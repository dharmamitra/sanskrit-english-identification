sideeffects of previous remedies A monk refrains from such base arts and wrong means of livelihoodThus he is perfected in morality And then Sire that monk who is perfected in morality sees no danger from any side owing to his being restrained by moralityJust as a dulyanointed Khattiya king having conquered his enemies by that very fact sees no danger from any side so the monk on account of his morality sees no danger anywhereHe experiences in himself the blameless bliss that comes from maintaining this Ariyan moralityIn this way Sire he is perfected in moralityAnd how Sire is he a guardian of the sensedoorsHere a monk on seeing a visible object with the eye does not grasp at its major signs or secondary characteristicsBecause greed and sorrow evil unskilled states would overwhelm him if he dwelt leaving this eyefaculty unguarded so he practises guarding it he protects the eyefaculty develops restraint of the eyefacultyOn hearing a sound with the ear  on smelling an odour with the nose  on tasting a flavour with the tongue   on feeling an object with the body  on thinking a thought with the mind he does not grasp at its major signs or secondary characteristics  he develops restraint of the mindfacultyHe experiences within himself the blameless bliss that comes from maintaining this Ariyan guarding of the facultiesIn this way Sire a monk is a guardian of the sense doorsAnd how Sire is a monk accomplished in mindfulness and clear awarenessHere a monk acts with clear awareness in going forth and back in looking ahead or behind him in bending and stretching in wearing his outer and inner robe and carrying his bowl in eating drinking chewing and swallowing in evacuating and urinating in walking standing sitting lying down in waking in speaking and in keeping silent he acts with clear awarenessIn this way a monk is accomplished in mindfulness and clear awarenessAnd how is a monk contentedHere a monk is satisfied with a robe to protect his body with alms to satisfy his stomachand having accepted sufficient he goes on his wayJust as a bird with wings flies hither and thither burdened by nothing but its wingsso he is satisfiedIn this way Sire a monk is contentedThen he equipped with this Ariyan morality with this Ariyan restraint of the senses with this Ariyan contentment finds a solitary lodging at the root of a forest tree in a mountain cave or gorge a charnelground a junglethicket or in the open air on a heap of strawThen having eaten after his return from the almsround he sits down crosslegged holding his body erect and concentrates on keeping mindfulness established before him Abandoning worldly desires he dwells with a mind freed from worldly desires and his mind is purified of themAbandoning illwill and hatred   and by compassionate love for the welfare of all living beings his mind is purified of ill will and hatredAbandoning slothandtorpor  perceiving light mindful and clearly aware his mind is purified of slothandtorporAbandoning worryandflurry  and with an inwardly calmed mind his heart is purified of worryand flurryAbandoning doubt he dwells with doubt left behind without uncertainty as to what things are wholesome his mind is purified of doubtJust as a man who had taken a loan to develop his businessand whose business had prosperedmight pay off his old debts and with what was left over could support a wifemight think Before this I developed my business by borrowingbut now it has prosperedand he would rejoice and be glad about thatJust as a man who was ill suffering terribly sick with no appetite and weak in bodymight after a time recover and regain his appetite and bodily strengthand he might think Before this I was illand he would rejoice and be glad about thatJust as a man might be bound in prisonHe might think Before this I was in prisonand he would rejoice and be glad about thatJust as a man might be a slave not his own master dependent on another unable to go where he likedand after some time he might be freed from slavery able to go where he likedmight think Before this I was a slave And he would rejoice and be glad about thatJust as a man laden with goods and wealth might go on a long journey through the desert where food was scarce and danger aboundedand after a time he would get through the desert and arrive safe and sound at the edge of a villagemight think Before this I was in dangernow I am safe at the edge of a villageand he would rejoice and be glad about thatAs long Sire as a monk does not perceive the disappearance of the five hindrances in himself he feels as if in debt in sickness in bonds in slavery on a desert journeyBut when he perceives the disappearance of the five hindrances in himself it is as if he were freed from debt from sickness from bonds from slavery from the perils of the desertAnd when he knows that these five hindrances have left him gladness arises in him from gladness comes delight from the delight in his mind his body is tranquillised with a tranquil body he feels joy and with joy his mind is concentratedBeing thus detached from sensedesires detached from unwholesome states he enters and remains in the first jhana which is with thinking and pondering bom of detachment filled with delight and joyAnd with this delight and joy bom of detachment he so suffuses drenches fills and irradiates his body that there is no spot in his entire body that is untouched by this delight and joy bom of detachmentJust as a skilled bathman or his assistant kneading the soappowder which he has sprinkled with water forms from it in a metal dish a soft lump so that the ball of soappowder becomes one oleaginous mass bound with oil so that nothing escapes  so this monk suffuses drenches fills and irradiates his body so that no spot remains untouchedThis Sire is a fruit of the homeless life visible here and now that is more excellent and perfect than the former onesAgain a monk with the subsiding of thinking and pondering by gaining inner tranquillity and oneness of mind enters and remains in the second jhana which is without thinking and pondering born of concentration filled with delight and joyAnd with this delight and joy born of concentration he so suffuses his body that no spot remains untouchedJust as a lake fed by a spring with no inflow from east west north or south where the raingod sends moderate showers from time to timethe water welling up from below mingling with cool water would suffuse fill and irradiate that cool water so that no part of the pool was untouched by it so with this delight and joy bom of concentration he so suffuses his body that no spot remains untouchedThis Sire is a fruit more excellent and perfect than the former onesAgain a monk with the fading away of delight remains imperturbable mindful and clearly aware and experiences in himself that joy of which the Noble Ones say Happy is he who dwells with equanimity and mindfulness and he enters and remains in the third jhanaAnd with this joy devoid of delight he so suffuses his body that no spot remains untouchedJust as if in a pond of blue red or white lotuses in which the flowers bom in the water grown in the water not growing out of the water are fed from the waters depths those blue red or white lotuses would be suffused  with the cool water  so with this joy devoid of delight the monk so suffuses his body that no spot remains untouchedThis is a fruit of the homeless life more excellent and perfect than the former onesAgain a monk having given up pleasure and pain and with the disappearance of former gladness and sadness enters and remains in the fourth jhana which is beyond pleasure and pain and purified by equanimity and mindfulness And he sits suffusing his body with that mental purity and clarification So that no part of his body is untouched by itJust as if a man were to sit wrapped from head to foot in a white garment so that no part of him was untouched by that garment  so his body is suffused This is a fruit of the homeless life more excellent and perfect than the former onesAnd so with mind concentrated purified and cleansed unblemished free from impurities malleable workable established and having gained imperturbability he directs and inclines his mind towards knowing and seeingAnd he knows This my body is material made up from the four great elements bom of mother and father fed on rice and gruel impermanent liable to be injured and abraded broken and destroyed and this is my consciousness which is bound to it and dependent on it It is just as if there were a gem a beryl pure excellent well cut into eight facets clear bright unflawed perfect in every respectstrung on a blue yellow red white or orange cordA man with good eyesight taking it in his hand and inspecting it would describe it as suchIn the same way Sire a monk with mind concentrated purified and cleansed   directs his mind towards knowing and seeingAnd he knows This my body is material made up of the four great elements  and this is my consciousness which is bound to it and dependent on itThis is a fruit of the homeless life more excellent and perfect than the former onesAnd he with mind concentrated having gained imperturbability applies and directs his mind to the production of a mindmade bodyAnd out of this body he produces another body having a form mindmade complete in all its limbs and facultiesIt is just as if a man were to draw out a reed from its sheathHe might think This is the reed this is the sheath reed and sheath are different Now the reed has been pulled from the sheathOr as if a man were to draw a sword from the scabbardHe might think This is the sword this is the scabbard sword and scabbard are different Now the sword has been drawn from the scabbardOr as if a man were to draw a snake from its old skinHe might think This is the snake this is the skinsnake and skin are different Now the snake has been drawn from its skinIn the same way a monk with mind concentrated  directs his mind to the production of a mindmade bodyHe draws that body out of this body having form mindmade complete with all its limbs and facultiesThis is a fruit of the homeless life more excellent and perfect than the former onesAnd he with mind concentrated applies and directs his mind to the various supernormal powersHe then enjoys different powers being one he becomes many  being many he becomes one he appears and disappears he passes through fences walls and mountains unhindered as if through airhe sinks into the ground and emerges from it as if it were waterhe walks on the water without breaking the surface as if on landhe flies crosslegged through the sky like a bird with wingshe even touches and strokes with his hand the sun and moon mighty and powerful as they areand he travels in the body as far as the Brahma worldJust as a skilled potter or his assistant can make from wellprepared clay whatever kind of bowl he likesor just as a skilled ivorycarver or his assistant can produce from well prepared ivory any object he likesor just as a skilled goldsmith or his assistant can make any gold article he likes so the monk with mind concentrated enjoys various supernormal powersThis is a fruit of the homeless lifeAnd he with mind concentrated  applies and directs his mind to the divine earWith the divine ear purified and surpassing that of human beings he hears sounds both divine and human whether far or nearJust as a man going on a long journeymight hear the sound of a big drum a small drum a conch cymbals or a kettledrumand he might think That is a big druma kettledrumso the monk with mind concentrated hears sounds divine or human far or nearThis is a fruit of the homeless life more excellent and perfect than the former onesAnd he with mind concentrated  applies and directs his mind to the knowledge of others mindsHe knows and distinguishes with his mind the minds of other beings or other persons He knows the mind with passion to be with passion he knows the mind without passion to be without passion  He knows the mind with hate to be with hate he knows the mind without hate to be without hate He knows the deluded mind to be deluded he knows the undeluded mind to be undeluded He knows the narrow mind to be narrow he knows the broad mind to be broad He knows the expanded mind to be expanded he knows the unexpanded mind to be unexpanded He knows the surpassed mind to be surpassed he knows the unsurpassed mind to be unsurpassed He knows the concentrated mind to be concentrated he knows the unconcentrated mind to be unconcentrated He knows the liberated mind to be liberated he knows the unliberated mind to be unliberatedJust as a woman or a man or young boy fond of his appearance might examine his face in a brightly polished mirror or in water and by examination would know whether there was a spot there or not so the monk with mind concentrated  directs his mind to the knowledge of others minds This is a fruit of the homeless lifeAnd he with mind concentrated  applies and directs his mind to the knowledge of previous existencesHe remembers many previous existences one birth two three four five births ten twenty thirty forty fifty births a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand births several periods of contraction of expansion of both contraction and expansion There my name was soandso my clan was soandso my caste was soandso my food was suchandsuch I experienced suchandsuch pleasant and painful conditions I lived for so long Having passed away from there I arose there There my name was soandso   And having passed away from there I arose hereThus he remembers various past births their conditions and detailsIt is just as if a man were to go from his village to another from that to yet anotherand thence return to his home villageHe might think I came from my own village to that other one where I stood sat spoke or remained silent like this and from that one I went to another where I stood sat spoke or remained silent like this and from there I have just returned to my own villageJust so the monk with mind concentrated  remembers past births This is a fruit of the homeless lifeAnd he with mind concentrated   applies and directs his mind to the knowledge of the passingaway and arising of beingsWith the divine eye purified and surpassing that of humans he sees beings passing away and arising base and noble wellfavoured and illfavoured to happy and unhappy destinations as kamma directs them and he knows These beings on account of misconduct of body speech or thought or disparaging the Noble Ones have wrong view and will suffer the kammic fate of wrong viewAt the breakingup of the body after death they are reborn in a lower world a bad destination a state of suffering hellBut these beings on account of good conduct of body speech or thought of praising the Noble Ones have right view and will reap the kammic reward of right view At the breakingup of the body after death they are reborn in a good destination a heavenly worldThus with the divine eye  he sees beings passing away and realising Tt is just as if there were a lofty building at a crossroadsand a man with good eyesight standing there might see people entering or leaving a house walking in the street or sitting in the middle of the crossroadsAnd he might think These are entering a house Just so with the divine eye    he sees beings passing away and realising This is a fruit of the homeless lifeAnd he with mind concentrated purified and cleansed unblemished free from impurities malleable workable established and having gained imperturbability applies and directs his mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the corruptionsHe knows as it really is This is suffering he knows as it really is This is the origin of suffering he knows as it really is This is the cessation of suffering he knows as it really is This is the path leading to the cessation of sufferingAnd he knows as it really is These are the corruptions This is the origin of the corruptions This is the cessation of the corruptions This is the path leading to the cessation of the corruptionsAnd through his knowing and seeing his mind is delivered from the corruption of sense desire from the corruption of becoming from the corruption of ignorance and the knowledge arises in him This is deliverance and he knows Birth is finished the holy life has been led done is what had to be done there is nothing further here Just as if Sire in the midst of the mountains there were a pond clear as a polished mirrorwhere a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see oystershells gravel banks and shoals of fish on the move or stationaryAnd he might think This pond is clearthere are oystershells just so with mind concentrated  he knows Birth is finished the holy life has been led done is what had to be done there is nothing further hereThis Sire is a fruit of the homeless life visible here and now which is more excellent and perfect than the previous fruitsAnd Sire there is no fruit of the homeless life visible here and now that is more excellent and perfect than thisAt this King Ajatasattu exclaimed Excellent Lord excellentIt is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down or to point out the way to one who had got lost or to bring an oillamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various waysAnd I Lord go for refuge to the Blessed Lord to the Dhamma and to the SanghaMay the Blessed Lord accept me from this day forth as a layfollower as long as life shall lastTransgression overcame me Lord foolish erring and wicked as I was in that I for the sake of the throne deprived my father that good man and just king of his lifeMay the Blessed Lord accept my confession of my evil deed that I may restrain myself in futureIndeed Sire transgression overcame you when you deprived your father that good man and just king of his lifeBut since you have acknowledged the transgression and confessed it as is right we will accept itFor he who acknowledges his transgression as such and confesses it for betterment in future will grow in the Ariyan discipline At this King Ajatasattu said Lord permit me to depart now I am busy and have much to doDo now Your Majesty as you think fit Then King Ajatasattu rejoicing and delighting at these words rose from his seat saluted the Lord and departed with his right side towards himAs soon as the King had gone the Lord said The King is done forhis fate is sealed monks But if the King had not deprived his father that good man and just king of his life then as he sat here the pure and spotless Dhamma eye would have arisen in himThus the Lord spokeand the monks delighted rejoiced at his wordsThus have I heard Once the Lord was staying at Nalanda in Pavarikas mango groveAnd the householder Kevaddha came to the Lord prostrated himself before him and sat down to one sideHe then said Lord this Nalanda is rich prosperous populous and full of people who have faith in the LordIt would be well if the Lord were to cause some monk to perform superhuman feats and miracles In this way Nalanda would come to have even more faith ip the LordThe Lord replied Kevaddha this is not the way I teach Dhamma to the monks by saying Go monks and perform superhuman feats and miracles for the whiteclothed lay people For a second time Kevaddha said Lord I would not be importunate but I still say This Nalanda is rich prosperous And the Lord replied as beforeWhen Kevaddha repeated his request for a third timethe Lord said Kevaddha there are three kinds of miracle that I have declared having realised them by my own insightWhich threeThe miracle of psychic power the miracle of telepathy the miracle of instruction What is the miracle of psychic powerHere Kevaddha a monk displays various psychic powers in different waysBeing one he becomes many being many he becomes one and he travels in the body as far as the Brahma worldThen someone who has faith and trust sees him doing these thingsHe tells this to someone else who is sceptical and un believing saying It is wonderful sir it is marvellous the great power and skill of that asceticAnd that is why Kevaddha seeing the danger of such miracles I dislike reject and despise themAnd what is the miracle of telepathyHere a monk reads the minds of other beings of other people reads their mental states their thoughts and ponderings and says That is how your mind is that is how it inclines that is in your heartThen someone who has faith and trust sees him doing these thingsHe tells this to someone else who is sceptical and unbelieving saying It is wonderful sir it is marvellous the great power and skill of that asceticAnd what is the miracle of instructionHere Kevaddha a monk gives instruction as follows Consider in this way dont consider in that direct your mind this way not that way give up that gain this and persevere in itThat Kevaddha is called the miracle of instructionAgain Kevaddha a Tathagata arises in the world an Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans enlightened and blessed He having realised it by his own superknowledge proclaims this world with its devas maras and Brahmas its princes and people He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle lovely in its ending in the spirit and in the letter and displays the fullyperfected and purified holy lifeA disciple goes forth and practises the moralities  He guards the sensedoors and attains the four jhanas he attains various insights  he realises the Four Noble Truths the path and the cessation of the corruptions  and he knows There is nothing further hereThat Kevaddha is called the miracle of instructionOnce Kevaddha in this order of monks the thought occurred to a certain monk I wonder where the four great elements  the earth element the water element the fire element the air element  cease without remainderAnd that monk attained to such a state of mental concentration that the way to the devarealms appeared before himThen coming to the Realm of the devas of the Four Great Kings he asked those devas Friends where do the four great elements  earth water fire and air  cease without remainderAt this question the devas of the Four Great Kings said to him Monk we dont know where the four great elements cease without remainderBut the Four Great Kings are loftier and wiser than we areThey may know where the four great elements ceaseSo that monk went to the Four Great Kings and asked the same questionSo that monk went to the ThirtyThree GodsSakka lord of the gods saidThe Yama devas may know  The Yama devas said Suyama son of the devas may know  Suyama said The Tusita devas may know  The Tusita devas said Santusita son of the devas may know   Santusita said The Nimmanarati devas may know  The Nimmanarati devas said Sunimmita son of the devas may know  Sunimitta said The ParanimmitaVasavatti devas may know  The ParanimmitaVasavatti devas said Vasavatti son of the devas may knowThen that monk by the appropriate concentration made the way to the Brahma world appear before himHe went to the devas of Brahmas retinue and asked themThey said We dont knowBut there is Brahma Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Lord the Maker and Creator the Ruler Appointer and Orderer Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be He is loftier and wiser than we areHe would know where the four great elements cease without remainderAnd where friends is this Great Brahma nowMonk we do not know when how and where Brahma will appear But when the signs are seen  when a light appears and a radiance shines forth  then Brahma will appear Such signs are an indication that he will appearThen it was not long before the Great Brahma appearedAnd that monk went up to him and said Friend where do the four great elements  earth water fire air  cease without remainderto which the Great Brahma replied Monk I am Brahma Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Lord the Maker and Creator the Ruler Appointer and Orderer Father of All That Have Been and Shall BeA second time the monk said Friend I did not ask if you are Brahma Great BrahmaAnd a second time the Great Brahma replied as beforeAnd a third time the monk said Friend I did not ask you thatThen Kevaddha the Great Brahma took that monk by the arm led him aside and said Monk these devas believe there is nothing Brahma does not see there is nothing he does not know there is nothing he is unaware ofThat is why I did not speak in front of themBut monk I dont know where the four great elements cease without remainderAnd therefore monk you have acted wrongly you have acted incorrectly by going beyond the Blessed Lord and going in search of an answer to this question elsewhereNow monk you just go to the Blessed Lord and put this question to him and whatever answer he gives accept itSo that monk as swiftly as a strong man might flex or unflex his arm vanished from the Brahma world and appeared in my presenceHe prostrated himself before me then sat down to one side and said Lord where do the four great elements  the earth element the water element the fire element and the air element  cease without remainder I replied Monk once upon a time seafaring merchants when they set sail on the ocean took in their ship a land sighting birdWhen they could not see the land themselves they released this birdThe bird flew to the east to the south to the west to the north it flew to the zenith and to the intermediate points of the compassIf it saw land anywhere it flew thereBut if it saw no land it returned to the shipIn the same way monk you have been as far as the Brahma world searching for an answer to your question and not finding it and now you come back to meBut monk you should not ask your question in this way Where do the four great elements  the earth element the water element the fire element the air element  cease without remainderInstead this is how the question should have been putWhere do earth water fire and air no footing findWhere are long and short small and great fair and foul Where are nameandform wholly destroyedAnd the answer isWhere consciousness is signless boundless all luminousThats where earth water fire and air find no footingThere both long and short small and great fair and foul There nameandform are wholly destroyedWith the cessation of consciousness this is all destroyedThus the Lord spoke Thus have I heard Once the Lord was touring Kosala with a large number of monks some five hundred and he came to a Kosalan Brahmin village called IcchanankalaAnd he stayed in the dense jungle of IcchanankalaAt that time the Brahmin Pokkharasati was living at Ukkhattha a populous place full of grass timber water and corn which had been given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift and with royal powers And Pokkharasati heard say The ascetic Gotama son of the Sakyans who has gone forth from the Sakya clan   is staying in the dense jungle of IcchanankalaAnd concerning that Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about This Blessed Lord is an Arahant a fullyenlightened Buddha perfected in knowledge and conduct a WellFarer Knower of the worlds unequalled Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans a Buddha a Blessed LordHe proclaims this world with its gods maras Brahmas the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and people having come to know it by his own knowledgeHe teaches a Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending in the spirit and in the letter and he displays the fullyperfected thoroughly purified holy lifeAnd indeed it is good to see such Arahants Now at that time Pokkharasati had a pupil the youth Ambattha who was a student of the Vedas who knew the mantras perfected in the Three Vedas a skilled expounder of the rules and rituals the lore of sounds and meanings and fifthly oral tradition complete in philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man admitted and accepted by his master in the Three Vedas with the words What I know you know what you know I know And Pokkharasati said to Ambattha Ambattha my son the ascetic Gotama is staying in the dense jungle of IcchanankalaAnd concerning that Blessed Lord a good report has been spread aboutNow you go to see the ascetic Gotama and find out whether this report is correct or not and whether the Reverend Gotama is as they say or notIn that way we shall put the Reverend Gotama to the test Sir how shall I find out whether the report is trueor whether the Reverend Gotama is as they say or not According to the tradition of our mantras Ambattha the great man who is possessed of the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man has only two courses open to himIf he lives the household life he will become a ruler a wheelturning righteous monarch of the law conqueror of the four quarters who has established the security of his realm and is possessed of the seven treasuresThese arethe WheelTreasure the Elephant Treasure the HorseTreasure the JewelTreasure the Woman Treasure the HouseholderTreasure and as seventh the CounsellorTreasureHe has more than a thousand sons who are heroes of heroic stature conquerors of the hostile armyHe dwells having conquered this seagirt land without stick or sword by the lawBut if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness then he will become an Arahant a fullyenlightened Buddha one who draws back the veil from the worldAnd Ambattha I am the passeron of the mantras and you are the receiver Very good sir said Ambattha at Pokkharasatis words and he got up passed by Pokkharasati with his right side got into his chariot drawn by a mare and accompanied by a number of young men headed for the dense jungle of IcchanankalaHe drove as far as the carriage would go then alighted and continued on foot At that time a number of monks were walking up and down in the open airAmbattha approached them and said Where is the Reverend Gotama to be found just nowWe have come to see the Reverend Gotama The monks thought This is Ambattha a youth of good family and a pupil of the distinguished Brahmin PokkharasatiThe Lord would not mind having a conversation with such a young manAnd they said to Ambattha That is his dwelling with the door closed Go quietly up to it go on to the verandah without haste cough and knock on the bolt The Lord will open the door to you Ambattha went up to the dwelling and on to the verandah coughed and knockedThe Lord opened the doorand Ambattha went inThe young men entered exchanged courtesies with the Lord and sat down to one sideBut Ambattha walked up and down while the Lord sat there uttered some vague words of politeness and then stood so speaking before the seated LordAnd the Lord said to Ambattha Well now Ambattha would you behave like this if you were talking to venerable and learned Brahmins teachers of teachers as you do with me walking and standing while I am sitting and uttering vague words of politeness No Reverend GotamaA Brahmin should walk with a walking Brahmin stand with a standing Brahmin sit with a sitting Brahmin and lie down with a Brahmin who is lying downBut as for those shaven little ascetics menials black scourings from Brahmas foot with them it is fitting to speak just as I do with the Reverend GotamaBut Ambattha you came here seeking something Whatever it was you came for you should listen attentively to hear about itAmbattha you have not perfected your training Your conceit of being trained is due to nothing but inexperienceBut Ambattha was angry and displeased at being called untrained and he turned on the Lord with curses and insults Thinking The ascetic Gotama bears me illwill he said Reverend Gotama the Sakyans are fierce roughspoken touchy and violent Being of menial origin being menials they do not honour respect esteem revere or pay homage to BrahminsWith regard to this it is not proper   that they do not pay homage to BrahminsThis was the first time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of being menialsBut Ambattha what have the Sakyans done to you Reverend Gotama once I went to Kapilavatthu on some business for my teacher the Brahmin Pokkharasatiand I came to the Sakyans meetinghallAnd at that time a lot of Sakyans were sitting on high seats in their meetinghall poking each other with their fingers laughing and playing about together and it seemed to me that they were just making fun of me and no one offered me a seatWith regard to this it is not proper that they do not pay homage to the BrahminsThis was the second time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of being menialsBut Ambattha even the quail that little bird can talk as she likes on her own nestKapilavatthu is the Sakyans home Ambattha They do not deserve censure for such a trifleReverend Gotama there are four castes the Khattiyas the Brahmins the merchants and the artisansAnd of these four castes three  the Khattiyas the merchants and the artisans  are entirely subservient to the BrahminsWith regard to this it is not proper that they should not pay homage to the BrahminsThis was the third time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of being menialsThen the Lord thought This young man goes too far in abusing the Sakyans Suppose I were to ask after his clan nameSo he said Ambattha what is your clanI am a Kanhayan Reverend GotamaAmbattha in former days according to those who remember the ancestral lineage the Sakyans were the masters and you are descended from a slavegirl of the SakyansFor the Sakyans regard King Okkaka as their ancestorAt one time King Okkaka to whom his queen was dear and beloved wishing to transfer the kingdom to her son banished his elder brothers from the kingdom  Okkamukha Karandu Hatthimya and SinipuraAnd these being banished made their home on the flank of the Himalayas beside a lotuspond where there was a big grove of teaktreesAnd for fear of contaminating the stock they cohabited with their own sistersThen King Okkaka asked his ministers and counsellors Where are the princes living nowand they told himAt this King Okkaha exclaimed They are strong as teak  these princes they are real SakyansAnd that is how the Sakyans got their wellknown name And the King was the ancestor of the SakyansNow King Okkaka had a slavegirl called Disawho gave birth to a black childThe black thing when it was bom exclaimed Wash me mother Bath me mother Deliver me from this dirt and I will bring you profitBecause Ambattha jast as people today use the term hobgoblin as a term of abuse so in thouse days they said black And they said As soon as he was bom he spoke He is bom a Kanha a hobgoblinThat is how in former days the Sakyans were the masters and you are descended from a slave girl of the SakyansOn hearing this the young men said Reverend Gotama do not humiliate Ambattha too much with talk of his being descended from a slavegirlAmbattha is wellborn of a good family he is very learned he is wellspoken a scholar well able to hold his own in this discussion with the Reverend GotamaThen the Lord said to the young men If you consider that Ambattha is illborn not of a good family unlearned illspoken no scholar unable to hold his own in this discussion with the ascetic Gotama then let Ambattha be silent and you conduct this discussion with meBut if you think he is able to hold his own then you be quiet and let him discuss with meAmbattha is wellborn Reverend Gotama   We will be silent he shall continueThen the Lord said to Ambattha Ambattha I have a fundamental question for you which you will not like to answerIf you dont answer or evade the issue if you keep silent or go away your head will split into seven piecesWhat do you think Ambattha Have you heard from old and venerable Brahmins teachers of teachers where the Kanhayans came from or who was their ancestorAt this Ambattha remained silentThe Lord asked him a second timeAgain Ambattha remained silentand the Lord said Answer me now Ambattha this is not a time for silenceWhoever Ambattha does not answer a fundamental question put to him by a Tathagata by the third asking has his head split into seven piecesAnd at that moment Vajirapani the yakkha holding a huge iron club flaming ablaze and glowing up in the sky just above Ambattha was thinking If this young man Ambattha does not answer a proper question put to him by the Blessed Lord by the third time of asking Ill split his head into seven piecesThe Lord saw Vajirapani and so did AmbatthaAnd at the sight Ambattha was terrified and unnerved his hairs stood on end and he sought protection shelter and safety from the Lord Crouching down close to the Lord he said What did the Reverend Gotama sayMay the Reverend Gotama repeat what he saidWhat do you think Ambattha Have you heard who was the ancestor of the Kanhayans Yes I have heard it just as the Reverend Gotama saidthat is there the Kanhayans came from he was their ancestorHearing this the young men made a loud noise and clamour So Ambattha is illborn not of a good family bom of a slavegirl of the Sakyansand the Sakyans are Ambatthas mastersWe disparaged the ascetic Gotama thinking he was not speaking the truthThen the Lord thought It is too much the way these young men humiliate Ambattha for being the son of a slavegirl I must get him out of thisSo he said to the young men Dont disparage Ambattha too much for being the son of a slavegirlThat Kanha was a mightly sageHe went to the south country learnt the mantras of the Brahmins there and then went to King Okkaka and asked for his daughter MaddarupiAnd King Okkaka furiously angry exclaimed So this fellow the son of a slavegirl wants my daughter and put an arrow to his bowBut he was unable either to shoot the arrow or to withdraw itThen the ministers and counsellors came to the sage Kanha and said Spare the king Reverend Sir spare the kingThe king will be safe but if he looses the arrow downwards the earth will quake as far as his kingdom extendsReverend Sir spare the king spare the landThe king and the land will besafe but if he looses the arrow upwards as far as his realm extends the god will not let it rain for seven yearsReverend Sir spare the king and the land and may the god let it rainsThe king and the land will be safe and the god will let it rain but if the king points the arrow at the crown prince the prince will be completely safeThen the ministers exclaimed Let King Okkaka point the arrow at the crown princethe prince will be perfectly safeThe king did so and the prince was unharmedThen King Okkaka terrified and fearful of divine punishment gave away his daughter MaddarupiSo young men do not disparage Ambattha too much for being the son of a slave girl That Kanha was a mighty sageThen the Lord said Ambattha what do you think Suppose a Khattiya youth were to wed a Brahmin maiden and there was a son of the unionWould that son of a Khattiya youth and a Brahmin maiden receive a seat and water from the BrahminsHe would Reverend GotamaWould they allow him to eat at funeralrites at riceoffer ings at sacrifices or as a guest They would Reverend GotamaWould they teach him mantras or notThey would Reverend GotamaWould they keep their women covered or uncoveredUncovered Reverend GotamaBut would the Khattiyas sprinkle him with the Khattiya consecrationNo Reverend GotamaWhy notBecause Reverend Gotama he is not wellborn on his mothers sideWhat do you think Ambattha Suppose a Brahmin youth were to wed a Khattiya maiden and there was a son of the unionWould that son of a Khattiya youth and a Brahmin maiden receive a seat and water from the BrahminsHe would Reverend GotamaBut would the Khattiyas sprinkle him with the Khattiya consecration No Reverend GotamaWhy notBecause Reverend Gotama he is not wellborn on his fathers sideSo Ambattha the Khattiyas through a man taking a woman or a woman taking a man are senior to the BrahminsWhat do you think Ambattha Take the case of a Brahmin who for some reason has had his head shaved by the Brahmins has been punished with a bag of ashes and banished from the country or the cityWould he receive a seat and water from the BrahminsNo Reverend GotamaWould they allow him to eat   as a guestNo Reverend GotamaWould they teach him mantras or notThey would not Reverend GotamaWould they keep their women covered or uncoveredCovered Reverend GotamaWhat do you think Ambattha Take the case of a Khattiya who   had his head shaved by the Khattiyas   and has been banished from the country or the cityWould he receive a seat and water from the BrahminsHe would Reverend GotamaWould they keep their women covered or uncoveredUncovered Reverend GotamaBut that Khattiya has so far reached the extreme of humiliation that he has been banished from the country or the citySo even if a Khattiya has suffered extreme humiliation he is superior and the Brahmins inferiorAmbattha this verse was pronounced by Brahma SanankumaraThe Khattiyas bestamong those who value clanHe with knowledge and conductis best of gods and menThis verse was rightly sung not wrongly rightly spoken not wrongly connected with profit not unconnectedAnd Ambattha I too say thisThe Khattiyas bestaming those who value clanHe with knowledge and conductis best of gods and menEnd of first recitationsection But Reverend Gotama what is this conduct what is this knowledge Ambattha it is not from the standpoint of the attainment of unexcelled knowledgeandconduct that reputation based on birth and clan is declared nor on the conceit which says You are worthy of me you are not worthy of meFor wherever there is a giving a taking in marriage there is always this talk and this conceintBut those who are enslaved by such things are far from the attainment of the unexcelled knowledgeandconductwhich is attained by abandoning all such things But Reverend Gotama what is this conduct what is this knowledge Ambattha a Tathagata arises in this world an Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans enlightened and blessedHe having realised it by his own superknow ledge proclaims this world with its devas maras and Brahmas its princes and peopleHe preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle lovely in its ending in the spirit and in the letter and displays the fully perfected and purified holy lifeThus he develops conductAnd beyond this there is no further development of knowledge and conduct that is higher or more perfectBut Ambattha in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and condact there are four paths of failure What are theyIn the first place an ascetic or Brahmin who has not managed to gain this unexcelled attainment takes his carryingpole and plunges into the depths of the forest thinking I will live on windfallsBut in this way he only becomes an attendant on one who has attainedThis is the first path of failureAgain an ascetic or Brahmin   being unable to live on windfalls takes a spade and basket thinking I will live on tubers and rootsThis is the second path of failureAgain an ascetic or Brahmin being unable to live on tubers and roots makes a firehearth at the edge of a village or small town and sits tending the flameThis is the third path of failureAgain an ascetic or Brahmin being unable to tend the flame erects a house with four doors at the crossroads thinking Whatever ascetic or Brahmin arrives from the four quarters I will honour to the best of my strength and abilityBut in this way he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conductThis is the fourth path of failure What do you think Ambattha Do you and your teacher live in accordance with this unexcelled knowledge and conductNo indeed Reverend GotamaWho are my teacher and I in comparisonWell then Ambattha could you and your teacher being unable to gain this go with your carryingpoles into the depths of the forest intending to live on windfallsNo indeed Reverend GotamaWell then Ambattha could you and your teacher being unable to gain this live on tubers and rootssit tending the flameNo indeed Reverend Gotamaerect a house And so Ambattha not only are you and your teacher incapable of attaining this unexcelled knowledge and conductbut even the four paths of failure are beyond youAnd yet you and your teacher the Brahmin Pokkharasati utter these words These shaven little ascetics menials black scrapings from Brahmas foot what converse can they have with Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas   even though you cant even manage the duties of one who has failedSee Ambattha how your teacher has let you downWe are far from it Ambattha the Brahmin Pokkharasati lives by the grace and favour of King Pasenadi of KosalaAnd yet the King does not allow him to have audience face to faceWhen he confers with the King it is through a curtainWhy should the King not grant audience face to face to one on whom he has bestowed a proper and blameless source of revenueSee how your teacher has let you down What do you think Ambattha Suppose King Pasenadi was sitting on the neck of an elephant or on horseback or was standing on the chariotmat conferring with his ministers and princes about somethingAnd suppose he were to step asideAnd suppose he were to step aside and some workman or workmans servant were to come along and stand in his place And standing there he might say This is what King Passenadi of Kosala saysWould he be speaking the Kings wordsas if he were the Kings equalNo indeed Reverend Gotama Well then Ambattha it is just the same thing Those who were as you say the first sages of the Brahmins the makers and expounders of the mantras whose ancient verses are chanted pronounced and collected by the Brahmins of today  Atthaka Vamaka Vamadeva Vessamitta Yamataggi Angirasa Bharadvaja Vasettha Kassapa Bhagu  whose mantras are said to be passed on to you and your teacher yet you do not thereby become a sage or one practised in the way of a sage  such a thing is not possible What do you think Ambattha What have you heard said by Brahmins who are venerable aged the teachers of teachers Those first sages Atthaka Bhagu  did they enjoy themselves wellbathed perfumed their hair and beards trimmed adorned with garlands and wreaths dressed in white clothes indulging in the pleasures of the five senses and addicted to them as you and your teacher do nowNo Reverend GotamaOr did they eat special fine rice with the black spots removed with various soups and curries as you and your teacher do nowNo Reverend GotamaOr did they amuse themselves with women dressed up in flounces and furbelows as you and your teacher do nowNo Reverend GotamaOr did they ride around in chariots drawn by mares with braided tails that they urged on with long goadsticksNo Reverend GotamaOr did they have themselves guarded in fortified towns with palisades and barricades by men with long swords No Reverend GotamaSo Ambattha neither you nor your teacher are a sage or one trained in the way of a sageAnd now as for your doubts and perplexities concerning me we will clarify these by your asking me and by my answering your questionsThen descending from his lodging the Lord started to walk up and downand Ambattha did like wiseAnd as he walked along with the Lord Ambattha looked out for the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man on the Lords bodyAnd he could see all of them except for twoHe was in doubt and perplexity about two of these marks he could not make up his mind or be certain about the sheathed genitals or the large tongueAnd the Lord being aware of his doubtseffected by his psychic power that Ambattha could see his sheathed genitalsand then sticking out his tongue he reached out to lick both ears and both nostrils and then covered the whole circle of his forehead with his tongueThen Ambattha thought The ascetic Gotama is equipped with all the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man complete and with none missingThen he said to the Lord Reverend Gotama may I go now I have much business much to doAmbattha do what you now think fitSo Ambattha got back into his chariot drawn by mares and departedMeanwhile the Brahmin Pokkharasati had gone outside and was sitting in his park with a large number of Brahmins just waiting for AmbatthaThen Ambattha came to the parkHe rode in the chariot as far as it would go and then continued on foot to where Pokkharasati was saluted him and sat down to one sideThen Pokkharasati said  Well dear boy did you see the Reverend GotamaI did sirAnd was the Reverend Gotama such as he is reported to be and not otherwise And is he of such nature and not otherwiseSir he is as he is reported to be and he is of such nature and not otherwiseHe is possessed of the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man all complete with none missingBut was there any conversation between you and the ascetic GotamaThere was sirAnd what was this conversation aboutSo Ambattha told Pokkharasati all that had passed between the Lord and himselfAt this Pokkharasati exclaimed Well youre a fine little scholar a fine wise man a fine expert in the Three Vedas Anyone going about his business like that ought when he dies at the breakingup of the body to go to the downfall to the evil path to ruin to hellYou have heaped insults on the Reverend Gotama as a result of which he has brought up more and more things against usYoure a fine little scholar He was so angry and enraged that he kicked Ambattha overand wanted to start out at once to see the LordBut the Brahmins said It is far too late sir to go to see the ascetic Gotama todayThe Reverend Pokkharasati should go to see him tomorrowThen Pokkharasati having had fine hard and soft food prepared in his own home set out by the light of torches from Ukkattha for the jungle of IcchanankalaHe went by chariot as far as possible then continued on foot to where the Lord wasHaving exchanged courtesies with the Lord he sat down to one side and saidVenerable Gotama did not our pupil Ambattha come to see youHe did BrahminAnd was there any conversation between youThere wasAnd what was this conversation aboutThen the Lord told Pokkharasati all that had passed between him and AmbatthaAt this Pokkharasati said to the Lord Reverend Gotama Ambattha is a young fool May the Reverend Gotama pardon himBrahmin may Ambattha be happyThen Pokkharasati looked out for the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man on the Lords bodyand he could see all of them exept for twothe sheathed genitals and the large tonguebut the Lord set his mind at rest about these And Pokkharasati said to the Lord May the Reverend Gotama accept a meal from me today together with his order of monksAnd the Lord consented by silenceSeeing his acceptance Pokkharasati said to the Lord It is time Reverend Gotama the meal is readyAnd the Lord having dressed in the early morning and taken his robe and bowl went with his order of monks to Pokkharasatis residence and sat down on the prepared seatThen Pokkharasati personally served the Lord with choice hard and soft food and the young men served the monksAnd when the Lord had taken his hand from the bowl Pokkharasati sat down to one side on a low stoolAnd as Pokkharasati sat there the Lord delivered a graduated discourse on generosity on morality and on heaven showing the danger degradation and corruption of sense desires and the profit of renunciationAnd when the Lord knew that Pokkharasatis mind was ready pliable free from the hindrances joyful and calm then he preached a sermon on Dhamma in brief on suffering its origin its cessation and the pathAnd just as a clean cloth from which all stains have been removed receives the dye perfectly so in the Brahmin Pokkharasati as he sat there there arose the pure and spotless Dhammaeye and he knew Whatever things have an origin must come to cessationAnd Pokkharasati having seen attained experienced and penetrated the Dhamma having passed beyond doubt transcended uncertainty having gained perfect confidence in the Teachers doctrine without relying on others said Excellent Lord excellentIt is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down or to point out the way to one who had got lost or to bring an oillamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various waysI go with my son my wife my ministers and counsellors for refuge to the Reverend Gotama to the Dhamma and to the SanghaMay the Reverend Gotama accept me as a lay follower who has taken refuge from this day forth as long as life shall lastAnd whenever the Reverend Gotama visits other families or layfollowers in Ukkattha may he also visit the family of PokkharasatiWhatever young men and maidens are there will revere the Reverend Gotama and rise before him will give him a seat and water and will be glad at heart and that will be for their welfare and happiness for a long timeWell said BrahminThus have I heard Once the Lord was travelling among the Angas with a large company of some five hundred monks and he arrived at CampaAt Campa he stayed by Gaggaras lotuspondAt that time the Brahmin Sonadanda was living at Campa a populous place full of grass timber water and com which had been given to him by King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha as a royal gift and with royal powersAnd the Brahmins and householders of Campa heard say The ascetic Gotama of the Sakyans who has gone forth from the Sakya clan is travelling among the Angas and is staying by Gaggaras lotuspoolAnd concerning that Blessed Lord Gotama a good report has been spread about This Blessed Lord is an Arahant a fullyenlightened Buddha perfected in knowledge and conduct a WellFarer Kriower of the worlds unequalled Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans a Buddha a Blessed LordHe proclaims this world with its gods maras Brahmas the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and people having come to know it by his own knowledgeHe teaches a Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending in the spirit and in the letter and he displays the fullyperfected thoroughly purified holy lifeAnd indeed it is good to see such ArahantsThereupon the Brahmins and householders of Campa leaving Campa in great crowds in vast numbers went to Gaggaras lotuspondJust then the Brahmin Sonadanda had gone up to his verandah for his midday restSeeing all the Brahmins and householders making for Gaggaras lotuspondhe asked his steward the reasonSir it is the ascetic Gotama of the Sakyans That is why they are going to see himWell then steward go to the Brahmins and householders of Campa and say to them Please wait gentlemen the Brahmin Sonadanda will come to see the ascetic GotamaAnd the steward conveyed this message to the Brahmins and householders of CampaNow at that time some five hundred Brahmins from various provinces were in Campa on some businessand they heard that Sonadanda intended to visit the ascetic GotamaSo they called upon him and asked if this were trueSo it is gentlemen I am going to visit the ascetic GotamaSir do not visit the ascetic Gotamait is not fitting that you should do soIf the Reverend Sonadanda goes to visit the ascetic Gotama his reputation will decrease and that of the ascetic Gotama will increaseThis being so it is not right that the Reverend Sonadanda should visit the ascetic Gotama but rather the ascetic Gotama should visit himThe Reverend Sonadanda is wellborn on both the mothers and the fathers side of pure descent to the seventh generation unbroken of irreproachable birthand therefore he should not call on the ascetic Gotama but rather the ascetic Gotama should call on himThe reverend Sonadanda is possessed of great wealth and resourcesThe Reverend Sonadanda is a scholar versed in the mantras accomplished in the Three Vedas a skilled expounder of the rules and rituals the lore of sounds and meanings and fifthly oral tradition  an expounder fully versed in natural philosophy and the marks of a Great ManThe Reverend Sonadanda is handsome goodlooking pleasing of the most beautiful complexion in form and countenance like Brahma of no mean appearanceHe is virtuous of increasing virtue endowed with increasing virtueHe is wellspoken of pleasing address polite of pure and clear enunciation speaking to the pointHe is the teachers teacher of many teaching the mantras to three hundred youthsand many young men come from different districts and regions seeking to learn the mantras in his presence desirous to learn them from himHe is aged grown old venerable advanced in years long past his youth whereas the ascetic Gotama is youthful and newly gone forth as a wandererThe Reverend Sonadanda is esteemed made much of honoured revered worshipped by King Seniya Bimbisaraand by Brahmin PokkharasatiHe lives at Campa a populous place full of grass timber water and com which has been given to him by King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha as a royal gift and with royal powersThis being soit is not proper that he should visit the ascetic Gotama but rather the ascetic Gotama should visit himAt this Sonadanda repliedNow listen gentlemen as to why it is fitting for us to visit the Reverend Gotama and why it is not fitting for him to visit usThe ascetic Gotama is wellborn on both sides of pure descent to the seventh generation unbroken of it reproachable birth   Therefore it is fitting for us to visit himHe went forth leaving a great body of kinsmenIn fact he gave up much gold and wealth to go forth both hidden away and openly displayedThe ascetic Gotama while youthful a blackhaired youth in the prime of his young days in the first stage of life went forth from the household life into homelessnessLeaving his grieving parents weeping with tearstained faces having cut off his hair and beard and put on yellow robes he went forth into homelessnessHe is handsome  virtuous   wellspoken   the teachers teacher of manyHe has abandoned sensuality and dispelled vanityHe teaches action and the results of action honouring the blameless Brahmin way of lifeHe is a wanderer of high birth of a leading Khattiya familyHe is a wanderer from a wealthy family of great wealth and possessionsPeople come to consult him from foreign kingdoms and foreign landsMany thousands of devas have taken refuge with himThis good report has been spread about him This Blessed Lord is an Arahant a fullyenlightened Buddha perfected in knowledge and conduct He bears the thirty two marks of a Great ManHe is welcoming kindly of speech courteous genial clear and ready of speechHe is attended by four assemblies revered honoured esteemed and worshipped by themMany devas and humans are devoted to himWhenever he stays in any town or village that place is not troubled by nonhuman beingsHe has a crowd a multitude of followers is a teacher of many he is consulted by the chief of the various leaders of sectsIt is not the way with the ascetic Gotamas reputation as it is with that of some ascetics and Brahmins about whom this or that is reported the ascetic Gotamas fame is based on his achievment of unsurpassed wisdom and conductIndeed King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha has gone for refuge to him together with his son his wife his followers and his ministersSo have King Pasenadi of Kosalaand the Brahmin PokkharasatiHe is revered honoured esteemed and worshipped by themThe ascetic Gotama has arrived in Campa and is staying by Gaggaras lotuspondAnd whatever ascetics and Brahmins come to our territory are our guestsAnd we should revere honour esteem and worship guestsHaving come to Gaggaras lotuspond the ascetic Gotama is such a guest and should be treated as suchTherefore it is not proper that he should come to usbut rather we should go to himHowever much I might praise the ascetic Gotama that praise is insufficienthe is beyond all praiseOn hearing this the Brahmins said to Sonadanda Sir since you praise the ascetic Gotama so much then even if he were to live a hundred yojanas from here it would be fitting for a believing clansman to go with a shoulderbag to visit himAnd so sir we shall all go to visit the ascetic GotamaAnd so Sonadaijda went with a large company of Brahmins to Gaggaras lotuspondBut when Sonadanda had traversed the junglethickets he thought If I ask the ascetic Gotama a question he might say to me That Brahmin is not a fitting question it is not at all a fitting question and then the company might despise me saying Sonadanda is a fool he has no sense he cant put a proper question to the ascetic GotamaAnd if anyone were despised by this company his reputation would sufferand then his income would sufferfor our income depends on the gaining of a reputationOr if the ascetic Gotama were to ask me a question my answer might not satisfy him and he might say That is not the right way to answer this question And then the companymight despise meAnd if having come into the presence of the ascetic Gotama I were to turn away without showing myself this company might despise meThen Sonadanda approached the Lord exchanged courtesies with himand sat down to one sideSome of the Brahmins and householders made obeisance to the Lord some exchanged courtesies with him some saluted him with joined palms some announced their name and clan and some sat down to one side in silenceSo Sonadanda took his seat with many thoughts going through his mind If I ask the ascetic Gotama a question he might say to me That Brahmin is not a fitting questionIf only the ascetic Gotama would ask me a question from my own field of the Three Vedas Then I could give him an answer that would satisfy himAnd the Lord reading his mind thought This Sonadanda is worriedSuppose I were to ask him a question from his own field as a teacher of the Three VedasSo he said to Sonadanda By how many qualities do Brahmins recognise a Brahmin How would one declare truthfully and without falling into falsehood I am a BrahminThen Sonadanda thought Now what I wanted hoped for desired and longed for has happened  Now I can give him an answer that will satisfy himStraightening up and looking round the assembly he said Reverend Gotama there are five such qualitiesWhat are theyA Brahmin is wellborn on both the mothers and the fathers side of pure descent to the seventh generation he is a scholar versed in the mantras he is handsome pleasing he is virtuous he is learned and wise and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladleThese are the five qualities of a true BrahminBut if one of these five qualities were omitted could not one be recognised as a true Brahmin being possessed of four of these qualitiesIt is possible GotamaWe could leave out appearancefor what does that matterIf a Brahmin had the other four qualities he could be recognised as a true BrahminBut could not one of these four qualities be omitted leaving three whereby one could be recognised as a true BrahminIt is possible GotamaWe could leave out the mantrasfor what do they matterIf he had the other three qualities he could be recognised as a true BrahminBut could not one of these three qualities be omitted  It is possible GotamaWe could leave out birthfor what does that matterIf a Brahmin is virtuous of increasing virtue  and if he is learned and wise and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle then he can be recognised as a true Brahmin and truthfully claim to be soAt this the Brahmins said to Sonadanda Dont say that Sonadanda dont say itThe Reverend Sonadanda is decrying appearance the mantras and birthhe is actually adopting the ascetic Gotamas own wordsThen the Lord said to the Brahmins If you think the Brahmin Sonadanda is not concentrating on his task is using wrong words is lacking in wisdom and is not fit to converse with the ascetic Gotama then let him cease and you talk to meBut if you think he is learned speaks properly is wise and fit to converse with the ascetic Gotama then you cease and let him speakThen Sonadanda said to the Lord Let that be Reverend Gotama and be silent I will answer in this matterTo the Brahmins he said Do not say the Reverend Sonadanda is decrying appearanceand adopting the ascetic Gotamas own wordsI do not decry appearance mantras or birthNow at that time Sonadandas nephew a young man called Angaka was sitting in the assemblyand Sonadanda said Gentlemen do you see my nephew Agaka Yes sirAngaka is handsome goodlooking pleasing of supremely fair complexion in form and countenance like Brahma of no mean appearance and there is none in this assembly his equal except the ascetic GotamaHe is a scholar I was his mantrateacherHe is wellborn on both sides I know his parentsBut if Angaka were to take life take what is not given commit adultery tell lies and drink strong drink  what would good looks or mantras or birth profit himBut it is because a Brahmin is virtuous because he is wiseon account of these two points that he can truthfully daclare I am a BrahminBut Brahmin if one were to omit one of these two points could one truthfully declare I am a BrahminNo GotamaFor wisdom is purified by morality and morality is purified by wisdomwhere one is the other isthe moral man has wisdom and the wise man has moralityand the combination of morality and wisdom is called the highest thing in the worldJust as one hand washes the other or one foot the other so wisdom is purified by morality and this combination is called the highest thing in the worldSo it is Brahmin Wisdom is purified by morality and morality is purified by wisdomwhere one is the other isthe moral man has wisdom and the wise man has moralityand the combination of morality and wisdom is called the highest thing in the worldBut Brahmin what is this moralityand what is this wisdomWe only know this much GotamaIt would be well if the Reverend Gotama were to explain the meaning of thisThen listen Brahmin pay proper attention and I will tell youYes sir said Sonadanda in replyand the Lord said Brahmin a Tathagata arises in this world an Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans enlightened and blessed He having realised it by his own superknowledge proclaims this world with its devas maras and Brahmas its princes and people He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle lovely in its ending in the spirit and in the letter and displays the fully perfected and purified holy life A disciple goes forth and practises the moralities  he guards the sense doors etc That Brahmin is morality He attains the four jhanas  he attains various insights  and the cessation of the corruptions  Thus he develops wisdomThat Brahmin is wisdomAt these words Sonsdsnds said Excellent Lord excellentIt is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down or to point out the way to one who had got lost or to bring an oillamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various waysAnd I go for refuge to the Blessed Lord Gotama to the Dhamma and to the SanghaMay the Reverend Gotama accept me from this day forth as a layfollower as long as life shall lastAnd may the Reverend Gotama and his order of monks accept a meal from me tomorrowThe Lord assented by silenceThen Sonadanda seeing his assent rose saluted the Lord passed by to his right and departedAs day was breaking he caused hard and soft food to be prepared in his own home and when it was ready he announced Reverend Gotama it is time the meal is readyAnd the Lord having risen early went with robe and bowl and attended by his monks to Sonadandas residence and sat down on the prepared seatAnd Sonadanda served the Buddha and his monks with the finest foods with his own hands until they were satisfiedAnd when the Lord had eaten and taken his hand away from the bowl Sonadanda took a low stool and sat down to one sideThen he said to the Lord  Reverend Gotama if when I have gone into the assembly I were to rise and salute the Lord the company would despise meIn that case my reputation would sufferand if a mans reputation suffers his income suffersSo if on entering the assembly I should join my palms in greeting may the Reverend Gotama take it as if I had risen from my seatAnd if on entering the assembly I should take off my turban may you take it as if I had bowed at your feetOr if when riding in my carriage I were to alight to salute the Lord the company would despise me So if when I am riding in my carriage I raise my goad may you take it as if I had alighted from my carriageand if I lower my hand may you take it as if I had bowed my head at your feetThen the Lord having instructed Sonadanda with a talk on Dhamma inspired him fired him with enthusiasm and delighted him rose from his seat and departedThus have I heard Once the Lord was travelling through Magadha with a large company of some five hundred monks and he arrived at a Brahmin village called KhanumataAnd there he stayed at the Ambalatthika parkNow at that time the Brahmin Kutadanta was living at Khanumata a populous place full of grass timber water and com which had been given to him by King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha as a royal gift and with royal powersAnd Kutadanta planned a great sacrificeseven hundred bulls seven hundred bullocks seven hundred heifers seven hundred hegoats and seven hundred rams were all tied up to the sacrificial postsAnd the Brahmins and householders of Khanumata heard say The ascetic Gotama is staying at AmbalatthikaAnd concerning that Blessed Lord Gotama a good report has been spread about This Blessed Lord is an Arahant a fully enlightened Buddha perfected in knowledge and conduct a WellFarer Knower of the worlds unequalled Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans a Buddha a Blessed LordHe proclaims this world with its gods maras and Brahmas the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and people having come to know it by his own knowledgeHe teaches a Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending in the spirit and in the letter and he displays the fullyperfected thoroughly purified holy lifeAnd indeed it is good to see such ArahantsAnd at that the Brahmins and householders leaving Khanumata in great numbers went to AmbalatthikaJust then Kutadanta had gone up to his verandah for his midday restSeeing all the Brahmins and householders making for Ambalatthikahe asked his steward the reasonThe steward replied Sir it is the ascetic Gotamaconcerning whom a good report has been spread about This Blessed Lord is an Arahant  a Buddha a Blessed LordThat is why they are going to see himThen Kutadanta thought I have heard that the ascetic Gotama understands how to conduct successfully the triple sacrifice with its sixteen requisitesNow I do not understand all thisbut I want to make a big sacrificeSuppose I were to go to the ascetic Gotama and ask him about the matterSo he sent his steward to the Brahmins and householders of Khanumatato ask them to wait for himAnd at that time several hundred Brahmins were staying at Khanumata intending to take part in Kutadantas sacrificeHearing of his intention to visit the ascetic Gotamathey wentand asked him if this were trueSo it is gentlemen I am going to visit the ascetic GotamaSir do not visit the ascetic GotamaThis being so it is not proper that the Reverend Kutadanta should visit the ascetic Gotamabut rather the ascetic Gotama should visit himThen Kutadanta said to the BrahminsNow listen gentlemen as to why it is fitting for us to visit the Reverend Gotama and why it is not fitting for him to visit usThe ascetic Gotama has arrived in Khanumata and is staying at AmbalatthikaAnd whatever ascetics or Brahmins come to our territory are our guestsHe is beyond all praiseOn hearing this the Brahmins said Sir since you praise the ascetic Gotama so much then even if he were to live a hundred yojanas from here it would be fitting for a believing clansman to go with a shoulderbag to visit himAnd sir we shall all go to visit the ascetic GotamaAnd so Kutadanta went with a large company of Brahmins to AmbalatthikaHe approached the Lord exchanged courtesies with him and sat down to one sideSome of the Brahmins and householders of Khanumata made obeisance to the Lord some exchanged courtesies with him some saluted him with joined palms some announced their name and clan and some sat down to one side in silenceSitting to one side Kutadanta addressed the Lord Reverend Gotama I have heard that you understand how to conduct successfully the triple sacrifice with its sixteen requisitesNow I do not understand all thisbut I want to make a big sacrificeIt would be well if the ascetic Gotama were to explain this to meThen listen Brahmin pay proper attention and I will explainYes sir said Kutadantaand the Lord said  Brahmin once upon a time there was a king called Mahavijita  He was rich of great wealth and resources with an abundance of gold and silver of possessions and requisites of money and moneys worth with a full treasury and granaryAnd when King Mahavijita was musing in private the thought came to him I have acquired extensive wealth in human terms I occupy a wide extent of land which I have conquered Suppose now I were to make a great sacrifice which would be to my benefit and happiness for a long timeAnd calling his ministerchaplain he told him his thoughtI want to make a big sacrificeInstruct me Reverend Sir how this may be to my lasting benefit and happinessThe chaplain replied Your Majestys country is beset by thieves it is ravaged villages and towns are being destroyed the countryside is infested with brigandsIf Your Majesty were to tax this region that would be the wrong thing to doSuppose Your Majesty were to think I will get rid of this plague of robbers by executions and imprisonment or by confiscation threats and banishment the plague would not be properly endedThose who survived would later harm Your Majestys realmHowever with this plan you can completely eliminate the plagueTo those in the kingdom who are engaged in cultivating crops and raising cattle let Your Majesty distribute grain and fodderto those in trade give capitalto those in goverment service assign proper living wagesThen those people being intent on their own occupations will not harm the kingdom Your Majestys revenues will be greatthe land will be tranquil and not beset by thievesand the people with joy in their hearts will play with their children and will dwell in open housesAnd saying So be it the king accepted the chaplains advice he gave grain and foddercapital to those in tradepropper living wagesand the people with joy in their hearts dwell in open housesThen King Mahavijita sent for the chaplain and said I have got rid of the plague of robbers following your plan my revenue has grownthe land is tranquil and not beset by thieves and the people with joy in their hearts play with their children and dwell in open housesNow I wish to make a great sacrificeInstruct me as to how this may be done to my lasting benefit and happinessFor this Sire you should send for your Khattiyas from town and countryyour advisers and counsellors the most influential Brahmins and the wealthy householders of your realm and say to them I wish to make a great sacrifice Assist me in this gentlemen that it may be to my lasting benefit and happinessThe King agreed and did soSire let the sacrifice begin now is the time Your MajestyThese four assenting groups will be the accessories for the sacrificeKing Mahavijita is endowed with eight things He is wellborn on both sides of irreproachable birth He is handsome of no mean appearance He is rich   with a full treasury and granary He is powerful having a fourbranched army that is loyal dependable making bright his reputation among his enemies He is a faithful giver and host not shutting his door against ascetics Brahmins and wayfarers beggars and the needy  a fountain of goodness He is very learned in what should be learnt He knows the meaning of whatever is said saying This is what that means He is a scholar accomplished wise competent to perceive advantage in the past the future or the presentKing Mahavijita is endowed with these eight thingsThese constitute the accessories for the sacrificeThe Brahmin chaplain is endowed with four thingsHe is wellborn   He is a scholar versed in the mantras  He is virtuous of increasing virtue endowed with increasing virtue He is learned accomplished and wise and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladleHe has these four qualitiesThese constitute the accessories to the sacrificeThen prior to the sacrifice the Brahmin chaplain taught the King the three modesIt might be that Your Majesty might have some regrets about the intended sacrifice I am going to lose a lot of wealthor during the sacrifice I am losing a lot of wealfor after the sacrifice I have lost a lot of wealth In such cases Your Majesty should not entertain such regretsThen prior to the sacrifice the chaplain dispelled the Kings qualms with ten conditions for the recipientSire there will come to the sacrifice those who take life and those who abstain from taking lifeTo those who take life so will be to thembut those who abstain from taking life will have a successful sacrifice and will rejoice in it and their hearts may be calmed withinThere will come those who take what is not given and those who refrain those who indulge in sexual misconduct and those who refrain those who tell lies indulge in calumny harsh and frivolous speech those who are covetous and those who are not those who harbour illwill and those who do not those who have wrong views and those who have right viewsTo those who have wrong views it will turn out accordinglybut those who have right views will have a successful sacrifice and will rejoice in it and their hearts may be calmed withinSo the chaplain dispelled the Kings doubts with ten conditionsSo the chaplain instructed the King who was making the great sacrifice with sixteen reasons urged him inspired him and gladdened his heart Someone might say King Mahavijita is making a great sacrifice but he has not invited his Khattiyashis advisers and counsellors the most influential Brahmins and wealthy housholdersBut such words would not be in accordance with the truthsince the King has invited themThus the King may know that he will have a successful sacrifice and rejoice in it and his heart will be calmed withinOr someone might say King Mahavijita is making a great sacrifice but he is not wellborn on both sides But such words would not be in accordance with the truthOr someone might say His chaplain is not wellbornBut such words would not be in accordance with the truthThus the chaplain instructed the King with sixteen reasonsIn this sacrifice Brahmin no bulls were slain no goats or sheep no cocks and pigs nor were various living beings subjected to slaughter nor were trees cut down for sacrificial posts nor were grasses mown for the sacrificial grassand those who are called slaves or servants or workmen did not perform their tasks for fear of blows or threats weeping and in tearsBut those who wanted to do something did it those who did not wish to did not they did what they wanted to do and not what they did not want to doThe sacrifice was carried out with ghee oil butter curds honey and molassesThen Brahmin the Khattiyas the ministers and counsellors the influential Brahmins the wealthy householders of town and country having received a sufficient income came to King Mahavijita and said We have brought sufficient wealth Your Majesty please accept itBut gentlemen I have collected together sufficient wealth Whatever is left over you take awayAt the Kings refusal they went away to one side and consulted together It is not right for us to take this wealth back to our own homesThe King is making a great sacrifice Let us follow his exampleThen the JKhattiyas put their gifts to the east of the sacrificial pitthe advisers and counsellors set out theirs to the souththe Brahmins to the westand the wealthy housholders to the northAnd in this sacrifice no bulls were slain nor were living beings subjected to slaughterThose who wanted to do something did it those who did not wish to did notThe sacrifice was carried out with ghee oil butter curds honey and molassesThus there were the four assenting groups and King Mahavijita was endowed with eight things and the chaplain with four things in three modes This Brahmin is called the sixteenfold successful sacrifice in three modesAt this the Brahmins shouted loudly and noisily What a splendid sacrifice What a splertdid way to perform a sacrificeBut Kutadanta sat in silenceAnd the Brahmins asked him why he did not applaud the ascetic Gotamas fine wordsHe replied It is not that I do not applaud themMy head would split open if I did notBut it strikes me that the ascetic Gotama does not say I have heard this or It must have been like this but he says It was like this or like that at the timeAnd so gentlemen it seems to me that the ascetic Gotama must have been at that time either King Mahavijita the lord of the sacrifice or else the Brahmin chaplain who conducted the sacrifice for himDoes the Reverend Gotama acknowledge that he performed or caused to be performed such a sacrifice and that in consequence at death after the breakingup of the body he was reborn in a good sphere a heavenly state I do Brahmin I was the Brahmin chaplain who conducted that sacrificeAnd Reverend Gotama is there any other sacrifice that is simpler less difficult more fruitful and profitable than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen attributes There is BrahminWhat is it Reverend Gotama Wherever regular family gifts are given to virtuous ascetics these constitute a sacrifice more fruitful and profitable than thatWhy Reverend Gotama and for what reason is this better Brahmin no Arahants or those who have attained the Arahant path will attend such a sacrificeWhyBecause there they see beatings and throttlings so they do not attendBut they will attend the sacrifice at which regular family gifts are given to virtuous asceticsbecause there there are no beatings or throttlingsThat is why this kind of sacrifice is more fruitful and profitableBut Reverend Gotama is there any other sacrifice that is more profitable than either of these There is BrahminWhat is it Reverend Gotama Brahmin if anyone provides shelter for the Sangha coming from the four quarters that constitutes a more profitable sacrificeBut Reverend Gotama is there any sacrifice that is more profitable than these three There is BrahminWhat is it Reverend Gotama Brahmin if anyone with a pure heart goes for refuge to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha that constitutes a sacrifice more profitable than any of these threeBut Reverend Gotama is there any sacrifice that is more profitable than these four There is BrahminWhat is it Reverend Gotama Brahmin if anyone with a pure heart undertakes the precepts  to refrain from taking life from taking what is not given from sexual immorality from lying speech and from taking strong drink and sloth producing drugs that constitutes a sacrifice more profitable than any of these fourBut Reverend Gotama is there any sacrifice that is more profitable than these five There is BrahminWhat is it Reverend Gotama Brahmin a Tathagata arises in this world an Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans enlightened and blessedThus a monk is perfected in morality He attains the four jhanas That Brahmin is a sacrifice    more profitableHe attains various insights  and the cessation of the corruptions  He knows There is nothing further in this worldThat Brahmin is a sacrifice that is simpler less difficult more fruitful and more profitable than all the othersAnd beyond this there is no sacrifice that is greater and more perfectExcellent Reverend Gotama excellentmay the Reverend Gotama accept me as a layfollower from this day forth as long as life shall lastAnd Reverend Gotama I set free the seven hundred bulls seven hundred bullocks seven hundred heifers seven hundred hegoats and seven hundred rams I grant them life let them be fed with green grass and given cool water to drink and let cool breezes play upon them Then the Lord delivered a graduated discourse to Kutadanta on generosity on morality and on heaven showing the danger degradation and corruption of sensedesires and the profit of renunciationAnd when the Lord knew that Kutadantas mind was ready pliable free from the hindrances joyful and calm then he preached a sermon on Dhamma in brief on suffering its origin its cessation and the pathAnd just as a clean doth from which all stains have been removed receives the dye perfectly so in the Brahmin Kutadanta as he sat there there arose the pure and spotless Dhammaeye and he knew Whatever things have an origin must come to cessationThen Kutadanta having seen attained experienced and penetrated the Dhamma having passed beyond doubt transcended uncertainty having gained perfect confidence in the Teachers doctrine without relying on others said May the Reverend Gotama and his order of monks accept a meal from me tomorrowThe Lord assented by silenceThen Kutadanta seeing his consent rose saluted the Lord passed by to his right and departedAs day was breaking he caused hard and soft food to be prepared at his place of sacrifice and when it was ready he announced Reverend Gotama it is time the meal is readyAnd the Lord having risen early went with robe and bowl and attended by his monks to Kutadantas place of sacrifice and sat down on the prepared seatAnd Kutadanta served the Buddha and his monks with the finest foods with his own hands until they were satisfiedAnd when the Lord had eaten and taken his hand away from the bowl Kutadanta took a low stool and sat down to one sideThen the Lord having instructed Kutadanta with a talk on Dhamma inspired him fired him with enthusiasm and delighted him rose from his seat and departedI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryNow on that occasion Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer together with a large following of about  wanderers had taken up residence in the debating hall near the Tiṇḍuka tree in the singlepavilion park of Queen MallikāThen the Blessed One early in the morninghaving adjusted his lower robe and taking his bowl  outer robeentered Sāvatthī for almsThen the thought occurred to him While its still too early to go into Sāvatthī for almswhy dont I go to the debating hall near the Tiṇḍuka tree in the singlepavilion park of Queen Mallikā to see Poṭṭhapāda the wandererSo he went to the debating hall near the Tiṇḍuka tree in the singlepavilion park of Queen MallikāNow on that occasion Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer was sitting with his large following of wanderers all making a great noise  racket discussing many kinds of bestial topics of conversationconversation about kings robbers  ministers of state armies alarms  battles food  drink clothing furniture garlands  scents relatives vehicles villages towns cities the countryside women  heroes the gossip of the street  the well tales of the dead tales of diversity the creation of the world  of the sea talk of whether things exist or notThen Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer saw the Blessed One coming from afar and on seeing him hushed his following Be quiet good sirs Dont make any noiseHere comes the contemplative GotamaHe is fond of quietude and speaks in praise of quietudeMaybe if he perceives our group as quiet he will consider it worth his while to come our waySo the wanderers fell silentThen the Blessed One went to Poṭṭhapādaand Poṭṭhapāda said to him Come Blessed OneWelcome Blessed OneIts been a long time since the Blessed One has gone out of his way to come hereSit down Blessed One This seat has been preparedSo the Blessed One sat on the prepared seatPoṭṭhapāda taking a lower seat sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him For what topic of conversation are you gathered together here In the midst of what topic of conversation have you been interruptedWhen this was said Poṭṭhapāda replied Never mind lord about the topic of conversation for which we have gathered hereIt wont be difficult for the Blessed One to hear about that laterFor the past few days a discussion has arisen among the many sects of contemplatives  brahmans gathered and sitting together in the debating hall concerning the ultimate cessation of perception How is there the ultimate cessation of perceptionWith regard to this some said A persons perception arises and ceases without cause without reasonWhen it arises one is percipientWhen it ceases one is not percipientThats how one group described the ultimate cessation of perceptionThen someone else said No thats not how it isPerception is a persons selfwhich comes and goesWhen it comes one is percipientWhen it goes one is not percipientThats how one group described the ultimate cessation of perceptionThen someone else said No thats not how it isfor there are contemplatives  brahmans of great power great potencyThey draw perception in and out of a personWhen they draw it in one is percipientWhen they draw it out one is not percipientThats how one group described the ultimate cessation of perceptionThen someone else said No thats not how it isfor there are devas of great power great potencyThey draw perception in and out of a personWhen they draw it in one is percipientWhen they draw it out one is not percipientThats how one group described the ultimate cessation of perceptionThen the memory of the Blessed One arose within me Ah the Blessed One Ah the One WellGonewho surely is wellskilled in these mattersThe Blessed One is skilled and expert in the ultimate cessation of perceptionSo what lord is the ultimate cessation of perceptionIn this regard Poṭṭhapāda those contemplatives  brahmans who say that a persons perception arises  ceases without cause without reason are wrong from the very startWhy is thatBecause a persons perception arises  ceases with a cause with a reasonWith training one perception arises and with training another perception ceasesAnd what is that trainingThere is the case where a Tathāgata appears in the world worthy and rightly selfawakened as in DN  This is how a monk is consummate in virtue Seeing that these five hindrances have been abandoned within him he becomes glad Glad he becomes enraptured Enraptured his body grows tranquil His body tranquil he is sensitive to pleasure Feeling pleasure his mind becomes concentratedQuite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities the monk enters  remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationHis earlier perception of sensuality ceasesand on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of seclusion On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of seclusionAnd thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceasesThen with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations the monk enters  remains in the second jhāna rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluationinternal assuranceHis earlier perception of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of seclusion ceasesand on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of concentration On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of concentrationAnd thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceasesAnd further with the fading of rapture the monk remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body He enters  remains in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abidingHis earlier perception of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of concentration ceasesand on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of equanimity On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of equanimityAnd thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceasesAnd further with the abandoning of pleasure  painas with the earlier disappearance of elation  distressthe monk enters  remains in the fourth jhāna purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor painHis earlier perception of a refined truth of equanimity ceasesand on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of neither pleasure nor pain On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of neither pleasure nor painAnd thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceasesAnd further with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of multiplicity Infinite space the monk enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of spaceHis earlier perception of a refined truth of neither pleasure nor pain ceasesand on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of spaceAnd thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceasesAnd further with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space Infinite consciousness the monk enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessHis earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space ceasesand on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessAnd thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceasesAnd further with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness There is nothing enters  remains in the dimension of nothingnessHis earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness ceasesand on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of nothingness On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of nothingnessAnd thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceasesNow when the monk is percipient of himself here then from there to there step by step he touches the peak of perceptionAs he remains at the peak of perception the thought occurs to him Thinking is bad for me Not thinking is better for meIf I were to think and will this perception of mine would cease and a grosser perception would appear What if I were neither to think nor to willSo he neither thinks nor wills and as he is neither thinking nor willingthat perception ceases and another grosser perception does not appearHe touches cessationThis Poṭṭhapāda is how there is the alert stepby step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perceptionNow what do you think Poṭṭhapāda Have you ever before heard of such an alert stepby step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perceptionNo lordAnd here is how I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One When the monk is percipient of himself here then from there to there step by step he touches the peak of perception As he remains at the peak of perception the thought occurs to him Thinking is bad for me Not thinking is better for meIf I were to think and will this perception of mine would cease and a grosser perception would appear What if I were neither to think nor to willSo he neither thinks nor wills and as he is neither thinking nor willing that perception ceases and another grosser perception does not appearHe touches cessationThis Poṭṭhapāda is how there is the alert stepby step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perceptionThats right PoṭṭhapādaBut lord does the Blessed One describe one peak of perception or many peaks of perceptionPoṭṭhapāda I describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perceptionAnd how does the Blessed One describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perceptionIn whatever way one touches cessation Poṭṭhapāda thats the way I describe the peak of perceptionThats how I describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perceptionNow lord does perception arise first and knowledge after or does knowledge arise first and perception after or do perception  knowledge arise simultaneouslyPoṭṭhapāda perception arises first and knowledge after And the arising of knowledge comes from the arising of perceptionOne discerns Its in dependence on this that my knowledge has arisenThrough this line of reasoning one can realize how perception arises first and knowledge after and how the arising of knowledge comes from the arising of perceptionNow lord is perception a persons self or is perception one thing and self anotherWhat self do you posit PoṭṭhapādaI posit a gross self possessed of form made up of the four great elements earth water fire and wind feeding on physical foodThen Poṭṭhapāda your self would be gross possessed of form made up of the four great elements feeding on physical foodThat being the case then for you perception would be one thing and self anotherAnd its through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self anothereven as there remains this gross selfpossessed of form made up of the four great elements and feeding on foodone perception arises for that person as another perception passes awayIts through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self anotherThen lord I posit a mindmade self complete in all its parts not inferior in its facultiesThen Poṭṭhapāda your self would be mindmade complete in all its parts not inferior in its faculties That being the case then for you perception would be one thing and self anotherAnd its through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self anothereven as there remains this mindmade selfcomplete in all its parts not inferior in its facultiesone perception arises for that person as another perception passes awayIts through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self anotherThen lord I posit a formless self made of perceptionThen Poṭṭhapāda your self would be formless and made of perception That being the case then for you perception would be one thing and self anotherAnd its through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self anothereven as there remains this formless self made of perception one perception arises for that person as another perception passes awayIts through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self anotherIs it possible for me to know lord whether perception is a persons self or if perception is one thing and self anotherPoṭṭhapādahaving other views other practices other satisfactions other aims other teachersits hard for you to know whether perception is a persons self or if perception is one thing and self anotherWell then lord ifhaving other views other practices other satisfactions other aims other teachersits hard for me to know whether perception is a persons self or if perception is one thing and self another then is it the case that the cosmos is eternal that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthlessPoṭṭhapāda I havent expounded that the cosmos is eternal that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthlessThen is it the case that the cosmos is not eternal that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthlessPoṭṭhapāda I havent expounded that the cosmos is not eternal that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthlessThen is it the case that the cosmos is finite the cosmos is infinite the soul  the body are the same the soul is one thing and the body another after death a Tathāgata exists after death a Tathāgata does not exist after death a Tathāgata both exists  does not exist after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthlessPoṭṭhapāda I havent expounded that after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthlessBut why hasnt the Blessed One expounded these thingsBecause they are not conducive to the goal are not conducive to the Dhamma are not basic to the holy life They dont lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to selfawakening to unbinding Thats why I havent expounded themAnd what has the Blessed One expoundedI have expounded that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stressAnd why has the Blessed One expounded these thingsBecause they are conducive to the goal conducive to the Dhamma and basic to the holy life They lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to selfawakening to unbinding Thats why I have expounded themSo it is Blessed One So it is O One WellGoneWell now its time for the Blessed One to do as he sees fitThen the Blessed One got up from his seat and leftNot long after he had left the wanderers with sneering words jeered at Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer from all sides So whatever the contemplative Gotama says Sir Poṭṭhapāda rejoices in his every word So it is Blessed One So it is O One WellGoneBut we dont understand the contemplative Gotama as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is eternal or the cosmos is not eternal or whether after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not existWhen this was said Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer replied to the wanderers I too dont understand the contemplative Gotama as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is eternal or the cosmos is not eternal or whether after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist But the contemplative Gotama describes a genuine authentic and accurate practice grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the DhammaAnd when a genuine authentic and accurate practice grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the Dhamma is being explained why shouldnt a knowledgeable person such as myself rejoice in the wellspokenness of the contemplative Gotamas wellspoken wordsThen two or three days later Citta the elephant trainers son and Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer went to the Blessed One On their arrival Citta bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one sidewhile Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer greeted the Blessed One courteouslyAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One The other day not long after the Blessed One had left the wanderers with sneering words jeered at me from all sides So whatever the contemplative Gotama says Sir Poṭṭhapāda rejoices in his every word So it is Blessed One So it is O One WellGoneBut we dont understand the contemplative Gotama as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is eternal or the cosmos is not eternal or  whether after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not existWhen this was said I replied to the wanderers I too dont understand the contemplative Gotama as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is eternal or the cosmos is not eternal or whether after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist But the contemplative Gotama describes a genuine authentic and accurate practice grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the DhammaAnd when a genuine authentic and accurate practice grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the Dhamma is being explained why shouldnt a knowledgeable person such as myself rejoice in the wellspokenness of the contemplative Gotamas wellspoken wordsThe Buddha Poṭṭhapāda all those wanderers are blind and have no eyes You alone among them have eyesI have taught and declared some teachings to be categorical and some teachings to be not categoricalAnd what are the teachings that I have taught and declared to be not categorical The cosmos is eternal I have taught and declared to be a not categorical teaching The cosmos is not eternal  The cosmos is finite  The cosmos is infinite  The soul  the body are the same  The soul is one thing and the body another  After death a Tathāgata exists  After death a Tathāgata does not exist  After death a Tathāgata both exists  does not exist  After death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist I have taught and declared to be a not categorical teachingAnd why have I taught and declared these teachings to be not categoricalBecause they are not conducive to the goal are not conducive to the Dhamma are not basic to the holy life They dont lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to unbindingThats why I have taught and declared them to be not categoricalAnd what have I taught and declared to be categorical teachings This is stress I have taught and declared to be a categorical teaching This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress I have taught and declared to be a categorical teachingAnd why have I taught and declared these teachings to be categoricalBecause they are conducive to the goal conducive to the Dhamma and basic to the holy life They lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to unbindingThats why I have taught and declared them to be categoricalThere are some contemplatives  brahmans with a doctrine  view like this After death the self is exclusively happy and free from diseaseI approached them and asked them Is it true that you have a doctrine  view like

world saying Practice well my dears Practice straightforwardly my dears for the realization of an exclusively happy world because it was through such a practice that we ourselves have been reborn in

YesSo what do you think Poṭṭhapāda When this is the case dont the words of that man turn out to be unconvincingYes lordIn the same way there are some contemplatives  brahmans with a doctrine  view like this After death the self is exclusively happy and free from disease Dont the words of those contemplatives  brahmans turn out to be unconvincingYes lord When this is the case the words of those contemplatives  brahmans turn out to be unconvincingPoṭṭhapāda there are these three appropriations of a self the gross appropriation of a self the mindmade appropriation of a self and the formless appropriation of a selfAnd what is the gross appropriation of a selfPossessed of form made up of the four great elements feeding on physical food this is the gross appropriation of a selfAnd what is the mindmade appropriation of a selfPossessed of form mindmade complete in all its parts not inferior in its faculties this is the mindmade appropriation of a selfAnd what is the formless

teach the Dhamma such that when you practice it defiling mental qualities will be abandoned bright mental qualities will grow and you will enter  remain in the culmination  abundance of discernment having known  realized it for yourself in the here  now When asked this I would answer This friend is that gross appropriation of a self for whose abandoning I teach the DhammaIn the past I have been asked What friend is the mindmade appropriation of a self the formless appropriation of a self for whose abandoning you teach the Dhamma When asked this I would answer This friend is that gross appropriation of a self for whose abandoning I teach the DhammaWhat do you think Poṭṭhapāda When this is the case dont those words turn out to be convincingYes lord When this is the case those words turn out to be convincingPoṭṭhapāda its as if a man at a crossroads were to build a staircase for ascending to a palaceand other people were to say to him Well my good man this palace for which you are building a staircase Do you know whether its east west north or south of here Whether its high low or in betweenHe would say This friends is the palace to which I am building a staircase The staircase is right under the palaceSo what do you think Poṭṭhapāda When this is the case dont the words of that man turn out to be convincingYes lordIn the same way in the past I have been asked What friend is the gross appropriation of a self the mindmade appropriation of a self the formless appropriation of a self for whose abandoning you teach the Dhamma When asked this I would answer This friend is that gross appropriation of a self for whose abandoning I teach the DhammaWhat do you think Poṭṭhapāda When this is the case dont those words turn out to be convincingYes lord When this is the case those words turn out to be convincingWhen this was said Citta the elephant trainers son said to the Blessed One When there is a gross appropriation of a self is it the case then that ones mindmade appropriation of a self and formless appropriation of a self are null  void and only ones gross appropriation of a self is trueAnd when there is a mindmade appropriation of a self is it the case then that ones gross appropriation of a self and formless appropriation of a self are null  void and only ones mindmade appropriation of a self is trueAnd when there is a formless appropriation of a self is it the case then that ones gross appropriation of a self and mindmade appropriation of a self are null  void and only ones formless appropriation of a self is trueCitta when there is a gross appropriation of a self its not classified either as a mindmade appropriation of a self or as a formless appropriation of a self Its classified just as a gross appropriation of a selfWhen there is a mindmade appropriation of a self its not classified either as a gross appropriation of a self or as a formless appropriation of a self Its classified just as a mindmade appropriation of a selfWhen there is a formless appropriation of a self its not classified either as a gross appropriation of a self or as a mindmade appropriation of a self It is classified just as a formless appropriation of a selfSuppose they were to ask you Did you exist in the past Did you not not exist Will you exist in the future Will you not not exist Do you exist now Do you not not exist Thus asked how would you answer Thus asked lord I would answer I existed in the past I did not not exist I will exist in the future I will not not exist I exist now I do not not exist Thats how I would answerSuppose Citta they were to ask you Whatever your past appropriation of a self Is that alone your true appropriation of self while the future  present ones are null  voidWhatever your future appropriation of a self Is that alone your true appropriation of a self while the past  present ones are null  voidWhatever your present appropriation of a self Is that alone your true appropriation of a self while the past  future ones are null  voidThus asked how would you answerThus asked lord I would answer Whatever my past appropriation of a self on that occasion that alone was my true

there is a gross appropriation of a self its classified just as a gross appropriation of a selfWhen there is a mindmade appropriation of a selfWhen there is a formless appropriation of a self its not classified either as a gross appropriation of a self or as a mindmade appropriation of a self Its classified just as a formless appropriation of a selfJust as when milk comes from a cow curds from milk butter from curds ghee from butter and the skimmings of ghee from gheeWhen there is milk its not classified as curds butter ghee or skimmings of ghee Its classified just as milkWhen there are curds When there is butter When there is ghee When there are the skimmings of ghee theyre not classified as milk curds butter or ghee Theyre classified just as the skimmings of gheeIn the same way

its not classified either as a gross appropriation of a self or as a mindmade appropriation of a self Its classified just as a formless appropriation of a selfCitta these are the worlds designations the worlds expressions the worlds ways of speaking the worlds descriptions with which the Tathāgata expresses himself but without grasping to themWhen this was said Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama MagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see formsin the same way has Master Gotamathrough many lines of reasoningmade the Dhamma clearI go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of monksMay Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeBut Citta the elephant trainers son said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificentin the same way has Master Gotamathrough many lines of reasoningmade the Dhamma clearI go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of monksLet me obtain the going forth in the Blessed Ones presence Let me obtain acceptanceSo Citta the elephant trainers son obtained the going forth in the Blessed Ones presence he obtained acceptanceAnd not long after his Acceptancedwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolutehe in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for the sake of this worldJust as if he were to place upright what was overturnedAnd thus Ven Elephanttrainers Son became another one of the arahantsThus have I heard Once the Lord was touring Kosala with a large company of some five hundred monks He came to a Kosalan Brahmin village called ManasakataHe came to a Kosalan Brahmin village called Manasakata and stayed to the north of the village in a mangogrove on the bank of the River AciravatiAnd at that time many very wellknown and prosperous Brahmins were staying at Manasakata including Canki Ta rukkha Pokkharasati Janussoni and TodeyyaAnd Vasettha and Bharadvaja went strolling along the road and as they did so an argument broke out between them on the subject of right and wrong pathsThe young Brahmin Vasettha said This is the only straight path this is the direct path the path of salvation that leads one who follows it to union with Brahma as is taught by the Brahmin PokkharasatiAnd the young Brahmin Bharadvaja said This is the only straight path as taught by the Brahmin TarukkhaAnd Vasettha could not convince Bharadvaja nor could Bharadvaja convince VasetthaThen Vasettha said to Bharadvaja This ascetic Gotama is staying to the north of the villageand concerning this Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about  Let us go to the ascetic Gotama and ask himand whatever he tells us we shall acceptAnd Bharadvaja agreedSo the two of them went to see the LordHaving exchanged courtesies with him they sat down to one sideand Vasettha said Reverend Gotama as we were strolling along the road we got to discussing right and wrong pathsI said This is the only straight path as is taught by the Brahmin Pokkharasatiand Bharadvaja said This is the only straight path   as is taught by the Brahmin TarukkhaThis is our dispute our quarrel our differenceSo Vasettha you say that the way to union with Brahma is that taught by the Brahmin Pokkharasatiand Bharadvaja says it is that taught by the Brahmin TarukhaWhat is the dispute the quarrel the difference all aboutRight and wrong paths Reverend GotamaThere are so many kinds of Brahmins who teach different paths the Ad dhariya the Tittiriya the Chandoka the Chandava the Brah macariya Brahmins  do all these ways lead to union with BrahmaJust as if there were near a town or village many different paths  do all these come together at that place And likewise do the ways of the various Brahmins lead the one who follows them to union with BrahmaYou say They lead Vasettha I say They lead Reverend GotamaYou say They lead Vasettha I say They lead Reverend GotamaYou say They lead Vasettha I say They lead Reverend GotamaBut Vasettha is there then a single one of these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas who has seen Brahma face to face No Reverend GotamaThen has the teachers teacher of any one of them seen Brahma face to face No Reverend GotamaThen has the ancestor seven generations back of the teacher of one of them seen Brahma face to face No Reverend GotamaWell then Vasettha what about the early sages of those Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas the makers of the mantras the expounders of the mantras whose ancient verses are chanted pronounced and collected by the Brahmins of today and sung and spoken about  such as Atthaka Vamaka Vamadeva Vessamitta Yamataggi Angirasa Bharadvaja Vasettha Kassapa Bhagu did they ever say We know and see when how and where Brahma appears No Reverend GotamaSo Vasettha not one of these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas has seen Brahma face to facenor has one of their teachersor teachers teachersnor even the ancestor seven generations back of one of their teachersNor could any of the early sages say We know and see when how and where Brahma appearsSo what these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas are saying is We teach this path to union with Brahma that we do not know or seethis is the only straight path leading to union with BrahmaWhat do you think Vasettha Such being the case does not what these Brahmins declare turn out to be illfounded Yes indeed Reverend GotamaWell Vasettha when these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas teach a path that they do not know or see sayingThis is the only straight path this cannot possibly be rightJust as a file of blind men go on clinging to each other and the first one sees nothing the middle one sees nothing and the last one sees nothing so it is with the talk of these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas the first one sees nothing the middle one sees nothing the last one sees nothingThe talk of these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas turns out to be laughable mere words empty and vainWhat do you think Vasettha Do these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas see the sun and moon just as other people do and when the sun and moon rise and set do they pray sing praises and worship with clasped hands They do Reverend GotamaWhat do you think Vasettha These Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas who can see the sun and moon just as other people do   can they point out a way to union with the sun and moon saying This is the only straight path that leads to union with the sun and moon No Reverend GotamaSo Vasettha these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas cannot point out a way to union with the sun and moon which they have seenAnd too none of them has seen Brahma face to facenor has even the ancestor seven generations back of one of their teachersNor could any of the early sages say We know and see when how and where Brahma appearsDoes not what these Brahmins declare turn out to be illfounded Yes indeed Reverend GotamaVasettha it is just as if a man were to say I am going to seek out and love the most beautiful girl in the countryThey might say to him  Do you know what caste she belongs to NoWell do you know her name her clan whether she is tall or short dark or lightcomplex ioned or where she comes from NoAnd they might say Well then you dont know or see the one you seek for and desire and he would say NoDoes not the talk of that man turn out to be stupid Certainly Reverend GotamaThen Vasettha it is like this not one of these Brahmins   has seen Brahma face to face nor has one of their teachers Yes indeed Reverend GotamaThat is right Vasettha When these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas teach a path that they do not know and see this cannot possibly be rightVasettha it is just as if a man were to build a staircase for a palace at a crossroadsPeople might say This staircase for a palace  do you know whether the palace will face east or west north or south or whether it will be high low or of medium height and he would say NoAnd they might say Well then you dont know or see what kind of a palace you are building the staircase for and he would say NoDoes not the talk of that man turn out to be stupid Certainly Reverend GotamaVasettha it is just as if this River Aciravati were brimful of water so that a crow could drink out of itand a man should come along wishing to cross over to get to the other side to get acrossand standing on this bank were to call out Come here other bank come hereWhat do you think Vasettha Would the other bank of the River Aciravati come over to this side on account of that mans calling begging requesting or wheedling No Reverend GotamaWell now Vasettha those Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas who persistently neglect what a Brahmin should do and persistently do what a Brahmin should not do declare We call on Indra Soma Varuna Isana Pajapati Brahma Mahiddhi YamaBut that such Brahmins who persistently neglect what a Brahmin should do will as a consequence of their calling begging requesting or wheedling attain after death at the breakingup of the body to union with Brahma  that is just not possibleVasettha it is just as if this River Aciravati were brimful of water so that a crow could drink out of itand a man should come wishing to cross overbut he was bound and pinioned on this side by a strong chain with his hands behind his backWhat do you think Vasettha Would that man be able to get to the other side No Reverend GotamaIn just the same way Vasettha in the Ariyan discipline these five strands of sensedesire are called bonds and fettersWhich fiveForms seen by the eye which are agreeable loved charming attractive pleasurable arousing desiresounds heard by the ear smells smelt by the nose tastes savoured by the tongue contacts felt by the body which are agreeable  arousing desireThese five in the Ariyan discipline are called bonds and fettersAnd Vasettha those Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas are enslaved infatuated by these five strands of sensedesire which they enjoy guiltily unaware of danger knowing no way outBut that such Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas who persistently neglect what a Brahmin should do who are enslaved by these five strands of sensedesire knowing no way out should attain after death at the breakingup of the body to union with Brahma  that is just not possibleIt is just as if this River Aciravati were brimful of water so that a crow could drink out of itand a man should come along wishing to cross over and were to lie down on this bank covering his head with a shawlWhat do you think Vasettha Would that man be able to get to the other side No Reverend GotamaIn the same way Vasettha in the Ariyan discipline these five hindrances are called obstacles hindrances cover ingsup envelopingsWhich fiveThe hindrance of sensuality of illwill of slothandtorpor of worryandflurry of doubtThese five are called obstacles hindrances coveringsup en velopingsAnd these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas are caught up hemmed in obstructed entangled in these five hindrancesBut that such Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas who persistently neglect what a Brahmin should do and who are caught up entangled in these five hindrances should attain after death at the breakingup of the body to union with Brahma  that is just not possibleWhat do you think Vasettha What have you heard said by Brahmins who are venerable aged the teachers of teachers Is Brahma encumbered with wives and wealth or unencumbered Unencumbered Reverend GotamaIs he full of hate or without hate Without hate Reverend GotamaIs he full of illwill or without illwill Without illwill Reverend GotamaIs he impure or pure Pure Reverend GotamaIs he disciplined or undisciplined Disciplined Reverend GotamaAnd what do you think Vasettha Are the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas encumbered with wives and wealth or unencumbered Encumbered Reverend GotamaAre they full of hate or without hate Full of hate Reverend GotamaAre they full of illwill or without illwill Full of illwill Reverend GotamaAre they impure or pure Impure Reverend GotamaAre they disciplined or undisciplined Undisciplined Reverend GotamaSo Vasettha the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas are encumbered with wives and wealth and Brahma is unencumberedIs there any communion anything in common between these encumbered Brahmins and the unencumbered Brahma No Reverend GotamaThat is right Vasettha That these encumbered Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas should after death at the breakingup of the body be united with the unencumbered Brahma  that is just not possibleLikewise do these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas and full of hate full of illwill impure undisciplined have any communion anything in common with the disciplined BrahmaNo Reverend GotamaThat is right Vasettha That these undisciplined Brahmins should after death be united with Brahma is just not possibleBut these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas having sat down on the bank sink down despairingly thinking maybe to find a dry way acrossTherefore their threefold knowledge is called the threefold desert the threefold wilderness the threefold destructionAt these words Vasettha said Reverend Gotama I have heard them say The ascetic Gotama knows the way to union with BrahmaWhat do you think Vasettha Suppose there were a man here born and brought up in Manasakataand somebody who had come from Manasakata and and had missed the road should ask him the wayWould that man bom and bred in Manasakata be in a state of confusion or perplexityNo Reverend GotamaAnd why notBecause such a man would know all the pathsVasettha it might be said that such a man on being asked the way might be confused or perplexed  but the Tathagata on being asked about the Brahma world and the way to get there would certainly not be confused or perplexedFor Vasettha I know Brahma and the world of Brahma and the way to the world of Brahma and the path of practice whereby the world of Brahma may be gainedAt this Vasettha said Reverend Gotama I have heard them say The ascetic Gotama teaches the way to union with BrahmaIt would be good if the Reverend Gotama were to teach us the way to union with Brahma may the Reverend Gotama help the people of BrahmaThen Vasettha listen pay proper attention and I will tell youVery good Reverend Sir said VasetthaThe Lord said  Vasettha a Tathagata arises in the world an Arahant fullyenlightened BuddhaThen with his heart filled with lovingkindness he dwells suffusing one quarterthe secondthe thirdthe fourthThus he dwells suffusing the whole world upwards downwards across everywhere always with a heart filled with lovingkindness abundant unbounded without hate or illwillJust as if a mighty trumpeter were with little difficulty to make a proclamation to the four quarters so by this meditation Vasettha by this liberation of the heart through loving kindness he leaves nothing untouched nothing unaffected in the sensuous sphereThis Vasettha is the way to union with BrahmaThen with his heart filled with compassion with sympathetic joy with equanimity he dwells suffusing one quarterthe secondthe thirdthe fourthThus he dwells suffusing the whole world upwards downwards across everywhere always with a heart filled with equanimity abundant unbounded without hate or illwillJust as if a mighty trumpeter were with little difficulty to make a proclamation to the four quartersso by this meditation Vasettha by this liberation of the heart through compassion  through sympathetic joy through equanimity he leaves nothing untouched nothing unaffected in the sensuous sphereThis Vasettha is the way to union with BrahmaWhat do you think Vasettha Is a monk dwelling thus encumbered with wives and wealth or unencumberedUnencumbered Reverend GotamaHe is without hatewithout illwillpure anddisciplined Reverend GotamaThen Vasettha the monk is unencumbered and Brahma is unencumberedHas that unencumbered monk anything in common with the unencumbered BrahmaYes indeed Reverend GotamaThat is right Vasettha Then that an unencumbered monk after death at the breakingup of the body should attain to union with the unencumbered Brahma  that is possibleLikewise a monk without hate without illwill pure disciplined Then that a disciplined monk after death at the breakingup of the body should attain to union with Brahma  that is possibleAt this the young Brahmins Vasettha and Bharadvaja said to the Lord Excellent Reverend Gotama excellentIt is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down or to point out the way to one who had got lost or to bring an oillamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was thereJust so the Reverend Gotama has expounded the Dhamma in various waysWe take refuge in the Reverend Gotama in the Dhamma and in the SanghaMay the Reverend Gotama accept us as layfollowers having taken refuge from this day forth as long as life shall lastVery good Sire said Vassakara and having had the state carriages harnessed he mounted one of them and drove in state from Rajagaha to Vultures Peakriding as far as the ground would allow then continuing on foot to where the Lord was He exchanged courtesies with the Lordthen sat down to one sideand delivered the Kings messageVery well sire said the brahman Vassakara in assent to Ajatasattu king of Magadha And he ordered a large number of magnificent carriages to be made ready mounted one himself and accompanied by the rest drove out to Rajagaha towards Vultures PeakHe went by carriage as far as the carriage could go then dismounting he approached the Blessed One on footAfter exchanging courteous greetings with the Blessed One together with many pleasant wordshe sat down at one side and addressed the Blessed One thus Venerable Gotama Ajatasattu the king of Magadha pays homage at the feet of the Venerable Gotama and wishes him good health strength ease vigour and comfortHe desires to wage war against the Vajjisand he has spoken in this fashion These Vajjis powerful and glorious as they are I shall annihilate them I shall make them perish I shall utterly destroy themResponding As you say sire to Ajātasattu Vedehiputta the King of Magadha Vassakāra the brahman the chief minister of Magadha had auspicious vehicles yoked got into an auspicious vehicle left Rājagaha with the auspicious vehicles and drove toward Vulture Peak MountainGoing in his vehicle as far as there was ground for a vehicle getting down from his vehicle he approached the Blessed One on foot On arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed OneAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he told the Blessed One Ajātasattu Vedehiputta the king of Magadha Master Gotama shows reverence with his head to Master Gotamas feet and asks whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfortMaster Gotama Ajātasattu Vedehiputta the king of Magadha wants to attack the VajjiansHe says I will cut down these Vajjiansso mighty so powerful I will destroy the Vajjians I will bring these Vajjians to ruinthese VajjiansNow the Venerable Ananda was standing behind the Lord fanning himAnd the Lord said Ananda have you heard that the Vajjians hold regular and frequent assemblies I have heard Lord that they doAnanda as long as the Vajjians hold regular and frequent assemblies they may be expected to prosper and not declineHave you heard that the Vajjians meet in harmony break up in harmony and carry on their business in harmony I have heard Lord that they doAnanda as long as the Vajjians meet in harmony break up in harmony and carry on their business in harmony they may be expected to prosper and not declineHave you heard that the Vajjians do not authorise what has not been authorised already and do not abolish what has been authorised but proceed according to what has been authorised by their ancient tradition I have Lord Have you heard that they honour respect revere and salute the elders among them and consider them worth listening to that they do not forcibly abduct others wives and daughters and compel them to live with themthat they honour respect revere and salute the Vajjian shrines at home and abroad not withdrawing the proper support made and given before that proper provision is made for the safety of Arahants so that such Arahants may come in future to live there and those already there may dwell in comfort I have LordAnanda so long as such proper provision is made the Vajjians may be expected to prosper and not declineThen the Lord said to the Brahmin Vassakara Once Brahmin when I was at the Sarandada Shrine in VesaliI taught the Vajjians these seven principles for preventing declineand as long as they keep to these seven principles as long as these principles remain in force the Vajjians may be expected to prosper and not declineAt this Vassakara replied Reverend Gotama if the Vajjians keep to even one of these principles they may be expected to prosper and not decline far less all sevenCertainly the Vajjians will never be conquered by King Ajatasattu by force of arms but only by means of propaganda and setting them against one anotherAnd now Reverend Gotama may I depart I am busy and have much to doBrahmin do as you think fitThen Vassakara rejoicing and delighted at the Lords words rose from his seat and departedAt that time the Venerable Ananda was standing behind the Blessed One fanning himand the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda thus What have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis have frequent gatherings and are their meetings well attendedI have heard Lord that this is soSo long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their declineWhat have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis assemble and disperse peacefully and attend to their affairs in concord I have heard Lord that they doSo long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their declineWhat have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis neither enact new decrees nor abolish existing ones but proceed in accordance with their ancient constitutions I have heard Lord that they doSo long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their declineWhat have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis show respect honor esteem and veneration towards their elders and think

long brahman as these endure among the Vajjis and the Vajjis are known for it their growth is to be expected not their declineThereupon the brahman Vassakara spoke thus to the Blessed One If the Vajjis Venerable Gotama were endowed with only one or another of these conditions leading to welfare their growth would have to be expected not their declineWhat then of all the sevenNo harm indeed can be done to the Vajjis in battle by Magadhas king Ajatasattu except through treachery or discordWell then Venerable Gotama we will take our leave for we have much to perform much work to doDo as

long as the Vajjians remain steadfast in these seven conditions the Vajjians growth can be expected not their declineWhen this was said Vassakāra the brahman the chief minister of Magadha said to the

Blessed One often gave this Dhamma talk to the monks Such is virtue such is concentration such is discernmentConcentration nurtured with virtue is of great fruit great rewardDiscernment nurtured with concentration is of great fruit great rewardThe mind nurtured with discernment is rightly released from the effluents i e  the effluent of sensuality the effluent of becoming the effluent of ignorance Then the Blessed One having stayed near Rājagaha as long as he pleased said to Ven nanda Come nanda we will head for Ambalaṭṭhikā As you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One together with a large Saṅgha of monks went to AmbalaṭṭhikāThere he stayed near Ambalaṭṭhikā at the Royal CottageWhile staying there near Ambalaṭṭhikā at the Royal Cottage the Blessed One often gave this Dhamma talk to the monks Such is virtue such is concentration such is discernmentConcentration nurtured with virtue is of great fruit great rewardDiscernment nurtured with concentration is of great fruit great rewardThe mind nurtured with discernment is rightly released from the effluents i e  the effluent of sensuality the effluent of becoming the effluent of ignorance Then the Blessed One having stayed near Ambalaṭṭhikā as long as he pleased said to Ven nanda Come nanda we will head for Nāḷandā As you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One together with a large Saṅgha of monks went to Nāḷandā There he stayed near Nāḷandā at the Pāvādika mango groveThen the Venerable Sariputta came to see the Lord saluted him sat down to one sideand said It is clear to me Lord that there never has been will be or is now another ascetic or Brahmin who is better or more enlightened than the LordYou have spoken boldly with a bulls voice Sariputta you have roared the lions roar of certaintyHow is this Have all the Arahant Buddhas of the past appeared to you and were the minds of all those Lords open to you so as to say These Lords were of such virtue such was their teaching such their wisdom such their way such their liberation No LordAnd have you perceived all the Arahant Buddhas who will appear in the future No LordWell then Sariputta you know me as the Arahant Buddha and do you know The Lord is of such virtue such is his teaching such his wisdom such his way such his liberation No LordSo Sariputta you do not have knowledge of the minds of the Buddhas of the past the future or the presentThus Sariputta have you not spoken boldly with a bulls voice and roared the lions roar of certainty with your declaration Lord the minds of the Arahant Buddhas of the past future and present are not open to me But I know the drift of the DhammaLord it is as if there were a royal frontier city with mighty bastions and a mighty encircling wall in which was a single gate at which was a gatekeeperwise skilled and clever who kept out strangers and let in those he knewAnd he constantly patrolling and following along a path might not see the joins and clefts in the bastion even such as a cat might creep throughBut whatever larger creatures entered or left the city must all go through this very gateAnd it seems to me Lord that the drift of the Dhamma is the same All those Arahant Buddhas of the past attained to supreme enlightenment by abandoning the five hindrances defilements of mind that weaken the understanding having firmly established the four foundations of mindfulness in their minds and realised the seven factors of enlightenment as they really areAll the Arahant Buddhas of the future will do likewiseand you Lord who are now the Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha have done the sameThen while staying at Nalanda in Pavarikas mango grove the Lord gave a comprehensive discourse to the monksThis is morality this is concentration this is wisdomThen the Venerable Sariputta went to the Blessed One respectfully greeted him sat down at one sideand spoke thus to him This faith Lord I have in the Blessed One that there has not been there will not be nor is there now another recluse or brahman more exalted in Enlightenment than the Blessed OneLofty indeed is this speech of yours Sariputta and lordly A bold utterance a veritable sounding of the lions roarBut how is this Sariputta Those Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of the past  do you have direct personal knowledge of all those Blessed Ones as to their virtue their meditation their wisdom their abiding and their emancipation Not so LordThen how is this Sariputta Those Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of the future  do you have direct personal knowledge of all those Blessed Ones as to their virtue their meditation their wisdom their abiding and their emancipation Not so LordThen how is this Sariputta Of me who am at present the Arahant the Fully Enlightened One do you have direct personal knowledge as to my virtue my meditation my wisdom my abiding and my emancipation Not so LordThen it is clear Sariputta that you have no such direct personal knowledge of the Arahats the Fully Enlightened Ones of the past the future and the presentHow then dare you set forth a speech so lofty and lordly an utterance so bold a veritable sounding of the lions roar saying This faith Lord I have in the Blessed One that there has not been there will not be nor is there now another recluse or brahman more exalted in Enlightenment than the Blessed One No such direct personal knowledge indeed is mine Lord of the Arahants the Fully Enlightened Ones of the past the future and the present and yet I have come to know the lawfulness of the DhammaSuppose Lord a kings frontier fortress was strongly fortified with strong ramparts and turrets and it had a single gate and there was a gatekeeper intelligent experienced and prudent who would keep out the stranger but allow the friend to enterAs he patrols the path that leads all around the fortress he does not perceive a hole or fissure in the ramparts even big enough to allow a cat to slip throughSo he comes to the conclusion Whatever grosser living things are to enter or leave this city they will all have to do so just by this gateIn the same way Lord I have come to know the lawfulness of the Dhamma For Lord all the Blessed Ones Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of the past had abandoned the five hindrances the mental defilements that weaken wisdom had well established their minds in the four foundations of mindfulness had duly cultivated the seven factors of enlightenment and were fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme EnlightenmentAnd Lord all the Blessed Ones Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of the future will abandon the five hindrances the mental defilements that weaken wisdom will well establish their minds in the four foundations of mindfulness will duly cultivate the seven factors of enlightenment and will be fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme EnlightenmentAnd the Blessed One too Lord being at present the Arahant the Fully Enlightened One has abandoned the five hindrances the mental defilements that weaken wisdom has well established his mind in the four foundations of mindfulness has duly cultivated the seven factors of enlightenment and is fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme EnlightenmentAnd also in Nalanda in the mango grove of Pavarika the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdomGreat becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conductgreat becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentrationutterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdomThen Ven Sāriputta went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there Ven Sāriputta said to the Blessed One Lord I have confidence in the Blessed One that there neither has been nor will be nor is currently found a contemplative or brahman whose direct knowledge of selfawakening is greater than that of the Blessed OneGrand is this bullstatement you have spoken Sāriputta categorical this lions roar you have roared Lord I have confidence in the Blessed One that there neither has been nor will be nor is currently found a contemplative or brahman whose direct knowledge of selfawakening is greater than that of the Blessed OneSo then Sāriputta have you encompassed with your awareness the awareness of all the worthy ones the rightly selfawakened ones that have been in the past and known Such was their virtue such their Dhamma such their discernment such their dwelling such their releaseNo lord Then have you encompassed with your awareness the awareness of all the worthy ones the rightly selfawakened ones that will be in the future and known Such will be their virtue such their Dhamma such their discernment such their dwelling such their release No lord Then have you encompassed with your awareness my awarenessthe awareness of the worthy one the rightly selfawakened one in the presentand known Such is his virtue such his Dhamma such his discernment such his dwelling such his release No lord Then Sāriputta if you dont have knowledge of the awareness of the worthy ones the rightly selfawakened ones of the past future  presenthow is it that just now you spoke this grand bullstatement and roared this categorical lions roar Lord I have confidence in the Blessed One that there neither has been nor will be nor is currently found a contemplative or brahman whose direct knowledge of selfawakening is greater than that of the Blessed OneLord I dont have knowledge of the awareness of the worthy ones the rightly selfawakened ones of the past future  present but I have known the consistency of the DhammaIts as if there were a royal frontier city with strong ramparts strong walls  arches and a single gate In it would be a wise competent  intelligent gatekeeper to keep out those he didnt know and to let in those he didWalking along the path encircling the city he wouldnt see a crack or an opening in the walls big enough for even a cat to slip throughThe thought would occur to him Whatever large creatures enter or leave the city all enter or leave it through this gate In the same way I have known the consistency of the Dhamma All those who were worthy ones the rightly selfawakened ones in the past awoke to the unexcelled right selfawakening after having abandoned the five hindrancesthose defilements of awareness that weaken discernmenthaving wellestablished their minds in the four establishings of mindfulness and having developed as they have come to be the seven factors for awakeningAll those who will be worthy ones the rightly selfawakened ones in the future will awaken to the unexcelled right selfawakening after having abandoned the five hindrancesthose defilements of awareness that weaken discernmenthaving wellestablished their minds in the four establishings of mindfulness and having developed as they have come to be the seven factors for awakeningThe Blessed One who is now the worthy one the rightly selfawakened one has awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening after having abandoned the five hindrancesthose defilements of awareness that weaken discernmenthaving wellestablished his mind in the four establishings of mindfulness and having developed as they have come to be the seven factors for awakening While staying there near Nāḷandā at the Pāvādika mango grove the Blessed One often

of great fruit great rewardThe mind nurtured with discernment is rightly released from the effluents i e  the effluent of sensuality the effluent of becoming the effluent of ignorance And having stayed at Nalanda as long as he wished the Lord said to Ananda Let us go to PataligamaAnd they did soAt Pataligama they heard say The Lord has arrived hereAnd the layfollowers of Pataligama came to the Lord saluted him sat down to one sideand said May the Lord consent to stay at our resthouseAnd the Lord consented by silenceUnderstanding his consent they rose from their seats saluted the Lord and passing him by to the right went to the resthouse and strewed the floor prepared seats provided a waterpot and filled the oillampThen they went to the Lord saluted him stood to one side and said All is ready at the resthouse Lord Now is the time to do as the Lord wishesThen the Lord dressed took his robe and bowl and went with his monks to the resthouse where he washed his feet went in and sat down facing east with his back against the central pillarAnd the monks having washed their feet went in and sat down with their backs to the west wall facing east and with the Lord sitting in front of themAnd the lay followers of Pataligama having washed their feet went in and sat down with their backs to the east wall facing west and with the Lord before themThen the Lord addressed the layfollowers of Pataligama Householders there are these five perils to one of bad morality of failure in moralityWhat are theyIn the first place he suffers great loss of property through neglecting his affairsIn the second place he gets a bad reputation for immorality and misconductIn the third place whatever assembly he approaches whether of Khattiyas Brahmins householders or ascetics he does so diffidently and shylyIn the fourth place he dies confusedIn the fifth place after death at the breaking up of the body he arises in an evil state a bad fate in suffering and hellThese are the five perils to one of bad moralityWhen the Blessed One had stayed at Nalanda as long as he pleased he addressed the Venerable Ananda thus Come Ananda let us go to PataligamaSo be it LordAnd the Blessed One

council hall is ready with the floor covered all over seats and water prepared and an oil lamp has been set out Let the Blessed One come Lord at his convenienceAnd the Blessed One got ready and taking his bowl and robe went to the council hall together with the company of bhikkhus After rinsing his feet the Blessed One entered the council hall and took his seat close to the middle pillar facing eastThe community of bhikkhus after rinsing their feet also entered the council hall and took seats near the western wall facing east so that the Blessed One was before themAnd the devotees of Pataligama after rinsing their feet and entering the council hall sat down near the eastern wall facing west so that the Blessed One was in front of themThereupon the Blessed One addressed the devotees of Pataligama thus The immoral man householders by falling away from virtue encounters five perilsgreat loss of wealth through heedlessnessan evil reputationa timid and troubled demeanor in every society be it that of nobles brahmans householders or asceticsdeath in bewildermentand at the breaking up of the body after death rebirth in a realm of misery in an unhappy state in the nether world in hellThen the Blessed One having stayed near Nāḷandā as long as he pleased said to Ven nanda Come nanda we will head for Pāṭali VillageAs you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One together with a large Saṅgha of monks went to Pāṭali VillageThe lay followers of Pāṭali Village heard The Blessed One they say has reached Pāṭali VillageSo they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they said to him Lord may the Blessed One acquiesce to the resthouse hall The Blessed One acquiesced with silenceSensing his acquiescence the lay followers of Pāṭali Village got up from their seats and bowing down to him and circumambulating him went to the resthouse hall On arrival they spread it all over with felt rugs arranged seats set out a water vessel and raised an oil lamp Then they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him stood to one sideAs they were standing there they said to him Lord the resthouse hall has been covered all over with felt rugs seats have been arranged a water vessel has been set out and an oil lamp raised May the Blessed One do what he thinks it is now time to do So the Blessed One in the evening after adjusting his lower robe and taking his bowl  outer robe went together with the Saṅgha of monks to the resthouse hall On arrival he washed his feet entered the hall and sat with his back to the central post facing eastThe Saṅgha of monks washed their feet entered the hall and sat with their backs to the western wall facing east ranged around the Blessed OneThe lay followers of Pāṭali Village washed their feet entered the hall and sat with their backs to the eastern wall facing west ranged around the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One addressed the lay followers of Pāṭali Village Householders there are these five drawbacks coming from an unvirtuous persons defect in virtueWhich fiveThere is the case where an unvirtuous person defective in virtue by reason of heedlessness undergoes the lossconfiscation of great wealthThis is the first drawback coming from an unvirtuous persons defect in virtueAnd further the bad reputation of the unvirtuous person defective in virtue gets spread aboutThis is the second drawback coming from an unvirtuous persons defect in virtueAnd further whatever assembly the unvirtuous person

defective in virtueon the breakup of the body after deathreappears in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hellThis is the fifth drawback coming from an unvirtuous persons defect in virtueThese householders are the five drawbacks coming from an unvirtuous persons defect in virtueAnd householders there are these five advantages to one of good morality and of success in moralityWhat are theyIn the first place through careful attention to his affairs he gains much wealthIn the second place he gets a good reputation for morality and good conductIn the third place whatever assembly he approaches whether of Khattiyas Brahmins householders or ascetics he does so with confidence and assuranceIn the fourth place he dies unconfusedIn the fifth place after death at the breakingup of the body he arises in a good place a heavenly worldThese are the five advantages to one of good morality and of success in moralityThen the Lord instructed inspired fired and delighted the layfollowers of Pataligama with talk on Dhamma until far into the night Then he dismissed them saying Householders the night is nearly over Now it is time for you to do as you think fitVery good Lord they said and rising and saluting the Lord they passed him by to the right and departedAnd the Lord spent the remainder of the night in the resthouse left empty by their departureFive blessings householders accrue to the righteous man through his practice of virtue great increase of wealth through his diligencea favorable reputationa confident deportment without timidity in every society be it that of nobles brahmans householders or asceticsa serene deathand at the breaking up of the body after death rebirth in a happy state in a heavenly worldAnd the Blessed One spent much of the night instructing the devotees of Pataligama in the Dhamma rousing edifying and gladdening them after which he dismissed them saying The night is far advanced householders You may go at your convenienceSo be it Lord And the devotees of Pataligama rose from their seats respectfully saluted the Blessed One and keeping their right sides towards him departedAnd the Blessed One soon after their departure retired into privacyHouseholders there are these five rewards coming from a virtuous persons consummation in virtueWhich fiveThere is the case where a virtuous person consummate in virtue by reason of heedfulness acquires a great mass of wealthThis is the first reward coming from a virtuous persons consummation in virtueAnd further the fine reputation of the virtuous person consummate in virtue gets spread aboutThis is the second reward coming from a virtuous persons consummation in virtueAnd further whatever assembly the virtuous person consummate in virtue approacheswhether of noble warriors brahmans householders or contemplativesheshe does so with confidence  unabashedThis is the third reward coming from a virtuous persons consummation in virtueAnd further the virtuous person consummate in virtue dies unconfusedThis is the fourth reward coming from a virtuous persons consummation in virtueAnd further the virtuous person consummate in virtueon the breakup of the body after deathreappears in a good destination a heavenly worldThis is the fifth reward coming from a virtuous persons consummation in virtueThese householders are the five rewards coming from a virtuous persons consummation in virtue Then the Blessed Onehaving instructed urged roused  encouraged the lay followers of Pāṭali Village for a large part of the night with Dhamma talkdismissed them saying The night is far gone householders Do what you think it is now time to doResponding As you say lord to the Blessed One the lay followers of Pāṭali Village got up from their seats and bowing down to him and circumambulating him leftThen the Blessed One not long after they had left entered an empty buildingNow at this time Sunidha and Vassakara the Maga dhan ministers were building a fortress in Pataligama as a defence against the VajjiansAnd at that time a multitude of thousands of devas were taking up lodging in PataligamaAnd in the parts where powerful devas settled they caused the minds of the most powerful royal officials to pick those sites for their dwellingsand where middle and lowerranking devas settled so too they caused the minds of royal officials of corresponding grade to pick those sites for their dwellingsAnd the Lord with his divine eye surpassing that of humans saw the thousands of devas taking up residence in PataligamaAnd getting up at break of day he said to the Venerable Ananda Ananda who is building a fortress at Pataligama Lord Sunidha and Vassakara the Magadhan ministers are building a fortress against the VajjiansAnanda just as if they had taken counsel with the ThirtyThree Gods Sunidha and Vassakara are building a fortress at PataligamaI have seen with my divine eye how thousands of devas were taking up lodging there Ananda as far as the Ariyan realm extends as far as its trade extends this will be the chief city Pataliputta scattering its seeds far and wideAnd Pataliputta will face three perils from fire from water and from internal dissensionThen Sunidha and Vassakara called on the Lord and having exchanged courtesies stood to one side and said May the Reverend Gotama accept a meal from us tomorrow with his order of monksAnd the Lord consented by silenceUnderstanding his consent Sunidha and Vassakara went home and there had a fine meal of hard and soft food prepared When it was ready they reported to the Lord Reverend Gotama the meal is readyThen the Lord having dressed in the morning took his robe and bowl went with the order of monks to the residence of Sunidha and Vassakara and sat down on the prepared seatThen Sunidha and Vassakara served the Buddha and his order of monks with choice soft and hard foods till they were satisfiedAnd when the Lord took his hand away from the bowl they sat down on low stools to one sideAnd as they sat there the Lord thanked them with these versesIn whatever realm the wise man makes his homeHe should feed the virtuous leaders of the holy lifeWhatever devas there are who report this offeringThey will pay him respect and honour for thisThey tremble for him as a mother for her sonAnd he for whom devas tremble ever happy isThen the Lord rose from his seat and took his departureSunidha and Vassakara followed closely behind the Lord saying Whichever gate the ascetic Gotama goes out by today that shall be called the Gotama gateand whichever ford he uses to cross the Ganges that shall be called the Gotama fordAnd so the gate by which the Lord went out was called the Gotama GateAnd then the Lord came to the River GangesAnd just then the river was so full that a crow could drink out of itAnd some people were looking for a boat and some were looking for a raft and some were binding together a raft of reeds to get to the other sideBut the Lord as swiftly as a strong man might stretch out his flexed arm or flex it again vanished from this side of the Ganges and reappeared with his order of monks on the other shoreAnd the Lord saw those people who were looking for a boat looking for a raft and binding together a raft of reeds to get to the other sideAnd seeing their intentions he uttered this verse on the spotWhen they want to cross the sea the lake or pondPeople make a bridge or raft  the wise have crossed alreadyEnd of first recitationsectionAt that time Sunidha and Vassakara the chief ministers of Magadha were building a fortress at Pataligama in defense against the VajjisAnd deities in large numbers counted in thousands had taken possession of sites at PataligamaIn the region where deities of great power prevailed officials of great power were bent on constructing edificesand where deities of medium powerand lesser power prevailed officials of medium and lesser power were bent on constructing edificesAnd the Blessed One saw with the heavenly eye pure and transcending the faculty of men the deities counted in thousands where they had taken possession of sites in PataligamaAnd rising before the night was spent towards dawn the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda thus Who is it Ananda that is erecting a city at PataligamaSunidha and Vassakara Lord the chief ministers of Magadha are building a fortress at Pataligama in defence against the VajjisIt is Ananda as if Sunidha and Vassakara had taken counsel with the gods of the ThirtythreeFor I beheld Ananda with the heavenly eye pure and transcending the faculty of men a large number of deities counted in thousands that have taken possession of sites at PataligamaIn the region where deities of great power prevail officials of great power are bent on constructing edificesand where deities of mediumand lesser power prevail officials of medium and lesser power are bent on constructing edificesTruly Ananda as far as the Aryan race extends and trade routes spread this will be the foremost city Pataliputta a tradecenterBut Pataliputta Ananda will be assailed by three perils  fire water and dissensionThen Sunidha and Vassakara went to the Blessed One and after courteous greeting to the Blessed One and exchanging many pleasant words they stood at one side and addressed him thus May the Venerable Gotama please accept our invitation for tomorrows meal together with the community of bhikkhusAnd the Blessed One consented by his silenceKnowing the Blessed Ones consent Sunidha and Vassakara departed for their own abodes where they had choice food hard and soft prepared And when it was time they announced to the Blessed One It is time Venerable Gotama the meal is readyThereupon the Blessed One got ready in the forenoon and taking bowl and robe he went together with the community of bhikkhus to the abode of Sunidha and Vassakara where he took the seat prepared for himAnd Sunidha and Vassakara themselves attended on the community of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha and served them with choice food hard and softWhen the Blessed One had finished his meal and had removed his hand from the bowl they took low seats and sat down at one sideAnd the Blessed One thanked them with these stanzasWherever he may dwell the prudent manMinisters to the chaste and virtuousAnd having to these worthy ones made gifts He shares his merits with the local devasAnd so revered they honor him in turnAre gracious to him even as a mother Is towards her own her only sonAnd he who thus enjoys the devas grace And is by them beloved good fortune seesAfter this the Blessed One rose from his seat and departedThen Sunidha and Vassakara followed behind the Blessed One step by step saying Through whichever gate the recluse Gotama will depart today that we will name the Gotamagateand the ford by which he will cross the river Ganges shall be named the GotamafordAnd so it came to pass where the gate was concernedBut when the Blessed One came to the river Gangesit was full to the brim so that crows could drink from itAnd some people went in search of a boat or float while others tied up a raft because they desired to get acrossBut the Blessed One as quickly as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or draw in his outstretched arm vanished from this side of the river Ganges and came to stand on the yonder sideAnd the Blessed One saw the people who desired to cross searching for a boat or float while others were binding raftsAnd then the Blessed One seeing them thus gave forth the solemn utteranceThey who have bridged the ocean vast Leaving the lowlands far behindWhile others still their frail rafts bind Are saved by wisdom unsurpassedNow on that occasion Sunidha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha were building a city at Pāṭali Village to preempt the VajjiansAnd on that occasion many devas by the thousands were occupying sites in Pāṭali VillageIn the area where devas of great influence occupied sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of great influence were inclined to build their homesIn the area where devas of middling influence occupied sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of middling influence were inclined to build their homesIn the area where devas of low influence occupied sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of low influence were inclined to build their homesThe Blessed One with the divine eyepurified and surpassing the humansaw those devas by the thousands occupying sites in Pāṭali VillageThen getting up in the last watch of the night the Blessed One addressed Ven nanda nanda who is building a city at Pāṭali Village Sunidha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha lord are building a city at Pāṭali Village to preempt the Vajjians nanda its as if they had consulted the Devas of the Thirtythree Thats how Sunidha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha are building a city at Pāṭali Village to preempt the VajjiansJust now nandawith the divine eyepurified and surpassing the humanI saw many devas by the thousands occupying sites in Pāṭali VillageIn the area where devas of great influence occupy sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of great influence are inclined to build their homesIn the area where devas of middling influence occupy sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of middling influence are inclined to build their homesIn the area where devas of low influence occupy sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of low influence are inclined to build their homesnanda as far as the sphere of the Ariyans extends as far as merchants roads extend this will be the supreme city Pāṭaliputta where the seedpods of the Pāṭali plant break openThere will be three dangers for Pāṭaliputta from fire from water or from the breaking of alliances Then Sunidha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies they stood to one side As they were standing there they said to him May Master Gotama acquiesce to our meal today together with the Saṅgha of monksThe Blessed One acquiesced with silenceThen Sunidha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha understanding the Blessed Ones acquiescence went to their resthouse On arrival after having exquisite staple  nonstaple food prepared in their resthouse they announced the time to the Blessed One Its time Master Gotama The meal is ready Then the Blessed One early in the morning adjusted his lower robe andtaking his bowl  outer robewent together with the Saṅgha of monks to the resthouse of Sunidha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha On arrival he sat down on the seat laid outSunidha  Vassakāra with their own hands served  satisfied the Saṅgha of monks with the Buddha at its head with exquisite staple  nonstaple foodThen when the Blessed One had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl Sunidha  Vassakāra taking a low seat sat to one sideAs they were sitting there the Blessed One gave his approval with these versesIn whatever place a wise person makes his dwellingthere providing food for the virtuous the restrained leaders of the holy lifehe should dedicate that offering to the devas thereThey receiving honor will honor him being respected will show him respectAs a result they will feel sympathy for him like that of a mother for her child her sonA person with whom the devas sympathize always meets with auspicious thingsThen the Blessed One having given his approval to Sunidha  Vassakāra with these verses got up from his seat and leftAnd on that occasion Sunidha  Vassakāra followed right after the Blessed One By whichever gate Gotama the contemplative departs today that will be called the Gotama GateAnd by whichever ford he crosses over the Ganges River that will be called the Gotama Ford So the gate by which the Blessed One departed was called the Gotama GateThen he went to the Ganges RiverNow on that occasion the Ganges River was full up to the banks so that a crow could drink from itSome people were searching for boats some were searching for floats some were binding rafts in hopes of going from this shore to the otherSo the Blessed Onejust as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended armdisappeared from the near bank of the Ganges River and reappeared on the far bank together with the Saṅgha of monksHe saw that some people were searching for boats some were searching for floats some were binding rafts in hopes of going from this shore to the otherThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedThose who cross the foaming flood having made a bridge avoiding the swampswhile people are binding rafts intelligent people have already crossed The Lord said to Ananda Let us go to KotigamaVery good Lord said Anandaand the Lord went with a large company of monks to Kotigamaand stayed thereThen the Lord addressed the monks thusMonks it is through not understanding not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that I as well as you have for a long time run on and gone round the cycle of birthanddeathWhat are theyBy not understanding the Noble Truth of Suffering we have fared onby not understanding the Noble Truth of the Origin of Sufferingof the Cessation of Sufferingand of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering we have fared on round the cycle of birthanddeathAnd by the understanding the penetration of the same Noble Truth of Suffering of the Origin of Suffering of the Cessation of Suffering and of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering the craving for becoming has been cut off the support of becoming has been destroyed there is no more rebecomingThe Lord having said thisthe WellFarer having spoken the Teacher saidNot seeing the Four Noble Truths as they areHaving long traversed the round from life to lifeThese being seen becomings supports pulled upSorrows root cut off rebirth is doneThen the Lord while staying at Kotigama gave a comprehensive discourse This is morality this is concentration this is wisdomConcentration when imbued with morality brings great fruit and profitWisdom when imbued with concentration brings great fruit and profitThe mind imbued with wisdom becomes completely free from the corruptions that is from the corruption of sensuality of becoming of false views and of ignoranceNow the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to KotigamaSo be it LordAnd the Blessed One took up his abode at Kotigama together with a large community of bhikkhusAnd the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus sayingBhikkhus it is through not realizing through not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that this long course of birth and death has been passed through and undergone by me as well as by youWhat are these fourThey are the noble truth of sufferingthe noble truth of the origin of sufferingthe noble truth of the cessation of sufferingand the noble truth of the way to the cessation of sufferingBut now bhikkhus that these have been realized and penetrated cut off is the craving for existence destroyed is that which leads to renewed becoming and there is no fresh becomingThus it was said by the Blessed OneAnd the Happy One the Master further saidThrough not seeing the Four Noble TruthsLong was the weary path from birth to birthWhen these are known removed is rebirths causeThe root of sorrow plucked then ends rebirthAnd also at Kotigama the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdomGreat becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conductgreat becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentrationutterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdomThen the Blessed One said to Ven nanda Come nanda we will head for Koṭi VillageAs you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One together with a large Saṅgha of monks went to Koṭi VillageThere he stayed near Koṭi VillageAnd there he addressed the monksIts through not awakening to or penetrating four noble truths monks that we have transmigrated and wandered on for

becoming is removedcrushed is the root of suffering  stress There is now no furtherbecomingWhile staying there near Koṭi Village the Blessed One often gave this Dhamma talk to the monks Such is virtue such is concentration such is discernmentConcentration nurtured with virtue is of great fruit great rewardDiscernment nurtured with concentration is of great fruit great rewardThe mind nurtured with discernment is rightly released from the effluents i e  the effluent of sensuality the effluent of becoming the effluent of ignorance When the Lord had stayed at Kotigama as long as he wished he said

Blessed One had stayed at Kotigama as long as he pleased he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to NadikaSo be it LordAnd the Blessed One took up his abode in Nadika together with a large community of bhikkhusstaying in the Brick HouseThen the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One and after greeting him respectfully sat down at one sideAnd he said to the Blessed One

through the complete destruction of the three fetters have become streamenterers and are safe from falling into the states of misery assured and bound for EnlightenmentThen the Blessed One having stayed near Koṭi Village as long as he pleased said to Ven nanda Come nanda we will head for NādikāAs you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One together with a large Saṅgha of monks went to NādikāThere he stayed near Nādikā at the Brick HallThen Ven nanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there Ven

died in Nādikā with the ending of the first three fetters are streamwinners never again destined for states of destitution certain headed for selfawakeningAnanda it is not remarkable that that which has come to be as a man should dieBut that you should come to the Tathagata to ask the fate of each of those who have died that is a weariness to himTherefore Ananda I will teach you a way of knowing Dhamma called the Mirror of Dhamma whereby the Ariyan disciple if he so wishes can discern of himself I have destroyed hell animalrebirth the realm of ghosts all downfall evil fates and sorry states I am a Stream Winner incapable of falling into states of woe certain of attaining NibbanaAnd what is this Mirror of Dhamma by which he can know thisHere Ananda this Ariyan disciple is possessed of unwavering confidence in the Buddha thus This Blessed Lord is an Arahant a fullyenlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct the WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans enlightened and blessedHe is possessed of unwavering faith in the Dhamma thus Wellproclaimed by the Lord is the Dhamma visible here and now timeless inviting inspection leading onward to be comprehended by the wise each one for himselfHe is possessed of unwavering confidence in the Sangha thus Welldirected is the Sangha of the Lords disciples of upright conduct on the right path on the perfect path that is to say the four pairs of persons the eight kinds of humans The Sangha of the Lords disciples is worthy of offerings worthy of hospitality worthy of gifts worthy of veneration an unsurpassed field of merit in the worldAnd he is possessed of morality dear to the Noble Ones unbroken without defect unspotted without inconsistency liberating uncorrupted and conducive to concentrationThis Ananda is the Mirror of Dhamma whereby the Aryan disciple can discern of himself I have destroyed hell I am a StreamWinner certain of attaining NibbanaThen the Lord staying at Nadika in the Brick House gave a comprehensive discourse to the monksThis is morality this is concentration this is wisdomAnd when the Lord had stayed at Nadika as long as he wishedhe went with a large company of monks to Vesallwhere he stayed at Ambapalis groveAnd there the Lord addressed the monks Monks a monk should be mindful and clearly aware this is our charge to youAnd how is a monk mindfulHere a monk abides contemplating the body as body earnestly clearly aware mindful and having put away all hankering and fretting for the worldand likewise with regard to feelings mind and mindobjectsThat is how a monk is mindfulAnd how is a monk clearly awareHere a monk when going forward or backward is aware of what he is doing in looking forward or back he is aware of what he is doing in bending and stretching he is aware of what he is doing in carrying his inner and outer robe and bowl he is aware of what he is doing in eating drinking chewing and savouring he is aware of what he is doing in passing excrement or urine he is aware of what he is doing in walking standing sitting or lying down in keeping awake in speaking or in staying silent he is aware of what he is doingThat is how a monk is clearly awareA monk should be mindful and clearly aware this is our charge to youBut truly Ananda it is nothing strange that human beings should dieBut if each time it happens you should come to the Tathagata and ask about them in this manner indeed it would be troublesome to himTherefore Ananda I will give you the teaching called the Mirror of the Dhamma possessing which the noble disciple should he so desire can declare of himself There is no more rebirth for me in hell nor as an animal or ghost nor in any realm of woe A streamenterer am I safe from falling into the states of misery assured am I and bound for EnlightenmentAnd what Ananda is that teaching called the Mirror of Dhamma possessing which the noble disciple may thus declare of himselfIn this case Ananda the noble disciple possesses unwavering faith in the Buddha thus The Blessed One is an Arahant the Fully Enlightened One perfect in knowledge and conduct the Happy One the knower of the world the paramount trainer of beings the teacher of gods and men the Enlightened One the Blessed OneHe possesses unwavering faith in the Dhamma thus Well propounded by the Blessed One is the Dhamma evident timeless inviting investigation leading to emancipation to be comprehended by the wise each for himselfHe possesses unwavering faith in the Blessed Ones Order of Disciples thus Well faring is the Blessed Ones Order of Disciples righteously wisely and dutifully that is to say the four pairs of men the eight classes of persons The Blessed Ones Order of Disciples is worthy of honor of hospitality of offerings of veneration  the supreme field for meritorious deeds in the worldAnd he possesses virtues that are dear to the Noble Ones complete and perfect spotless and pure which are liberating praised by the wise uninfluenced  and favorable to concentration of mindThis Ananda is the teaching called the Mirror of the Dhamma whereby the noble disciple may thus know of himself There

white clothes and white adornmentAnd Ambapali met the young Licchavis axle to axle wheel to wheel yoke to yokeAnd they said to her Ambapali why do you drive up against us like that Because young sirs the Blessed Lord has been invited by me for a meal with his order of monksAmbapali give up this meal for a hundred thousand piecesYoung sirs if you were to give me all Vesall with its revenues I would not give up such an important mealThen the Licchavis snapped their fingers saying Weve been beaten by the mangowoman weve been cheated by the mangowomanAnd they set out for Ambapalls groveAnd the Lord having seen the Licchavis from afarsaid Monks any of you who have not seen the ThirtyThree Gods just look at this troop of Licchavis Take a good look at them and you will get an idea of the ThirtyThree GodsThen the Licchavis drove in their carriages as far as the ground would allow then they alighted and went on foot to where the Lord was saluted him and sat down to one sideAnd as they

the Blessed One saying May the Blessed One O Lord please accept my invitation for tomorrows meal together with the community of bhikkhusAnd by his silence the Blessed One consentedSure then of the Blessed Ones consent Ambapali the courtesan rose from her seat respectfully saluted him and keeping her right side towards him took her departureThen the Licchavi of Vesali came to know The Blessed One they say has arrived at Vesali and is now staying in Ambapalis groveAnd they ordered a large number of magnificent carriages to be made ready each mounted one and accompanied by the rest drove out from VesaliNow of these Licchavis some were in blue with clothing and ornaments all of blue while others were in yellow red and whiteAnd it so happened that Ambapali the courtesan drove up against the young Licchavis axle by axle wheel by wheel and yoke by yokeThereupon the Licchavis exclaimed Why do you drive up against us in this fashion Ambapali Thus it is indeed my princes and not otherwise For the Blessed One is invited by me for tomorrows meal together with the community of bhikkhusGive up the meal Ambapali for a hundred thousandBut she replied Even if you were to give me Vesali sirs together with its tributary lands I would not give up a meal of such importanceThen the Licchavis snapped their fingers in annoyance See friends We are defeated by this mango lass We are utterly outdone by this mango lassBut they continued on their way to Ambapalis groveAnd the Blessed One beheld the Licchavis from afar as they drove upThen he spoke to the bhikkhus saying Those of you bhikkhus who have not yet seen the Thirtythree gods may behold the assembly of the Licchavis and may gaze on them for they are comparable to the assembly of the Thirtythree godsThen the Licchavis

saluted him and keeping their right sides towards him took their departureThen after the night had passed Ambapali the courtesan had choice food hard and soft prepared in her park and announced it to the Blessed One It is time O Lord the meal is readyThereupon the Blessed One got ready in the forenoon and taking bowl and robe he went together with the community of bhikkhus to Ambapalis dwelling and there he took the seat prepared for himAnd Ambapali herself attended on the community of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha and served them with choice food hard and softAnd when the Blessed One had

of bhikkhus headed by the BuddhaAnd the Blessed One accepted the parkHe then instructed Ambapali in the Dhamma and having roused edified and gladdened her he rose from his seat and departedAnd also at Vesali in Ambapalis grove the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdomGreat becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conductgreat becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentrationutterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdomThen Ambapālī the courtesan heard The Blessed One they say has arrived at Vesālī and is staying near Vesālī in my mango amba groveThen having auspicious vehicles yoked she got into an auspicious vehicle left Vesālī with the auspicious vehiclesand drove toward her own garden the groveGoing in her vehicle as far as there was ground for a vehicle getting down from her vehicle she approached the Blessed One on foot On arrival having bowed down to him she sat to one sideAs she was sitting there the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged her with a talk on DhammaThen Ambapālī the courtesaninstructed urged roused  encouraged with the Blessed Ones talk on Dhammasaid to him Lord may the Blessed One acquiesce to my meal tomorrow together with the Saṅgha of monks The Blessed One acquiesced with silenceThen Ambapālī the courtesan understanding the Blessed Ones acquiescence got up from her seat and bowing down to him and circumambulating him leftThen the Licchavis of Vesālī heard The Blessed One they say has arrived at Vesālī and is staying near Vesālī in Ambapālīs groveThen having auspicious vehicles yoked the Licchavis got into the auspicious vehicles and left Vesālī with the auspicious vehiclesNow some of those Licchavis were dark blue with dark blue complexions dark blue clothing  dark blue ornaments Some of those Licchavis were yellow with yellow complexions yellow clothing  yellow ornaments Some of those Licchavis were red with red complexions red clothing  red ornaments Some of those Licchavis were white with white complexions white clothing  white ornamentsThen Ambapālī the courtesan driving axle to axle wheel to wheel yoke to yoke brought those young Licchavis to a haltSo those Licchavis said to her Hey Ambapālī what are you doingdriving axle to axle wheel to wheel yoke to yokebringing the young Licchavis to a halt Because young masters I have invited the Blessed One together with the Saṅgha of monks for tomorrows mealGive us that meal Ambapālī for Even if the masters gave me Vesālī with all its revenue I still wouldnt give up such a great mealThen the Licchavis snapped their fingers How weve been defeated by Little Ambapālī How weve been cheated by Little AmbapālīThen the Licchavis set out for Ambapālīs groveThe Blessed One saw them coming from afarand on seeing them he said to the monks Those monks who have never before seen the Devas of the Thirtythree look at the assembly of Licchavis Gaze at the assembly of Licchavis Regard the assembly of Licchavis as like the assembly of the ThirtythreeThen the Licchavis going in their vehicles as far as there was ground for vehicles got down from their vehicles and approached the Blessed One on foot On arrival having bowed down to him they sat to one sideAs they were sitting there the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged them with a talk on DhammaThen the Licchavisinstructed urged roused and encouraged with the Blessed Ones talk on Dhammasaid to him Lord may the Blessed One acquiesce to our meal tomorrow together with the Saṅgha of monks Licchavis I have already acquiesced to Ambapālī the courtesans meal tomorrow Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers How weve been defeated by Little Ambapālī How weve been cheated by Little AmbapālīThen the Licchavis delighting in and approving of the Blessed Ones words got up from their seats and bowing down to him and circumambulating him leftThen Ambapālī the courtesan at the end of the nightafter having exquisite staple  nonstaple food prepared in her own gardenannounced the time to the Blessed One Its time lord The meal is ready Then the Blessed One early in the morning adjusted his lower robe andtaking his bowl  outer robewent together with the Saṅgha of monks to Ambapālī the courtesans meal offering On arrival he sat down on the seat laid outAmbapālī the courtesan with her own hands served  satisfied the Saṅgha of monks with the Buddha at its head with exquisite staple  nonstaple foodThen when the Blessed One had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl Ambapālī the courtesan taking a low seat sat to one sideAs she was sitting there she said to the Blessed One Lord I give this garden to the Saṅgha of monks with the Buddha at its head The the Blessed One accepted the gardenThenhaving instructed urged roused  encouraged Ambapālī the courtesan with a talk on Dhammagot up from his seat and leftWhile staying there near Vesālī in Ambapālīs grove the Blessed One often gave this Dhamma talk to the monks Such is virtue such is concentration such is discernmentConcentration nurtured with virtue is of great fruit great rewardDiscernment nurtured with concentration is of great fruit great rewardThe mind nurtured with discernment is rightly released from the effluents i e  the effluent of sensuality the effluent of becoming the effluent of ignorance And when the Lord had stayed at Ambapalls grove as long as he wishedhe went with a large company of monks to the little village of Beluvawhere he stayedThere the Lord said to the monks You monks should go to anywhere in Vesall where you have friends or acquaintances or supporters and spend the Rains thereI shall spend the Rains here in BeluvaVery good Lord replied the monks and they did sobut the Lord spent the Rains in BeluvaAnd during the Rains the Lord was attacked by a severe sickness witlj sharp pains as if he were about to dieBut he endured all this mindfully clearly aware and without complainingHe thought It is not fitting that I should attain final Nibbana without addressing my followers and taking leave of the order of monksI must hold this disease in check by energy and apply myself to the force of lifeHe did soand the disease abatedThen the Lord having recovered from his sickness as soon as he felt better went outside and sat on a prepared seat in front of his dwellingThen the Venerable Ananda came to him saluted him sat down to one side and said Lord I have seen the Lord in comfort and I have seen the Lords patient enduring And Lord my body was like a drunkardsI lost my bearings and things were unclear to me because of the Lords sickness The only thing that was some comfort to me was the thought The Lord will not attain final Nibbana until he has made some statement about the order of monksBut Ananda what does the order of monks expect of meI have taught the Dhamma Ananda making no inner and outerthe Tathagata has no teachers fist in respect of doctrinesIf there is anyone who thinks I shall take charge of the order or The order should refer to me let him make some statement about the orderbut the Tathagata does not think in such termsSo why should the Tathagata make a statement about the orderAnanda I am now old worn out venerable one who has traversed lifes path I have reached the term of lifewhich is eightyJust as an old cart is made to go by being held together with straps so the Tathagatas body is kept going by being strapped upIt is only when the Tathagata withdraws his attention from outward signs and by the cessation of certain feelings enters into the signless concentration of mind that his body knows comfortTherefore Ananda you should live as islands unto yourselves being your own refuge with no on else as your refuge with the Dhamma as an island with the Dhamma as your refuge with no other refugeAnd how does a monk live as an island unto himself with no other refugeHere Ananda a monk abides contemplating the body as body earnestly clearly aware mindful and having put away all hankering and fretting for the world and likewise with regard to feelings mind and mindobjectsThat Ananda is how a monk lives as an island unto himself with no other refugeAnd those who now in my time or afterwards live thus they will become the highest if they are desirous of learningEnd of second recitationsectionWhen the Blessed One had stayed in Ambapalis grove as long as he pleased he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to the village of BeluvaSo be it LordAnd the Blessed One took up his abode in the village of Beluva together with a large community of bhikkhusAt that time the Blessed One spoke to the bhikkhus saying Go now bhikkhus and seek shelter anywhere in the neighborhood of Vesali where you are welcome among acquaintances and friends and there spend the rainy seasonAs for me I shall spend the rainy season in this very place in the village of BeluvaSo be it O Lord the bhikkhus saidBut when the Blessed One had entered upon the rainy season there arose in him a severe illness and sharp and deadly pains came upon himAnd the Blessed One endured them mindfully clearly comprehending and unperturbedThen it occurred to the Blessed One It would not be fitting if I came to my final passing away without addressing those who attended on me without taking leave of the community of bhikkhusThen let me suppress this illness by strength of will resolve to maintain the life process and live onAnd the Blessed One suppressed the illness by strength of will resolved to maintain the life process and lived onSo it came about that the Blessed Ones illness was allayedAnd the Blessed One recovered from that illness and soon after his recovery he came out from his dwelling place and sat down in the shade of the building on a seat prepared for himThen the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One respectfully greeted him and sitting down at one side he spoke to the Blessed Onesaying Fortunate it is for me O Lord to see the Blessed One at ease again Fortunate it is for me O Lord to see the Blessed One recovered For truly Lord when I saw the Blessed Ones sickness it was as though my own body became weak as a creeperevery thing around became dim to me and my senses failed me Yet Lord I still had some little comfort in the thought that the Blessed One would not come to his final passing away until he had given some last instructions respecting the community of bhikkhusThus spoke the Venerable Ananda but the Blessed One answered him saying What more does the community of bhikkhus expect from me AnandaI have set forth the Dhamma without making any distinction of esoteric and exoteric doctrinethere is nothing Ananda with regard to the teachings that the Tathagata holds to the last with the closed fist of a teacher who keeps some things backWhosoever may think that it is he who should lead the community of bhikkhus or that the community depends upon him it is such a one that would have to give last instructions respecting themBut Ananda the Tathagata has no such idea as that it is he who should lead the community of bhikkhus or that the community depends upon himSo what instructions should he have to give respecting the community of bhikkhusNow I am frail Ananda old aged far gone in years and my life is spentThis is my eightieth yearEven as an old cart Ananda is held together with much difficulty so the body of the Tathagata is kept going only with supportsIt is Ananda only when the Tathagata disregarding external objects with the cessation of certain feelings attains to and abides in the signless concentration of mind that his body is more comfortableTherefore Ananda be islands unto yourselves refuges unto yourselves seeking no external refuge with the Dhamma as your island the Dhamma as your refuge seeking no other refugeAnd how Ananda is a bhikkhu an island unto himself a refuge unto himself seeking no external refuge with the Dhamma as his island the Dhamma as his refuge seeking no other refugeWhen he dwells contemplating the body in the body earnestly clearly comprehending and mindfully after having overcome desire and sorrow in regard to the worldwhen he dwells contemplating feelings in feelings the mind in the mind and mental objects in mental objects earnestly clearly comprehending and mindfully after having overcome desire and sorrow in regard to the worldthen truly he is an island unto himself a refuge unto himself seeking no external refuge having the Dhamma as his island the Dhamma as his refuge seeking no other refugeThose bhikkhus of mine Ananda who now or after I am gone abide as an island unto themselves as a refuge unto themselves seeking no other refuge having the Dhamma as their island and refuge seeking no other refuge it is they who will become the highest if they have the desire to learnThen the Blessed One having stayed in Ambapālīs grove as long as he pleased said to Ven nanda Come nanda we will head for Veḷuva VillageAs you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One together with a large Saṅgha of monks went to Veḷuva VillageThere he stayed near Veḷuva VillageAnd there he addressed the monks Come monks enter the Rains retreat around Vesālī with your friends acquaintances  eating companionsAs for me I will enter the Rains retreat right here near Veḷuva VillageResponding As you say lord to the Blessed One the monks entered the Rains retreat around Vesālī with their friends acquaintances  eating companionsThe Blessed One entered the Rains retreat right there near Veḷuva VillageThen in the Blessed One when he had entered the Rains retreat there arose a severe disease with intense pains  deadlyBut the Blessed One endured itmindful alert  not struck down by itThe thought occurred to him It would not be proper for me to totally unbind without having addressed my attendants or taken leave of the Saṅgha of monksWhy dont I bending back this disease with persistence keep determining the fabrications of life So the Blessed One bending back the disease with persistence kept determining the fabrications of lifeAnd his disease calmed downThen the Blessed Onehaving recovered from being ill not long recovered from the illnesswent out of the dwelling and sat down on a seat laid out behind the dwellingThen Ven nanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One What a happy sight to see the Blessed Ones comfort What a happy sight to see the Blessed Ones being at ease Because of the Blessed Ones illness my own body felt as if it were druggedI lost my bearings Things were unclear to me Yet I still took a measure of reassurance in the thought that the Blessed One would not totally unbind as long as he hadnt given at least some pronouncement concerning the Saṅgha of monks What more does the Saṅgha of monks want from me nandaI have taught the Dhamma without making an inside or outside The Tathāgata has no closed fist with regard to teachingsTo whomever the thought occurs I will govern the Saṅgha of monks or The Saṅgha of monks looks to me he should give some pronouncement concerning the Saṅgha of monksBut the thought doesnt occur to the Tathāgata that I will govern the Saṅgha of monks or The Saṅgha of monks looks to me So why should he give some pronouncement concerning the Saṅgha of monksI am now aged nanda old elderly advanced in years having come to the last stage of life  years oldJust as an old cart is kept going with the help of bamboo strips the Tathāgatas body is kept going with the help of bamboo strips as it wereWhen the Tathāgatanot attending to any theme at all and with the cessation of certain feelingsenters  remains in the themeless concentration of awareness that is when his body is more at easeSo nanda you should all live with yourselves as your island yourselves as your refuge with no other as your refuge with the Dhamma as your island the Dhamma as your refuge with no other as your refugeAnd how does a monk live with himself as his island himself as his refuge with no other as his refuge with the Dhamma as his island the Dhamma as his refuge with no other as his refugeThere is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itselfardent alert  mindfulsubduing greed  distress with reference to the worldHe remains focused on feelings in  of themselves mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselvesardent alert  mindfulsubduing greed  distress with reference to the worldThis is how a monk lives with himself as his island himself as his refuge with no other as his refuge with the Dhamma as his island the Dhamma as his refuge with no other as his refugeFor those who now or when I am gone live with themselves as their island themselves as their refuge with no other as their refuge with the Dhamma as their island the Dhamma as their refuge not with another as their refuge will be my foremost monks those who are desirous of training Then the Lord rising early dressed took his robe and bowl and entered Vesall for almsHaving eaten on his return from the almsround he said to the Venerable Ananda Bring a mat Ananda We will go to the Capala Shrine for the siestaVery good Lord said Ananda and getting a mat he followed behindThen the Lord came to the Capala Shrine and sat down on the prepared seatAnanda saluted the Lord and sat down to one sideand the Lord said Ananda Vesali is delightful the Udena Shrine is delightful the Gotamaka Shrine is delightful the Sattambaka Shrine is delightful the Bahuputta Shrine is delightful the Capala Shrine is delightfulAnanda whoever has developed the four roads to power practised them frequently made them his vehicle made them his base established them become familiar with them and properly undertaken them could undoubtedly live for a century or the remainder of oneThe Tathagata has developed these powers   properly undertaken them And he could Ananda undoubtedly live for a century or the remainder of oneBut the Venerable Ananda failing to grasp this broad hint this clear sign did not beg the Lord Lord may the Blessed Lord stay for a century may the WellFarer stay for a century for the benefit and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit and happiness of devas and humans so much was his mind possessed by Mara And a second time and a third timeThen the Lord said Ananda go now and do what seems fitting to youVery good Lord said Ananda and rising from his seat he saluted the Lord passed by on the right and sat down under a tree some distance awayThen the Blessed One getting ready in the forenoon took bowl and robe and went into Vesali for almsAfter the alms round and meal on his return he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Take up a mat Ananda and let us spend the day at the Capala shrineSo be it Lord And the Venerable Ananda took up a mat and followed behind the Blessed One step by stepAnd the Blessed One went to the Capala shrine and sat down on the seat prepared for himAnd when the Venerable Ananda had seated himself at one side after he had respectfully saluted the Blessed Onethe Lord said to him Pleasant Ananda is Vesali pleasant are the shrines of Udena Gotamaka Sattambaka Bahuputta Sarandada and CapalaAnd the Blessed One said Whosoever Ananda has developed practiced employed strengthened maintained scrutinized and brought to perfection the four constituents of psychic power could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of itThe Tathagata Ananda has done so Therefore the Tathagata could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of itBut the Venerable Ananda was unable to grasp the plain suggestion the significant prompting given by the Blessed One As though his mind was influenced by Mara he did not beseech the Blessed One May the Blessed One remain O Lord May the Happy One remain O Lord throughout the worldperiod for the welfare and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit well being and happiness of gods and menAnd when for a second and a third time the Blessed One repeated his words the Venerable Ananda remained silentThen the Blessed One said to the Venerable Ananda Go now Ananda and do as seems fit to youEven so O Lord And the Venerable Ananda rising from his seat respectfully saluted the Blessed One and keeping his right side towards him took his seat under a tree some distance awayThen the Blessed One early in the morning adjusted his lower robe andtaking his bowl  outer robewent into Vesālī for almsThen having gone for alms in Vesālī after the meal returning from his alms round he addressed Ven nanda Get a sitting cloth nanda We will go to the Pāvāla shrine for the days abiding Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven nanda followed along behind the Blessed One carrying the sitting clothThen the Blessed One went to the Pāvāla shrine and on arrival sat down on the seat laid outSeated the Blessed One addressed Ven nanda Vesālī is refreshing nanda Refreshing too are the Udena shrine the Gotamaka shrine the Sattamba shrine the ManySon shrine the Sāranda shrine the Pāvāla shrine Anyone nanda in whom the four bases of power are developed pursued given a means of transport given a grounding steadied consolidated and wellundertaken couldif he

wellundertaken He couldif he wantedremain for an eon or the remainder of an eon But Ven nandaeven when the Blessed One had given such a blatant sign such a blatant hintwasnt able to understand his meaning He didnt beg of him Lord may the Blessed One remain for an eon May the One WellGone remain for an eonfor the benefit of the many for the happiness of the many out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of human beings  devas It was as if his mind was possessed by MāraA second time A third time the Blessed One addressed Ven nanda Vesālī is refreshing nanda Refreshing

One addressed Ven nanda Go nanda Do what you think it is now time to doResponding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven nanda got up from his seat and bowing down to him and circumambulating him went to sit under a tree not far from the Blessed OneSoon after Ananda had left Mara the Evil One came to the Lord stood to one side and said Lord may the Blessed Lord now attain final Nibbana may the WellFarer now attain final NibbanaNow is the time for the Blessed Lords final NibbanaBecause the Blessed Lord has said this Evil One I will not take final Nibbana till I have monks and disciples who

from now the Tathāgata will totally unbindSo the Lord at the Capala Shrine mindfully and in full awareness renounced the lifeprincipleand when this occurred there was a great earthquake terrible hairraising and accompanied by thunderAnd when the Lord saw this he uttered this verseGross or fine things become the sage abjuredCalm composed he burst becomings shellAnd at the Capala shrine the Blessed One thus mindfully and clearly comprehending renounced his will to live onAnd upon the Lords renouncing his will to live on there came a tremendous earthquake dreadful and astonishing and thunder rolled across the heavensAnd the Blessed One beheld it with understanding and made this solemn utteranceWhat causes life unbounded or confined  His process of becoming  this the Sage RenouncesWith inward calm and joy he breaks As though a coat of mail his own lifes causeThus at the Pāvāla shrinemindful  alertthe Blessed One relinquished the fabrications of lifeAnd as the Blessed One relinquished the fabrications of life there was a great earthquake awesome  hairraising and rolls of the devadrums split Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedComparing the incomparable with comingintobeing the sage relinquished the fabrication of becomingInwardly joyful centered he split his own comingintobeing like a coat of mailAnd the Venerable Ananda thought It is marvellous it is wonderful how this great earthquake arises this terrible earthquake so dreadful and hairraising accompanied by thunderWhatever can have caused itHe went to the Lord saluted him sat down to one side and asked him that questionAnanda there are eight reasons eight causes for the appearance of a great earthquakeThis great earth is established on water the water on the wind the wind on spaceAnd when a mighty wind blowsthis stirs up the waterand through the stirringup of the water the earth quakesThat is the first reasonIn the second place there is an ascetic or Brahmin who has developed psychic powers or a mighty and powerful deva whose earthconsciousness is weakly developed and his waterconsciousness is immeasurableand he makes the earth shudder and shake and violently quakeThat is the second reasonAgain when a Bodhisatta descends from the Tusita Heaven mindful and clearly aware into his mothers womb then the earth shudders and shakes and violently quakesThat is the third reasonAgain when the Bodhisatta emerges from his mothers womb mindful and clearly aware then the earth shudders and shakes and violently quakesThat is the fourth reasonAgain when the Tathagata gains unsurpassed enlightenment then the earth shudders and shakes and violently quakesThat is the fifth reasonAgain when the Tathagata sets in motion the Wheel of the Dhamma then the earth shudders and shakes and violently quakesThat is the sixth reasonAgain when the Tathagata mindful and clearly aware renounces the lifeprinciple then the earth shudders and shakes and violently quakeAgain when the Tathagata gains the Nibbana element without remainder then the earth shudders and shakes and violently quakesThat is the eighth reasonThese Ananda are the eight reasons the eight causes for the appearance of a great earthquakeThen it came to the mind of the Venerable Ananda Marvellous it is indeed and most wonderful The earth shakes mightily tremendously Dreadful and astonishing it is how the thunders roll across the heavensWhat could be the reason what the cause that so mighty an earthquake should ariseAnd the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One and respectfully greeting him sat down at one sideThen he spoke to the Blessed One saying Marvellous it is indeed and most wonderful The earth shakes mightily tremendously Dreadful and astonishing it is how the thunders roll across the heavensWhat could be the reason what the cause that so mighty an earthquake should arise Then the Blessed One said There are eight reasons Ananda eight causes for a mighty earthquake to ariseWhat are those eightThis great earth Ananda is established upon liquid the liquid upon the atmosphere and the atmosphere upon spaceAnd when Ananda mighty atmospheric disturbances take placethe liquid is agitatedAnd with the agitation of the liquid tremors of the earth ariseThis is the first reason the first cause for the arising of mighty earthquakesAgain Ananda when an ascetic or holy man of great power one who has gained mastery of his mind or a deity who is mighty and potent develops intense concentration on the delimited aspect of the earth element and to a boundless degree on the liquid elementhe too causes the earth to tremble quiver and shakeThis is the second reason the second cause for the arising of mighty earthquakesAgain Ananda when the Bodhisatta departs from the Tusita realm and descends into his mothers womb mindfully and clearly comprehendingand when the Bodhisatta comes out from his mothers womb mindfully and clearly comprehendingand when the Tathagata becomes fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenmentwhen the Tathagata sets rolling the excellent Wheel of the Dhammawhen the Tathagata renounces his will to live onand when the Tathagata comes to pass away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains  then too Ananda this great earth trembles quivers and shakesThese Ananda are the eight reasons the eight causes for a great earthquake to ariseThen the thought occurred to Ven nanda How amazing How astounding What a great earthquake What a very great earthquake awesome  hairraising and rolls of the devadrums split What is the reason what is the cause for the appearance of the great earthquakeSo Ven nanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One How amazing lord How astounding What a great earthquake What a very great earthquake awesome  hairraising and rolls of thunder split What lord is the reason what is the cause for the appearance of the great earthquakenanda there are these eight reasons eight causes for the appearance of a great earthquakeWhich eightThis great earth nanda is established on water The water is established on wind The wind is standing on spaceThere comes a time when a great wind blowsThe great wind blowing shakes the waterThe water shaken shakes the earthThis is the first reason the first cause for the appearance of a great earthquakeThen nanda there come a time when a brahman of power with mastery of the mind or a deva of great power great might has developed a limited earthperception and an immeasurable liquidperceptionHe makes this earth shake  shiver quiver  quakeThis is the second reasonThen nanda when the bodhisatta falling from the Tusita group mindful  alert descends into his mothers womb the earth shakes  shivers quivers  quakesThis is the third reasonThen nanda when the bodhisatta mindful  alert emerges from his mothers womb the earth shakes  shivers quivers  quakesThis is the fourth reasonThen nanda when the Tathāgata awakens to the unexcelled right selfawakening the earth shakes  shivers quivers  quakesThis is the fifth reasonThen nanda when the Tathāgata sets rolling the unexcelled Dhammawheel the earth shakes  shivers quivers  quakesThis is the sixth reasonThen nanda when the Tathāgata mindful  alert relinquishes the fabrications of life the earth shakes  shivers quivers  quakesThis is the seventh reasonThen nanda when the Tathāgata by means of the unbinding property with no fuel remaining totally unbinds the earth shakes  shivers quivers  quakesThis is the eighth reason the eighth cause for the appearance of a great earthquakeThese are the eight reasons the eight causes for the appearance of a great earthquakeAnanda these eight kinds of assembliesWhat are theyThey are the assembly of Khattiyas the assembly of Brahmins the assembly of householders the assembly of ascetics the assembly of devas of

made my appearance resemble theirsmy voice resemble theirsAnd so I taught them the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened themYet while I was speaking to them thus they did not know me and they would enquire of one another asking Who is he that speaks to us Is it a man or a god Then having taught them the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened them I would straightaway vanishAnd when I had

and happiness of devas and humansEnough AnandaDo not beg the Tathagata it is not the right time for thatAnd a second and a third time the Venerable Ananda made the same requestAnanda have you faith in the Tathagatas enlightenment Yes LordThen why do you bother the Tathagata with your request up to three times But Lord I have heard from the Lords own lips I have understood from the Lords own lips Whoever has developed the four roads to power could undoubtedly live for a century or for the remainder of oneHave you faith Ananda Yes LordThen Ananda yours is the fault yours is the failure that having been given such a broad hint such a clear sign by the Tathagata you did not understand and did not beg the Tathagata to stay for a century  If Ananda you had begged him the Tathagata would twice have refused you but the third time he would have consentedTherefore Ananda yours is the fault yours is the failureOnce Ananda I was staying at Rajagaha at the Vultures PeakAnd there I said Ananda Rajagaha is delightful the Vultures Peak is delightfulWhoever has developed the four roads to power could undoubtedly live for a centuryBut you Ananda in spite of such a broad hint did not

whoever has developed the four roads to powercould undoubtedly live for a century or the remainder of oneThe Tathagata has developed these powers and he could Ananda undoubtedly live for a century or the remainder of oneBut you Ananda failing to grasp this broad hint this clear sign did not beg the Tathagata to stay for a centuryIf Ananda you had begged him the Tathagata would twice have refused you but the third time he would have consentedAnanda have I not told you before All those things that are dear and pleasant to us must suffer change separation and alterationSo how could this be possible Whatever is born become compounded is liable to decay  that it should not decay is impossibleAnd that has been renounced given up rejected abandoned forsaken the Tathagata has renounced the

Tathagata for the time is past Ananda for such an entreatyBut for a second and a third time the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One May the Blessed One remain O Lord May the Happy One remain O Lord throughout the worldperiod for the welfare and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit well being and happiness of gods and menThen the Blessed One said Do you have faith Ananda in the Enlightenment of the TathagataAnd the Venerable Ananda replied Yes O Lord I doThen how Ananda can you persist against the Tathagata even up to the third time Then the Venerable Ananda said This O Lord I have heard and learned from the Blessed One himself when the Blessed One said to me Whosoever Ananda has developed practiced employed strengthened maintained scrutinized and brought to perfection the four constituents of psychic power could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of itThe Tathagata Ananda has done soTherefore the Tathagata could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of itAnd did you believe it Ananda Yes O Lord I didThen Ananda the fault is yours Herein have you failed inasmuch as you were unable to grasp the plain suggestion the significant prompting given by the Tathagata and you did not then entreat the Tathagata to remainFor if you had done so Ananda twice the Tathagata might have declined but the third time he would have consentedTherefore Ananda the fault is yours herein have you failedAt Rajagaha Ananda when dwelling at Vultures PeakI spoke to you saying Pleasant Ananda is Rajagaha pleasant is Vultures PeakWhosoever Ananda has developedTherefore the Tathagata could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of itSo also at the Banyan Grove at Robbers Cliff at the Sattapanni Cave on the Vebhara Mountain at the Black Rock of Isigili at the Serpents Pool in the Cool Forest at the Tapoda Grove at the Bamboo Grove in the Squirrels Feedingground at Jivakas Mango Grove and at Small Nook in the Deer Park I spoke to you in the same words saying Pleasant Ananda is Rajagaha pleasant are these placesWhosoever Ananda has developed Therefore the Tathagata could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of itBut you Ananda were unable to grasp the plain suggestion the significant prompting given you by the Tathagata and you did not entreat the Tathagata to remainFor if you had done so Ananda twice the Tathagata might have declined but the third time he would have consentedTherefore Ananda the fault is yours herein you have failedSo also at Vesali Ananda at different times the Tathagata has spoken to you saying Pleasant Ananda is Vesali pleasant are the shrines of UdenaGotamaka Sattambaka Bahuputta

suggestion the significant prompting given you by the Tathagata and you did not entreat the Tathagata to remainFor if you had done so Ananda twice the Tathagata might have declined but the third time he would have consentedTherefore Ananda the fault is yours herein you have failedYet Ananda have I not taught from the very beginning that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change separation and severanceOf that which is born come into being is compounded and subject to decay how can one say May it not come to dissolution There can be no such state of thingsAnd of that Ananda which the Tathagata has finished with that which he has relinquished given up abandoned and rejected  his will to live on  the Tathagatas word has been spoken once for all Before long the Parinibbana of the Tathagata will come aboutThree months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass awayAnd that the Tathagata should withdraw his words for the sake of living on  this is an impossibilitySo then Ananda let us go to the hall of the Gabled House in the Great ForestAnd the Venerable Ananda replied So be it LordThen the Blessed One with the Venerable Ananda went to the hall of the Gabled House in the Great Forest And there he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Go now Ananda and assemble in the hall of audience all the bhikkhus who dwell in the neighborhood of VesaliSo be it Lord And the

develop and frequently practice that the life of purity may be established and may long endure for the welfare and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit well being and happiness of gods and menThen the Blessed One said to the bhikkhus So bhikkhus I exhort you All compounded things are subject to vanish Strive with earnestnessThe time of the Tathagatas Parinibbana is nearThree months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass awayAnd having spoken these words the Happy One the Master spoke again sayingMy years are now full ripe the life span left is

understanding the Ariyan concentrationthrough not understanding the Ariyan wisdomthrough not understanding the Ariyan liberation I as well as you have for a long time fared on round the cycle of rebirthsAnd it is by understanding and penetrating the Ariyan morality the Ariyan concentration the Ariyan wisdom and the Ariyan liberation that the craving for becoming has been cut off the tendency towards becoming has been exhausted and there will be no more rebirthThus the Lord spokeThe WellFarer having thus spoken the Teacher said thisMorality samadhi wisdom and final releaseThese glorious things Gotama came to knowThe Dhamma hed discerned he taught his monksHe whose vision ended woe to Nibbanas goneThen the Lord while staying at Bhandagama delivered a comprehensive discourse This is morality this is concentration this is wisdomConcentration when imbued with morality brings great fruit and profitWisdom when imbued with concentration brings great fruit and profitThe mind imbued

BhoganagaraAt Bhoganagara the Lord stayed at the Ananda ShrineAnd here he said to the monks Monks I will teach you four criteria Listen pay close attention and I will speakYes Lord replied the monksSuppose a monk were to say Friends I heard and received this from the Lords own lips this is the Dhamma this is the discipline this is the Masters teachingthen monks you should neither approve nor disapprove his wordsThen without approving or disapproving his words and expressions should be carefully noted and compared with the Suttas and reviewed in the light of the disciplineIf they on such comparison and review are found not to conform to the Suttas or the discipline the conclusion must be Assuredly this is not the word of the Buddha it has been wrongly understood by this monkand the matter is to be rejectedBut where on such comparison and review they are found to conform to the Suttas or the discipline the conclusion must be Assuredly this is the word of the Buddha it has been rightly understood by this monkThis is the first criterionSuppose a monk were to say In such and such a place there is a community with elders and distinguished teachersI have heard and received this from that communitythen monks you should neither approve nor disapprove his words  That is the second criterionSuppose a monk were to say In such and such a place there are many elders who are learned bearers of the tradition who know the Dhamma the discipline the code of rules This is the third criterionSuppose a monk were to say In such and such a place there is one elder who is learned I have heard and received this from that elder But where on such comparison and review they are found to conform to the Suttas and the discipline then the conclusion must be Assuredly this is the word of the Buddha it has been rightly understood by this monkThen the Lord while staying at Bhoganagara delivered a comprehensive discourse This is morality this is concentration this is wisdomWhen the Blessed One had stayed at Bhandagama as long as he pleased he spoke to the Venerable Ananda Come Ananda let us go to Hatthigama Ambagama Jambugama to BhoganagaraSo be it LordAnd the Blessed One took up his abode at Bhoganagara together with a large community of bhikkhusand stayed in the Ananda shrineAnd there the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Now bhikkhus I shall make known to you the four great references Listen and pay heed to my wordsAnd those bhikkhus answered saying So be it LordThen the Blessed One saidIn this fashion bhikkhus a bhikkhu might speak Face to face with the Blessed One brethren I have heard and learned thus This is the Dhamma and the Discipline the Masters DispensationWithout approval and without scorn but carefully studying the sentences word by word one should trace them in the Discourses and verify them by the DisciplineIn that way bhikkhus you should reject itAnd in that way bhikkhus you may accept it on the first referenceor In an abode of such and such a name lives a community with elders and a chiefFace to face with that community I have heard and learned thus This is the Dhamma and the Discipline the Masters DispensationIn that way bhikkhus you should reject itAnd in that way bhikkhus you may accept it on the second referenceor In an abode of such and such a name live several bhikkhus who are elders who are learned who have accomplished their course who are preservers of the Dhamma the Discipline and the SummariesFace to face with those elders I have heard and learned thus This is the Dhamma and the Discipline the Masters DispensationAnd in that way bhikkhus you may accept it on the third referenceor In an abode of such and such a name lives a single bhikkhu who is an elder who is learned who has accomplished his course who is a preserver of the Dhamma the Discipline and the SummariesFace to face with that elder I have heard and learned thus This is the Dhamma and the Discipline the Masters DispensationIn such a case bhikkhus the declaration of such a bhikkhu is neither to be received with approval nor with scornWithout approval and without scorn but carefully studying the sentences word by word one should trace them in the Discourses and verify them by the DisciplineIf they are neither traceable in the Discourses nor verifiable by the Discipline one must conclude thus Certainly this is not the Blessed Ones utterance this has been misunderstood by that bhikkhu  or by that community or by those elders or by that elderIn that way bhikkhus you should reject itBut if the sentences concerned are traceable in the Discourses and verifiable by the Discipline then one must conclude thus Certainly this is the Blessed Ones utterance this has been well understood by that bhikkhu  or by that community or by those elders or by that elderAnd in that way bhikkhus you may accept it on the fourth referenceThese bhikkhus are the four great references for you to preserveAnd also at Bhoganagara at the Ananda shrine the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdomGreat becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conductgreat becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentrationutterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdomThen the Blessed One having stayed near Bhaṇḍa Village as long as he pleased said to Ven nanda Come nanda we will head for Hatthi

Teachers instruction His statement is neither to be approved nor scornedWithout approval or scorn take careful note of his words and make them stand against the suttas and tally them against the VinayaIf on making them stand against the suttas and tallying them against the Vinaya you find that they dont stand with the suttas or tally with the Vinaya you may conclude This is not the word of the Blessed One this monk has misunderstood itand you should reject itBut if on making them stand against the suttas and tallying them against the Vinaya you find that they stand with the suttas and

other food hard and soft he served the community of bhikkhusThereafter the Blessed One spoke to Cunda saying Whatever Cunda is left over of the sukaramaddava bury that in a pitFor I do not see in all this world with its gods Maras and Brahmas among the host of ascetics and brahmans gods and men anyone who could eat it and entirely digest it except the Tathagata aloneAnd Cunda the metalworker answered the Blessed One saying So be it O Lord And what remained over of the sukaramaddava he buried in a pit  Then he returned to the Blessed One respectfully greeted him and sat down at one sideAnd the Blessed One instructed Cunda the metalworker in the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened him After this he rose from his seat and departedAnd soon after the Blessed One had eaten the meal provided by Cunda the metalworker a dire sickness fell upon him even dysentery and he suffered sharp and deadly painsBut the Blessed One endured them mindfully clearly comprehending and unperturbedThen the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to KusinaraAnd the Venerable Ananda answered So be it LordWhen he had eaten Cundas food I heardWith fortitude the deadly pains he boreFrom the sukaramaddavaa sore And dreadful sickness came upon the LordBut natures pangs he enduredCome let us go To Kusinara was his dauntless wordThen the Blessed One having stayed near Bhoganagara at the nanda shrine as long as he pleased said to Ven nanda Come nanda we will head for PāvāAs you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One together with a large Saṅgha of monks went to PāvāThere the Blessed One stayed near Pāvā in the mango grove of Cunda the silversmithCunda the silversmith heard The Blessed One they say on reaching Pāvā is staying near Pāvā in my mango grove So Cunda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged him with Dhamma talkThen Cundainstructed urged roused  encouraged by the Blessed Ones Dhamma talksaid to him Lord may the Blessed One acquiesce to my meal tomorrow together with the Saṅgha of monks The Blessed One acquiesced with silenceThen Cunda understanding the Blessed Ones acquiescence got up from his seat and bowing down to him and circumambulating him leftThen at the end of the night after having exquisite staple  nonstaple foodincluding a large amount of pigdelicacyprepared in his own home he announced the time to the Blessed One Its time lord The meal is ready Then the Blessed One early in the morning adjusted his lower robe andtaking his bowl  outer robewent together with the Saṅgha of monks to Cundas home On arrival he sat down on the seat laid outSeated he said to Cunda Cunda serve me with the pigdelicacy you have had preparedand the Saṅgha of monks with the other staple  nonstaple food you have had preparedResponding As you say lord to the Blessed One Cunda served the Blessed One with the pigdelicacy he had had preparedand the Saṅgha of monks with the other staple  nonstaple food he had had preparedThen the Blessed One said to him Cunda bury the remaining pigdelicacy in a pitI dont see anyone in the world together with its devas Māras Brahmās in this generation with its contemplatives brahmans its rulers commonfolk in whom when it was ingested it would go to a healthy change aside from the TathāgataResponding As you say lord to the Blessed One Cunda buried the remaining pigdelicacy in a pit went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed Oneafter instructing urging rousing  encouraging him with Dhamma talkgot up from his seat and leftThen in the Blessed One after he had eaten Cundas meal there arose a severe disease accompanied with blood with intense pains  deadlyBut the Blessed One endured itmindful alert  not struck down by itThen he addressed Ven nanda nanda we will go to Kusinārā As you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed OneI have heard that on eating Cunda the silversmiths mealthe enlightened one was touched by illness fierce deadlyAfter he had eaten the pigdelicacya fierce sickness arose in the TeacherAfter being purged of it the Blessed One saidTo the city of Kusinārā I will go Then turning aside from the road the Lord went to the foot of a tree and said Come Ananda fold a robe in four for me I am tired and want to sit downVery good Lord said Ananda and did soThe Lord sat down on the prepared seat and said Ananda bring me some water I am thirsty and want to drinkAnanda replied Lord five hundred carts have passed this way The water is churned up by their wheels and is not good it is dirty and disturbedBut Lord the River Kakuttha nearby has clean water pleasant cool pure with beautiful banks delightfulThere the Lord shall drink the water and cool his limbsA second time the Lord said Ananda bring me some water and Ananda replied as beforeA third time the Lord said Ananda bring me some water I am thirsty and want to drinkVery good Lord said Ananda and taking his bowl he went to the streamAnd that stream whose water had been churned up by the wheels and was not good dirty and disturbed as Ananda approached it began to flow pure bright and unsulliedAnd the Venerable Ananda thought Wonderful marvellous are the Tathagatas great and mighty powersThis water was churned up by wheels and at my approach it flows pure bright and unsulliedHe took water in his bowl brought it to the Lord and told him of his thought saying May the Lord drink the water may the WellFarer drinkAnd the Lord drank the waterNow on the way the Blessed One went aside from the highway and stopped at the foot of a tree And he said to the Venerable Ananda Please fold my upper robe in four Ananda and lay it down I am weary and want to rest awhileSo be it Lord And the Venerable Ananda folded the robe in four and laid it downAnd the Blessed One sat down on the seat prepared for himand said to the Venerable Ananda Please bring me some water Ananda I am thirsty and want to drinkAnd the Venerable Ananda answered the Blessed One But just now Lord a great number of carts five hundred carts have passed over and the shallow water has been cut through by the wheels so that it flows turbid and muddyBut the Kakuttha River Lord is quite close by and its waters are clear pleasant cool and translucent It is easily approachable and delightfully placedThere the Blessed One can quench his thirst and refresh his limbsBut a second time the Blessed One made his request and the Venerable Ananda answered him as beforeAnd then for a third time the Blessed One said Please bring me some water Ananda I am thirsty and want to drinkThen the Venerable Ananda answered saying So be it Lord And he took the bowl and went to the streamAnd the shallow water which had been cut through by the wheels so that it flowed turbid and muddy became clear and settled down pure and pleasant as the Venerable Ananda drew nearThen the Venerable Ananda thought Marvellous and most wonderful indeed is the power and glory of the TathagataAnd he took up water in the bowl and carried it to the Blessed One and said Marvellous and most wonderful indeed is the power and glory of the TathagataFor this shallow water which had been cut through by the wheels so that it flowed turbid and muddy became clear and settled down pure and pleasant as I drew nearNow let the Blessed One drink the water Let the Happy One drinkAnd the Blessed One drank the waterThen the Blessed One going down from the road went to a certain tree and on arrival said to Ven nanda nanda please arrange my outer robe folded in four I am tired I will sit downResponding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven nanda arranged the outer robe folded in fourThe Blessed One sat down on the seat laid outSeated he said to Ven nanda nanda please fetch me some water I am thirsty I will drink When this was said Ven nanda said to the Blessed One Lord just now  carts have passed through The meager rivercut by the wheelsflows turbid  disturbedBut the Kakudha river is not far away with pristine water pleasing water cool water pellucid water with restful banks refreshingThere the Blessed One will drink potable water and cool his limbs A second time the Blessed One said to Ven nanda nanda please fetch me some water I am thirsty I will drink A second time Ven nanda said to the Blessed One Lord just now  carts have passed through The meager watercut by the wheelsflows turbid  disturbedBut the Kakudha River is not far away with pristine water pleasing water cool water pellucid water with restful banks refreshingThere the Blessed One will drink potable water and cool his limbsA third time the Blessed One said to Ven nanda nanda please fetch me some water I am thirsty I will drink Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven nandataking a bowlwent to the riverAnd the meager river that cut by the wheels had been flowing turbid  disturbed on his approach flowed pristine clear  undisturbedThe thought occurred to him How amazing How astoundingthe great power  great might of the Tathāgatain that this meager river that cut by the wheels was flowing turbid  disturbed on my approach flowed pristine clear  undisturbedFetching water with the bowl he went to the Blessed One and on arrival said How amazing How astoundingthe great power  great might of the Tathāgatain that this meager river that cut by the wheels was flowing turbid  disturbed on my approach flowed pristine clear  undisturbedDrink the water O Blessed One Drink the water O One WellGoneThen the Blessed One drank the waterAt that moment Pukkusa the Malla a pupil of Alara Kalama was going along the main road from Kusinara to PavaSeeing the Lord sitting under a treehe went over saluted him and sat down to one sideThen he said It is wonderful Lord it is marvellous how calm these wanderers areOnce Lord Alara Kalama was going along the main road and turning aside he went and sat down under a nearby tree to take his siestaAnd five hundred carts went rumbling by very close to himA man who was walking along behind them came to Alara Kalama and said Lord did you not see five hundred carts go by No friend I did notBut didnt you hear them Lord No friend I did notWell were you asleep Lord No friend I was not asleepThen Lord were you conscious Yes friendSo Lord being conscious and awake you neither saw nor heard five hundred carts passing close by you even though your outer robe was bespattered with dust That is so friendAnd that man thought It is wonderful it is marvellous These wanderers are so calmthat though conscious and awake a man neither saw nor heard five hundred carts passing close by himAnd he went away praising Alara Kalamas lofty powersWell Pukkusa what do you think What do you consider is more difficult to do or attain to  while conscious and awake not to see or hear five hundred carts passing nearby or while conscious and awake not to see or hear anything when the raingod streams and splashes when lightning flashes and thunder crashesLord how can one compare not seeing or hearing five hundred carts with that  or even six seven eight nine or ten hundred or hundreds of thousands of carts to thatTo see or hear nothing when such a storm rages is more difficultOnce Pukkusa when I was staying at Atuma at the threshingfloorthe raingod streamed and splashed lightning flashed and thunder crashed and two farmers brothers and four oxen were killedAnd a lot of people went out of Atuma to where the two brothers and the four oxen were killedAnd Pukkusa I had at that time gone out of the door of the threshingfloor and was walking up and down outsideAnd a man from the crowd came to me saluted me and stood to one sideAnd I said to him Friend why are all these people gathered here Lord there has been a great storm and two farmers brothers and four oxen have been killedBut you Lord where have you been I have been right here friendBut what did you see Lord I saw nothing friendOr what did you hear Lord I heard nothing friendWere you sleeping Lord I was not sleeping friendThen Lord were you consciousrYes friendSo Lord being conscious and awake you neither saw nor heard the great rainfall and floods and the thunder and lightning That is so friendAnd Pukkusa that man thought It is wonderful it is marvellous These wanderers are so calmthat they neither see nor hear when the raingod streams and splashes lightning flashes and thunder crashesProclaiming my lofty powers he saluted me passed by to the right and departedAt this Pukkusa the Malla said Lord I reject the lofty powers of Alara Kalama as if they were blown away by a mighty wind or carried off by a swift stream or riverExcellent Lord excellentIt is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down or to point out the way to one who had got lost or to bring an oil lamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various waysAnd I Lord go for refuge to the Blessed Lord the Dhamma and the SanghaMay the Blessed Lord accept me from this day forth as a layfollower as long as life shall lastThen Pukkusa said to one man Go and fetch me two fine sets of robes of clothofgold burnished and ready to wearYes Lord the man replied and did soAnd Pukkusa offered the robes to the Lord saying Here Lord are two fine sets of robes of clothofgold May the Blessed Lord be graciously pleased to accept themWell then Pukkusa clothe me in one set and Ananda in the otherVery good Lord said Pukkusa and did so Then the Lord instructed inspired fired and delighted Pukkusa the Malla with a talk on DhammaThen Pukkusa rose from his seat saluted the Lord passed by to the right and departedSoon after Pukkusa had gone Ananda having arranged one set of the golden robes on the body of the Lordobserved that against the Lords body it appeared dulledAnd he said It is wonderful Lord it is marvellous how dear and bright the Lords skin appearsIt looks even brighter than the golden robes in which it is clothedJust so Ananda There are two occasions on which the Tathagatas skin appears especially clear and brightWhich are theyOne is the night in which the Tathagata gains supreme enlightenment the other is the night when he attains the Nibbanaelement without remainder at his final passingOn these two occasions the Tathagatas skin appears especially clear and brightTonight Ananda in the last watch in the salgrove of the Mallas near Kusinara between two saltrees the Tathagatas final passing will take placeAnd now Ananda let us go to the River KakutthaVery good Lord said Ananda Two golden robes were Pukkusas offeringBrighter shone the Teachers body than its dressThen the Lord went with a large number of monks to the River Kakuttha He entered the water bathed and drank and emerging went to the mango grovewhere he said to the Venerable Cundaka Come Cundaka fold a robe in four for me I am tired and want to lie downVery good Lord said Cundaka and did soThen the Lord adopted the lionposture lying on his right side placing one foot on the other mindfully and with clear awareness bearing in mind the time of awakeningAnd the Venerable Cundaka sat down in front of the LordThe Buddha having gone to Kakuttha the riverWith its clear bright and pleasant watersTherein the Teacher plunged his weary bodyTathagata  without an equal in the worldSurrounded by the monks whose head he wasThe Teacher and Lord Preserver of DhammaTo the Mango Grove the great Sage wentAnd to Cundaka the monk he saidOn a fourfold robe Ill lie downAnd thus adjured by the great AdeptCundaka placed the fourfold robeThe Teacher laid his weary limbs to restWhile Cundaka kept watch beside himThen the Lord said to the Venerable Ananda It might happen Ananda that Cunda the smith should feel remorse thinking It is your fault friend Cunda it is by your misdeed that the Tathagata gained final Nibbana after taking his last meal from youBut Cundas remorse should be expelled in this way That is your merit Cunda that is your good deed that the Tathagata gained final Nibbana after taking his last meal from youFor friend Cunda I have heard and understood from the Lords own lips that these two almsgivings are of very great fruit of very great result more fruitful and advantageous than any otherWhich twoThe one is the almsgiving after eating which the Tathagata attains supreme enlightenment the other that after which he attains the Nib banaelement without remainder at his final passingThese two almsgivings are more fruitful and profitable than all othersCundas deed is conducive to long life to good looks to happiness to fame to heaven and to lordshipIn this way Ananda Cundas remorse is to be expelledThen the Lord having settled this matter at that time uttered this verseBy giving merit growsby restraint hatreds checkedHe whos skilled abandons evil thingsAs greed hate and folly wane Nibbanas gainedEnd of the fourth recitationsection concerning AlaraNow it so happened that one Pukkusa of the Malla clan who was a disciple of Alara Kalama was passing by on his way from Kusinara to PavaAnd when he saw the Blessed One seated at the foot of a treehe approached him respectfully greeted him and sat down at one sideAnd he spoke to the Blessed One saying Marvellous it is Lord most wonderful it is O Lord the state of calmness wherein abide those who have gone forth from the worldFor at one time Lord Alara Kalama was on a journey and he went aside from the highway and sat down by the wayside at the foot of a tree to pass the heat of the dayAnd it came about Lord that a great number of carts even five hundred carts passed by him one by oneAnd then Lord a certain man who was following behind that train of carts approached and spoke to him saying Did you sir see a great number of carts that passed you by And Alara Kalama answered him I did not see them brotherBut the noise sir surely you heardI did not hear it brotherThen that man asked him Then sir perhaps you slept No brother I was not sleepingThen sir were you conscious I was brotherThen that man said Then sir while conscious and awake you still did not see the great number of carts even five hundred carts that passed you by one after another nor heard the noise Why sir your very robe is covered with their dustAnd Alara Kalama replied saying So it is brotherAnd to that man O Lord came the thought Marvellous it is most wonderful indeed it is the state of calmness wherein abide those who have gone forth from the worldAnd there arose in him great faith in Alara Kalama and he went his wayNow what do you think Pukkusa What is more difficult to do more difficult to meet with  that a man while conscious and awake should not see a great number of carts even five hundred carts that passed him by one after another nor hear the noise or that one conscious and awake in the midst of a heavy rain with thunder rolling lightning flashing and thunderbolts crashing should neither see it nor hear the noise What O Lord are five hundred carts  nay six seven eight nine hundred or a thousand or even hundreds of thousands of carts  compared with thisNow one time Pukkusa I was staying at Atuma and had my abode in a barn thereAnd at that time there was a heavy rain with thunder rolling lightning flashing and thunderbolts crashing And two farmers who were brothers were killed close to the barn together with four oxenand a great crowd came forth from Atuma to the spot where they were killedNow at that time Pukkusa I had come out of the barn and was walking up and down in thought before the doorAnd a certain man from the great crowd approached me respectfully greeted me and stood at one sideAnd I asked him Why brother has this great crowd gathered together And he answered me Just now Lord there was a heavy rain with thunder rolling lightning flashing and thunderbolts crashing And two farmers who were brothers were killed close by together with four oxenIt is because of this that the great crowd has gatheredBut where Lord were you I was here brotherYet Lord did you not see it I did not see it brotherBut the noise Lord you surely heard I did not hear it brotherThen that man asked me Then Lord perhaps you slept No brother I was not sleepingThen Lord you were conscious I was brotherThen that man said Then Lord while conscious and awake in the midst of a heavy rain with thunder rolling lightning flashing and thunderbolts crashing you neither saw it nor heard the noise And I answered him saying I did not brotherAnd to that man Pukkusa came the thought Marvellous it is most wonderful indeed it is the state of calmness wherein abide those who have gone forth from the worldAnd there arose in him great faith in me and he respectfully saluted me and keeping his right side towards me he went his wayWhen this had been said Pukkusa of the Malla clan said to the Blessed One The faith Lord that I had in Alara Kalama I now scatter to the mighty wind I let it be carried away as by a flowing streamExcellent O Lord most excellent O LordIt is as if Lord one were to set upright what had been overthrown or to reveal what had been hidden or to show the path to one who had gone astray or to light a lamp in the darkness so that those having eyes might see  even so has the Blessed One set forth the Dhamma in many waysAnd so O Lord I take my refuge in the Blessed One the Dhamma and the Community of BhikkhusMay the Blessed One accept me as his disciple one who has taken refuge until the end of lifeThen Pukkusa of the Malla clan spoke to a certain man saying Bring me at once friend two sets of goldenhued robes burnished and ready for wearAnd the man answered him So be it sirAnd when the robes were brought Pukkusa of the Malla clan offered them to the Blessed One saying May the Blessed One O Lord out of compassion accept this from meAnd the Blessed One said Robe me then in one Pukkusa and in the other robe AnandaSo be it Lord And he thereupon robed the Blessed One in one and in the other he robed the Venerable AnandaAnd then the Blessed One instructed Pukkusa of the Malla clan in the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened himAnd after that Pukkusa rose from his seat respectfully saluted the Blessed One and keeping his right side towards him went his wayAnd soon after Pukkusa of the Malla clan had departed the Venerable Ananda arranged the set of goldenhued robes burnished and ready for wear about the body of the Blessed OneBut when the set of robes was arranged upon the body of the Blessed One it became as though faded and its splendor dimmedAnd the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One Marvellous it is O Lord most wonderful indeed it is how clear and radiant the skin of the Tathagata appearsThis set of goldenhued robes burnished and ready for wear Lord now that it is arranged upon the body of the Blessed One seems to have become faded its splendor dimmedIt is so Ananda There are two occasions Ananda when the skin of the Tathagata appears exceedingly clear and radiantWhich are these twoThe night Ananda when the Tathagata becomes fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment and the night when the Tathagata comes to his final passing away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remainsThese Ananda are the two occasions on which the skin of the Tathagata appears exceedingly clear and radiantAnd now today in the last watch of this very night Ananda in the Mallas Sala Grove in the vicinity of Kusinara between two sala trees the Tathagata will come to his ParinibbanaSo now Ananda let us go to the Kakuttha RiverClad in Pukkusas gift the robes of goldThe Masters form was radiant to beholdThen the Blessed One went to the Kakuttha River together with a great community of bhikkhus  And he went down into the water and bathed and drank And coming forth from the water again he went to the Mango Groveand there spoke to the Venerable Cundaka saying Please fold my upper robe in four Cundaka and lay it down I am weary and would rest awhileSo be it Lord And Cundaka folded the robe in four and laid it downAnd the Blessed One lay down on his right side in the lions posture resting one foot upon the other and so disposed himself mindfully and clearly comprehending with the time for rising held in mindAnd the Venerable Cundaka sat down right in front of the Blessed OneThe Buddha to Kakutthas river cameWhere cool and limpid flows the pleasant streamThere washed in water clear his weary frameThe Buddha  he in all the world supremeAnd having bathed and drank the Teacher straightCrossed over the bhikkhus thronging in his wakeDiscoursing holy truths the Master greatTowards the Mango Grove his path did takeThere to the elder Cundaka he spokeLay down my robe please folded into fourThen the elder swift as lightning strokeHastened the Teachers bidding to obeyWeary the Lord then lay down on the matAnd Cunda on the ground before him satThen the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying It may come to pass Ananda that someone will cause remorse to Cunda the metalworker saying It is no gain to you friend Cunda but a loss that it was from you the Tathagata took his last alms meal and then came to his endThen Ananda the remorse of Cunda should be dispelled after this manner It is a gain to you friend Cunda a blessing that the Tathagata took his last alms meal from you and then came to his endFor friend face to face with the Blessed One I have heard and learned There are two offerings of food which are of equal fruition of equal outcome exceeding in grandeur the fruition and result of any other offerings of foodWhich twoThe one partaken of by the Tathagata before becoming fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment and the one partaken of by the Tathagata before passing into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remainsBy his deed the worthy Cunda has accumulated merit which makes for long life beauty well being glory heavenly rebirth and sovereignty Thus Ananda the remorse of Cunda the metalworker should be dispelledThen the Blessed One understanding that matter breathed forth the solemn utteranceWho gives his virtues shall increaseWho is selfcurbed no hatred bearsWhoso is skilled in virtue evil shunsAnd by the rooting out of lust and hate And all delusion comes to be at peaceNow on that occasion Pukkusa Mallaputta a disciple of ḷāra Kālāma was traveling on the road from Kusinārā to PāvāHe saw the Blessed One sitting at the root of a treeand on seeing him approached him On arrival having bowed down to him he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Its amazing lord Its astounding the peaceful abiding by which those gone forth abideOnce ḷāra Kālāma while traveling went down from the road and sat not far away at the root of a tree for the days abidingThen  carts passed by right near himThe a certain man coming along right behind those hundreds of carts approached ḷāra Kālāma and on arrival said to him Venerable sir did you see  carts going past No friend I didnt But did you hear the sound No friend I didnt But were you asleep No friend I wasnt asleep But were you conscious Yes friend Then venerable sir being conscious  awake when  carts passed by right near you you neither saw them nor heard a soundAnd yet your outer robe is covered with dustYes friend Then the thought occurred to that man How amazing How astounding the peaceful abiding by which those gone forth abidein that being conscious  awake when  carts passed by right near he would neither see them nor hear a soundHaving proclaimed immense conviction in ḷāra Kālāma he then leftWhat do you think Pukkusa Which is more difficult to do more difficult to master one who being conscious  awake when  carts passed by right near would neither see them nor hear a sound or one who being conscious  awake when the raindeva was raining the raindeva was pouring lightningstreaks were shooting out and a thunderbolt splits  would neither see them nor hear a sound Lord what would  carts amount toor  carts or  carts or  carts or  carts or  carts or  cartsThat would be more difficult to do more difficult to master one who being conscious  awake when the raindeva was raining the raindeva was pouring lightningstreaks were shooting out and a thunderbolt splits  would neither see them nor hear a sound One time Pukkusa I was staying near tumā in a threshingbarnAnd on that occasion when the raindeva was raining the raindeva was pouring lightningstreaks were shooting out and a thunderbolt split not far from the threshinghouse two farmersbrotherswere killed along with four oxenThen a large crowd of people came out of tumā to where the two farmersbrotherswere killed along with the four oxenAnd on that occasion I having come out of the threshingbarn was doing walking meditation in front of the door to the threshingbarnA certain man from the great crowd of people approached me and on arrival having bowed down to me stood to one sideAs he was standing there I said to him Why friend has this great crowd of people gathered Just now lordwhen the raindeva was raining the raindeva was pouring lightningstreaks were shooting out and a thunderbolt split two farmersbrotherswere killed along with four oxenThats why this great crowd of people has gatheredBut you lord Where were you I was right here friend But did you see anything No friend I didnt But did you hear the sound No friend I didnt But were you asleep No friend I wasnt asleep But were you conscious Yes friendThen lord being conscious  awake when the raindeva was raining the raindeva was pouring lightningstreaks were shooting out and a thunderbolt split  you neither saw anything nor heard a sound Yes friendThen the thought occurred to that man How amazing How astounding the peaceful abiding by which those gone forth abidein that when the raindeva was raining the raindeva was pouring lightningstreaks were shooting out and a thunderbolt split  he would neither see them nor hear a soundHaving proclaimed immense conviction in me he circumambulated me and then leftWhen this was said Pukkusa Mallaputta said to the Blessed One The conviction I had in ḷāra Kālāma I winnow before a high wind or wash away in the swift current of a riverMagnificent lord MagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed Onethrough many lines of reasoningmade the Dhamma clearI go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of monksMay the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life Then Pukkusa Mallaputta addressed a certain man Come now I say Fetch me a pair of goldcolored robes ready to wear Responding As you say lord to Pukkusa Mallaputta the man fetched the pair of goldcolored robes ready to wearThen Pukkusa Mallaputta presented the pair of goldcolored robes ready to wear to the Blessed One May the Blessed One accept this pair of goldcolored robes ready to wear out of kindness Very well then Pukkusa Clothe me with one and nanda with the otherResponding As you say lord to the Blessed One Pukkusa Mallaputta clothed the Blessed One with one and Ven nanda with the otherThen the Blessed One instructed urged roused and encouraged Pukkusa Mallaputta with Dhamma talkThen Pukkusa Mallaputtainstructed urged roused and encouraged with the Blessed Ones Dhamma talkgot up from his seat and bowing down to the Blessed One and circumambulating him leftThen not long after Pukkusa Mallaputta had left Ven nanda placed the pair of goldcolored robes ready to wear against the Blessed Ones bodyPlaced against the Blessed Ones body their iridescence seemed as if destroyedThen Ven nanda said Its amazing lord Its astoundinghow clear  bright the color of the Tathāgatas skinWhen this pair of goldcolored robes ready to wear is placed against the Blessed Ones body their iridescence seems as if destroyedSo it is nanda There are two times when the color of the Tathāgatas skin is especially clear  brightWhich twoThe night on which the Tathāgata awakens to the unexcelled selfawakening and the night on which the Tathāgata totally unbinds by means of the unbinding property with no fuel remainingThese are the two times when the color of the Tathāgatas skin is especially clear  brightToday in the last watch of the night between the twin Sal trees in Upavattana the Mallans Sal Forest near Kusinārā the Tathāgatas total unbinding will occurCome nanda we will head for Kakudha River As you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed OnePukkusa offered a pair of goldcolored robes clothed in whichthe Teacher of golden complexion shone brightlyThen the Blessed One together with the large Saṅgha of monks went to the Kakudha River and after arriving at the Kakudha River going down bathing drinking  coming back out went to a mango groveOn arrival the Blessed One said to Ven Cundaka Cundaka please arrange my outer robe folded in four I am tired I will lie down Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven Cundaka arranged the outer robe folded in fourThe Blessed One lying on his right side took up the lions posture placing one foot on top of the othermindful alert and attending to the perception of getting upVen Cundaka sat in front of himThe awakened one having gone to the little Kakudha riverwith its pristine pleasing water clearthe Teacher seeming very tiredthe Tathāgata unequalled in the worldwent down bathed drank  came outHonored surrounded in the midst of the group of monksthe Blessed One Teacher proceeding here in the Dhammathe great seer went to the mango groveHe addressed the monk named CundakaSpread it out folded in four for me to lie downOrdered by the One of developed mindCundaka quickly set it out folded in fourThe Teacher lay down seeming very tiredand Cundaka sat down there before himThen the Blessed One addressed Ven nanda nanda if anyone tries to incite remorse in Cunda the silversmith saying Its no gain for you friend Cunda its illdone by you that the Tathāgata having eaten your last alms totally unboundthen Cundas remorse should be allayed  Its a gain for you friend Cunda its welldone by you that the Tathāgata having eaten your last alms totally unboundFace to face with the Blessed One have I heard it face to face have I learned it These two alms are equal to each other in fruit equal to each other in result of much greater fruit  reward than any other almsWhich twoThe alms that after having eaten it the Tathāgata awakens to the unexcelled right selfawakening And the alms that after having eaten it the Tathāgata unbinds by means of the unbinding property with no fuel remainingThese are the two alms that are equal to each other in fruit equal to each other in result of much greater fruit  reward than any other almsVenerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to long life Venerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to beauty Venerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to happiness Venerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to heaven Venerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to rank Venerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to sovereignty In this way nanda Cunda the silversmiths remorse should be allayed Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedFor a person giving merit increasesFor one selfrestraining no animosity is amassedOne who is skillful leaves evil behind andfrom the ending of passion aversion delusion totally unbinds  The Lord said Ananda let us cross the Hirannavati River and go to the Mallas salgrove in the vicinity of KusinaraVery good Lord said Anandaand the Lord with a large company of monks crossed the river and went to the salgroveThere the Lord said Ananda prepare me a bed between these twin saltrees with my head to the north I am tired and want to lie downVery good Lord said Ananda and did soThen the Lord lay down on his right side in the lionposture placing one foot on the other mindful and clearly awareAnd those twin saltrees burst forth into an abundance of untimely blossomswhich fell upon the Tathagatas body sprinkling it and covering it in homageDivine coraltree flowers fell from the skydivine sandalwood powder fell from the sky sprinkling and covering the Tathagatas body in homageDivine musicand song sounded from the sky in homage to the TathagataAnd the Lord said Ananda these saltrees have burst forth into an abundance of untimely blossomsDivine musicand song sound from the sky in homage to the TathagataNever before has the Tathagata been so honoured revered esteemed worshipped and adoredAnd yet Ananda whatever monk nun male or female layfollower dwells practising the Dhamma properly and perfectly fulfils the Dhammaway he or she honours the Tathagata reveres and esteems him and pays him the supreme homageTherefore Ananda We will dwell practising the Dhamma properly and perfectly fulfil the Dhammaway this must be your watchwordThen the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us cross to the farther bank of the Hiraññavati and go to the Mallas Sala Grove in the vicinity of KusinaraSo be it LordAnd the Blessed One together with a large company of bhikkhus went to the further bank of the river Hiraññavati to the Sala Grove of the Mallas in the vicinity of KusinaraAnd there he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying  Please Ananda prepare for me a couch between the twin sala trees with the head to the north I am weary Ananda and want to lie downSo be it Lord And the Venerable Ananda did as the Blessed One asked him to doThen the Blessed One lay down on his right side in the lions posture resting one foot upon the other and so disposed himself mindfully and clearly comprehendingAt that time the twin sala trees broke out in full bloom though it was not the season of floweringAnd the blossoms rained upon the body of the Tathagata and dropped and scattered and were strewn upon it in worship of the TathagataAnd celestial mandarava flowersand heavenly sandalwood powder from the sky rained down upon the body of the Tathagata and dropped and scattered and were strewn upon it in worship of the TathagataAnd the sound of heavenly voicesand heavenly instruments made music in the air out of reverence for the TathagataAnd the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Ananda the twin sala trees are in full bloom though it is not the season of floweringAnd the blossoms rain upon the body of the Tathagata and drop and scatter and are strewn upon it in worship of the TathagataAnd celestial coral flowersand heavenly sandalwood powder from the sky rain down upon the body of the Tathagata and drop and scatter and are strewn upon it in worship of the TathagataAnd the sound of heavenly voicesand heavenly instruments makes music in the air out of reverence for the TathagataYet it is not thus Ananda that the Tathagata is respected venerated esteemed worshipped and honored in the highest degreeBut Ananda whatever bhikkhu or bhikkhuni layman or laywoman abides by the Dhamma lives uprightly in the Dhamma walks in the way of the Dhamma it is by such a one that the Tathagata is respected venerated esteemed worshipped and honored in the highest degreeTherefore Ananda  We shall abide by the Dhamma live uprightly in the Dhamma walk in the way of the Dhamma thus should you train yourselvesThen the Blessed One said to Ven nanda Come nanda we will head for the far shore of the Hiraññavati River for Upavattana the Mallans Sal Forest near KusinārāAs you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One with a large Saṅgha of monks went to the far shore of the Hiraññavati River to Upavattana the Mallans Sal Forest near KusinārāOn arrival he said to Ven nanda nanda please prepare a bed for me between the twin Sal trees with its head to the north I am tired and will lie down Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven nanda prepared a bed between the twin Sal trees with its head to the northThen the Blessed One lay down on his right side in the lions sleeping posture with one foot on top of the other mindful  alert Now on that occasion the twin Sal trees were in full bloom even though it was not the time for floweringThey showered strewed  sprinkled on the Tathāgatas body in homage to himHeavenly coraltree blossoms fell from the sky showering strewing  sprinkling the Tathāgatas body in homage to himHeavenly sandalwood powder fell from the sky showering strewing  sprinkling the Tathāgatas body in homage to himHeavenly music was playing in the sky in homage to the TathāgataHeavenly songs were sung in the sky in homage to the TathāgataThen the Blessed One said to Ven nanda nanda the twin Sal trees are in full bloom even though its not the flowering seasonThey shower strew  sprinkle on the Tathāgatas body in homage to himHeavenly coraltree blossoms are falling from the sky Heavenly sandalwood powder is falling from the sky Heavenly music is playing in the sky Heavenly songs are sung in the sky in homage to the TathāgataBut it is not to this extent that a Tathāgata is worshipped honored respected venerated or paid homage toRather the monk nun male lay follower or female lay follower who keeps practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma who keeps practicing masterfully who lives in accordance with the Dhamma That is the person who worships honors respects venerates  pays homage to the Tathāgata with the highest homageSo you should train yourselves We will keep practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma we will keep practicing masterfully we will live in accordance with the DhammaThats how you should train yourselvesJust then the Venerable Upavana was standing in front of the Lord fanning himAnd the Lord told him to move Move aside monk do not stand in front of meAnd the Venerable Ananda thought This Venerable Upavana has for long been the Lords attendant keeping close at hand at his beck and callAnd now in his last hour the Lord tells him to stand aside and not stand in front of himWhy ever does he do thatAnd he asked the Lord about thisAnanda the devas from ten worldspheres have gathered to see the TathagataFor a distance of twelve yojanas around the Mallas salgrove near Kusinara there is not a space you could touch with the point of a hair that is not filled with mighty devasand they are grumbling We have come a long way to see the TathagataIt is rare for a Tathagata a fullyenlightened Buddha to arise in the worldand tonight in the last watch the Tathagata will attain final Nibbanaand this mighty monk is standing in front of the Lord preventing us from getting a last glimpse of the TathagataBut Lord what kind of devas can the Lord perceive Ananda there are skydevas whose minds are earthbound they are weeping and tearing their hair raising their arms throwing themselves down and twisting and turning crying All too soon the Blessed Lord is passing away all too soon the WellFarer is passing away all too soon the Eye of the World is disappearingAnd there are earthdevas whose minds are earthbound who do likewiseBut those devas who are free from craving endure patiently saying All compounded things are impermanent  what is the use of thisAt that time the Venerable Upavana was standing before the Blessed One fanning himAnd the Blessed One rebuked him saying Move aside bhikkhu do not stand in front of meAnd to the Venerable Ananda came the thought This Venerable Upavana has been in attendance on the Blessed One for a long time closely associating with him and serving himYet now right at the end the Blessed One rebukes himWhat now could be the reason what the cause for the Blessed One to rebuke the Venerable Upavana saying Move aside bhikkhu do not stand in front of meAnd the Venerable Ananda told his thought to the Blessed OneThe Blessed One said Throughout the tenfold worldsystem Ananda there are hardly any of the deities that have not gathered together to look upon the TathagataFor a distance of twelve yojanas around the Sala Grove of the Mallas in the vicinity of Kusinara there is not a spot that could be pricked with the tip of a hair that is not filled with powerful deitiesAnd these deities Ananda are complaining From afar have we come to look upon the TathagataFor rare in the world is the arising of Tathagatas Arahants Fully Enlightened OnesAnd this day in the last watch of the night the Tathagatas Parinibbana will come aboutBut this bhikkhu of great powers has placed himself right in front of the Blessed One concealing him so that now at the very end we are prevented from looking upon him Thus Ananda the deities complainOf what kind of deities Lord is the Blessed One awareThere are deities Ananda in space  who are earthlyminded with dishevelled hair they weep with uplifted arms they weep flinging themselves on the ground they roll from side to side lamenting Too soon has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana Too soon has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana Too soon will the Eye of the World vanish from sightand on earthBut those deities who are freed from passion mindful and comprehending reflect in this way Impermanent are all compounded things How could this be otherwise Now on that occasion Ven Upavāṇa was standing in front of the Blessed One fanning himThen the Blessed One dismissed him saying Go away monk Dont stand in front of me Then the thought occurred to Ven nanda For a long time now this Ven Upavāṇa has been an attendant to the Blessed One staying near him and traveling with himBut now in his final hour he dismisses him saying Go away monk Dont stand in front of me Now what is the reason what is the cause why the Blessed One dismisses him saying Go away monk Dont stand in front of me Then Ven nanda said to the Blessed One For a long time now this Ven Upavāṇa has been an attendant to the Blessed One staying near him and traveling with himBut now in his final hour he dismisses him saying Go away monk Dont stand in front of me Now what is the reason what is the cause why the Blessed One dismisses him saying Go away monk Dont stand in front of me nanda most of the devatās from ten worldsystems have gathered in order to see the TathāgataFor twelve leagues all around Upavattana the Mallans Sal Forest near Kusinārā there is not the space even of the tip of a horsetail hair that is not occupied by eminent devatāsThe devatās nanda are complaining We have come a long distance to see the TathāgataOnly once in a long long time does a Tathāgataworthy  rightly selfawakenedarise in the worldTonight in the last watch of the night the total unbinding of the Tathāgata will occurAnd this eminent monk is standing in front of the Blessed One blocking the way We arent getting to see the Blessed One in his final hour But lord what is the state of the devatās the Blessed One is paying attention to nanda there are devatās who perceive space to be earth Tearing at their hair they are weeping Uplifting their arms they are weeping As if their feet were cut out from under them they fall down and roll back  forth crying All too soon the Blessed One will totally unbind All too soon the One WellGone will totally unbind All too soon the One with Eyes alternate reading the Eye will disappear from the worldThen there are devatās who perceive earth to be earth Tearing at their hair they are weeping Uplifting their arms they are weeping As if their feet were cut out from under them they fall down and roll back  forth crying All too soon the Blessed One will totally unbind All too soon the One WellGone will totally unbind All too soon the One with Eyes will disappear from the worldBut those devatās who are free from passion acquiesce mindful  alert Inconstant are fabrications What else is there to expectLord formerly monks who had spent the Rains in various places used to come to see the Tathagataand we used to welcome them so that such welltrained monks might see you and pay their respectsBut with the Lords passing we shall no longer have a chance to do thisAnanda there are four places the sight of which should arouse emotion in the faithfulWhich are theyHere the Tathagata was bom is the firstHere the Tathagata attained supreme enlightenment is the secondHere the Tathagata set in motion the Wheel of Dhamma is the thirdHere the Tathagata attained the Nibbanaelement without remainder is the fourthAnd Ananda the faithful monks and nuns male and female layfollowers will visit those placesAnd any who die while making the pilgrimage to these shrines with a devout heart will at the breakingup of the body after death be reborn in a heavenly worldFormerly Lord on leaving their quarters after the rains the bhikkhus would set forth to see the Tathagataand to us there was the gain and benefit of receiving and associating with those very revered bhikkhus who came to have audience with the Blessed One and to wait upon himBut Lord after the Blessed One has gone we shall no longer have that gain and benefitThere are four places Ananda that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverenceWhat are the fourHere the Tathagata was born This Ananda is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverenceHere the Tathagata became fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment This Ananda is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverenceHere the Tathagata set rolling the unexcelled Wheel of the Dhamma This Ananda is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverenceHere the Tathagata passed away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains This Ananda is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverenceThese Ananda are the four places that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverenceAnd truly there will come to these places Ananda pious bhikkhus and bhikkhunis laymen and laywomen reflecting Here the Tathagata was born Here the Tathagata became fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment Here the Tathagata set rolling the unexcelled Wheel of the Dhamma Here the Tathagata passed away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remainsAnd whoever Ananda should die on such a pilgrimage with his heart established in faith at the breaking up of the body after death will be reborn in a realm of heavenly happinessIn the past lord the monks in all directions after ending the Rains retreat came to see the TathāgataThus we got to see  attend to the monks who inspire the heartBut now after the Blessed One is gone we wont get to see or attend to the monks who inspire the heart nanda there are these four places that merit being seen by a clansman with conviction that merit his feelings of urgency  dismay savegaWhich fourHere the Tathāgata was born is a place that merits being seen by a clansman with conviction that merits his feelings of urgency  dismayHere the Tathāgata awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening Here the Tathāgata set rolling the unexcelled wheel of Dhamma Here the Tathāgata totally unbound in the property of unbinding with no fuel remaining is a place that merits being seen by a clansman with conviction that merits his feelings of urgency  dismayThese are the four places that merit being seen by a clansman with conviction that merit his feelings of urgency  dismayThey will come out of conviction nandamonks nuns male lay followers  female lay followersto the spots where Here the Tathāgata was born Here the Tathāgata awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening Here the Tathāgata set rolling the unexcelled wheel of Dhamma Here the Tathāgata totally unbound in the property of unbinding with no fuel remaining And anyone who dies while making a pilgrimage to these shrines with a bright confident mind willon the breakup of the body after deathreappear in a good destination a heavenly worldLord how should we act towards women Do not see them AnandaBut if we see them how should we behave Lord Do not speak to them AnandaBut if they speak to us Lord how should we behave Practise mindfulness Ananda Lord what shall we do with the Tathagatas remains Do not worry yourselves about the funeral arrangements AnandaYou should strive for the highest goal devote yourselves to the highest goal and dwell with your minds tirelessly zealously devoted to the highest goalThere are wise Khattiyas Brahmins and householders who are devoted to the Tathagata they will take care of the funeralBut Lord what are we to do with the Tathagatas remains Ananda they should be dealt with like the remains of a wheelturning monarchAnd how is that Lord Ananda the remains of a wheelturning monarch are wrapped in a new linencloth This they wrap in teased cotton wool and this in a new clothHaving done this five hundred times each they enclose the kings body in an oilvat of iron which is covered with another iron pot Then having made a funeralpyre of all manner of perfumes they cremate the kings bodyand they raise a stupa at a crossroadsThat Ananda is what they do withthe remains of a wheelturning monarch and they should deal with the Tathagatas body in the same wayA stupa should be erected at the crossroads for the TathagataAnd whoever lays wreaths or puts sweet perfumes and colours there with a devout heart will reap benefit and happiness for a long timeThen the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One How Lord should we conduct ourselves towards womenDo not see them AnandaBut Lord if we do see them Do not speak AnandaBut Lord if they should speak to us Then Ananda you should establish mindfulnessThen the Venerable Ananda said How should we act Lord respecting the body of the Tathagata Do not hinder yourselves Ananda to honor the body of the TathagataRather you should strive Ananda and be zealous on your own behalf for your own good Unflinchingly ardently and resolutely you should apply yourselves to your own goodFor there are Ananda wise nobles wise brahmans and wise householders who are devoted to the Tathagata and it is they who will render the honor to the body of the TathagataThen the Venerable Ananda said But how Lord should they act respecting the body of the Tathagata After the same manner Ananda as towards the body of a universal monarchBut how Lord do they act respecting the body of a universal monarch The body of a universal monarch Ananda is first wrapped round with new linen and then with teased cotton wooland so it is done up to five hundred layers of linen and five hundred of cotton wool When that is done the body of the universal monarch is placed in an iron oil vessel which is enclosed in another iron vessel a funeral pyre is built of all kinds of perfumed woods and so the body of the universal monarch is burnedand at a crossroads a stupa is raised for the universal monarchSo it is done Ananda with the body of a universal monarchAnd even Ananda as with the body of a universal monarch so should it be done with the body of the Tathagataand at a crossroads also a stupa should be raised for the TathagataAnd whosoever shall bring to that place garlands or incense or sandalpaste or pay reverence and whose mind becomes calm there  it will be to his well being and happiness for a long timeLord what course should we follow with regard to womenfolk Notseeing nandaBut when there is seeing lord what course should be followed Notaddressing nanda But when we are addressed what course should be followed Mindfulness should be established nanda And lord what course should we follow with regard to the Tathāgatas body You are not to be concerned about the Tathāgatas funeralPlease nanda strive for the true goal be committed to the true goal dwell heedful ardent  resolute for the sake of the true goalThere are wise nobles wise brahmans  wise householders who are highly confident in the Tathāgata They will conduct the Tathāgatas funeral But lord what course should be followed with regard to the Tathāgatas body The course they follow with regard to a wheelturning monarchs body nanda is the course that should be followed with regard to the Tathāgatas body And what lord is the course they follow with regard to a wheelturning monarchs bodynanda they wrap the wheelturning monarchs body in new linen cloth Having wrapped it in new linen cloth they wrap it in teased cottonwool Having wrapped it in teased cottonwool they wrap it in new linen clothHaving done this five hundred times they place the body in an iron oilvat cover it with an iron lid make a pyre composed totally of perfumed substances and cremate the bodyThen they build a burial mound for the wheelturning monarch at a great fourway intersectionThat is the course that they follow with regard to a wheelturning monarchs bodyThe course they follow with regard to a wheelturning monarchs body nanda is the course that should be followed with regard to the Tathāgatas bodyA burial mound for the Tathāgata is to be built at a great fourway intersectionAnd those who offer a garland a scent or a perfume powder there or bow down there or brighten their minds there That will be for their longterm welfare  happinessAnanda there are four persons worthy of a stupaWho are theyA Tathagata Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha is one a Pacceka Buddha is one a disciple of the Tathagata is one and a wheelturning monarch is oneAnd why is each of these worthy of a stupaBecause Ananda at the thought This is the stupa of a Tathagata peoples hearts are made peacefuland then at the breakingup of me body after death they go to a good destiny and rearise in a heavenly worldof a Pacceka Buddhaof a disciple of the Tathagataof a wheelturning monarchThat is the reason and those are the four who are worthy of a stupaThere are four persons Ananda who are worthy of a stupaWho are those fourA Tathagata an Arahant a Fully Enlightened One is worthy of a stupa so also is a Paccekabuddha and a disciple of a Tathagata and a universal monarchAnd why Ananda is a Tathagata an Arahant a Fully Enlightened One worthy of a stupaBecause Ananda at the thought This is the stupa of that Blessed One Arahant Fully Enlightened One the hearts of many people will be calmed and made happyand so calmed and with their minds established in faith therein at the breaking up of the body after death they will be reborn in a realm of heavenly happinessAnd so also at the thought This is the stupa of that Paccekabuddhaor This is the stupa of a disciple of that Tathagata Arahant Fully Enlightened Oneor This is the stupa of that righteous monarch who ruled according to Dhamma  the hearts of many people are calmed and made happyand so calmed and with their minds established in faith therein at the breaking up of the body after death they will be reborn in a realm of heavenly happinessAnd it is because of this Ananda that these four persons are worthy of a stupaThere are these four who are worthy of a burial moundWhich fourA Tathāgata worthy  rightly selfawakened is worthy of a burial mound A Private Buddha a disciple of a Tathāgata a wheelturning monarch is worthy of a burial moundAnd for what reason is a Tathāgata worthy  rightly selfawakened worthy of a burial mound This is the burial mound of a Tathāgata worthy  rightly selfawakened many people will brighten their mindsHaving brightened their minds there thenon the breakup of the body after deaththey will reappear in a good destination a heavenly worldIt is for this reason that a Tathāgata worthy  rightly selfawakened is worthy of a burial moundAnd for what reason is a Private Buddha worthy of a burial mound This is the burial mound of a Private Buddha many people will brighten their mindsHaving brightened their minds there thenon the breakup of the body after deaththey will reappear in a good destination a heavenly worldAnd for what reason is a disciple of a Tathāgata worthy of a burial mound This is the burial mound of a disciple of a Tathāgata many people will brighten their mindsHaving brightened their minds there thenon the breakup of the body after deaththey will reappear in a good destination a heavenly worldAnd for what reason is a wheelturning monarch worthy of a burial mound This is the burial mound of a wheelturning monarch many people will brighten their mindsHaving brightened their minds there thenon the breakup of the body after deaththey will reappear in a good destination a heavenly worldIt is for this reason that a wheelturning monarch is worthy of a burial moundThese are the four who are worthy of a burial moundAnd the Venerable Ananda went into his lodging and stood lamenting leaning on the doorpost Alas I am still a learner with much to do And the Teacher is passing away who was so compassionate to meThen the Lord enquired of the monks where Ananda wasand they told himSo he said to a certain monk Go monk and say to Ananda from me Friend Ananda the Teacher summons youVery good Lord said the monk and did soVery good friend Ananda replied to that monk and he went to the Lord saluted him and sat down to one sideAnd the Lord said Enough Ananda do not weep and wail Have I not already told you that all things that are pleasant and delightful are changeable subject to separation and becoming otherSo how could it be Ananda  since whatever is bom become compounded is subject to decay  how could it be that it should not pass awayFor a long time Ananda you have been in the Tathagatas presence showing lovingkindness in act of body speech and mind beneficially blessedly wholeheartedly and unstintinglyYou have achieved much merit Ananda Make the effort and in a short time you will be free of the corruptions Then the Lord addressed the monks Monks all those who were Arahant fullyenlightened Buddhas in the past have had just such a chief attendant as Anandaand so too will those Blessed Lords who come in the futureMonks Ananda is wiseHe knows when it is the right time for monks to come to see the Tathagata when it is the right time for nuns for male layfollowers for female layfollowers for kings for royal ministers for leaders of other schools and for their pupilsAnanda has four remarkable and wonderful qualitiesWhat are theyIf a company of monks comes to see Ananda they are pleased at the sight of himand when Ananda talks Dhamma to them they are pleasedand when he is silent they are disappointedAnd so it is too with nunswith maleand female layfollowersAnd these four qualities apply to a wheelturning monarchif he is visited by a company of Khattiyasof Brahmins of householders or of ascetics they are pleased at the sight of himand when he talks to themand when he is silent they are disappointedAnd so too it is with AnandaThen the Venerable Ananda went into the vihara and leaned against the doorpost and wept I am still but a learner and still have to strive for my own perfection But alas my Master who was so compassionate towards me is about to pass awayAnd the Blessed One spoke to the bhikkhus saying Where bhikkhus is Ananda The Venerable Ananda Lord has gone into the vihara and there stands leaning against the door post and weeping I am still but a learner and still have to strive for my own perfection But alas my Master who was so compassionate towards me is about to pass awayThen the Blessed One asked a certain bhikkhu to bring the Venerable Ananda to him saying Go bhikkhu and say to Ananda Friend Ananda the Master calls youSo be it Lord And that bhikkhu went and spoke to the Venerable Ananda as the Blessed One had asked him toAnd the Venerable Ananda went to the Blessed One bowed down to him and sat down on one sideThen the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Enough Ananda Do not grieve do not lament For have I not taught from the very beginning that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change separation and severanceOf that which is born come into being compounded and subject to decay how can one say May it not come to dissolution There can be no such state of thingsNow for a long time Ananda you have served the Tathagata with lovingkindness in deed word and thought graciously pleasantly with a whole heart and beyond measureGreat good have you gathered Ananda Now you should put forth energy and soon you too will be free from the taintsThen the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Bhikkhus the Blessed Ones Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of times past also had excellent and devoted attendant bhikkhus such as I have in AnandaAnd so also bhikkhus will the Blessed Ones Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of times to comeCapable and judicious is Ananda bhikkhusfor he knows the proper time for bhikkhus to have audience with the Tathagata and the time for bhikkhunis the time for laymen and for laywomen the time for kings and for ministers of state the time for teachers of other sects and for their followersIn Ananda bhikkhus are to be found four rare and superlative qualitiesWhat are the fourIf bhikkhus a company of bhikkhus should go to see Ananda they become joyful on seeing himand if he then speaks to them of the Dhamma they are made joyful by his discourseand when he becomes silent they are disappointedSo it is also when bhikkhunislaymenor laywomen go to see Ananda they become joyful on seeing himand if he then speaks to them of the Dhamma they are made joyful by his discourseand when he becomes silent they are disappointedIn a universal monarch bhikkhus are to be found four rare and superlative qualitiesWhat are those fourIf bhikkhus a company of nobles should go to see the universal monarch they become joyful on seeing himand if he then speaks they are made joyful by his talkand when he becomes silent they are disappointedSo it is also when a company of brahmans of householders or of ascetics goes to see a universal monarchAnd in just the same way bhikkhus in Ananda are to be found these four rare and superlative qualitiesThen Ven nanda going into a building stood leaning against the door jamb weeping Here I am still in training with work left to do and the total unbinding of my teacher is about to occurthe teacher who has had such sympathy for meThen the Blessed One said to the monks Monks where is nanda Lord Ven nanda having gone into that building stands leaning against the door jamb weeping Here I am still in training with work left to do and the total unbinding of my teacher is about to occurthe teacher who has had such sympathy for meThen the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monk In my name call nanda saying The Teacher calls you my friend Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One the monk went to Ven nanda and on arrival said The Teacher calls you my friend Responding As you say my friend to the monk Ven nanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Enough nanda Dont grieve Dont lament Havent I already taught you the state of growing different with regard to all things dear  appealing the state of becoming separate the state of becoming otherwise What else is there to expectIts impossible that one could forbid anything born existent fabricated  subject to disintegration from disintegratingFor a long time nanda you have waited on the Tathāgata with bodily acts of good willhelpful happy wholehearted without limit with verbal acts of good will with mental acts of good willhelpful happy wholehearted without limitYou are one who has made merit Commit yourself to exertion and soon you will be without effluents Then the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks those Blessed Ones who in the past were worthy ones rightly selfawakened had foremost attendants just as I have had nandaThose Blessed Ones who in the future will be worthy ones rightly selfawakened will have foremost attendants just as I have had nandananda is wiseHe knows This is the time to approach to see the Tathāgata This is the time for monks this the time for nuns this the time for male layfollowers this the time for female layfollowers this the time for kings  their ministers this the time for sectarians this the time for the followers of sectariansThere are these four amazing  astounding qualities in nandaIf a group of monks approaches to see nanda they are

saysBefore they are sated he falls silentThese are the four amazing  astounding qualities in nandaAfter this the Venerable Ananda said Lord may the Blessed Lord not pass away in this miserable little town of wattleanddaub right in the jungle in the back of beyondLord there are other great cities such as Campa Rajagaha Savatthi Saketa Kosambi or VaranasiIn those places there are wealthy Khattiyas Brahmins and householders who are devoted to the Tathagataand they will provide for the Tathagatas funeral in proper style Ananda dont call it a miserable little town of wattleand daub right in the jungle in the back of beyondOnce upon a time Ananda King Mahasudassana was a wheelturning monarch a rightful and righteous king who had conquered the land in four directions and ensured the security of his realm and who possessed the seven treasuresAnd Ananda this King Mahasudassana had this very Kusinara under the name of Kusavati for his capital And it was twelve yojanas long from east to west and seven yojanas wide from north to southKusavati was rich prosperous and wellpopulated crowded with people and wellstocked with foodJust as the devacity of Alakamanda is rich prosperous and wellpopulated crowded with yakkhas and wellstocked with food so was the royal city of KusavatiAnd the city of Kusavati was never free of ten sounds by day or night the sound of elephants horses carriages kettledrums sidedrums lutes singing cymbals and gongs with cries of Eat drink and be merry as tenth And now Ananda go to Kusinara and announce to the Mallas of Kusinara Tonight Vasetthas in the last watch the Tathagata will attain final NibbanaApproach him Vasetthas approach himlest later you should regret it saying The Tathagata passed away in our parish and we did not take the opportunity to see him for the last timeVery good Lord said Ananda and taking robe and bowl he went with a companion to KusinaraWhen this had been said the Venerable Ananda spoke to the Blessed One saying Let it not be Lord that the Blessed One should pass away in this mean place this uncivilized township in the midst of the jungle a mere outpost of the provinceThere are great cities Lord such as Campa Rajagaha Savatthi Saketa Kosambi and Benares  let the Blessed One have his final passing away in one of thoseFor in those cities dwell many wealthy nobles and brahmans and householders who are devotees of the Tathagataand they will render due honor to the remains of the Tathagata  Do not say that Ananda Do not say This mean place this uncivilized township in the midst of the jungle a mere outpost of the provinceIn times long past Ananda there was a king by the name of Maha Sudassana who was a universal monarch a king of righteousness a conqueror of the four quarters of the earth whose realm was established in security and who was endowed with the seven jewelsAnd that King Maha Sudassana Ananda had his royal residence here at Kusinara which was then called Kusavati and it extended twelve yojanas from east to west and seven from north to southAnd mighty Ananda was Kusavati the capital prosperous and well populated much frequented by people and abundantly provided with foodJust as the royal residence of the deities Alakamanda is mighty prosperous and well populated much frequented by deities and abundantly provided with food so was the royal capital of KusavatiKusavati Ananda resounded unceasingly day and night with ten sounds  the trumpeting of elephants the neighing of horses the rattling of chariots the beating of drums and tabours music and song cheers the clapping of hands and cries of Eat drink and be merryGo now Ananda to Kusinara and announce to the Mallas Today Vasetthas in the last watch of the night the Tathagatas Parinibbana will take placeApproach O Vasetthas draw nearDo not be remorseful later at the thought In our township it was that the Tathagatas Parinibbana took place but we failed to see him at the endSo be it Lord And the Venerable Ananda prepared himself and taking bowl and robe went with a companion to KusinaraWhen this was said Ven nanda said to the Blessed One Lord may the Blessed One not totally unbind in this little town this dusty town this branch townshipThere are other great cities Campā Rājagaha Sāvatthī Sāketa Kosambī Bārāṇasī May the Blessed One totally unbind thereIn those cities there are many wealthy noble warriors brahmans  householders who have high confidence in the TathāgataThey will conduct the Tathāgatas funeral  Dont say that nanda Dont say that this little town this dusty town this branch township In the past nanda a king named Mahā Sudassana was a wheelturning monarch a righteous king ruling righteously who was a conqueror of the four directions a stabilizer of his country endowed with the seven treasuresThis Kusinārā was his capital city named Kusāvatī twelve leagues long from east to west seven leagues wide from north to southKusāvatī was powerful rich  wellpopulated crowded with people  prosperousJust as the capital city of the devas named lakamandā is powerful rich  wellpopulated crowded with yakkhas  prosperous in the same way Kusāvatī was powerful rich  wellpopulated crowded with people  prosperousBy day or by night it was never lacking in ten sounds the sound of elephants the sound of horses the sound of carts the sound of drums the sound of tabors the sound of lutes the sound of songs the sound of cymbals the sound of gongs with cries of Eat Drink Snack as the tenthNow nanda go into Kusinārā and announce to the Kusinārā Mallans Tonight Vāsiṭṭhas in the last watch of the night the total unbinding of the Tathāgata will occurCome out Vāsiṭṭhas Come out VāsiṭṭhasDont later regret that The Tathāgatas total unbinding occurred within the borders of our very own town but we didnt get to see him in his final hourResponding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven nanda adjusted his lower robe andtaking his bowl  outer robewent unaccompanied into KusinārāJust then the Mallas of Kusinara were assembled in their meetinghall on some businessAnd Ananda came to them and delivered the Lords wordsAnd when they heard Anandas words the Mallas with their sons daughtersinlaw and wives were struck with anguish and sorrow their minds were overcome with grief so that they were all weeping and tearing their hair Then they all went to the salgrove where the Venerable Ananda wasAnd Ananda thought If I allow the Mallas of Kusinara to salute the Lord individually the night will have passed before they have all paid homageI had better let them pay homage family by family saying Lord the Malla soandso with his children his wife his servants and his friends pays homage at the Lords feet And so he presented them in that way and thus allowed all the Mallas of Kusinara to pay homage to the Lord in the first watchNow at that time the Mallas had gathered in the council hall for some public businessAnd the Venerable Ananda approached them and announced Today Vasetthas in the last watch of the night the Tathagatas Parinibbana will take placeApproach Vasetthas draw nearDo not be remorseful later at the thought In our township it was that the Tathagatas Parinibbana took place but we failed to see him at the endWhen they heard the Venerable Ananda speak these words the Mallas with their sons their wives and the wives of their sons were sorely grieved grieved at heart and afflicted and some with their hair all dishevelled with arms uplifted in despair wept flinging themselves on the ground they rolled from side to side lamenting Too soon has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana Too soon has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana Too soon will the Eye of the World vanish from sightAnd thus afflicted and filled with grief the Mallas with their sons their wives and the wives of their sons went to the Sala Grove the recreation park of the Mallas to the place where the Venerable Ananda wasAnd the thought arose in the Venerable Ananda If I were to allow the Mallas of Kusinara to pay reverence to the Blessed One one by one the night will have given place to dawn before they are all presented to himTherefore let me divide them up according to clan each family in a group and so present them to the Blessed One thus The Malla of such and such a name Lord with his wives and children his attendants and his friends pays homage at the feet of the Blessed OneAnd the Venerable Ananda divided the Mallas up according to clan each family in a group and presented them to the Blessed OneSo it was that the Venerable Ananda caused the Mallas of Kusinara to be presented to the Blessed One by clans each family in a group even in the first watch of the nightNow at that time the Kusinārā Mallans had met for some business in their reception hallVen nanda went to the reception hall and on arrival announced to them Tonight Vāsiṭṭhas in the last watch of the night the total unbinding of the Tathāgata will occurCome out Vāsiṭṭhas Come out VāsiṭṭhasDont later regret that The Tathāgatas total unbinding occurred within the borders of our very own town but we didnt get to see him in his final hourWhen they heard Ven nanda the Mallans together with their sons daughters  wives were shocked saddened their minds overflowing with sorrow Some of them wept tearing at their hair they wept uplifting their arms As if their feet were cut out from under them they fell down and rolled back  forth crying All too soon the Blessed One will totally unbind All too soon the One WellGone will totally unbind All too soon the One with Eyes will disappear from the worldThen the Mallans together with their sons daughters  wivesshocked saddened their minds overflowing with sorrowwent to Ven nanda at Upavattana the Mallans Sal Forest near KusinārāThe thought occurred to Ven nanda If I let the Mallans pay reverence to the Blessed One one by one the night will be over before they have finished paying reverenceWhat if I were to have them pay reverence to the Blessed One arranging them family by family announcing Lord the Mallan named soso together with his children  wives servants  retainers bows down with his head at the Blessed Ones feetSo Ven nanda arranging the Mallans family by family had them pay reverence to the Blessed One Lord the Mallan named soso together with his children  wives servants  retainers bows down with his head at the Blessed Ones feetIn this way Ven nanda got the Mallans to pay reverence to the Blessed One within the first watch of the nightAnd at that time a wanderer called Subhadda was in Kusinara and he heard that the ascetic Gotama was to attain final Nibbana in the final watch of that nightHe thought I have heard from venerable wanderers advanced in years teachers of teachers that a Tathagata a fullyenlightened Buddha only rarely arises in the worldAnd tonight in the last watch the ascetic Gotama will attain final NibbanaNow a doubt has arisen in my mind and I feel sure that the ascetic Gotama can teach me a doctrine to dispel that doubtSo Subhadda went to the Mallas salgrove to where the Venerable Ananda was and told him what he had thoughtReverend Ananda may I be permitted to see the ascetic Gotama But Ananda replied Enough friend Subhadda do not disturb the Tathagata the Lord is wearyAnd Subhadda made his request a second and a third timebut still Ananda refused itBut the Lord overheard this conversation between Ananda and Subhaddaand he called to Ananda Enough Ananda do not hinder Subhadda let him see the TathagataFor whatever Subhadda asks me he will ask in quest of enlightenment and not to annoy meand what I say in reply to his questions he will quickly understandThen Ananda said Go in friend Subhadda the Lord gives you leaveThen Subhadda approached the Lord exchanged courtesies with him and sat down to one sidesaying Venerable Gotama all those ascetics and Brahmins who have orders and followings who are teachers wellknown and famous as founders of schools and popularly regarded as saints like Purana Kassapa Makkhali Gosala Ajita Kesakamball Pakudha Kac cayana Sanjaya Belatthaputta and the Nigantha Nataputta  have they all realised the truth as they all make out or have none of them realised it or have some realised it and some not Enough Subhadda never mind whether all or none or some of them have realised the truthI will teach you Dhamma Subhadda Listen pay close attention and I will speakTes Lord said Subhaddaand the Lord saidIn whatever Dhamma and discipline the Noble Eightfold Path is not found no ascetic is found of the firstthe secondthe thirdor the fourth gradeBut such ascetics can be found of the first second third and fourth grade in a Dhamma and discipline where the Noble Eightfold Path is foundNow Subhadda in this Dhamma and discipline the Noble Eightfold Path is found and in it are to be found ascetics of the first second third and fourth grade Those other schools are devoid of true asceticsbut if in this one the monks were to live the life to perfection the world would not lack for ArahantsTwentynine years of age I was When I wentforth to seek the GoodNow over fifty years have passedSince the day that I went forthTo roam the realm of wisdoms lawOutside of which no ascetic is First secondthirdor fourth degreeOther schools of such are bareBut if here monks live perfectly The world wont lack for Arahants At this the wanderer Subhadda said Excellent Lord excellentIt is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down or to point out the way to one who had got lost or to bring an oil lamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various waysAnd I Lord go for refuge to the Blessed Lord the Dhamma and the SanghaMay I receive the goingforth in the Lords presence May I receive ordinationSubhadda whoever coming from another school seeks the goingforth and ordination in this Dhamma and discipline must wait four months on probationAnd at the end of four months those monks who are established in mind may let him go forth and give him ordination to the status of a monkHowever there can be a distinction of personsLord if those coming from other schools must wait four months on probationI will wait four years and then let them give me the goingforth and the ordinationBut the Lord said to Ananda Let Subhadda go forthVery good Lord said AnandaAnd Subhadda said to the Venerable Ananda Friend Ananda it is a great gain for you all it is very profitable for you that you have obtained the consecration of discipleship in the Teachers presenceThen Subhadda received the goingforth in the Lords presence and the ordinationAnd from the moment of his ordination the Venerable Subhadda alone secluded unwearying zealous and resolute in a short time attained to that for which young men of good family go forth from the household life into homelessness that unexcelled culmination of the holy life having realised it here and now by his own insightand dwelt therein Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is nothing further hereAnd the Venerable Subhadda became another of the ArahantsHe was the last personal disciple of the LordEnd of the fifth recitationsection Now at that time a wandering ascetic named Subhadda was dwelling at KusinaraAnd Subhadda the wandering ascetic heard it said Today in the third watch of the night the Parinibbana of the ascetic Gotama will take placeAnd the thought arose in him I have heard it said by old and venerable wandering ascetics teachers of teachers that the arising of Tathagatas Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones is rare in the worldYet this very day in the last watch of the night the Parinibbana of the ascetic Gotama will take placeNow there is in me a doubt but to this extent I have faith in the ascetic Gotama that he could so teach me the Dhamma as to remove that doubtThen the wandering ascetic Subhadda went to the Sala Grove the recreation park of the Mallas and drew near to the Venerable Ananda and told the Venerable Ananda his thoughtAnd he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Friend Ananda it would be good if I could be allowed into the presence of the ascetic GotamaBut the Venerable Ananda answered him saying Enough friend Subhadda Do not trouble the Tathagata The Blessed One is wearyYet a second and a third time the wandering ascetic Subhadda made his request and a secondand a third time the Venerable Ananda refused himAnd the Blessed One heard the talk between themand he called the Venerable Ananda and said Stop Ananda Do not refuse Subhadda Subhadda Ananda may be allowed into the presence of the TathagataFor whatever he will ask me he will ask for the sake of knowledge and not as an offenceAnd the answer I give him that he will readily understandThereupon the Venerable Ananda said to the wandering ascetic Subhadda Go then friend Subhadda the Blessed One gives you leaveThen the wandering ascetic Subhadda approached the Blessed One and saluted him courteously And having exchanged with him pleasant and civil greetings the wandering ascetic Subhadda seated himself at one sideand addressed the Blessed One saying There are Venerable Gotama ascetics and brahmans who are heads of great companies of disciples who have large retinues who are leaders of schools well known and renowned and held in high esteem by the multitude such teachers as Purana Kassapa Makkhali Gosala Ajita Kesakambali Pakudha Kaccayana Sañjaya Belatthaputta Nigantha Nataputta Have all of these attained realization as each of them would have it believed or has none of them or is it that some have attained realization and others notEnough Subhadda Let it be as it may whether all of them have attained realization as each of them would have it believed or whether none of them has or whether some have attained realization and others notI will teach you the Dhamma Subhadda listen and heed it well and I will speakSo be it LordAnd the Blessed One spoke sayingIn whatsoever Dhamma and Discipline Subhadda there is not found the Noble Eightfold Path neither is there found a true ascetic of the firstsecondthirdor fourth degree of saintlinessBut in whatsoever Dhamma and Discipline there is found the Noble Eightfold Path there is found a true ascetic of the first second third and fourth degrees of saintlinessNow in this Dhamma and Discipline Subhadda is found the Noble Eightfold Path and in it alone are also found true ascetics of the first second third and fourth degrees of saintliness Devoid of true ascetics are the systems of other teachersBut if Subhadda the bhikkhus live righteously the world will not be destitute of arahatsIn age but twentynine was I SubhaddaWhen I renounced the world to seek the GoodFiftyone years have passed since then SubhaddaAnd in all that time a wanderer have I beenIn the domain of virtue and of truthAnd except therein there is no saint And there is none of the second degreenor of the third degreenor of the fourth degree of saintlinessDevoid of true ascetics are the systems of other teachersBut if Subhadda the bhikkhus live righteously the world will not be destitute of arahatsWhen this was said the wandering ascetic Subhadda spoke to the Blessed One saying Excellent O Lord most excellent O LordIt is as if Lord one were to set upright what had been overthrown or to reveal what had been hidden or to show the path to one who had gone astray or to light a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes might see  even so has the Blessed One set forth the Dhamma in many waysAnd so O Lord I take my refuge in the Blessed One the Dhamma and the Community of BhikkhusMay I receive from the Blessed One admission to the Order and also the higher ordinationWhoever Subhadda having been formerly a follower of another creed wishes to receive admission and higher ordination in this Dhamma and Discipline remains on probation for a period of four monthsAt the end of those four months if the bhikkhus are satisfied with him they grant him admission and higher ordination as a bhikkhuYet in this matter I recognize differences of personalitiesIf O Lord whoever having been formerly a follower of another creed wishes to receive admission and higher ordination in this Dhamma and Discipline remains on probation for a period of four months and at the end of those four months if the bhikkhus are satisfied with him they grant him admission and higher ordination as a bhikkhu then I will remain on probation for a period of four years And at the end of those four years if the bhikkhus are satisfied with me let them grant me admission and higher ordination as a bhikkhuBut the Blessed One called the Venerable Ananda and said to him Ananda let Subhadda be given admission into the OrderAnd the Venerable Ananda replied So be it LordThen the wandering ascetic Subhadda said to the Venerable Ananda It is a gain to you friend Ananda a blessing that in the presence of the Master himself you have received the sprinkling of ordination as a discipleSo it came about that the wandering ascetic Subhadda in the presence of the Blessed One received admission and higher ordinationAnd from the time of his ordination the Venerable Subhadda remained alone secluded heedful ardent and resolute And before long he attained to the goal for which a worthy man goes forth rightly from home to homelessness the supreme goal of the holy life and having by himself realized it with higher knowledge he dwelt thereinHe knew Destroyed is birth the higher life is fulfilled nothing more is to be done and beyond this life nothing more remainsAnd the Venerable Subhadda became yet another among the arahatsand he was the last disciple converted by the Blessed One himselfNow on that occasion a wanderer named Subhadda was staying near KusinārāHe heard Tonight in the last watch of the night the total unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will take place Then the thought occurred to him I have heard the old elder wanderers teachers of teachers saying that only once in a long long time do Tathāgatasworthy ones rightly selfawakenedappear in the worldTonight in the last watch of the night the total unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will occurNow there is a doubt that has arisen in me but I have confidence in Gotama the contemplative that he can teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might abandon that doubt So he went to Upavattana the Mallans Sal Forest and on arrival said to Ven nanda I have heard the old elder wanderers teachers of teachers saying that only once in a long long time do Tathāgatasworthy ones rightly selfawakenedappear in the worldTonight in the last watch of the night the total unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will occurNow there is a doubt that has arisen in me but I have confidence in Gotama the contemplative that he can teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might abandon that doubtIt would be good Ven nanda if you would let me see him When this was said Ven nanda said to him Enough friend Subhadda Dont bother the Blessed One The Blessed One is tiredFor a second time For a third time Subhadda the wanderer said to Ven nanda It would be good Ven nanda if you would let me see himFor a third time Ven nanda said to him Enough friend Subhadda Dont bother the Blessed One The Blessed One is tired Now the Blessed One heard the exchange between Ven nanda  Subhadda the wandererand so he said to Ven nanda Enough nanda Dont stand in his way Let him see the TathāgataWhatever he asks me will all be for the sake of knowledge and not to be bothersomeAnd whatever I answer when asked he will quickly understandSo Ven nanda said to Subhadda the wanderer Go ahead friend Subhadda The Blessed One gives you his leave Then Subhadda went to the Blessed One and exchanged courteous greetings with him After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama these contemplatives  brahmans each with his group each with his community each the teacher of his group an honored leader wellregarded by people at largei e  Pūraṇa Kassapa Makkhali Gosāla Ajita Kesakambalin Pakudha Kaccāyana Sañjaya Velaṭṭhaputta  the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta Do they all have direct knowledge as they themselves claim or do they all not have direct knowledge or do some of them have direct knowledge and some of them notEnough Subhadda Put this question aside Do they all have direct knowledge as they themselves claim or do they all not have direct knowledge or do some of them have direct knowledge and some of them not I will teach you the Dhamma Subhadda Listen and pay close attention I will speak As you say lord Subhadda responded to the Blessed OneThe Blessed One saidIn any doctrine  discipline where the noble eightfold path is not ascertained no contemplative of the firstsecondthirdfourth order streamwinner oncereturner nonreturner or arahant is ascertainedBut in any doctrine  discipline where the noble eightfold path is ascertained contemplatives of the first second third fourth order are ascertainedThe noble eightfold path is ascertained in this doctrine  discipline and right here there are contemplatives of the first second third fourth order Other teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplativesAnd if the monks dwell rightly this world will not be empty of arahantsAt age twentynine SubhaddaI went forth seeking what might be skillfuland more than fifty years have passedsince my going forth Subhaddaof the realm of methodical DhammaOutside there is no contemplativeThere is no contemplative of the second orderthere is no contemplative of the third orderthere is no contemplative of the fourth orderOther teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplativesAnd if the monks dwell rightly this world will not be empty of arahantsThen Subhadda the wanderer said Magnificent lord MagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to set out a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed Onethrough many lines of reasoningmade the Dhamma clearI go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of monksLet me obtain the going forth in the Blessed Ones presence let me obtain the acceptanceAnyone Subhadda who has previously belonged to another sect and who desires the going forth  acceptance into this Dhamma  Vinaya must first undergo probation for four monthsIf at the end of four months the monks feel so moved they give him the going forth  accept him into the monks stateBut I know distinctions among individuals in this matter Lord if that is soI am willing to undergo probation for four years If at the end of four years the monks feel so moved let them give me the going forth  accept me into the monks stateThen the Blessed One said to Ven nanda Very well then nanda give Subhadda the going forthAs you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed OneThen Subhadda said to Ven nanda Its a gain for you nanda a great gain that you have been anointed here facetoface with the Teacher with the pupils anointing Then Subhadda the wanderer obtained the going forth in the Blessed Ones presence he obtained acceptanceAnd not long after his acceptancedwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolutehe in no long time entered  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness directly knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for the sake of this worldAnd thus Ven Subhadda became another one of the arahantsthe last of the Blessed Ones directwitness disciples And the Lord said to Ananda Ananda it may be that you will think The Teachers instruction has ceased now we have no teacherIt should not be seen like thisAnanda for what I have taught and explained to you as Dhamma and discipline will at my passing be your teacherAnd whereas the monks are in the habit of addressing one another as friend this custom is to be abrogated after my passingSenior monks shall address more junior monks by their name their clan or as friendwhereas more junior monks are to address their seniors either as Lord or as Venerable SirIf they wish the order may abolish the minor rules after my passing After my passing the monk Channa is to receive the BrahmapenaltyBut Lord what is the Brahmapenalty Whatever the monk Channa wants or sayshe is not to be spoken to admonished or instructed by the monksThen the Lord addressed the monks saying It may be monks that some monk has doubts or uncertainty about the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha or about the path or the practice Ask monks Do not afterwards feel remorse thinking The Teacher was there before us and we failed to ask the Lord face to faceAt these words the monks were silentThe Lord repeated his words a second and a third time and still the monks were silentThen the Lord said Perhaps monks you do not ask out of respect for the TeacherThen monks let one friend tell it to anotherBut still they were silentAnd the Venerable Ananda said It is wonderful Lord it is marvellous I clearly perceive that in this assembly there is not one monk who has doubts or uncertaintyYou Ananda speak from faith But the Tathagata knowsthat in this assembly there is not one monk who has doubts or uncertainty about the Buddha the Dhamma or the Sangha or about the path or the practiceAnanda the least one of these five hundred monks is a StreamWinner incapable of falling into states of woe certain of NibbanaThen the Lord said to the monks Now monks I declare to you all conditioned things are of a nature to decay  strive on untiringlyThese were the Tathagatas last wordsNow the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying It may be Ananda that to some among you the thought will come Ended is the word of the Master we have a Master no longerBut it should not Ananda be so consideredFor that which I have proclaimed and made known as the Dhamma and the Discipline that shall be your Master when I am goneAnd Ananda whereas now the bhikkhus address one another as friend let it not be so when I am goneThe senior bhikkhus Ananda may address the junior ones by their name their family name or as friendbut the junior bhikkhus should address the senior ones as venerable sir or your reverenceIf it is desired Ananda the Sangha may when I am gone abolish the lesser and minor rulesAnanda when I am gone let the higher penalty be imposed upon the bhikkhu ChannaBut what Lord is the higher penalty The bhikkhu Channa Ananda may say what he willbut the bhikkhus should neither converse with him nor exhort him nor admonish himThen the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying It may be bhikkhus that one of you is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha the Dhamma or the Sangha the path or the practice Then question bhikkhus Do not be given to remorse later on with the thought The Master was with us face to face yet face to face we failed to ask himBut when this was said the bhikkhus were silentAnd yet a second and a third time the Blessed One said to them It may be bhikkhus that one of you is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha the Dhamma or the Sangha the path or the practice Then question bhikkhus Do not be given to remorse later on with the thought The Master was with us face to face yet face to face we failed to ask himAnd for a second and a third time the bhikkhus were silentThen the Blessed One said to them It may be bhikkhus out of respect for the Master that you ask no questionsThen bhikkhus let friend communicate it to friendYet still the bhikkhus were silentAnd the Venerable Ananda spoke to the Blessed One saying Marvellous it is O Lord most wonderful it is This faith I have in the community of bhikkhus that not even one bhikkhu is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha the Dhamma or the Sangha the path or the practiceOut of faith Ananda you speak thus But here Ananda the Tathagata knows for certainthat among this community of bhikkhus there is not even one bhikkhu who is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha the Dhamma or the Sangha the path or the practiceFor Ananda among these five hundred bhikkhus even the lowest is a streamenterer secure from downfall assured and bound for enlightenmentAnd the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Behold now bhikkhus I exhort you All compounded things are subject to vanish Strive with earnestnessThis was the last word of the TathagataThen the Blessed One said to Ven nanda Now if the thought occurs to any of youThe teaching has lost its arbitrator we are without a Teacherdo not view it in that wayWhatever Dhamma  Vinaya I have pointed out  formulated for you that will be your Teacher after my passingAt present the monks address one another as friend but after my passing they are not to address one another that wayThe more senior monks are to address the newer monks by their name or clan or as friend The newer monks are to address the more senior monks as venerable or sir After my passing the Saṅghaif it wantsmay rescind the lesser  minor training rules After my passing the monk Channa should be given the brahmapenalty What lord is the brahmapenaltyChanna may say what he wants nandabut he is not to be spoken to instructed or admonished by the monks Then the Blessed One addressed the monks If even a single monk has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha Dhamma or Saṅgha the path or the practice ask Dont later regret that The Teacher was facetoface with us but we didnt bring ourselves to ask a counterquestion in his presence When this was said the monks were silentA second time  A third time the Blessed One said If even one of the monks has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha Dhamma or Saṅgha the path or the practice ask Dont later regret that The Teacher was facetoface with us but we didnt bring ourselves to ask a counterquestion in his presence A third time the monks were silentThen the Blessed One addressed the monks Now if its simply out of respect for the Teacher that you dont asklet a companion inform a companion When this was said the monks were silentThen Ven nanda said to the Blessed One Its amazing lord Its astounding I have confidence in this Saṅgha of monks that there is not even a single monk in this Saṅgha of monks who has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha Dhamma or Saṅgha the path or the practice You nanda speak out of confidence while there is knowledge in the Tathāgatathat there is not even a single monk in this Saṅgha of monks who has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha Dhamma or Saṅgha the path or the practiceOf these  monks the most backward is a streamwinner never again destined for the lower realms certain headed for selfawakeningThen the Blessed One addressed the monks Now then monks I exhort you All fabrications are subject to ending  decay Reach consummation through heedfulnessThat was the Tathāgatas last statementThen the Lord entered the first jhana And leaving that he entered the second the third the fourth jhanaThen leaving the fourth jhana he entered the Sphere of Infinite Space then the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness then the Sphere of No Thingness then the Sphere of NeitherPerceptionNorNon Perception and leaving that he attained the Cessation of Feeling and Perception Then the Venerable Ananda said to the Venerable Anu ruddha Venerable Anuruddha the Lord has passed awayNo friend Ananda the Lord has not passed away he has attained the Cessation of Feeling and PerceptionThen the Lord leaving the attainment of the Cessation of Feeling and Perception entered the Sphere of NeitherPer ceptionNorNonPerception from that he entered the Sphere of NoThingness the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness the Sphere of Infinite Space From the Sphere of Infinite Space he entered the fourth jhana from there the third the second and the first jhana Leaving the first jhana he entered the second the third the fourth jhana And leaving the fourth jhana the Lord finally passed awayAnd at the Blessed Lords final passing there was a great earthquake terrible and hairraisingaccompanied by thunderAnd Brahma Sahampati uttered this verseAll beings in the world all bodies must break upEven the Teacher peerless in the human worldThe mighty Lord and perfect Buddhas passed awayAnd Sakka ruler of the devas uttered this verseImpermanent are compounded things prone to rise and fallHaving risen theyre destroyed their passing truest bliss And the Venerable Anuruddha uttered this verseNo breathing in and out  just with steadfast heartThe Sage whos free from lust has passed away to peaceWith mind unshaken he endured all painsBy Nibbana the Illumineds mind is freedAnd the Venerable Ananda uttered this verseTerrible was the quaking mens hair stood on endWhen the allaccomplished Buddha passed awayAnd those monks who had not yet overcome their passions wept and tore their hair raising their arms throwing themselves down and twisting and turning crying All too soon the Blessed Lord has passed away all too soon the Well Farer has passed away all too soon the Eye of the World has disappearedBut those monks who were free from craving endured mindfully and clearly aware saying All compounded things are impermanent  what is the use of thisThen the Venerable Anuruddha said Friends enough of your weeping and wailingHas not the Lord already told you that all things that are pleasant and delightful are changeable subject to separation and to becoming otherSo why all this friendsWhatever is bom become compounded is subject to decay it cannot be that it does not decayThe devas friends are grumblingVenerable Anuruddha what kind of devas are you aware of Friend Ananda there are skydevas whose minds are earthbound they are weeping and tearing their hair  And there are earthdevas whose minds are earthbound they do likewiseBut those devas who are free from craving endure patiently saying All compounded things are impermanent What is the use of this Then the Venerable Anuruddha and the Venerable Ananda spent the rest of the night in conversation on DhammaAnd the Venerable Anuruddha said Now go friend Ananda to Kusinara and announce to the Mallas Vasetthas the Lord has passed away Now is the time to do as you think fitYes Lord said Ananda and having dressed in the morning and taken his robe and bowl he went with a companion to KusinaraAt that time the Mallas of Kusinara were assembled in their meetinghall on some businessAnd the Venerable Ananda came to them and delivered the Venerable Anuruddhas messageAnd when they heard the Venerable Anandas words the Mallas  were struck with anguish and sorrow their minds were overcome with grief so that they were all tearing their hairAnd the Blessed One entered the first jhana Rising from the first jhana he entered the second jhana Rising from the second jhana he entered the third jhana Rising from the third jhana he entered the fourth jhanaAnd rising out of the fourth jhana he entered the sphere of infinite space Rising from the attainment of the sphere of infinite space he entered the sphere of infinite consciousness Rising from the attainment of the sphere of infinite consciousness he entered the sphere of nothingness Rising from the attainment of the sphere of nothingness he entered the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception And rising out of the attainment of the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception he attained to the cessation of perception and feelingAnd the Venerable Ananda spoke to the Venerable Anuruddha saying Venerable Anuruddha the Blessed One has passed awayNo friend Ananda the Blessed One has not passed away He has entered the state of the cessation of perception and feelingThen the Blessed One rising from the cessation of perception and feeling entered the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception Rising from the attainment of the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception he entered the sphere of nothingness Rising from the attainment of the sphere of nothingness he entered the sphere of infinite consciousness Rising from the attainment of the sphere of infinite consciousness he entered the sphere of infinite space Rising from the attainment of the

and wreaths and all the musicians and with five hundred sets of garments they went to the salgrove where the Lords body was lying And there they honoured paid respects worshipped and adored the Lords body with dance and song and music with garlands and scents making awnings and circular tents in order to spend the day thereAnd they thought It is too late to cremate the Lords body today We shall do so tomorrowAnd so paying homage in the same way they waited for a second a third a fourth a fifth a sixth dayAnd on the seventh day the Mallas of Kusinara thought We have paid sufficient honour with song and dance to the Lords body now we shall burn his body after carrying him out by the south gateThen eight Malla chiefs having washed their heads and put on new clothes declared Now we will lift up the Lords body but found they were unable to do soSo they went to the Venerable Anuruddha and told him what had happened Why cant we lift up the Lords body Vasetthas your intention is one thing but the intention of the devas is anotherLord what is the intention of the devas Vasetthas your intention is having paid homage to the Lords body with dance and song to bum his body after carrying him out by the south gate But the devas intention is having paid homage to the Lords body with heavenly dance and song to carry him to the north of the city bring him in through the north gate and bear him through the middle of the city and out through the eastern gate to the Mallas shrine of Makuta Bandhana and there to bum the bodyLord if that is the devas intention so be itAt that time even the sewers and rubbishheaps of Kusinara were covered kneehigh with coraltree flowersAnd the devas as well as the Mallas of Kusinara honoured the Lords body with divine and human dancing song and they carried the body to the north of the city brought it in through the north gate through the middle of the city and out through the eastern gate to the Mallas shrine of Makuta Bandhana where they set the body downThen they asked the Venerable Ananda Lord how should we deal with the body of the Tathagata Vasetthas you should deal with the Tathagatas body as you would that of a wheelturning monarchAnd how do they deal with that LordVasetthas the remains are wrapped in a new linencloth This they wrap in teased cottonwoolthen having made a funeralpyre of all manner of perfumes they cremate the kings bodyand they raise a stupa at a cross roadsThen the Mallas ordered their men to bring their teased cottonwoolAnd they dealt with the Tathagatas body accordinglyThen the Mallas of Kusinara gave orders to their men saying Gather now all the perfumes flowergarlands and musicians even all that are in KusinaraAnd the Mallas with the perfumes the flowergarlands and the musicians and with five hundred sets of clothing went to the Sala Grove the recreation park of the Mallas and approached the body of the Blessed One And having approached they paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and erecting canopies and pavilions they spent the day showing respect honor and veneration to the body of the Blessed OneAnd then the thought came to them Now the day is too far spent for us to cremate the body of the Blessed One Tomorrow we will do itAnd for the second day and a third fourth fifth and sixth day they paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and erecting canopies and pavilions they spent the day showing respect honor and veneration to the body of the Blessed OneBut on the seventh day the thought came to them We have paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and have shown respect honor and veneration let us now carry the body of the Blessed One southward to the southern part of the town and beyond and let us there cremate the body of the Blessed One south of the townAnd eight Mallas of the foremost families bathed from the crown of their heads and wearing new clothes with the thought We will lift up the body of the Blessed One tried to do so but they could notThen the Mallas spoke to the Venerable Anuruddha saying What is the cause Venerable Anuruddha what is the reason that these eight Mallas of the foremost families bathed from the crown of their heads and wearing new clothes with the thought We will lift up the body of the Blessed One try to do so but cannot You Vasetthas have one purpose the deities have anotherThen what venerable sir is the purpose of the deities Your purpose Vasetthas is this We have paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and have shown respect honor and veneration let us now carry the body of the Blessed One southward to the southern part of the town and beyond and let us there cremate the body of the Blessed One south of the town But the purpose of the deities Vasetthas is this We have paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with heavenly dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and have shown respect honor and veneration let us now carry the body of the Blessed One northward to the northern part of the town and having carried it through the northern gate let us go through the center of the town and then eastward to the east of the town and having passed through the east gate let us carry it to the cetiya of the Mallas Makutabandhana and there let us cremate the body of the Blessed OneAs the deities wish venerable sir so let it beThereupon the whole of Kusinara even to the dust heaps and rubbish heaps became covered kneedeep in mandarava flowersAnd homage was paid to the body of the Blessed One by the deities as well as the Mallas of Kusinara With dance song music flowergarlands and perfume both divine and human respect honor and veneration were shown And they carried the body of the Blessed One northward to the northern part of the town and having carried it through the northern gate they went through the center of the town and then eastward to the east of the town and having passed through the east gate they carried the body of the Blessed One to the cetiya of the Mallas Makutabandhana and there laid it downThen the Mallas of Kusinara spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying How should we act Venerable Ananda respecting the body of the Tathagata After the same manner Vasetthas as towards the body of a universal monarchBut how venerable Ananda do they act respecting the body of a universal monarch The body of a universal monarch Vasetthas is first wrapped round with new linen and then with teased cotton wool And again it is wrapped round with new linen and again with teased cotton wool and so it is done up to five hundred layers of linen and five hundred of cotton woolWhen that is done the body of the universal monarch is placed in an iron oilvessel which is enclosed in another iron vessel and a funeral pyre is built of all kinds of perfumed woods and so the body of the universal monarch is burnedAnd at a crossroads a stupa is raised for the universal monarchSo it is done Vasetthas with the body of a universal monarchAnd even Vasetthas as with the body of a universal monarch so should it be done with the body of the Tathagataand at a crossroads also a stupa should be raised for the TathagataAnd whoever shall bring to that place garlands or incense or sandalwood paste or pay reverence and whose mind becomes calm there  it will be to his well being and happiness for a long timeThen the Mallas gave orders to their men saying Gather now all the teased cotton wool of the MallasAnd the Mallas of Kusinara wrapped the body of the Blessed One round with new linen and then with teased cotton woolAnd again they wrapped it round with new linen and again with teased cotton wool and so it was done up to five hundred layers of linen and five hundred of cotton wool When that was done they placed the body of the Blessed One in an iron oilvessel which was enclosed in another iron vessel and they built a funeral pyre of all kinds of perfumed woods and upon it they laid the body of the Blessed OneThen the Kusinārā Mallans ordered their men In that case I say gather scents garlands  all the musical instruments in KusinārāThen taking scents garlands  all the musical instruments in Kusinārā along with  pairs of cloth the Kusinārā Mallans went to the Blessed Ones body in Upavattana the Mallans Sal Forest near Kusinārā On arrival they spent the entire day in worshipping honoring respecting  venerating the Blessed Ones body with dances songs music garlands  scents in making cloth canopies and arranging floral wreathsThen the thought occurred to them Its too late today to cremate the Blessed Ones body Well cremate the Blessed Ones body tomorrow And so they spent the second day the third day the fourth day the fifth day the sixth day in worshipping honoring respecting  venerating the Blessed Ones body with dances songs music garlands  scents in making cloth canopies and arranging floral wreathsThen on the seventh day the thought occurred to them Worshipping honoring respecting  venerating to the Blessed Ones body with dances songs music garlands  scents lets carry it to the south around the outside of the town and cremate it to the south of the town Then eight leading Mallans having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth thinking Well lift up the Blessed Ones body were unable to lift itSo the Kusinārā Mallans asked Ven Anuruddha What is the reason Ven Anuruddha what is the cause why these eight leading Mallans having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth thinking Well lift up the Blessed Ones body are unable to lift it Your intention Vāsiṭṭhas is one thing The devas intention is anotherBut what Ven Anuruddha is the devas intention Your intention Vāsiṭṭhas is Worshipping honoring respecting  venerating the Blessed Ones body with dances songs music garlands  scents lets carry it to the south around the outside of the town and cremate it to the south of the town  The devas intention is Worshipping honoring respecting  venerating the Blessed Ones body with heavenly dances songs music garlands  scents lets carry it to the north of the town enter the town through the north gate carry it through the middle of the town and out the east gate to the Mallans shrine called Makuṭabandhana to cremate it thereThen let it be venerable sir in line with the devas intention Now on that occasion Kusinārāeven to its rubbish heaps  cesspoolswas strewn kneedeep in coraltree flowersSo the devas  the Kusinārā Mallans worshipping honoring respecting  venerating the Blessed Ones body with heavenly  human dances songs music garlands  scents carried it to the north of the town entered the town through the north gate carried it through the middle of the town and out the east gate to the Mallans shrine called Makuṭabandhana There they set it downThen the Kusinārā Mallans said to Ven nanda Venerable sir what course should we follow with regard to the Tathāgatas body The course they follow with regard to a wheelturning monarchs body Vāsiṭṭhas is the course that should be followed with regard to the Tathāgatas body And what venerable sir is the course they follow with regard to a wheelturning monarchs body Vāsiṭṭhas they wrap the wheelturning monarchs body in new linen cloth Having wrapped it in new linen cloth they wrap it in teased cottonwool Having wrapped it in teased cottonwool they wrap it in new linen clothHaving done this five hundred times they place the body in an iron oilvat cover it with an iron lid make a pyre composed totally of perfumed substances and cremate the bodyThen they build a burial mound for the wheelturning monarch at a great fourway intersectionThat is the course that they follow with regard to the wheelturning monarchs bodyThe course they follow with regard to a Vāsiṭṭhas is the course that should be followed with regard to the Tathāgatas bodyA burial mound for the Tathāgata is to be built at a great fourway intersectionAnd those who offer a garland a scent or a perfume powder there or bow down there or brighten their minds there that will be for their longterm welfare  happiness So the Kusinārā Mallans ordered their men In that case I say gather the Mallans teased cottonwool Then they wrapped the Blessed Ones body in new linen cloth Having wrapped it in new linen cloth they wrapped it in teased cottonwool Having wrapped it in teased cottonwool they wrapped it in new linen clothHaving done this five hundred times they placed the body in an iron oilvat covered it with an iron lid made a pyre composed totally of perfumed substances and set the body on the pyreNow just then the Venerable Kassapa the Great was travelling along the main road from Pava to Kusinara with a large company of about five hundred monksAnd leaving the road the Venerable Kassapa the Great sat down under a treeAnd a certain Ajivika chanced to be coming along the main road towards Pava and he had picked a coraltree flower in KusinaraThe Venerable Kassapa saw him coming from afar and said to him Friend do you know our Teacher Yes friend I do The ascetic Gotama passed away a week agoI picked this coraltree flower thereAnd those monks who had not yet overcome their passions wept and tore their hair But those monks who were free from craving endured mindfully and clearly aware saying All compounded things are impermanent  what is the use of thisAnd sitting in the group was one Subhadda who had gone forth late in life and he said to those monksEnough friends do not weep and wail We are well rid of the Great AsceticWe were always bothered by his saying It is fitting for you to do this it is not fitting for you to do thatNow we can do what we like and not do what we dont likeBut the Venerable Kassapa the Great said to the monks Friends enough of your weeping and wailingHas not the Lord already told you that all things that are pleasant and delightful are changeable subject to separation and becoming otherSo why all this friendsWhatever is bom become compounded is subject to decay it cannot be that it does not decayMeanwhile four Malla chiefs having washed their heads and put on new clothes said We will light the Lords funeral pyre but they were unable to do soThey went to the Venerable Anuruddha and asked him why this wasVasetthas your intention is one thing but that of the devas is anotherWell Lord what is the intention of the devas Vasetthas the devas intention is this The Venerable Kassapa the Great is coming along the main road from Pava to Kusinara with a large company of five hundred monksThe Lords funeral pyre will not be lit until the Venerable Kassapa the Great has paid homage with his head to the Lords feetLord if that is the devas intention so be itThen the Venerable Kassapa the Great went to the Mallas shrine at MakutaBandhana to the Lords funeral pyre and covering one shoulder with his robe joined his hands in salutation circumambulated the pyre three times and uncovering the Lords feet paid homage with his head to themand the five hundred monks did likewiseAnd when this was done the Lords funeral pyre ignited of itselfAnd when the Lords body was burnt what had been skin underskin flesh sinew or jointfluid all that vanished and not even ashes or dust remained only the bones remainedJust as when butter or oil is burnt no ashes or dust remain so it was with the Lords body only the bones were leftAnd all the five hundred garments even the innermost and the outermost cloth were burnt upAnd when the Lords body was burnt up a shower of water from the skyand another which burst forth from the saltrees extinguished the funeral pyreAnd the Mallas of Kusinara poured perfumed water over it for the same purposeThen the Mallas honoured the relics for a week in their assembly hall having made a latticework of spears and an encircling wall of bows with dancing singing garlands and musicNow at that time the Venerable Maha Kassapa was journeying from Pava to Kusinara together with a large company of five hundred bhikkhusAnd on the way the Venerable Maha Kassapa went aside from the highway and sat down at the foot of a treeAnd a certain Ajivaka came by on his way to Pava and he had taken a mandarava flower from KusinaraAnd the Venerable Maha Kassapa saw the Ajivaka coming from a distance and as he drew close he spoke to him saying Do you know friend anything of our Master Yes friend I know It is now seven days since the ascetic Gotama passed awayFrom there I have brought this mandarava flowerThereupon some bhikkhus not yet freed from passion lifted up their arms and wept and some flinging themselves on the ground rolled from side to side and wept lamenting Too soon has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana Too soon has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana Too soon has the Eye of the World vanished from sightNow at that time one Subhadda who had renounced only in his old age was seated in the assemblyAnd he addressed the bhikkhus saying Enough friends Do not grieve do not lament We are well rid of that great asceticToo long friends have we been oppressed by his saying This is fitting for you that is not fitting for youNow we shall be able to do as we wish and what we do not wish that we shall not doBut the Venerable Maha Kassapa addressed the bhikkhus saying Enough friends Do not grieve do not lamentFor has not the Blessed One declared that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change separation and severancehow can one sayOf that which is born come into being compounded and subject to decay  May it not come to dissolutionNow at that time four Mallas of the foremost families bathed from the crown of their heads and wearing new clothes with the thought We will set alight the Blessed Ones pyre tried to do so but they could notAnd the Mallas spoke to the Venerable Anuruddha saying What is the cause Venerable Anuruddha what is the reason that these four Mallas of the foremost families bathed from the crown of their heads and wearing new clothes with the thought We will set alight the Blessed Ones pyre try to do so but cannot You Vasetthas have one purpose the deities have anotherThen what venerable sir is the purpose of the deities The purpose of the deities Vasetthas is this The Venerable Maha Kassapa is on his way from Pava to Kusinara together with a large company of five hundred bhikkhusLet not the Blessed Ones pyre be set alight until the Venerable Maha Kassapa has paid homage at the feet of the Blessed OneAs the deities wish venerable sir so let it beAnd the Venerable Maha Kassapa approached the pyre of the Blessed One at the cetiya of the Mallas Makutabandhana in Kusinara And he arranged his upper robe on one shoulder and with his clasped hands raised in salutation he walked three times round the pyre keeping his right side towards the Blessed Ones body and he paid homage at the feet of the Blessed OneAnd even so did the five hundred bhikkhusAnd when homage had been paid by the Venerable Maha Kassapa and the five hundred bhikkhus the pyre of the Blessed One burst into flame by itselfAnd it came about that when the body of the Blessed One had been burned no ashes or particles were to be seen of what had been skin tissue flesh sinews and fluid only bones remainedJust as when ghee or oil is burned it leaves no particles or ashes behind even so when the body of the Blessed One had been burned no ashes or particles were to be seen of what had been skin tissue flesh sinews and fluid only bones remainedAnd of the five hundred linen wrappings only two were not consumed the innermost and the outermostAnd when the body of the Blessed One had been burned water rained down from heaven and extinguished the pyre of the Blessed Oneand from the sala trees water came forthand the Mallas of Kusinara brought water scented with many kinds of perfumes and they too extinguished the pyre of the Blessed OneAnd the Mallas of Kusinara laid the relics of the Blessed One in their council hall and surrounded them with a latticework of spears and encircled them with a fence of bows and there for seven days they paid homage to the relics of the Blessed One with dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and showed respect honor and veneration to the relics of the Blessed OneNow on that occasion Ven Mahā Kassapa was traveling on the highway from Pāvā to Kusinārā with a large Saṅgha of monks approximately  monks in allLeaving the road he sat down at the root of a treeMeanwhile a certain jīvakan ascetic carrying a coraltree flower from Kusinārā was traveling on the highway to PāvāVen Mahā Kassapa saw the jīvakan ascetic coming from afar and on seeing him said to him Do you know our teacher friendYes friend I know him Seven days ago Gotama the contemplative totally unboundThats how I got this coraltree flowerWith that some of the monks present who were not without passion wept uplifting their arms As if their feet were cut out from under them they fell down and rolled back  forth crying All too soon has the Blessed One totally unbound All too soon has the One WellGone totally unbound All too soon has the One with Eyes disappeared from the worldBut those monks who were free from passion acquiesced mindful  alert Inconstant are fabrications What else is there to expect Now at that time a monk named Subhadda who had gone forth when old was sitting among the groupHe said to the monks Enough friends Dont grieve Dont lament Were well rid of the Great ContemplativeWeve been harassed by This is allowable This is not allowable But now we will do what we want to do and not do what we dont want to do Then Ven Mahā Kassapa addressed the monks Enough friends Dont grieve Dont lamentHasnt the Blessed One already taught the state of growing different with regard to all things dear  appealing the state of becoming separate the state of becoming otherwiseWhat else is there to expectIts impossible that one could forbid anything born existent fabricated  subject to disintegration from disintegrating Then four leading Mallans having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth thinking Well ignite the Blessed Ones pyre were unable to ignite itSo the Kusinārā Mallans asked Ven Anuruddha What is the reason Ven Anuruddha what is the cause why these four leading Mallans having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth thinking Well ignite the Blessed Ones pyre are unable to ignite it Your intention Vāsiṭṭhas is one thing The devas intention is another But what Ven Anuruddha is the devas intention The devas intention Vāsiṭṭhas is This Ven Mahā Kassapa is traveling on the highway from Pāvā to Kusinārā with a large Saṅgha of monks approximately  monks in allThe Blessed Ones pyre will not catch fire until Ven Mahā Kassapa has worshipped the Blessed Ones feet with his bathed headThen let it be venerable sir in line with the devas intention So Ven Mahā Kassapa went to the Blessed Ones pyre at Makuṭabandhana the Mallans memorial near Kusinārā On arrival arranging his robe over one shoulder he placed his hands palmtopalm over his heart circumambulated the pyre three times uncovered the Blessed Ones feet and worshipped them with his headAnd the  monks arranging their robes over one shoulder placed their hands palmtopalm over their hearts circumambulated the pyre three times and worshipped the Blessed Ones feet with their headsAs soon as it had been worshipped by Ven Mahā Kassapa and the  monks the Blessed Ones pyre caught fire of its own accordIn the burning of the Blessed Ones body no cinder or ash of the outer skin inner skin flesh tendons or oil of the joints could be discerned Only the bonerelics remainedJust as in the burning of ghee or oil no cinder or ash can be discerned in the same way in the burning of the Blessed Ones body no cinder or ash of the outer skin inner skin flesh tendons or oil of the joints could be discerned Only the bonerelics remainedAnd of the five hundred twinwrappings only two were burnt the innermost  the outermostWhen the Blessed Ones body was consumed a cascade of water falling from the sky extinguished nibbāpesi the Blessed Ones pyreWater shooting up from a Sal tree as well extinguished the Blessed Ones pyreThe Kusinārā Mallans with all kinds of scented water extinguished the Blessed Ones pyreThen for seven days the Kusinārā Mallans kept the bonerelics in their reception hallsetting them round with a lattice of spears surrounded by ramparts of bowsworshipping honoring respecting  venerating them with dances songs music garlands  scentsAnd King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha heard that the Lord had passed away at KusinaraAnd he sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara The Lord was a Khattiya and I am a Khattiya I am worthy to receive a share of the Lords remains I will make a great stupa for themThe Licchavis of Vesall heardand they sent a message The Lord

remains and we will make a great stupa for themOn hearing all this the Mallas of Kusinara addressed the crowd saying The Lord passed away in our parish We will not give away any share of the Lords remainsAt this the Brahmin Dona addressed the crowd in this verseListen lords to my proposalForbearance is the Buddhas teachingIt is not right that strife should come From sharing out the best of mens remainsLets all be joined in harmony and peaceIn friendship sharing out portions eightLet stupas far and wide be put upThat all may see  and gain in faithWell then Brahmin you divide up the remains of the Lord in the best and fairest wayVery good friends said Dona And he made a good and fair division into eight portions and then said to the assembly Gentlemen please give me the urn and I will erect a great stupa for itSo they gave Dona the urnNow the Moriyas of Pipphalavana heard of the Lords passingand they sent a message The Lord was a Khattiya and we are Khattiyas We are worthy to receive a

Once the Lord was staying at Kusinara in the Mallas salgrove shortly before his final Nibbana between the twin saltreesThe Venerable Ananda came to the Lord saluted him sat down to one sideand said Lord may the Blessed Lord not pass away in this miserable little town of wattleanddaub right in the jungle in the back of beyondLord there are other great citiessuch as Campa Rajagaha Savatthi Saketa Kosambi or VaranasiIn those places there are wealthy Khattiyas Brahmins and householders who are devoted to the Tathagata and they will provide for the Tathagatas funeral in proper styleAnanda dont call it a miserable little town of wattleanddaub right in the jungle in the back of beyondOnce upon a time Ananda King Mahasudassana was a wheel turning monarch a rightful and righteous king who had conquered the land in four directions and ensured the security of his realmAnd this King Mahasudassana had this very Kusinara under the name of Kusavati for his capitalAnd it was twelve yojanas long from east to west and seven yojanas wide from north to southKusavati was rich prosperous and wellpopulated crowded with people and wellstocked with foodJust as the devacity of Alakamanda is rich  so was the royal city of KusavatiAnd the city of Kusavati was never free of ten sounds by day or night the sound of elephants horses carriages kettledrums sidedrums lutes singing cymbals and gongs with cries of Eat drink and be merry as tenthThe royal city of Kusavati was surrounded by seven encircling wallsOne was of gold one silver one beryl one crystal one ruby one emerald and one of all sorts of gemsAnd the gates of Kusavati were of four coloursone gold one silver one beryl one crystalAnd before each gate were set seven pillars three or four times a mans heightOne was of gold one silver one beryl one crystal one ruby one emerald and one of all sorts of gemsKusavati was surrounded by seven rows of palmtreesof the same materialsThe gold trees had gold trunks with silver leaves and fruitthe silver trees had silver trunks with gold leaves and fruitThe beryl trees had beryl trunks with crystal leaves and fruitthe crystal trees had crystal trunks with beryl leaves and fruitThe ruby trees had ruby trunks and emerald leaves and fruitthe emerald trees had emerald trunks and ruby leaves and fruitwhile the trees of all sorts of gems were the same as regards trunks leaves and fruitThe sound of the leaves stirred by the wind was lovely delightful sweet and intoxicatingjust like that of the five kinds of musical instruments played in concert by welltrained and skilful playersAnd Ananda those who were libertines and drunkards in Kusavati had their desires assuaged by the sound of the leaves in the windKing Mahasudassana was endowed with the seven treasures and the four propertiesWhat are the sevenOnce on a fastday of the fifteenth when the King had washed his head and gone up io the verandah on top of his palace to observe the fastday the divine WheelTreasure appeared to him thousandspoked complete with felloe hub and all appurtenancesOn seeing it King Mahasudassana thought I have heard that when a duly anointed Khattiya king sees such a wheel on the fastday of the fifteenth he will become a wheelturning monarchMay I become such a monarchThen rising from his seat covering one shoulder with his robe the King took a gold vessel in his left hand sprinkled the Wheel with his right hand and said May the noble WheelTreasure turn may the noble WheelTreasure conquerThe Wheel turned to the east and King Mahasudassana followed it with his fourfold army And in whatever country the Wheel stopped the King took up residence with his fourfold armyAnd those kings who faced him in the eastern region came and said Come Your Majesty welcome We are yours Your Majesty Rule us Your MajestyAnd the King said Do not take life Do not take what is not given Do not commit sexual misconduct Do not tell lies Do not drink strong drink Be moderate in eatingAnd those who had faced him in the eastern region became his subjectsAnd when the Wheel had plunged into the eastern sea it emerged and turned south and King Mahasudassana followed it with his fourfold army And those Kingsbecome his subjects Having plunged into the southern sea it turned west having plunged into the western sea it turned north and King Mahasudassana followed it with his fourfold army having plunged into the western sea it turned north and King Mahasudassana followed it with his fourfold armyand those who had faced him in the northern region became his subjectsThen the WheelTreasure having conquered the lands from sea to sea returned to the royal capital of Kusavati and stopped before the Kings palace as he was trying a case as if to adorn the royal palaceAnd this is how the WheelTreasure appeared to King MahasudassanaThen the ElephantTreasure appeared to King Mahasudassana pure white of sevenfold strength with the wonderful power of travelling through the air a royal tusker called UposathaSeeing him the King thought What a wonderful ridingelephant if only he could be brought under controlAnd this ElephantTreasure submitted to control just like a thoroughbred that had been trained for a long timeAnd once the King to try him mounted the ElephantTreasure at crack of dawn and rode him from sea to sea returning to Kusavati in time for breakfastAnd that is how the ElephantTreasure appeared to King MahasudassanaThen the HorseTreasure appeared to King Mahasudassana with a crows head darkmaned with the wondrous power of travelling through the air a royal stallion called ValahakaAnd the King thought What a wonderful mount if only he could be brought under controlAnd this HorseTreasure submitted to control just like a thoroughbred that had been trained for a long timeAnd that is how the HorseTreasure appeared to King MahasudassanaThen the JewelTreasure appeared to King MahasudassanaIt was a beryl pure excellent wellcut into eight facets clear bright unflawed perfect in every respectThe lustre of this JewelTreasure radiated for an entire yojana round aboutAnd once the King to try it went on nightmanoeuvres on a dark night with his fourfold army with the JewelTreasure fixed to the top of his standardAnd all who lived in the villages round about started their daily work thinking it was daylightAnd that is how the JewelTreasure appeared to King MahasudassanaThen the WomanTreasure appeared to King Mahasudassana lovely fair to see charming with a lotuslike complexion not too tall or too short not too thin or too fat not too dark or too fair of more than human devalike beautyAnd the touch of the skin of the WomanTreasure was like cotton or silk and her limbs were cool when it was hot and warm when it was coldHer body smelt of sandalwood and her lips of lotusThis WomanTreasure rose before the King and retired laterand was always willing to do his pleasure and she was pleasant of speechAnd this WomanTreasure was not unfaithful to the King even in thought much less in deedAnd that is how the WomanTreasure appeared to King MahasudassanaThen the HouseholderTreasure appeared to King MahasudassanaWith the divine eye which as the result of kamma he possessed he saw where treasure owned and ownerless was hiddenHe came to the King and said Have no fear Your Majesty I will look after your wealth properlyAnd once the King to try him went on board a ship and had it taken to the current in the middle of the Ganges Then he said to the HouseholderTreasure Householder I want some gold coinWell then Sire let the ship be brought to one bankI want the gold coins hereThen the householder touched the water with both hands and drew out a vessel full of gold coins saying Is that enough Sire Will that do Sireand the King said That is enough householder that will do you have served me enoughAnd that is how the HouseholderTreasurer appeared to King MahasudassanaThen the CounsellorTreasure appeared to King Mahasudassana He was wise experienced clever and competent to advise the King on how to proceed with what should be proceeded with and to withdraw from what should be withdrawn from and to overlook what should be overlookedHe came to the King and said Have no fear Your Majesty I shall advise youAnd that is how the CounsellorTreasure appeared to King Mahasudassanaand how he was equipped with all the seven treasuresAgain Ananda King Mahasudassana was endowed with the four propertiesWhat are theyFirstly the King was handsome good to look at pleasing with a complexion like the finest lotus surpassing other menSecondly he was longlived outliving other menThirdly he was free from illness free from sickness with a healthy digestion less subject to cold and heat than that of other menFourthly he was beloved and popular with Brahmins and householdersJust as a father is beloved by his children so he was with Brahmins and householdersAnd they were beloved by the Kingas children are beloved by their fatherOnce the King set out for the pleasurepark with his fourfold armyand the Brahmins and householders came to him and said Pass slowly by Sire that we may see you as long as possibleAnd the King said to the charioteer Drive the chariot slowly so that I can see these Brahmins and householders as long as possibleThus King Mahasudassana was endowed with these four propertiesThen King Mahasudassana thought Suppose I were to construct lotusponds between the palmtrees a hundred bowlengths apartAnd he did soThe lotusponds were lined with fourcoloured tiles gold silver beryl and crystaleach pond being approached by four staircases one gold one silver one beryl and one crystalAnd the gold staircase had gold posts with silver railings and banistersthe silver had silver posts with gold railings and banisters and so onAnd the lotusponds were provided with two kinds of parapet gold and silverthe gold parapets having gold posts silver railings and banistersand the silver parapets having silver posts gold railings and banistersThen the King thought Suppose I were to provide each pond with suitable flowers for garlands blue yellow red and white lotuses which will last through all seasons without fadingAnd he did soThen he thought Suppose I were to place bathmen on the banks of these ponds to bathe those who come thereAnd he did soThen he thought Suppose I were to establish charitable posts on the banks of these ponds so that those who want food can get it those who want drink can get it those who want clothes can get it those who want transport can get it those who want a sleepingplace can get it those who want a wife can get one and those who want gold coin can get itAnd he did soThen the Brahmins and householders took great wealth and went to the King saying Sire here is wealth that we have gathered together especially for Your Majesty please accept itThank you friends but I have enough wealth from legitimate revenues Let this be yours and take away more besidesBeing thus refused by the King they withdrew to one side and considered It would not be right for us to take this wealth back home againSuppose we were to build a dwelling for King MahasudassanaSo they went to the King and said Sire we would build you a dwellingand the King accepted by silenceThen Sakka ruler of the gods knowing in his mind King Mahasudassanas thought said to the attendantdeva Vis sakamma Come friend Vissakamma and build a dwelling for King Mahasudassana a palace called Dhamma Very good Lord Vissakamma replied and as swiftly as a strong man might stretch his flexed arm or flex it again he at once vanished from the Heaven of the ThirtyThree and appeared before King Mahasudassanaand said to him Sire I shall build you a dwelling a palace called DhammaThe King assented by silenceand Vissakamma built him the Palace of DhammaThe Palace of Dhamma Ananda was a yojana in length from east to westand half a yojana wide from north to southThe whole palace was faced up to three times a mans height with tiles of four colours gold silver beryl and crystaland it contained eightyfour thousand columns of the same four coloursIt had twentyfour staircases of the same four coloursand the gold staircases had gold posts with silver railings and banistersIt also had eightyfour thousand chambers of the same coloursIn the gold chamber was a silver couch in the silver chamber a gold couch in the beryl chamber an ivory couch and in the crystal chamber a sandalwood couchOn the door of the gold chamber a silver palmtree was figured with silver stem gold leaves and fruitOn the door of the silver chamber a golden palmtree was figured with golden trunk leaves and fruiton the door of the beryl chamber a crystal palmtree was figured with crystal trunk and beryl leaves and fruiton the door of the crystal chamber a beryl palmtree was figured with crystal leaves and fruitThen the King thought Suppose I were to make a grove of palmtrees all of gold by the door of the great gabled chamber where I sit in the daytimeand he did soSurrounding the Dhamma Palace were two parapets one of gold one of silverThe gold one had gold posts silver railings and banistersand the silver one had silver posts gold railings and banistersThe Dhamma Palace was surrounded by two nets of tinkling bellsOne net was gold with silver bells the other silver with gold bellsAnd when these nets of bells were stirred by the wind their sound was lovely delightful sweet and intoxicatingjust like that of the five kinds of musical instruments played in concert by welltrained and skilful playersAnd those who were libertines and drunkards in Kusavati had their desires assuaged by the sound of those nets of bellsAnd when the Dhamma Palace was finished it was hard to look at dazzling to the eyes just as in the last month of the Rains in autumn when there is a clear and cloudless sky the sun breaking through the mists is hard to look at so was the Dhamma Palace when it was finishedThen the King thought Suppose I were to make a lotuslake called Dhamma in front of the Dhamma Palaceso he did soThis lake was a yojana long from east to west and half a yojana wide from north to southand lined with four kinds of tiles gold silver beryl and crystalThere were twentyfour staircases to it of four different kinds gold silver beryl and crystalThe gold staircases had gold posts with silver railings and

intoxicatingjust like that of the five kinds of musical instruments played in concert by welltrained and skilful playersAnd Ananda those who were libertines and drunkards in Kusavati had their desires assuaged by the sound of the leaves in the windWhen the Dhamma Palace and the Dhamma Lake were finished King Mahasudassana having satisfied every wish of those who at the time were ascetics or Brahmins or revered as such ascended into the Dhamma PalaceEnd of first recitationsectionThen King Mahasudassana thought Of what kamma is it the fruit of what kamma is it the result that I am now so mighty and powerfulThen he thought It is the fruit the result of three kinds of kamma of giving selfcontrol and abstinenceThen the King went to the great gabled chamber and standing at the door exclaimed May the thought of lust cease May the thought of illwill cease May the thought of cruelty ceaseThul far and no further the thought of lust of illwill of crueltyThen the King went into the great gabled chamber sat down crosslegged on the golden couch and detached from all sensedesires detached from unwholesome mental states entered and remained in the first jhana which is with thinking and pondering born of detachment filled with delight and joyAnd with the subsiding of thinking and pondering by gaining inner tranquillity and oneness of mind he entered and remained in the second jhana which is without thinking and pondering bom of concentration filled with delight and joyAnd with the fading away of delight remaining imperturbable mindful and clearly aware he experienced in himself that joy of which the Noble Ones say Happy is he who dwells with equanimity and mindfulness he entered and remained in the third jhanaAnd having given up pleasure and pain and with the disappearance of former gladness and sadness he entered and remained in the fourth jhana which is beyond pleasure and pain and purified by equanimity and mindfulnessThen the King emerging from the great gabled chamber went to the golden gabled chamber and seated crosslegged on the silver couch stayed pervading first one quarterthen the second the third and the fourth quarter with a mind filled with lovingkindnessThus he stayed spreading the thought of lovingkindness above below and across everywhere always with a mind filled with lovingkindness abundant magnified unbounded without hatred or

his eightyfour thousand bales of clothing were of the finest linen cotton silk and wool his eightyfour thousand riceofferings were there for the taking by those in need evening and morningAnd at that time King Mahasudassanas eightyfour thousand elephants waited on him everning and morningAnd he thought These eightyfour thousand elephants wait on me evening and morning How if at the end of each century fortytwo thousand elephants were to wait on me turn and turn aboutAnd he gave instructions accordingly to his CounsellorTreasure and so it was doneAnd Ananda after many hundred many hundred thousand years Queen Subhadda thought It is a long time since I saw King MahasudassanaSuppose I were to go and see himSo she said to her women Come now wash your heads and put on clean clothesIt is long since we saw King Mahasudassana We shall go to see himYes Your Majesty they said and prepared themselves as ordered then returned to the QueenAnd Queen Subhadda said to the CounsellorTreasure

and burst into tearsThen wiping away her tears she saidSire all things that are pleasing and attractive are liable to change Do not Sire die filled with longingSoon after this King Mahasudassana diedand just as a householder or his son might feel drowsy after a good meal so he felt the sensation of passing awayand he had a favourable rebirth in the BrahmaworldKing Mahasudassana indulged in boyish sports for eightyfour thousand yearsfor eightyfour thousand years he exercised the viceroyaltyfor eightyfour thousand years he ruled as Kingand for eightyfour thousand years as a layman he lived the holy life in the Dhamma PalaceAnd having practised the four divine abidings at the breakingup of the body he was reborn in the BrahmaworldNow Ananda you might think King Mahasudassana at that time was somebody elseBut you should not regard it so for I was King Mahasudassana thenThose eightyfour thousand cities of which Kusavati was the chief were mineAnd of those eightyfour thousand cities I dwelt in just one Kusavatithe eightyfour thousand riceofferingswere mineof the eightyfour thousand wives I had just one looked after me and she was called Khattiyani or Velamikani of the eightyfour thousand bales of cloth I had just oneof the eightyfour thousand riceofferings there was just one measure of choice curry that I ateSee Ananda how all those conditioned states of the past have vanished and changedThus Ananda conditioned states are impermanent they are unstable they can bring us no comfortand such being the case Ananda we should not rejoice in conditioned states we should cease to take an interest in them and be liberated from themSix times Ananda I recall discarding the body in this place and at the seventh time I discarded it as a wheelturning monarch a righteous king who had conquered the four quarters and established a firm rule and who possessed the seven treasuresBut Ananda I do not see any place in this world with its devas and maras and Brahmas or in this generation with its ascetics and Brahmins princes and people where the Tathagata will for an eighth time discard the bodySo the Lord spoke The WellFarer having said this the Teacher saidImpermanent are compounded things prone to rise and fallHaving risen theyre destroyed their passing truest blissTHUS have I heard Once the Lord was staying at Nadika at the Brick HouseAnd at that time the Lord was explaining the rebirths of various devotees up and down the country who had died and passed away Kasis and Kosalans Vajjians and Mallas Cetis and Vamsas Kurus and Pancalas Macchas and Surasenas saying This one was reborn there and that one thereMore than fifty Nadikan devotees having abandoned the five lower fetters were reborn spontaneously and would attain Nibbana without returning to this worldover ninety of them having abandoned three fetters and weakened greed hatred and delusion were OnceRetumers who would return to this world once more and then make an end of sufferingand more than five hundred having abandoned three fetters were StreamWinners incapable of falling into states of woe certain of NibbanaThis news reached the ears of the devotees in Nadikaand they were pleased delighted and filled with joy to hear the Lords repliesAnd the Venerable Ananda heard of the Lords report and the Nadikans delightAnd he thought There were also Magadhan disciples of long standing who have died and passed awayOne would think Anga and Magadha contained no Magadhan disciples who had diedYet they too were devoted to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and they observed the discipline perfectlyThe Lord has not stated their destiny It would be good to have a declaration about this it would make the multitude have faith and so attain a good rebirthNow King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha was a righteous and lawful king a friend of Brahmins householders town and countrydwellersso that his fame is spread abroad That righteous king of ours is dead who gave us so much happiness Life was easy for us who dwelt under his righteous ruleAnd he was devoted to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and observed the discipline perfectlyThus people say King Bimbisara who praised the Lord to his dying day is deadThe Lord has not declared his destinyand it would be good to have a declarationBesides it was in Magadha that the Lord gained his enlightenmentSince the Lord gained his enlightenment in Magadha why does he not declare the destinies of those who have died thereFor the Lord not to make such a declaration would cause unhappiness to the Magadhans Such being the case why does not the Lord make such a declaration And after thus reflecting in solitude on behalf of the Magadhan devotees the Venerable Ananda rose at the crack of dawn went to the Lord and saluted himThen sitting down to one side he said Lord I have heard what has been declared concerning the inhabitants of Nadika as verse These were all devoted to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and they observed the discipline perfectly The Lord has not stated their destiny Why does not the Lord make such a declarationThen having thus spoken to the Lord on behalf of the Magadhan devotees he rose from his seat saluted the Lord passed him by to the right and departedAs soon as Ananda had gone the Lord took his robe and bowl and went into Nadika for almsLater on his return after his meal he went to the Brick House and having washed his feet he went in and having thought over considered and given his whole mind to the question of the Magadhan devotees he sat down on the prepared seat saying I shall know their destiny and future lot whatever it is And then he perceived the destiny and fate of each one of themAnd in the evening emerging from meditative seclusion the Lord came out of the Brick House and sat down on the prepared seat in the shade of his lodgingThen the Venerable Ananda ame to the Lord saluted him sat down to one sideand said Lord the Lords countenance looks bright and shining showing that the Lords mind is at easeHas the Lord been satisfied with todays lodgingAnanda after you spoke to me about the devotees of Magadha I took my robe and bowl and went into Nadika for alms Later on went to the Brick House and considered the question of the Magadhan devoteesAnd I perceived the destiny and fate of each one of themThen the voice of a yakkha who had passed over cried out I am Janavasabha Lord I am Janavasabha WellFarerWell Ananda do you know anyone who formerly bore the name of JanavasabhaI must admit Lord that I have never heard such a name and yet on hearing the name Janavasabha my hairs stood on endand I thought He whose name is Janavasabha will not be such a lowranking yakkhaAnanda immediately after I heard this voice the yakkha appeared before me as a noble visionand uttered a second cry I am Bimbisara Lord I am Bimbisara WellFarerI have now for the seventh time been reborn into the entourage of the Lord Vessavana Thus having passed away as a king of humans I have now become among the devas a king of nonhuman beingsSeven states here and seven there fourteen birthsThats the tally of lives I can recallFor a long time Lord I have known myself to be exempt from states of woe and now the desire arises in me to become a OnceRetumerI said It is amazing it is astonishing that the reverend yakkha Janavasabha should say this On what grounds can he know of such an august specific attainment Not otherwise Lord not otherwise WellFarer than through your teaching From the time when I became fully committed and gained complete faith from then on Lord for a long time I have known myself to be exempt from states of woe and the desire has arisen in me to become a Once RetumerAnd here Lord having been sent by King Vessavana on some business to King Virulhaka I saw the Lord entering the Brick House and sitting down and considering the question of the Magadhan devoteesAnd since I had only just heard King Vessavana announce to his assembly what those folks fates wereit is no wonder that I thought I will go and see the Lord and report this to himAnd these Lord are the two reasons why I came to see the Lord Lord in earlier days long ago on the fastday of the fifteenth at the beginning of the Rains in the fullmoon night all the ThirtyThree Gods were seated in the Sudhamma Hall a great congregation of divine beings and the Four Great Kings from the four quarters were thereThere was the Great King Dhatarattha from the east at the head of his followers facing west the Great King Virulhaka from the south facing north the Great King Virupakkha from the west facing east and the Great King Vessavana from the north facing south On such occasions that is the order in which they are seated and after that came our seatsAnd those devas who having lived the holy life under the Lord had recently appeared in the Heaven of the ThirtyThree outshone the other devas in brightness and gloryAnd for that reason the Thirty Three Gods were pleased happy filled with delight and joy saying The devas hosts are growing the asuras hosts are decliningThen Lord Sakka ruler of the gods seeing the satisfaction of the ThirtyThree uttered these verses of rejoicingThe gods of ThirtyThree rejoice their leader tooPraising the Tathagata and Dhammas truthSeeing newcome devas fair and gloriousWhove lived the holy life now well rebornOutshining all the rest in fame and splendourThe mighty Sages pupils singled outSeeing this the ThirtyThree rejoice their leader tooPraising the Tathagata and Dhammas truthAt this the ThirtyThree Gods rejoiced still more saying The devas hosts are growing the asuras hosts are declining And then they consulted and deliberated together about the matter concerning which they had assembled in the Sudhamma Hall and the Four Great Kings were advised and admonished on this matteras they stood by their seats unmovingThe Kings instructed marked the words they spokeStanding calm serene beside their seatsAnd then Lord a glorious radiance shone forth from the north and a splendour was seen greater than the sheen of the devasAnd Sakka said to the ThirtyThree Gods Gentlemen when such signs are seen such light is seen and such radiance shines forth Brahma will appearThe appearance of such radiance is the first sign of Brahmas approaching manifestation When they see these signs Brahma will soon appearThis is Brahmas sign radiance vast and greatThen the ThirtyThree Gods sat down each in his proper place saying Let us find out what comes of this radiance and having found the truth of it we will go towards itThe Four Great Kings sitting down in their places said the sameThus they were all agreedLord whenever Brahma Sanankumara appears to the ThirtyThree Gods he appears having assumed a grosser formbecause his natural appearance is not such as to be perceptible to their eyesWhen he appears to the Thirty Three Gods he outshines other devas in radiance and gloryjust as a figure made of gold outshines the human figureAnd Lord when Brahma Sanankumara appears to the Thirty Three Gods not one of them salutes him or rises or offers him a seatThey all sit silently with palms together cross legged thinking he will sit down on the couch of that god from whom he wants somethingAnd the one on whose couch he sits down is as thrilled and delightedas a duly anointed Khattiya king on assuming his royal officeThen Lord Brahma Sanankumara having assumed a grosser form appeared to the ThirtyThree Gods in the shape of the youth PancasikhaRising up in the air he appeared floating crossleggedjust as a strong man might sit down on a properlyspread couch or on the ground And seeing the delight of the ThirtyThree Gods he uttered these verses of rejoicingThe gods of ThirtyThree rejoice their leader tooPraising the Tathagata and Dhammas truthSeeing newcome devas fair and gloriousWhove lived the holy life now well rebornOutshining all the rest in fame and splendourThe mighty Sages pupils singled outSeeing this the ThirtyThree rejoice their leader tooPraising the Tathagata and Dhammas truthNow to the matter of Brahma Sanankumaras speech and as for the manner of his speech his voice had eight qualities it was distinct intelligible pleasant attractive compact concise deep and resonantAnd when he spoke in that voice to the assembly its sound did not carry outsideWhoever has such a voice as that is said to have the voice of BrahmaAnd Brahma Sanankumara multiplying his shape by thirtythree sat down crosslegged on each individual couch of the ThirtyThree and said What do my lords the ThirtyThree think Since the Lord out of compassion for the world and for the benefit and happiness of the many has acted to the advantage of devas and mankindthose whoever they may be who have taken refuge in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and have observed the moral precepts have at death and the breakingup of the body arisen in the company of the ParinimmitaVasavatti devas or the Nimmanaratti devas or the Tusita devas or the Yama devas or in the retinue of the ThirtyThree Gods or of the Four Great Kings or at the very least in the company of the gandhabbas This was the burden of Brahma Sanankumaras speech And every one of the gods he spoke to thought He is sitting on my couch he is speaking to me alone All the forms assumed with one voice speakAnd having spoken all at once are silentAnd so the ThirtyThree their leader tooEach thinks He speaks to me alone  Then Brahma Sanankumara assumed a single form then he sat down on the couch of Sakka and saidWhat do my lords the ThirtyThree think This Lord the Arahant supreme Buddha has known and seen the four roads to power and how to develop perfect and practise themWhat fourHere a monk develops concentration of intention accompanied by effort of willconcentration of energyconcentration of consciousnessand concentration of investigation accompanied by effort of willThese are the four roads to powerAnd whatever ascetics or Brahmins have in the past realised such powers in different ways they have all developed and strongly practised these four waysand the same applies to all who may in the futureor who do now realise such powersDo my lords the ThirtyThree observe such powers in meYes BrahmaWell I too have developed and strongly practised these four ways  This was the burden of Brahma Sanankumaras speechHe went onWhat do my lords of the ThirtyThree think There are three gateways to the bliss proclaimed by the Lord who knows and seesWhat are theyIn the first place someone dwells in association with sensedesires with unwholesome conditionsAt some time he hears the Ariyan Dhamma he pays close attention and practises in conformity with itBy so doing he comes to live dissociated from such sensedesires and unwholesome conditionsAs a result of this dissociation pleasant feeling arises and what is more gladnessJust as pleasure might give birth to rejoicing so from pleasant feeling he experiences gladnessIn the second place there is someone in whom the gross tendencies of body speech and thought are not allayedAt some time he hears the Ariyan Dhammaand his gross tendencies of body speech and thought are allayedAs a result of this allaying pleasant feeling arises and what is more gladnessIn the third place there is someone who really does not know what is right and what is wrongwhat is blameworthy and what is not what is to be practised and what is not what is base and what is noble and what is foul fair or mixed in qualityAt some time he hears the Ariyan Dhamma he pays close attention and practises in conformity with itAs a result he comes to know in reality what is right and wrongwhat is blameworthy and what is not what is to be practised and what is not what is base and what is noble and what is foul fair or mixed in qualityIn him who knows and sees thus ignorance is dispelled and knowledge arisesWith the waning of ignorance and the arising of knowledge pleasant feeling arises and what is more gladnessJust as pleasure might give birth to rejoicing so from pleasant feeling he experiences gladnessThese are the three gateways to the bliss proclaimed by the Lord who knows and seesThis was the burden of Brahma Sanankumaras speechHe went onWhat do my lords of the ThirtyThree think How well has the Lord Buddha who knows and sees pointed out the four foundations of mindfulness for the attainment of that which is goodWhat are theyHere a monk abides contemplating the body as body earnestly clearly aware mindful and having put away all hankering and fretting for the worldAs he thus dwells contemplating his own body as body he becomes perfectly concentrated and perfectly sereneBeing thus calm and serene he gains knowledge and vision externally of the bodies of othersHe abides contemplating his own feelings as feelingshe abides contemplating his own mind as mindhe abides contemplating his own mindobjects as mindobjects earnestly clearly aware mindful and having put away all hankering and fretting for the worldAs he thus dwells contemplating his own mindobjects as mindobjects he becomes perfectly concentrated and perfectly sereneBeing thus calm and serene he gains knowledge and vision externally of the mindobjects of othersThese are the four foundations of mindfulness well pointed out by the Lord Buddha who knows and sees for the attainment of that which is good This was the burden of Brahma Sanankumaras speechHe went onWhat do my lords of the ThirtyThree think How well has the Lord Buddha who knows and sees pointed out the seven requisites of concentration for the development of perfect concentration and the perfection of concentrationWhat are theyThey are right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulnessThat onepointedness of mind that is produced by these seven factors is called the Ariyan right concentration with its bases and requisitesFrom right view arises right thought from right thought arises right speech from right speech arises right actionfrom right action arises right livelihood from right livelihood arises right effort from right effort arises right mindfulness from right mindfulness arises right concentration from right concentration arises right knowledge from right knowledge arises right liberationIf anyone truthfully declaring Wellproclaimed by the Lord is the Dhamma visible here and now timeless inviting inspection leading onward to be comprehended by the wise each one for himself were to say Open are the doors of the Deathless he would be speaking in accordance with the highest truthFor indeed my lords the Dhamma is wellproclaimed by the Lord visible here and now timeless inviting inspection leading onward to be comprehended by the wise each one for him or herself and too the doors to the Deathless are openThose who have unshakeable faith in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and are endowed with the virtues pleasing to the Noble Ones those beings who have arisen here on account of their Dhammatraining amounting to more than twentyfour hundred Magadhan followers who have passed over have by the destruction of three fetters become StreamWinners incapable of falling into states of woe and certain of enlightenmentand indeed there are Once Retumers here tooBut of that other race indeed Of greater merit still my mindCan make no reckoning at all For fear that I should speak untruthThis was the burden of Brahma Sanankumaras speech And in connection with this the Great King Vessavana reflected in his mind It is marvellous it is wonderful that such a glorious Teacher should arise that there should be such a glorious proclamation of Dhamma and that such glorious paths to the sublime should be made knownThen Brahma Sanankumara reading King Vessavanas mind said to him What do you think King Vessavana There has been such a glorious Teacher in the past and such a proclamation and such paths made knownand there will be again in the future Such was the burden of what Brahma Sanankumara proclaimed to the ThirtyThree Gods And the Great King Vessavana having heard and received it in person related it to his followersAnd the yakkha Janavasabha having heard it himself related it to the LordAnd the Lord having heard it himself and also come to know it by his own superknowledge related it to the Venerable Ananda who in turn related it to the monks and nuns the male and female lay followersAnd so the holy life waxed mighty and prospered and spread widely as it was proclaimed among mankindTHUS have I heard Once the Lord was staying at Rajagaha on Vultures PeakAnd when the night was nearly over Pancasikha of the gandhabbas lighting up the entire Vultures Peak with a splendid radiance approached the Lord saluted him stood to one sideand said Lord I wish to report to you what I have personally seen and observed when I was in the presence of the ThirtyThree GodsTell me then Pancasikha said the Lord Lord in earlier days long ago on the fastday of the fifteenth at the end of the Rains the ThirtyThree Gods assembled and rejoiced that the devas hosts were growing the asuras hosts declining Then Sakka uttered the verseThe gods of ThirtyThree rejoice their leader tooPraising the Tathagata and Dhammas truthSeeing newcome devas fair and gloriousWhove lived the holy life now well rebornOutshining all the rest in fame and splendourThe mighty Sages pupils singled outSeeing this the ThirtyThree rejoice their leader tooPraising the Tathagata and Dhammas truthAt this Lord the ThirtyThree Gods rejoiced still more saying The devas hosts are growing the asuras hosts are decliningPancasikha continued Then Sakka seeing their satisfaction said to the ThirtyThree Gods Would you like gentlemen to hear eight truthful statements in praise of the Lordand on receiving their assent he declaredWhat do you think my lords of the ThirtyThreeAs regards the way in which the Lord has striven for the welfare of the many for the happiness of the many out of compassion for the world for the welfare and happiness of devas and humans we can find no teacher endowed with such qualities whether we consider the past or the present other than the LordWellproclaimed truly is this Lords Teaching visible here and now timeless inviting inspection leading onward to be realised by the wise each one for himself and we can find no proclaimer of such an onwardleading doctrine either in the past or in the present other than the LordThe Lord has well explained what is right and what is wrongwhat is blameworthy and what is blameless what is to be followed and what is not to be followed what is base and what is noble what is foul fair and mixed in qualityAnd we can find none who is a proclaimer of such thingsother than the LordAgain the Lord has well explained to his disciples the path leading to Nibbanaand they coalesce Nibbana and the path just as the waters of the Ganges and the Yamuna coalesce and flow on togetherAnd we can find no proclaimer of the path leading to Nibbana  other than the LordThe gifts given to the Lord are wellbestowed his fame is well established so much so that I think the Khatti yas will continue to be attached to him yet the Lord takes his foodoffering without conceitAnd we can find no teacher who does this other than the LordAnd the Lord has gained companions both learners and those who having lived the life have abolished the corruptionsand the Lord dwells together with them all rejoicing in the one thingAnd we can find no such teacher   other than the LordAnd the Lord acts as he speaks and speaks as he actsAnd we can find no teacher who does likewise in every detail of doctrineother than the LordThe Lord has transcended doubt passed beyond all how and why he has accomplished his aim in regard to his goal and the supreme holy lifeAnd we can find no teacher who has done the like whether we consider the past or the present other than the Lord And when Sakka had thus proclaimed these eight truthful statements in praise of the Lordthe ThirtyThree Gods were even more pleased overjoyed and filled with delight and happiness at what they had heard in the Lords praiseThen certain gods exclaimed Oh if only four fully enlightened Buddhas were to arise in the world and teach Dhamma just like the Blessed LordThat would be for the benefit and happiness of the many out of compassion for the world for the benefit and happiness of devas and humansAnd some said Never mind four fullyenlightened Buddhas  three would sufficeand others said Never mind three  two would sufficeAt this Sakka said It is impossible gentlemen it cannot happen that two fullyenlightened Buddhas should arise simultaneously in a single worldsystem That cannot beMay this Blessed Lord continue to live long for many years to come free from sickness and diseaseThat would be for the benefit and happiness of the many out of compassion for the world it would be for the benefit and happiness of devas and humansThen the ThirtyThree Gods consulted and deliberated together about the matter concerning which they had assembled in the Sudhamma Halland the Four Great Kings were advised and admonished on this matter as they stood by their seats unmovingThe Kings instructed marked the words they spokeStanding calm serene beside their seatsA great radiance was seen heralding the approach of BrahmaAll took their proper seats  each hoping Brahma would sit on his couchThen Brahma Sanankumara having descended from his heaven and seeing their pleasure uttered these versesThe gods of ThirtyThree rejoice their leader too    Brahma Sanankumaras voice had eight qualities Then the ThirtyThree Gods said to Brahma Sanankumara It is well Brahma We rejoice at what we have heard Sakka lord of the devas has also declared eight truthful statements to us about the Lord at which we also rejoiceThen Brahma said to Sakka It is well Lord of the devas And we too would like to hear those eight truthful statements about the LordVery well Great Brahma said Sakka and he repeated those eight statements What do you think Lord Brahma   And Brahma Sanankumara was pleased overjoyed and filled with delight and happiness at what he had heard in the Lords praiseBrahma Sanankumara assumed a grosser form and appeared in the shape of Pancasikha  And sitting thus crosslegged he said to the ThirtyThree GodsFor how long has the Blessed Lord been one of mighty wisdom Once upon a time there was a king called DisampatlHis chaplain was a Brahmin called the StewardThe Kings son was a youth called Renuand the Stewards son was called JotipalaPrince Renu and Jotipala together with six other Khattiyas formed a band of eight friendsIn the course of time the Steward diedand King Disampati mourned him saying Alas at the very moment when we had entrusted all our responsibilities to the Steward and were abandoning ourselves to the pleasures of the five senses the Steward has passed awayHearing this Prince Renu said Sire do not mourn the Stewards death overmuchHis son Jotipala is cleverer than his father was and has a better eye for what is advantageous You should let Jotipala manage all the business you entrusted to his fatherIs that so my boyYes Sire  Then the King called a man and said Come here my good man go to the youth Jotipala and say May the Reverend Jotipala be well King Disampati sends for you he would like to see youVery good Your Majesty said the man and delivered the messageOn receiving the message Jotipala said Very good sir and went to see the King On entering the royal presence he exchanged courtesies with the King then sat down to one sideThe King said We wish the Reverend Jotipala to manage our affairs Do not refuseI will install you in your fathers place and consecrate you as StewardVery good Lord replied JotipalaSo King Disampati appointed Jotipala as steward in his fathers placeAnd once installed Jotipala carried out the business his father had carried out not doing any business his father had not done He accomplished all the tasks his father had accomplished and no othersAnd people said This Brahmin is truly a steward Indeed he is a great stewardAnd that is how the young Brahmin Jotipala came to be known as the Great StewardAnd one day the Great Steward went to the group of six nobles and said King Disampati is aged decrepit stricken with age His life is near its end and he cannot last much longer Who can tell how long people will liveWhen King Disampati dies the kingmakers are bound to anoint Prince Renu as KingYou should go gentlemen to Prince Renu and say We are the beloved dear and favoured friends of the Lord Renu sharing his joys and his sorrowsOur Lord King Disampati is aged  When he dies the kingmakers are bound to anoint the Lord Renu as KingIf the Lord Renu should gain the kingship let him share it with us Very good sir said the six nobles and they went to Prince Renu and spoke to him as the Great Steward had proposedWell gentlemen who apart from myself ought to prosper but youIf gentlemen I gain the kingship I will share it with you  In due course King Disampati diedand the kingmakers anointed Prince Renu King in his placeAnd having been made King Renu abandoned himself to the pleasures of the five sensesThen the Great Steward went to the six nobles and said Gentlemen now King Disampati is deadthe Lord Renu who has been anointed in his place has abandoned himself to the pleasures of the five sensesWho knows what will come of this The sensepleasures are intoxicatingYou should go to him and say King Disampati is dead and the Lord Renu has been anointed King Do you remember your word Lord They did soand the King said Gentlemen I remember my wordWho is there who can divide this mighty realm of earth so broad in the north and so narrow like the front of a earth in the south into seven equal partsWho indeed Lord if not the Great Steward So King Renu sent a man to the Great Steward to say My lord the King sends for youThe man wentand the Great Steward came to the Kingexchanged courtesies with him and sat down to one sideThen the King said My Lord Steward go and divide this mighty realm of earth so broad in the north and so narrow like the front of a cart in the south into seven equal partsVery good Sire said the Great Steward and he did soAnd King Renus country was in the centreDantapura to the Kalingas Potaka to the AssakasMahissati to the Avantis Roruka to the SovirasMithila to the Videhas Campa to the Angas goesBenares to the Kasi thus did the Steward disposeThe six nobles were delighted with their respective gains and at the success of the plan What we wanted desired aimed at and strove for we have gotSattabhu Brahmadatta Vessabhu and BharataRenu and two Dhataratthas these are the seven Bharat kings  End of first recitationsectionThen the six nobles came to the Great Steward and said Reverend Steward just as you were a beloved dear and faithful friend to King Renuso you have been to us Please manage our affairs for us We trust you will not refuseSo he administered the realms of seven anointed kings and he also taught the mantras to seven distinguished Brahmins and seven hundred advanced pupils  In course of time good reports were spread about concerning the Great Steward The Great Steward can see Brahma with his own eyes talks with him face to face and consults with himAnd he thought Now this good report is being spread about concerning me that I can see Brahma with my own eyes but it is not trueHowever I have heard it said by aged and respectable Brahmins the teachers of teachers that anyone who withdraws into meditation for the four months of the Rains developing the absorption on compassion can see Brahma with his own eyes talk with him face to face and consult with himSuppose I were to do thisSo the Great Steward went to King Renu and told him of the reportand of his wish to go into retreat and develop the absorption on compassionAnd nobody is to come near me except to bring me foodReverend Steward do as you think fit  The six nobles likewise replied Reverend Steward do as you think fit He went to the seven Brahmins and the seven hundred pupils and told them of his intentionsadding So gentlemen you carry on with reciting the mantras you have heard and learnt and teach them to each otherReverend Steward do as you think fit they repliedThen he went to his forty equalranking wivesand they said Reverend Steward do as you think fit So the Great Steward erected a new lodging to the east of the city and withdrew there for the four months of the Rains developing the absorption on compassion and nobody came near him except to bring him foodBut at the end of four months he felt nothing but dissatisfaction and weariness as he thought I heard it said   that anyone who withdraws into meditation for the four months of the Rains developing the absorption on compassion can see Brahma with his own eyes But I cannot see Brahma with my own eyes and cannot talk discuss or consult with himNow Brahma Sanankumara read his thoughts and as swiftly as a strong man might stretch out his flexed arm or flex it again he disappeared from the Brahma world and appeared before the Great StewardAnd the Great Steward felt fear and trembling and his hair stood on end at such a sight as he had never seen beforeAnd thus fearful trembling with hair standing on end he addressed Brahma Sanankumara in these versesO splendid vision glorious and divine Who are you LordI fain would know your name In highest heaven I am known by allBrahma Sanankumara  know me thus A seat and water for the feet and cakes Are fitting for a BrahmaLet the Lord Decide what hospitality he would We accept the gift thats offered now declare What it is you wish from us Of profit in this very life or in the nexta boon Say Lord Steward what it is youd have Then the Great Steward thought Brahma Sanankumara offers me a boonWhat shall I choose  benefits in this life or in that to comeThen he thought I am an expert in matters of advantage in this life and others consult me about thisSuppose I were to ask Brahma Sanankumara for something of benefit in the life to comeAnd he addressed Brahma in these versesI ask Brahma Sanankumara thisDoubting him who has no doubts I ask By doing whatCan mortals reach the deathless Brahma world That man who spurns all possessive thoughtsAlone intent compassionfilledAloof from stench free from lust Established thus and training thusCan mortals reach the deathless Brahma world I understand Spuming possessive thoughtsThis means that one renounces ones possessions small or great leaves ones relatives few or many and shaving off hair and beard goes forth from the household life into homelessness This is how I understand Spuming possessive thoughtsI understand Alone intentThat means that one goes off on ones own and chooses a lodging in the forest at the foot of a tree in a mountain glen in a rocky cave a charnelground in the jungle or on a heap of grass in the open I understand CompassionfilledThat means that one dwells suffusing one quarter with a mind filled with compassion then a second then a third and a fourth quarterThus one abides suffusing the whole world up down and across everywhere all around with a mind filled with compassion expanded immeasurable free from hatred and illwillThat is how I understand CompassionfilledBut the Lords words about Aloof from stench I do not understandWhat do you mean Brahma by stench among menPray lighten my ignorance  wise one on thisWhat hindrance causes man to stink and festerAnger lying fraud and cheatingAvarice pride and jealousyCoveting doubt and harming othersGreed and hate stupor and delusionThe loathsome stench that these give offHeads man for hell from Brahmarealm cut off As I understand the Lords words about the stenchthese things are not easy to overcome if one lives the household lifeI will therefore go forth from the household life into the homeless stateReverend Steward do as you think fit Heading for hell from Brahmarealm cut off So the Great Steward went to King Renu and said My Lord please appoint another minister to manage your affairsI wish to go forth from the household life into homelessnessAfter what Brahma has told me about the stench of the world which cannot easily be overcome by one living the household lifeI am going forth into homelessnessKing Renu lord of this realm I declareYou yourself must rule Ill counsel you no moreIf anything you lack Ill make it goodIf any hurt you my royal arms shall guard youYou my father I your son Steward stayI lack nothing none there is who harms meNo human voice I heard  at home I cannot stay Nonhuman  whats he like who calls that youAt once abandon home and all of us Before I went on this retreat I thought of sacrificeLighting the sacred fire strewing kusagrassBut now  eternal Brahma from Brahmarealms appearedI asked he answered I now can stay no more Reverend Steward in your words I trustSuch words Once heard you had no other courseWe will follow Steward be our MasterLike a berylgem clear of finest waterSo purified well follow in your wakeIf the Reverend Steward goes forth from the household life into homelessness I will do the sameWherever you go we will follow Then the Great Steward went to the six nobles and said to them My lords please appoint another minister to manage your affairsI wish to go forth from the household life into homelessness  And the six nobles went aside and consulted together These Brahmins are greedy for money Perhaps we can win the Great Steward round with money So they came back to him and said Sir there is plenty of wealth in these seven kingdoms Take as much as you like Enough gentlemen I have received plenty of wealth from my lords alreadyThat is the very thing that I am renouncing in order to go forth from the household life into homelessnessas I have explained Then the six nobles went aside again and consulted together These Brahmins are greedy for women Perhaps we can win the Great Steward round with women So they came to him and said Sir there are plenty of women in these seven kingdoms Take your pickEnough gentlemen I already have forty equal wivesand I am leaving them in order to go forth from the household life into homelessnessas I have explained If the Reverend Steward goes forth from the household life into homelessness we will do likewise Wherever you go we will followIf you renounce those lusts that bind most menExert yourselves be strong and patiently endureThis is the path thats straight the peerless pathThe path of truth guarded by the good to Brahmas realm And so Lord Steward just wait seven yearsand then we too will go forth into homelessness Wherever you go we will follow Gentlemen seven years is far too long I cannot wait for seven yearsWho can tell how long people will liveWe have to go on into the next world we must learn by means of wisdom we must do what is right and live the holy life for nothing that is born is immortalNow I am going forth as I have explained  Well Reverend Steward just wait six years  five years  four years  three years  two years  one year and then we too will go forth into homelessness Wherever you go we will follow Gentlemen one year is far too long  Then wait seven months  Gentlemen seven months is far too long  Then wait six months   five months   four months   three months  two months  one month  half a month Gentlemen half a month is far too long Then Reverend Steward just wait seven days while we make over our kingdoms to our sons and brothers At the end of seven days we will go forth into homelessness Wherever you go we will followSeven days is not long gentlemen I agree my lords to seven days Then the Great Steward went to the seven Brahmins and their seven hundred advanced pupils and said to them Now Your Reverences you must seek another teacher to teach you the mantrasI mean to go forth from the household life into homelessnessAfter what Brahma has told me about the stench of the worldwhich cannot be easily overcome by one living the household life I am going forth into homelessness Reverend Steward do not do soThere is little power and profit in the homeless life and much power and profit in the life of a BrahminDo not say such things gentlemenBesides who has greater power and profit than I haveI have been like a king to kings like Brahma to the Brahmins like a deity to householdersand I am giving all this up in order to go forth from the household life into homelessnessas I have explained If the Reverend Steward goes forth from the household life into homelessness we will do likewise Wherever you go we will follow Then the Great Steward went to his forty equal wives and said Whichever of you ladies wishes to may go back to her own family and seek another husbandI mean to go forth into homelessness You alone are the kinsman we could wish for the only husband we wantIf the Reverend Steward goes forth into homelessness we will do likewise Wherever you go we will follow And so the Great Steward at the end of the seven days shaved off his hair and beard donned yellow robes and went forth from the household life into homelessnessAnd with him went the seven anointed Khattiya kings the seven wealthy and distinguished Brahmins with their seven hundred advanced pupils his forty equal wives several thousand Khatti yas several thousand Brahmins several thousand householders even some haremwomenAnd so followed by this company the Great Steward wandered through villages towns and royal citiesAnd whenever he came to a village or town he was like a king to kings like Brahma to the Brahmins like a deity to householdersAnd in those days whenever anyone sneezed or stumbled they used to say Praise be to the Great Steward Praise be to the Minister of SevenAnd the Great Steward dwelt suffusing one quarter with a mind filled with lovingkindness then a second then a third and a fourth quarterHe dwelt suffusing the whole world up down and across everywhere all around with a mind filled with compassion  with a mind filled with sympathetic joy   with a mind filled with equanimity  free from hatred and illwill And thus he taught his disciples the way to union with the BrahmaworldAnd all those who had at that time been the Great Stewards pupils and had fully mastered his teachingwere after death at the breakingup of the body reborn in a happy sphere in the BrahmaworldAnd those who had not fully mastered his teaching were reborn either among the ParanimmitaVasavatti devas among the Nimmanarati devas among the Tusita devas among the Yama devas among the devas of the ThirtyThree Gods or among the devas of the Four Great Kings And the very lowest realm that any of them attained was that of the gandhabbasThus the goingforth of all those people was not fruitless or barren but productive of fruit and profit Do you remember this Lord I do PancasikhaAt that time I was the Brahmin the Great Stewardand I taught those disciples the path to union with the BrahmaworldHowever Pancasikha that holy life does not lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to peace to superknowledge to enlightenment to Nibbana but only to birth in the Brahmaworldwhereas my holy life leads unfailingly to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to peace to superknowledge to enlightenment to NibbanaThat is the Noble Eightfold Pathnamely Right View Right Thought Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness Right ConcentrationAnd Pancasikha those of my disciples who have fully mastered my teaching have by their own superknowledge realised by the destruction of the corruptions in this very life the uncorrupted freedom of heart and mind And of those who have not fully mastered it some by the destruction of the five lower fetters will be reborn spontaneously attaining thence to Nibbana without returning to this worldsome by the destruction of three fetters and the reduction of greed hatred and delusion will become OnceRetumers who will return once more to this world before making an end of sufferingand some by the destruction of three fetters will become StreamWinners incapable of falling into states of woe assured of enlightenmentThus the goingforth of all these people was not fruitless or barren but productive of fruit and profit Thus the Lord spokeand Pancasikha of the gandhabbas was delighted and rejoiced at the Lords words And having saluted him he passed him by on the right and vanished from the spotand would come to have even more faith in the LordThus have I heard Once the Venerable Kumara Kassapa was touring round Kosala with a large company of about five hundred monks and he came to stay at a town called SetavyaHe stayed to the north of Setavya in the Simsapa ForestAnd at that time Prince Payasi was living at Setavya a populous place full of grass timber water and corn which had been given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift and with royal powersAnd Prince Payasi developed the following evil opinion There is no other world there are no spontaneously bom beings there is no fruit or result of good or evil deedsMeanwhile the Brahmins and householders of Setavya heard the news The ascetic KumaraKassapa a disciple of the ascetic Gotama is touring round Kosala with a large company of about five hundred monks he has arrived at Setavya and is staying to the north of Setavya in the Simsapa Forestand concerning the Reverend Kassapa a good report has been spread about He is learned experienced wise wellinformed a fine speaker able to give good replies venerable an ArahantAnd it is good to see such ArahantsAnd so the Brahmins and householders of Setavya leaving Setavya by the north gate in large numbers made for the Simsapa ForestAnd just then Prince Payasi had gone up to the verandah for his midday restSeeing all the Brahmins and householders making for the Simsapa Forest he asked his steward whyThe steward said Sir it is the ascetic Kumara Kassapa a disciple of the ascetic Gotamaand concerning him a good report has been spread about That is why they are going to see himWell then steward you go to the Brahmins and householders of Setavya and say Gentlemen Prince Payasi says Please wait the Prince will come to see the ascetic KumaraKassapaAlready this ascetic KumaraKassapa has been teaching these foolish and inexperienced Brahmins and householders of Setavya that there is another world that there are spontaneously bom beings and that there is fruit and result of good and evil deedsBut no such things existVery good sir said the steward and delivered the messageThen Prince Payasi accompanied by the Brahmins and householders of Setavya went to the Simsapa Forest where the Venerable KumaraKassapa was Having exchanged courtesies with the Venerable Kumara Kassapa he sat down to one sideAnd some of the Brahmins and householders saluted the Venerable KumaraKassapa and then sat down to one side while some first exchanged courtesies with himsome saluted him with joined palmssome announced their name and clanand some silently sat down to one sideThen Price Payasi said to the Venerable KumaraKassapa Reverend Kassapa I hold to this tenet and this view There is no other world there are no spontaneously bom beings there is no fruit or result of good or evil deedsWell Prince I have never seen or heard of such a tenet or view as you declareAnd so Prince I will question you about it and you shall reply as you think fitWhat do you think Prince Are the sun and the moon in this world or another are they gods or humans Reverend Kassapa they are in another world and they are gods not humansIn the same way Prince you should consider There is another world there are spontaneously bom beings there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds  Whatever you may say about that Reverend Kassapa I still think there is no other worldHave you any reasons for this assertion Prince I have Reverend KassapaHow is that Prince Reverend Kassapa I have friends colleagues and blood relations who take life take what is not given commit sexual offences tell lies use abusive harsh and frivolous speech who are greedy full of hatred and hold wrong viewsEven tually they become ill suffering diseasedAnd when I am sure they will not recover I go to them and say There are certain ascetics and Brahmins who declare and believe that those who take life hold wrong views will after death at the breakingup of the body be born in a state of woe an evil place a place of punishment in hellNow you have done these thingsand if what these ascetics and Brahmins say is true that is where you will goNow if after death you go to a state of woe come to me and declare that there is another world there are spontaneously born beings there is fruit and result of good and evil deedsYou gentlemen are trustworthy and dependable and what you have seen shall be as if I had seen it myself so it will beBut although they agreed they neither came to tell me nor did they send a messengerThat Reverend Kassapa is my reason for maintaining There is no other world there are no spontaneously born beings there is no fruit or result of good or evil deedsAs to that Prince I will question you about itand you shall reply as you think fitWhat do you think Prince Suppose they were to bring a thief before you caught in the act and say This man Lord is a thief caught in the act Sentence him to any punishment you wishAnd you might say Bind this mans arms tightly behind him with a strong rope shave his head closely and lead him to the rough sound of a drum through the streets and squares and out through the southern gate and there cut off his headAnd they saying Very good in assent mightlead him out through the southern gate and there cut off his headNow if that thief were to say to the executioners Good executioners in this town or village I have friends colleagues and bloodrelations please wait till I have visited them would he get his wish Or would they just cut off that talkative thiefs head He would not get his wish Reverend KassapaThey would just cut off his headSo Prince this thief could not get even his human executioners to wait while he visited his friends and relationsSo how can your friends colleagues and bloodrelations who have committed all these misdeeds having died and gone to a place of woe prevail upon the warders of hell saying Good warders of hell please wait while we report to Prince Payasi that there is another world there are spontaneously born beings and there is fruit and result of good and evil deedsTherefore Prince admit that there is another worldWhatever you may say about that Reverend Kassapa I still think there is no other worldHave you any reason for this assertion Prince I have Reverend KassapaWhat is that Prince Reverend Kassapa I have friends who abstain from taking life from taking what is not given from committing sexual offences from telling lies or using abusive harsh and frivolous speech who are not greedy or full of hatred and who have right viewsEventually they become illand when I am sure they will not recover I go to them and say There are certain ascetics and Brahmins who declare and believe that those who abstain from taking life and have right views will after death at the breakingup of the body be born in a happy state a heavenly worldNow you have refrained from doing these thingsand if what these ascetics and Brahmins say is true that is where you will goNow if after death you go to a happy state a heavenly world come to me and declare that there is another world  You gentlemen are trustworthy and dependable and what you have seen shall be as if I had seen it myself so it will beBut although they agreed they neither came to me nor did they send a messengerThat Reverend Kassapa is my reason for maintaining There is no other worldWell then Prince I will give you a parablebecause some wise people understand what is said by means of parablesSuppose a man had fallen head first into a cesspitand you were to say to your men Pull that man out of the cesspitand they would say Very good and do soThen you would tell them to clean his body thoroughly of the filth with bamboo scrapersand then to give him a triple shampoo with yellow loamThen you would tell them to anoint his body with oil and then to clean him three times with fine soap powderThen you would tell them to dress his hair and beardand to adorn him with fine garlands ointments and clothesFinally you would tell them to lead him up to your palace and let him indulge in the pleasures of the five sensesand they would do soWhat do you think Prince Would that man having been well washed with his hair and beard dressed adorned and garlanded clothed in white and having been conveyed up to the palace enjoying and revelling in the pleasures of the five senses want to be plunged once more into that cesspit No Reverend KassapaWhy not Because that cesspit is unclean and considered so evilsmelling horrible revolting and generally considered to be soIn just the same way Prince human beings are unclean evilsmelling horrible revolting and generally considered to be so by the devasSo why should your friends who have not committed any of the offences  and who have after death been bom in a happy state a heavenly world come back and say There is another world   there is fruit of good and evil deedsTherefore Prince admit that there is another worldWhatever you may say about that Reverend Kassapa I still think there is no other worldHave you any reason for this assertion Prince I have Reverend Kassapa What is that Prince Reverend Kassapa I have friends who abstain   from telling lies from strong drink and slothinducing drugs Eventually they become illThere are certain ascetics and Brahmins who declare and believe that those who abstain from taking life   and slothproducing drugs will   be bom in a happy state in a heavenly world as companions of the ThirtyThree Gods  But although they agreed they neither came to tell me nor did they send a messengerThat Reverend Kassapa is my reason for maintaining There is no other worldAs to that Prince I will question you about it and you shall answer as you think fitThat which is for human beings Prince a hundred years is for the ThirtyThree Gods one day and night Thirty of such nights make a month twelve such months a year and a thousand such years are the lifespan of the ThirtyThree GodsNow suppose they were to think After we have indulged in the pleasures of the five senses for two or three days we will go to Payasi and tell him there is another world there are spontaneously bom beings there is fruit and result of good and evil deedswould they have done so No Reverend Kassapabecause we should be long since deadBut Reverend Kassapa who has told you that the ThirtyThree Gods exist and that they are so longlivedI dont believe the ThirtyThree Gods exist or are so long livedPrince imagine a man who was blind from birth and could not see dark or light objects or blue yellow red or crimson ones could not see the smooth and the rough could not see the stars and the moonHe might say There are no dark and light objects and nobody who can see themthere is no sun or moon and nobody who can see themI am not aware of this thing and therefore it does not existWould he be speaking rightly Prince No Reverend KassapaThere are dark and light objects there is a sun and a moonand anyone who said I am not aware of this thing I cannot see it and therefore it does not existwould not be speaking rightlyWell Prince it appears that your reply is like that of the blind man when you ask how I know about the ThirtyThree Gods and their longevityPrince the other world cannot be seen the Way you think with the physical eyePrince those ascetics and Brahmins who seek in the junglethickets and the recesses of the forest for a restingplace that is quiet with little noise  they stay there unwearied ardent restrained purifying the divine eyeand with that purified divine eye that exceeds the powers of human sight they see both this world and the next and spontaneously bom beingsThat Prince is how the other world can be seen and not the way you think with the physical eyeTherefore Prince admit that there is another world that there are spontaneously bom beings and that there is fruit and result of good and evil deedsWhatever you may say about that Reverend Kassapa I still think there is no other worldHave you any reason for this assertion Prince I have Reverend Kassapa What is that Prince Well Reverend Kassapa I see here some ascetics and Brahmins who observe morality and are wellconducted who want to live do not want to die who desire comfort and hate sufferingAnd it seems to me that if these good ascetics and Brahmins who are so moral and wellconducted know that after death they will be better offthen these good people would now take poison take a knife and kill themselves hang themselves or jump off a cliffBut though they have such knowledge they still want to live do not want to die they desire comfort and hate sufferingAnd that Reverend Kassapa is my reason for maintaining There is no other world tt Well then Prince I will give you a parablebecause some wise people understand what is said by means of parablesOnce upon a time Prince a certain Brahmin had two wivesOne had a son ten or twelve years old while the other was pregnant and nearing her timewhen the Brahmin diedThen this youth said to his mothers cowife Lady whatever wealth and possessions silver or gold there may be is all mineMy father made me his heirAt this the Brahmin lady said to the youth Wait young man until I give birthIf the child is a boy one portion will be his and if it is a girl she will become your servantThe youth repeated his words a second time and received the same replyWhen he repeated them a third timethe lady took a knife and going into an inner room cut open her belly thinking If only I could find out whether it is a boy or a girlAnd thus she destroyed herself and the living embryo and the wealth as welljust as fools do who seek their inheritance unwisely heedless of hidden danger In the same way you Prince will foolishly enter on hidden dangers by unwisely seeking for another world just as that Brahmin lady did in seeking her inheritanceBut Prince those ascetics and Brahmins who observe morality and are wellconducted do not seek to hasten the ripening of that which is not yet ripe but rather they wisely await its ripeningTheir life is profitable to those ascetics and Brahminsfor the longer such moral and wellconducted ascetics and Brahmins remain alive the greater the merit that they create they practise for the welfare of the many for the happiness of the many out of compassion for the world for the profit and benefit of devas and humansTherefore Prince admit that there is another worldWhatever you may say about that Reverend Kassapa I still think there is no other worldHave you any reason for this assertion Prince I have Reverend Kassapa What is that Prince Reverend Kassapa take the case that they bring a thief before me caught in the act and say Here Lord is a thief caught in the act sentence him to whatever punishment you wishAnd I say Take this man and put him alive in a jar Seal the mouth and close it with a damp skin give it a thick covering of damp clay put it in an oven and light the fireAnd they do soWhen we are sure the man is dead we remove the jar break the clay uncover the mouth and watch carefully Maybe we can see his soul escapingBut we do not see any soul escapingand that is why Reverend Kassapa I believe there is no other worldAs to that Prince I will question you about it and you shall reply as you think fitDo you admit that when you have gone for your midday rest you have seen pleasant visions of parks forests delightful country and lotusponds I do Reverend KassapaAnd at that time are you not watched over by hunchbacks dwarfs young girls and maidens I am Reverend KassapaAnd do they observe your soul entering or leaving your body No Reverend KassapaSo they do not see your soul entering or leaving your body even when you are aliveTherefore how could you see the soul of a dead man entering or leaving his bodyTherefore Prince admit that there is another worldWhatever you may say about that Reverend Kassapa I still think there is no other worldHave you any reason for this assertion Prince  have Reverend Kassapa What is that Prince Reverend Kassapa take the case that they bring a thief before meand I say Weigh this man on the scales alive then strangle him and weigh him againAnd they do soAs long as he was alive he was lighter softer and more flexiblebut when he was dead he was heavier stiffer and more inflexibleAnd that Reverend Kassapa is my reason for maintaining that there is no other worldWell then Prince I will give you a parableSuppose a man weighed an iron ball that had been heated all day blazing burning fiercely glowingAnd suppose that after a time when it had grown cold and gone out he weighed it againAt which time would it be lighter softer and more flexible when it was hot burning and glowing or when it was cold and extinguished Reverend Kassapa when that ball of iron is hot burning and glowing with the elements of fire and air then it is lighter softer and more flexibleWhen without those elements it has grown cold and gone out it is heavier stiffer and more inflexibleWell then Prince it is just the same with the body When it has life heat and consciousness it is lighter softer and more flexibleBut when it is deprived of life heat and consciousness it is heavier stiffer and more inflexibleIn the same way Prince you should consider There is another worldWhatever you may say about that Reverend Kassapa I still think there is no other worldHave you any reason for this assertion Prince  have Reverend Kassapa What is that Prince Reverend Kassapa take the case of a thief that they bring before meand I say Kill this man without wounding his cuticle skin flesh sinews bones or marrowand they do soWhen he is halfdead I say Now lay this man on his back and perhaps we shall be able to see his soul emergingThey do sobut we cannot see his soul emergingThen I say Turn him face downwards on his side on the other side stand him up stand him on his head thump him with your fists stone him hit him with sticks strike him with swords shake him this way and that and perhaps we shall be able to see his soul emergingAnd they do all these thingsbut although he has eyes he does not perceive objects or their spheresalthough he has ears he does not hear sounds although he has a nose he does not smell smellsalthough he has a tongue he does not taste tastesalthough he has a body he does not feel tangibles or their spheresAnd that is why Reverend Kassapa I believe there is no other worldWell then Prince I will give you a parableOnce there was a trumpeter who took his trumpet and went into the border countryOn coming to a village he stood in the village centre blew his trumpet three times and then putting it down on the ground sat down to one sideThen Prince those border folk thought Where does that sound come from that is so delightful so sweet so intoxicating so compelling so captivating They addressed the trumpeter and asked him about thisFriends this trumpet is where those delightful sounds come fromSo then they laid the trumpet on its back crying Speak mister trumpet speakBut the trumpet never uttered a soundThen they turned it face downwards on its side on its other side stood it up stood it on its head   thumped it with their fists   stoned it  beat it with sticks struck it with swords shook it this way and that crying Speak mister trumpet speakBut the trumpet never uttered a soundThe trumpeter thought What fools these border folk are How stupidly they search for the sound of the trumpetAnd as they watched him he took the trumpet blew it three times and went awayAnd those border folk thought It seems that when the trumpet is accompanied by a man by effort and by the wind then it makes a sound But when it is not accompanied by a man by effort and by the wind then it makes no soundIn the same way Prince when this body has life heat and consciousness then it goes and comes back stands and sits and lies down sees things with its eyes hears with its ears smells with its nose tastes with its tongue feels with its body and knows mental objects with its mindBut when it has no life heat or consciousness it does none of these thingsIn the same way Prince you should consider There is another worldWhatever you may say about that Reverend Kassapa I still think there is no other worldHave you any reason for this assertion Prince I have Reverend Kassapa What is that Prince Reverend Kassapa take the case of a thief they bring before meand I say Strip away this mans outer skin and perhaps we shall be able to see his soul emergingThen I tell them to strip away his inner skin his flesh sinews bones bonemarrow  but still we cannot see any soul emergingAnd that is why Reverend Kassapa I believe there is no other worldWell then Prince I will give you a parableOnce there was a mattedhaired fireworshipper who dwelt in the forest in a leafhutAnd a certain tribe was on the moveand its leader stayed for one night near the fireworshippers dwelling and then leftSo the fireworshipper thought he would go to the site to see if he could find anything he could make use ofHe got up early and went to the site and there he saw a tiny delicate baby boy lying abandoned on his backAt the sight he thought It would not be right for me to look on and let a human being die I had better take this child to my hermitage take care of him feed him and bring him upSo he did soWhen the boy was ten or twelve the hermit had some business to do in the neighbourhoodSo he said to the boy I want to go to the neighbourhood my son You look after the fireand dont let it go outIf it should go out here is an axe here are some sticks here are the firesticks so you can relight the fire and look after itHaving thus instructed the boy the hermit went into the neighbourhoodBut the boy being absorbed in his games let the fire go outThen he thought Father said  here is an axe   so you can relight the fire and look after itNow Id better do soSo he chopped up the firesticks with the axe thinking I expect Ill get a fire this wayBut he got no fireHe cut the firesticks into two into three into four into five ten a hundred pieces he splintered them he pounded them in a mortar he winnowed them in a great wind thinking I expect Ill get a fire this wayBut he got no fireand when the hermit came back having finished his business he said Son why have you let the fire go outand the boy told him what had happenedThe hermit thought How stupid this boy is how senseless What a thoughtless way to try to get a fireSo while the boy looked on he took the firesticks and rekindled the fire saying Son thats the way to rekindle a firenot the stupid senseless thoughtless way you tried to do itIn just the same way Prince you are looking foolishly senselessly and unreasonably for another worldPrince give up this evil viewpoint give it up Do not let it cause you misfortune and suffering for a long timeEven though you say this Reverend Kassapa still I cannot bear to give up this evil opinionKing Pasenadi of Kosala knows my opinions and so do kings abroadIf I give it up they will say What a fool Prince Payasi is how stupidly he grasps at wrong viewsI will stick to this view out of anger contempt and spiteWell then Prince I will give you a parableOnce Prince a great caravan of a thousand carts was travelling from east to westAnd wherever they went they rapidly consumed all the grass wood and greenstuffNow this caravan had two leaders each in charge of five hundred cartsAnd they thought This is a great caravan of a thousand carts Wherever we go we use up all the suppliesPerhaps we should divide the caravan into two groups of five hundred  carts eachand they did soThen one of the leaders collected plenty of grass wood and water and set offAfter two or three days journey he saw a dark redeyed man coming towards him wearing a quiver and a wreath of white waterlilies with his clothes and hair all wet driving a donkeychariot whose wheels were splashed with mud On seeing this man the leader said Where do you come from sir From suchandsuchAnd where are you going To soandsoHas there been much rainfall in the jungle ahead Oh yes sir there has been a great deal of rain inf the jungle ahead of you the roads are well watered and there is plenty of grass wood and waterThrow away the grass wood and water you have already got sir You will make rapid progress with lightlyladen carts so do not tire your draughtoxenThe caravanleader told the carters what the man had saidThrow away the grass wood and waterand they did soBut at the first campingplace they did not find any grass wood or waternor at the second the third fourth fifth sixth or seventhand thus they all came to ruin and destructionAnd whatever there was of them men and cattle they were all gobbled up by that yakkha spiritand only their bones remainedAnd when the leader of the second caravan was sure the first caravan had gone forward far enough he stocked up with plenty of grass wood and waterAftr two or three days journey this leader saw a dark redeyed man coming towards himwho advised him to throw away his stocks of grass wood and waterThen the leader said to the carters This man told us that we should throw away the grass wood and water we already haveBut he is not one of our friends and relatives so why should we trust himSo do not throw away the grass wood and water we have let the caravan continue on its way with the goods we have broughtand do not throw any of them awayThe carters agreed and did as he saidAnd at the first campingplace they did not find any grass wood or waternor at the second the third fourth fifth sixth or seventhbut there they saw the other caravan that had come to ruin and destructionand they saw the bones of those men and cattle that had been gobbled up by the yakkhaspiritThen the caravan leader said to the carters That caravan came to ruin and destruction through the folly of its leaderSo now let us leave behind such of our goods as are of little value and take whatever is of greater value from the other caravanAnd they did so And with that wise leader they passed safely through the jungleIn the same way you Prince will come to ruin and destruction if you foolishly and unwisely seek the other world in the wrong wayThose who think they can trust anything they hear are heading for ruin and destruction just like those cartersPrince give up this evil viewpoint give it upDo not let it cause you misfortune and suffering for a long timeEven though you say this Reverend Kassapa still I cannot bear to give up this evil opinionIf I give it up they will say What a fool Prince Payasi isWell then Prince I will give you a parable Once there was a swineherd who was going from his own village to anotherThere he saw a heap of dry dung that had been thrown awayand he thought Theres a lot of dry dung somebodys thrown away that would be food for my pigs I ought to carry it awayAnd he spread out his cloak gathered up the dung in it made it into a bundle and put it on his head and went onBut on his way back there was a heavy shower of unseasonable rainand he went on his way bespattered with oozing dripping dung to his fingertips and still carrying his load of dungThose who saw him said You must be mad You must be crazy Why do you go along carrying that load of dung thats oozing and dripping all over you down to your fingertips Youre the ones that are mad Youre the ones that are crazy This stuff is food for my pigsPrince you speak just like the dungcarrier in my parablePrince give up this evil viewpointgive it upDo not let it cause you misfortune and suffering for a long timeEven though you say this Reverend Kassapa still I cannot bear to give up this evil opinionIf I give it up they will say What a fool Prince Payasi isWell then Prince I will give you a parableOnce there were two gamblers using nuts as diceOne of them whenever he got the unlucky dice swallowed itThe other noticed what he was doing and said Well my friend youre the winner all right Give me the dice and I will make an offering of themAll right said the first and gave them to himThen that one filled the dice with poison and then said Come on lets have a gameThe other agreedthey played againand once again the one player whenever he got the unlucky dice swallowed itThe second watched him do so and then uttered this verseThe dice is smeared with burning stuff Though the swallower doesnt knowSwallow cheat and swallow well  Bitter it will be like hellPrince you speak just like the gambler in my parablePrince give up this evil viewpoint give it upDo not let it cause you misfortune and suffering for a long timeEven though you say this Reverend Kassapa still I cannot bear to give up this evil opinionIf I give it up they will say What a fool Prince Payasi isWell then Prince I will give you a parableOnce the inhabitants of a certain neighbourhood migratedAnd one man said to his friend Come along lets go to that neighbourhood we might find something valuableHis friend agreedso they went to that district and came to a village street And there they saw a pile of hemp that had been thrown away and one said Heres some hemp You make a bundle Ill make a bundle and well both carry it offThe other agreed and they did so Then coming to another village streetthey found some hempthread and one said This pile of hempthread is just what we wanted the hemp forLets each throw away our bundle of hemp and well go on with a load of hempthread eachIve brought this bundle of hemp a long way and its well tied up That will do for me  you do as you likeSo his companion threw away the hemp and took the hempthreadComing to another village streetthey found some hemp cloth and one said This pile of hempcloth is just what we wanted the hemp or hempthread forYou throw away your load of hemp and Ill throw away my load of hempthread and well go on with a load of hempcloth eachBut the other replied as beforeso the one companion threw away the hempthread and took the hempclothIn another village they saw a pile of flax in another linenthread in another linencloth in another cotton in another cotton thread in another cottonclothin another iron in another copper in another tin in another lead in another silver in another gold Then one said This pile of gold is just what we wanted the hemp hempthread hemp cloth flax linenthread linencloth cotton cottonthread cottoncloth iron copper tin lead silver forYou throw away your load of hemp and Ill throw away my load of silver and well both go on with a load of gold eachIve brought this load of hemp a long way and its well tied up That will do for me  you do as you likeAnd this companion threw away the load of silver and took the load of goldThen they came back to their own villageAnd there the one who brought a load of hemp gave no pleasure to his parents nor to his wife and children nor to his friends and colleagues and he did not even get any joy or happiness from it himselfBut the one who came back with a load of gold pleased his parents his wife and children his friends and colleagues and he derived joy and happiness from it himself as wellPrince you speak just like the hempbearer in my parablePrince give up this evil view give it upDo not let it cause you misfortune and suffering for a long timeI was pleased and delighted with the Reverend Kas sapas first parableand I wanted to hear his quickwitted replies to questions because I thought he was a worthy opponentExcellent Reverend Kassapa excellentIt is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down or to point out the way to one who had got lost or to bring an oillamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there Just so has the Reverend Kassapa expounded the Dhamma in various waysAnd I Reverend Kassapa go for refuge to the Blessed Lord to the Dhamma and to the SanghaMay the Reverend Kassapa accept me from this day forth as a lay follower as long as life shall lastAnd Reverend Kassapa I want to make a great sacrifice Instruct me Reverend Kassapa how this may be to my lasting benefit and happinessPrince when a sacrifice is made at which oxen are slain or goats fowl or pigs or various creatures are slaughtered and the participants have wrong view wrong thought wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness and wrong concentration then that sacrifice is of no great fruit or profit it is not very brilliant and has no great radianceSuppose Prince a farmer went into the forest with plough and seedand there in an untilled place with poor soil from which the stumps had not been uprooted were to sow seeds that were broken rotting ruined by wind and heat stale and not properly embedded in the soiland the raingod did not send proper showers at the right time would those seeds germinate develop and increase and would the farmer get an abundant crop No Reverend KassapaWell then Prince it is the same with a sacrifice at which oxen are slain where the participants have wrong view  wrong concentrationBut when none of these creatures are put to death and the participants have right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration then that sacrifice is of great fruit and profit it is brilliant and of great radianceSuppose Prince a farmer went into the forest with plough and seedand there in a welltilled place with good soil from which the stumps had been uprooted were to sow seeds that were not broken rotting ruined by wind and heat or stale and were firmly embedded in the soiland the raingod were to send proper showers at the right time would those seeds germinate develop and increase and would the farmer get an abundant crop He would Reverend KassapaIn the same way Prince at a sacrifice at which no oxen are slain where the participants have right view right concentration then that sacrifice is of great fruit and profit it is brilliant and of great radianceThen Prince Payasi established a charity for ascetics and Brahmins wayfarers beggars and the needyAnd there such food was given out as broken rice with sour gruel and also rough clothing with ballfringesAnd a young Brahmin called Uttara was put in charge of the distributionReferring to it he said Through this charity I have been associated with Prince Payasi in this world but not in the nextAnd Prince Payasi heard of his wordsso he sent for him and asked him if he had said thatYes LordBut why did you say such a thingFriend Uttara dont we who wish to gain merit expect a reward for our charity But Lord the food you give  broken rice with sour gruel  you would not care to touch it with your foot much less eat it And the rough clothes with ballfringes  you would not care to set foot on them much less wear themLord you are kind and gentle to us so how can we reconcile such kindness and gentleness with unkindness and roughness Well then Uttara you arrange to supply food as I eatand clothes such as I wearVery good Lord said Uttara and he did soAnd Prince Payasi because he had established his charity grudgingly not with his own hands and without proper concern like something casually tossed aside was reborn after his death at the breakingup of the body in the company of the Four Great Kings in the empty Serisaka mansionBut Uttarawho had given the charity ungrudgingly with his own hands and with proper concern not as something tossed aside was reborn after death at the breakingup of the body in a good place a heavenly realm in the company of the ThirtyThree GodsNow at that time the Venerable Gavampati was accustomed to go to the empty Serisaka mansion for his midday restAnd Payasi of the devas went to the Venerable Gavampati saluted him and stood to one sideAnd the venerable Gavampati said to him as he stood there Who are you friend Lord I am Prince PayasiFriend are you not the one who used to say There is no other world there are no spontaneously bom beings there is no fruit or result of good or evil deeds Yes Lord I am the one who used to say thatbut I was converted from that evil view by the Noble Kumara KassapaAnd where has the young Brahmin Uttara who was in charge of the distribution of your charity been reborn Lord he who gave the charity ungrudgingly   was reborn in the company of the ThirtyThree Godsbut I who gave grudgingly have been reborn here in the empty Serisaka mansionLord please when you return to earth tell people to give ungrudginglyand inform them of the way in which Prince Payasiand the young Brahmin Uttara have been re bomAnd so the Venerable Gavampati on his return to earth declared You should give ungrudgingly with your own hands with proper concern not carelesslyPrince Payasi did not do this and after death at the breakingup of the body he was reborn in the company of the Four Great Kings in the empty Serisaka mansionwhereas the administrator of his charity the young Brahmin Uttara who gave ungrudgingly with his own hands with proper concern and not carelessly was reborn in the company of the ThirtyThree Gods Thus have l heard Once the Lord was staying among the Mallas Anupiya is the name of a Malla townand the Lord having dressed in the early morning and taken his robe and bowl went to Anupiya for almsThen he thought It is too early for me to go into Anupiya for almsSuppose I were to visit the hermitage of the wanderer BhaggavagottaAnd he did so And the wanderer Bhaggavagotta said Come Blessed Lordwelcome Blessed LordAt last the Blessed Lord has gone out of his way to come hereBe seated Lord a seat is preparedThe Lord sat down on the prepared seatand Bhaggava took a low stool and sat down to one sideThen he said Lord a few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me and said Bhaggava I have left the Blessed Lordl am no longer under his rulels that really so Lordlt is true Bhaggava A few days ago Sunakkhatta came to me saluted me sat down to one sideand said Lord I am leaving the Blessed LordI am no longer under the Lords ruleSo l said to him Well Sunakkhatta did l ever say to you Come Sunakkhatta be under my ruleNo LordOr did you ever say to me Lord I will be under your ruleNo LordSo Sunakkhatta if I did not say that to youand you did not say that to me you foolish man who are you and what are you giving upConsider foolish man how far the fault is yours  Well Lord you have not performed any miraclesAnd did l ever say to you Come under my rule Sunakkhatta and I will perform miracles for youNo LordOr did you ever say to me Lord I will be under your rule if you will perform miracles for meNo LordThen it appears Sunakkhatta that I made no such promises and you made no such conditionsSuch being the case you foolish man who are you and what are you giving upWhat do you think Sunakkhatta Whether miracles are performed or not  is it the purpose of my teaching Dhamma to lead whoever practises it to the total destruction of sufferinglt is Lord So Sunakkhatta whether mirlacles are performed or not the purpose of my teaching Dhamma is to lead whoever practises it to the total destruction of sufferingThen what purpose would the performance of miracles serveConsider you foolish man how far the fault is yours  Well Lord you do not teach the beginning of things And did I ever say to you Come under my rule Sunakkhatta and I will teach you the beginning of things No Lord Such being the case you foolish man who are you and what are you giving up Sunakkhatta you have in many ways spoken in praise of me among the Vajjians saying This Blessed Lord is an Arahant a fullyenlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct the WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans the Buddha the Blessed LordIn these ways you have spoken in praise of me among the Vajjians You have in many ways spoken in praise of the Dhamma saying Wellproclaimed by the Blessed Lord is the Dhamma visible here and now timeless inviting inspection leading onward to be realised by the wise each one for himselfIn these ways you have spoken in praise of the Dhamma among the Vajjians You have in many ways spoken in praise of the order of monks saying Welltrained is the order of the Lords disciples trained in uprightness methodicallytrained excellentlytrained is the order of the Lords disciples that is the four pairs of men the eight classes of individuals This is the order of the Lords disciples worthy of respect worthy of homage worthy of gifts worthy of salutation an unsurpassed field in the world for meritIn these ways you have spoken in praise of the order among the VajjiansAnd I say to you l declare to you Sunakkhattathere will be those who will say Sunakkhatta the Licchavi was unable to maintain the holy life under the ascetic Gotama and being thus unable he abandoned the training and reverted to a base life That Sunakkhatta is what they will say And Bhaggava at my words Sunakkhatta left this Dhamma and discipline like one condemned to hell Once Bhaggava I was staying among the Khulus at a place called Uttaraka a town of theirsIn the early morning l went with robe and bowl into Uttaraka for alms with Sunakkhatta as my attendantAnd at that time the naked ascetic Korakkhattiya the dogman was going round on all fours sprawling on the ground and chewing and eating his food with his mouth aloneSeeing himSunakkhatta thought Now that is a real Arahant ascetic who goes round on all fours sprawling on the ground and chewing and eating his food with his mouth alone And I knowing his thought in my own mind said to him You foolish man do you claim to be a follower of the Sakyan Lord what do you mean by this question Sunakkhatta did you not on seeing that naked ascetic going around on all fours think Now that is a real Arahant ascetic who goes round on all fours sprawling on the ground and chewing and eating his food with his mouth alone I did LordDoes the Blessed Lord begrudge others their Arahantship l do not begrudge others their Arahantship you foolish manlt is only in you that this evil view has arisenCast it aside lest it should be to your harm and sorrow for a long timeThis naked ascetic Korakkhattiya whom you regard as a true Arahantwill die in seven days from indigestionand when he is dead he will reappear among the Kalakanja asuras who are the very lowest grade of asurasAnd when he is dead he will be cast aside on a heap of biranagrass in the chamelgroundIf you want to Sunakkhatta you can go to him and ask him if he knows his fateAnd it may be that he will tell you Friend Sunakkhatta I know my fate I have been reborn among the Kalakanja asuras the very lowest grade of asuras Then Sunakkhatta went to Korakkhattiya and told him what I had prophesiedadding Therefore friend Korakkhattiya be very careful what you eat and drinkso that the ascetic Gotamas words may be proved wrongAnd Sunakkhatta was so sure that the Tathagatas words would be proved wrong that he counted up the seven days one by oneBut on the seventh day Korakkhattiya died of indigestionand when he was dead he reappeared among the Kalakanja asurasand his body was cast aside on a heap of biranagrass in the charnelground And Sunakkhatta heard of thisso he went to the heap of biranagrass in the charnelground where Korakkhattiya was lying struck the body three times with his hand and said Friend Korakkhattiya do you know your fate And Korakkhattiya sat up and rubbed his back with his hand and saidFriend Sunakkhatta I know my fateI have been reborn among the Kalakanja asuras the very lowest grade of asuras And with that he fell back againThen Sunakkhatta came to me saluted me and sat down to one sideAnd I said to him Well Sunakkhatta what do you think Has what I told you about the dogman Korakkhattiya come true or not It has come about the way you said Lord and not otherwise Well what do you think Sunakkhatta Has a miracle been performed or not Certainly Lord this being so a miracle has been performed and not otherwise Well then you foolish man do you still say to me after I have performed such a miracle Well Lord you have not performed any miraclesConsider you foolish man how far the fault is yours And at my words Sunakkhatta left this Dhamma and discipline like one condemned to hellOnce Bhaggava I was staying at Vesali at the Gabled Hall in the Great ForestAnd at that time there was a naked ascetic living in Vesali called Kalaramutthaka who enjoyed great gains and fame in the Vajjian capitalHe had undertaken seven rules of practice As long as I live l will be a naked ascetic and will not put on any clothes as long as I live I will remain chaste and abstain from sexual intercourse as long as I live I will subsist on strong drink and meat abstaining from boiled rice and sour milkas long as I live l will never go beyond the Udena shrine to the east of Vesali the Gotamaka shrine to the south the Sattamba shrine to the west nor the Bahuputta shrine to the north And it was through having undertaken these seven rules that he enjoyed the greatest gains and fame of all in the Vajjian capitalNow Sunakkhatta went to see Kalaramutthaka and asked him a questionwhich he could not answerand because he could not answer it he showed signs of anger rage and petulanceBut Sunakkhatta thought I might cause this real Arahant ascetic offenceI dont want anything to happen that would be to my lasting harm and misfortuneThen Sunakkhatta came to me saluted me and sat down to one sideI said to him You foolish man do you claim to be a follower of the Sakyan Lord what do you mean by this question Sunakkhatta did you not go to see Kalaramutthakaand ask him a question he could not answerand did he not thereupon show signs of anger rage and petulanceAnd did you not think I might cause this real Arahant ascetic offenceI dont want anything to happen that would be to my lasting harm and misfortune l did LordDoes the Blessed Lord begrudge others their Arahantship l do not begrudge others their Arahantship you foolish man It is only in you that this evil view has arisen Cast it asidelest it should be to your hann and sorrow for a long timeThis naked ascetic Kalaramutthaka whom you regard as a true Arahant will before long be living clothed and married subsisting on boiled rice and sour milk He will go beyond all the shrines of Vesali and will die having entirely lost his reputation And indeed all this came aboutThen Sunakkhatta having heard what had happened came to me And I said Well Sunakkhatta what do you think Has what I told you about Kalaramutthaka come about or not Has a miracle been performed or not And at my words Sunakkhatta left this Dhamma and discipline like one condemned to hellOnce Bhaggava I was staying at Vesali in the Gabled Hall in the Great ForestAnd at that time there was a naked ascetic living in Vesali called Patikaputta who enjoyed great gains and fame in the Vajjian capitalAnd he made this declaration in the assembly of Vesali The ascetic Gotama claims to be a man of wisdom and I make the same claimIt is right that a man of wisdom should show it by performing miraclesIf the ascetic Gotama will come halfway to meet me l will do likewiseThen we could both work miraclesand if the ascetic Gotama performs one miracle l will perform twoIf he performs two I will perform fourAnd if he performs four I will perform eightHowever many miracles the ascetic Gotama performs l will perform twice as manyThen Sunakkhatta came to me saluted me sat down to one side and told me what Patikaputta had saidI said Sunakkhatta that naked ascetic Patikaputta is not capable of meeting me face to face unless he takes back his words abandons that thought and gives up that viewAnd if he thinks otherwise his head will split in piecesLord let the Blessed Lord have a care what he says let the WellFarer have a care what he saysWhat do you mean by saying that to me Lord the Blessed Lord might make an absolute statement about Patikaputtas comingBut he might come in some altered shape and thus falsify the Blessed Lords words But Sunakkhatta would the Tathagata make any statement that was ambiguous Lord does the Blessed Lord know by his own mind what would happen to PatikaputtaOr has some deva told the Tathagata Sunakkhatta I know it by my own mindand I have also been told by a devaFor Ajita the general of the Licchavis died the other day and has been reborn in the company of the ThirtyThree GodsHe came to see me and told me Lord Patikaputta the naked ascetic is an impudent liarHe declared in the Vajjian capital Ajita the general of the Licchavis has been reborn in the great hellBut I have not been reborn in the great hell but in the company of the ThirtyThree GodsHe is an impudent liar Thus Sunakkhatta I know what I have said by my own mind but I have also been told by a devaAnd now Sunakkhatta I will go into Vesali for alms On my return after I have eaten I will go for my midday rest to Patikaputtas parkYou may tell him whatever you wishThen having dressed I took my robe and bowl and went into Vesali for almsOn my return I went to Patikaputtas park for my midday restMeanwhile Sunakkhatta rushed into Vesali and declared to all the prominent Licchavis Friends the Blessed Lord has gone into Vesali for alms and after that he has gone for his midday rest to Patikaputtas parkCome along friends come along the two great ascetics are going to work miraclesAnd all the prominent Licchavis thought The two great ascetics are going to work miracles Let us go alongAnd he went to the distinguished and wealthy Brahmins and householders and to the ascetics and Brahmins of various schoolsand told them the same thing and they too thought Let us go alongAnd so all these people came along to Patikaputtas park hundreds and thousands of themAnd Patikaputta heard that all these people had come to his parkand that the ascetic Gotama had gone there for his midday restAnd at the news he was overcome with fear and trembling and his hair stood on endAnd thus terrified and trembling his hair standing on end he made for the Tinduka lodging of the wanderersWhen the assembled company heard that he had gone to the Tinduka lodgingthey instructed a man to go there to Patikaputta and say to himFriend Patikaputta come along All these people have come to your park and the ascetic Gotama has gone there for his midday rest Because you declared to the assembly at Vesali The ascetic Gotama claims to be a man of wisdom and I make the same claimHowever many miracles he performs I will perform twice as manySo now come halfway the ascetic Gotama has already come halfway to meet you and is sitting for his midday rest in Your Reverences parkThe man went and delivered the message andon hearing it Patikaputta said Im coming friend coming but wriggle as he might he could not get up from his seatThen the man said Whats the matter with you friend Patikaputta Is your bottom stuck to the seat or is the seat stuck to your bottomYou keep saying Im coming friend Im coming but you only wriggle and cant get up from your seat And even at these words Patikaputta still wriggled about but could not riseAnd when that man realised that Patikaputta could not help himself he went back to the assembly and reported the situationAnd then I said to them Patikaputta the naked ascetic is not capable of meeting me face to face unless he takes back his words abandons that thought and gives up that viewAnd if he thinks otherwise his head will split in pieces End of first recitationsection Then Bhaggava one of the ministers of the Licchavis rose from his seat and said Well gentlemen just wait a little till I have beento see whether I can bring Patikaputta to the assembly So he went to the Tinduka lodging and said to PatikaputtaCome along Patikaputta it is best for you to come All these people have come to your parkand the ascetic Gotama has gone there for his midday restIf you come we will make you the winner and let the ascetic Gotama be defeated And Patikaputta said Im coming friend Im coming but wriggle as he might he could not get up from his seat  So the minister returned to the assembly and reported on the situationThen I said Patikaputta is not capalble of meeting me Even if the good Licchavis were to think Let us bind him with thongs and try to drag him with yoked oxen he would burst the thongsHe is not capable of meeting me face to face  Then Jaliya a pupil of the woodenbowl ascetic rose from his seatwent to the Tinduka lodging and said to Patikaputta Come along Patikaputtaif you come we will make you the winner and let the ascetic Gotama be defeated And Patikaputta said lm coming friend lm coming but wriggle as he might he could not get up from his seat Then when Jaliya realised the situation he saidPatikaputta once long ago the lion king of beasts thought Suppose I were to make my lair near a certain jungleThen I could emerge in the evening yawn survey the four quarters roar my lions roar three times and then make for the cattlepastureI could then pick out the very best of the herd for my kill and having had a good feast of tender meat return to my lair And he did accordingly Now there was an old jackal who had grown fat on the lions leavings and he was proud and strongAnd he thought What difference is there between me and the lion king of beastsSuppose I were to make my lair near the jungle  So he chose a lair accordinglyand emerging in the evening he surveyed the four quarters and then thought Now I will roar a lions roar three times  and he gave out the howl of his kind a jackal howl For what has the wretched howl of a jackal in common with a lions roarIn just the same way Patikaputta you live off the achievements of the WellFarer and feed on the WellFarers leavings imagining you can set yourself up beside the Tathagatas Arahants and fullyenlightened BuddhasBut what have wretched Patikaputtas in common with them  Then being unable even with the aid of this parable to get Patikaputta to rise from his seat Jaliyauttered this verseThinking himself a lion the jackal saysIm the king of beasts and tries to roarA lions roar but only howls insteadLion is lion and jackal jackal stillIn just the same way Patikaputta you are living off the achievements of the WellFarer And being unable even with the aid of this parable to get Patikaputta to rise from his seat Jaliyauttered this verseFollowing anothers tracks and fed On scraps his jackalnaturehe forgets Thinking Im a tiger tries to roarA mighty roar but only howls insteadLion is lion and jackals jackal stillIn just the same way Patikaputta you are living off the achievements of the WellFarerAnd being unable even with this parable to get Patikaputta to rise from his seatJaliya uttered this verseGorged on frogs and mice from threshingfloorsAnd corpses cast aside in charnelgroundsIn lonely forests wild the jackal thinksIm the king of beasts and tries to roarA lions roar but only howls insteadLion is lion and jackals jackal stillIn just the same way Patikaputta you are living off the achievements of the WellFarer feeding on the WellFarers leavings imagine you can set yourself up beside the Tathagatas Arahants and fullenlightened BuddhasBut what have wretched Patikaputtas in common with them  Then being unable even with this parable to get Patikaputta to rise from his seatJaliya returned to the assembly and reported on the situationThen I said Paticaputta is not capable of meeting me face to face unless he takes back his words abandons that thought and gives up that view Even if the good Licchavis were to think Let us bind him with thongs and try to drag him here with yoked oxenhe would burst the thongsHe is not capable of meeting me face to faceIf he thinks otherwise his head will split in piecesThen Bhaggava I instructed inspired fired and delighted that assembly with a talk on Dhamma And having thereby delivered that company from the great bondage thus rescuing eightyfour thousand beings from the great path of peril I entered into the fireelement and rose into the air to the height of seven palmtrees and projecting a beam for the height of another seven so that it blazed and shed fragrance I then reappeared in the Gabled Hall in the Great ForestAnd there Sunakkhatta came to me saluted me and sat down to one sideI said What do you think Sunakkhatta Has what I told you about Patikaputta come about or not It has Lord And has a miracle been performed or not It has Lord Well then you foolish man do you still say to me after I have performed such a miracle Well Lord you have not performed any miraclesConsider you foolish man how far the fault is yours And Bhaggava at my words Sunakkhatta left this Dhamma and discipline like one condemned to hellBhaggava I know the first beginning of thingsand l know not only that but what surpasses it in value And I am not under the sway of what I know and not being under its sway I have come to know for myself that quenching by the realisation of which the Tathagata cannot fall into perilous pathsThere are Bhaggava some ascetics and Brahmins who declare as their doctrine that all things began with the creation by a god or BrahmaI have gone to them and said Reverend sirs is it true that you declare that all things began with the creation by a god or Brahma Yes they repliedThen I asked In that case how do the reverend teachers declare that this came about But they could not give an answer and so they asked me in returnAnd I replied  There comes a time friends sooner or later after a long period when this world contractsBeings are born in the Abhassara Brahma worldand stay there a long timeWhen this world expands one being falls from thereand arises in an empty Brahma palaceHe longs for company other beings appearand he and they believe he created them That Reverend Sirs is how it comes about that you teach that all things began with the creation by a god or Brahma And they said We have heard this Reverend Gotama as you have explained But I know the first beginning of thingsand not being under the sway of what I know I have come to know that quenching by the realisationof which the Tathagata cannot fall into perilous waysThere are some ascetics and Brahmins who declare that the beginning of things was due to corruption by pleasureI went to them and asked them if this was their viewYes they repliedI asked them how this came aboutand when they could not explain I saidThere are friends certain devas called Corrupted by PleasureThey spend an excessive amount of time addicted to merrimenttheir mindfulness lapses and they fall away That Reverend Sirs is how it comes about that you teach that the beginning of things was due to corruption by pleasure And they said We have heard this Reverend Gotama as you have explainedThere are some ascetics and Brahmins who declare that the beginning of things was due to corruption of mindI went to them and asked them if this was their viewYes they repliedI asked them how this came aboutand when they could not explainI saidThere are friends certain devas called Corrupted in MindThey spend an excessive amount of time regarding each other with envytheir minds become corrupted and they fall away That Reverend Sits is how it comes about that you teach that the beginning of things was due to corruption of mind And they said We have heard this Reverend Gotama as you have explainedThere are Bhaggava some ascetics and Brahmins who declare that the beginning of things was due to chanceI went to them and asked them if this was their viewYes they repliedI asked them how this came aboutand when they could not explainI saidThere are friends certain devas called UnconsciousAs soon as a perception arises in them those devas fall from that realmremembering nothing they think Now from nonbeing I have been brought to being That Reverend Sirs is how it comes about that you teach that the beginning of things was due to chance And they said We have heard this Reverend Gotama as you have explained But I know the first beginning of things and I know not only that but what surpasses it in value And I am not under the sway of what I know and not being under its sway I have come to know for myself that quenchingby the realisation of which the Tathagata cannot fall into perilous pathsAnd I Bhaggava who teach this and declare this am wrongly vainly lyingly and falsely accused by some ascetics and Brahmins who say The ascetic Gotama is on the wrong track and so are his monksHe has declared that whoever has attained to the stage of deliverance called the Beautiful finds everything repulsive But I do not say thisWhat l say is that whenever anyone has attained to the stage of deliverance called the Beautiful he knows that it is beautifulIndeed Lord they are on the wrong track themselves who accuse the Lord and his monks of errorI am so delighted with the Lordthat I think the Lord is able to teach me to attain and remain in the deliverance called the BeautifulIt is hard for you Bhaggava holding different views being of different inclinations and subject to different influences following a different discipline and having had a different teacher to attain and remain in the deliverance called the BeautifulYou must strive hard putting your trust in me Bhaggava Lord even if it is hard for me to attain and remain in the deliverance called the Beautifulstill l will place my trust in the LordThus the Lord spokeand Bhaggava the wanderer was delighted and rejoiced at the Lords wordsThus have I heard  Once the Lord was staying among the Magadhans at MatulaThen he said MonksLord they repliedand the Lord said Monks be islands unto yourselves be a refuge unto yourselves with no other refuge Let the Dhamma be your island let the Dhamma be your refuge with no other refugeAnd how does a monk dwell as an island unto himself as a refuge unto himself with no other refuge with the Dhamma as his island with the Dhamma as his refuge with no other refugeHere a monk abides contemplating body as body ardent clearly aware and mindful having put aside hankering and fretting for the worldhe abides contemplating feelings as feelings he abides contemplating mind as mind he abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects ardent clearly aware and mindful having put aside hankering and fretting for the worldKeep to your own preserves monks to your ancestral hauntsIf you do so then Mara will find no lodgement no footholdIt is just by the buildingup of wholesome states that this merit increasesOnce monks there was a wheelturning monarch named Dalhanemi a righteous monarch of the law conqueror of the four quarters who had established the security of his realm and was possessed of the seven treasuresThese are the Wheel Treasure the Elephant Treasure the Horse Treasure the Jewel Treasure the Woman Treasure the Householder Treasurer and as seventh the Counsellor TreasureHe has more than a thousand sons who are heroes of heroic stature conquerors of the hostile armyHe dwells having conquered this seagirt land without stick or sword by the law   And after many hundreds and thousands of years King Dalhanemi said to a certain man My good man whenever you see that the sacred WheelTreasure has slipped from its position report it to meYes sire the man repliedAnd after many hundreds and thousands of years the man saw that the sacred WheelTreasure had slipped from its position Seeing this he reported the fact to the KingThen King Dalhanemi sent for his eldest son the crown prince and said My son the sacred WheelTreasure has slipped from its positionAnd I have heard say that when this happens to a wheel turning monarch he has not much longer to liveI have had my fill of human pleasures now is the time to seek heavenly pleasuresYou my son take over control of this oceanbounded landI will shave off my hair and beard don yellow robes and go forth from the household life into homelessnessAnd having installed his eldest son in due fprm as king King Dalhanemi shaved off his hair and beard donned yellow robes and went forth from the household life into homelessnessAnd seven days after the royal sage had gone forth the sacred WheelTreasure vanishedThen a certain man came to the anointed Khattiya King and said Sire you should know that the sacred WheelTreasure has disappearedAt this the King was grieved and felt sadHe went to the royal sage and told him the newsAnd the royal sage said to him My son you should not grieve or feel sad at the disappearance of the WheelTreasure The WheelTreasure is not an heirloom from your fathersBut now my son you must turn yourself into an Ariyan wheel tumerAnd then it may come about that if you perform the duties of an Ariyan wheelturning monarch on the fast day of the fifteenth when you have washed your head and gone up to the verandah on top of your palace for the fast day the sacred WheelTreasure will appear to you thousand spoked complete with felloe hub and all appurtenancesBut what sire is the duty of an Ariyan wheelturning monarch It is this my son Yourself depending on the Dhamma honouring it revering it cherishing it doing homage to it and venerating it having the Dhamma as your badge and banner acknowledging the Dhamma as your master you should establish guard ward and protection according to Dhamma for your own household your troops your nobles and vassals for Brahmins and householders town and country folk ascetics and Brahmins for beasts and birdsLet no crime prevail in your kingdomand to those who are in need give propertyAnd whatever ascetics and Brahmins in your kingdom have renounced the life of sensual infatuation and are devoted to forbearance and gentleness each one taming himself each one calming himself and each one striving for the end of craving if from time to time they should come to you and consult you as to what is wholesome and what is unwholesome what is blameworthy and what is blameless what is to be followed and what is not to be followed and what action will in the long run lead to harm and sorrow and what to welfare and happinessyou should listen and tell them to avoid evil and do what is goodThat my son is the duty of an Ariyan wheelturning monarchYes sire said the King and he performed the duties of an Ariyan wheelturning monarchAnd as he did so on the fastday of the fifteenth when he had washed his head and gone up to the verandah on top of his palace for the fastday the sacred WheelTreasure appeared to him thousandspoked complete with felloe hub and all appurtenancesThen the King thought I have heard that when a duly anointed Khattiya king sees such a wheel on the fastday of the fifteenth he will become a wheelturning monarchMay I become such a monarchThen rising from his seat covering one shoulder with his robe the King took a gold vessel in his left hand sprinkled the Wheel with his right hand and said May the noble WheelTreasure turn may the noble WheelTreasure conquerThe Wheel turned to the east and the King followed it with his fourfold armyAnd in whatever country the Wheel stopped the King took up residence with his fourfold armyAnd those who opposed him in the eastern region came and said Come Your Majesty welcome We are yours Your Majesty Rule us Your MajestyAnd the King said Do not take life Do not take what is not given Do not commit sexual misconduct Do not tell lies Do not drink strong drink Be moderate in eatingAnd those who had opposed him in the eastern region became his subjectsThen the Wheel turned south west and north Then the WheelTreasure having conquered the lands from sea to sea returned to the royal dapital and stopped before the Kings palace as he was trying a case as if to adorn the royal palaceAnd a second wheelturning monarch did likewise and a third a fourth a fifth a sixth and a seventh king also told a man to see if the Wheel had slipped from its position And seven days after the royal sage had gone forth the Wheel disappearedThen a man came to the King and said Sire you should know that the sacred WheelTreasure has disappearedAt this the King was grieved and felt sadBut he did not go to the royal sage and ask him about the duties of a wheel turning monarchInstead he ruled the people according to his own ideasand being so ruled the people did not prosper so well as they had done under the previous kings who had performed the duties of a wheelturning monarchThen the ministers counsellors treasury officials guards and doorkeepers and the chanters of mantras came to the King and said Sire as long as you rule the people according to your own ideas and differently from the way they were ruled before under previous wheelturning monarchs the people do not prosper so wellSire there are ministers in your realm including ourselves who have preserved the knowledge of how a wheelturning monarch should ruleAsk us Your Majestyand we will tell youThen the King ordered all the ministers and others to come together and he consulted themAnd they explained to him the duties of a wheelturning monarchAnd having listened to them the King established guard and protection but he did not give property to the needyand as a result poverty became rifeWith the spread of poverty a man took what was not given thus committing what was called theftThey arrested himand brought him before the King saying Your Majesty this man took what was not given which we call theftThe King said to him Is it true that you took what was not given  which is called theft It is Your MajestyWhy Your Majesty I have nothing to live onThen the King gave the man some property saying With this my good man you can keep yourself support your mother and father keep a wife and children carry on a business and make gifts to ascetics and Brahmins which will promote your spiritual welfare and lead to a happy rebirth with pleasant result in the heavenly sphereVery good Your Majesty replied the manAnd exactly the same thing happened with another manThen people heard that the King was giving away property to those who took what was not givenand they thought Suppose we were to do likewiseAnd then another man took what was not givenand they brought him before the KingThe King asked him why he had done thisand he replied Your Majesty I have nothing to live onThen the King thought If I give property to everybody who takes what is not given this theft will increase more and moreI had better make an end of him finish him off once for all and cut his head offSo he commanded his men Bind this mans arms tightly behind him with a strong rope shave his head closely and lead him to the rough sound of a drum through the streets and squares and out through the southern gate and there finish by inflicting the capital penalty and cutting off his headAnd they did soHearing about this people thought Now let us get sharp swords made for us and then we can take from anybody what is not given which is called theft we will make an end of them finish them off once for all and cut off their headsSo having procured some sharp swords they launched murderous assaults on villages towns and cities and went in for highwayrobberykilling their victims by cutting off their headsThus from the not giving of property to the needy poverty became rife from the growth of poverty the taking of what was not given increased from the increase of theft the use of weapons increased from the increased use of weapons the taking of life increased  and from the increase in the taking of life peoples lifespan decreased their beauty decreasedand as a result of this decrease of lifespan and beauty the children of those whose lifespan had been eighty thousand years lived for only forty thousandAnd a man of the generation that lived for forty thousand years took what was not givenHe was brought before the Kingwho asked him Is it true that you took what was not given  what is called theft No Your Majesty he replied thus telling a deliberate lieThus from the not giving of property to the needythe taking of life increased and from the taking of life lying increased from the increase in lying peoples lifespan decreased their beauty decreasedand as a result the children of those whose lifespan had been forty thousand years lived for only twenty thousandAnd a man of the generation that lived for twenty thousand years took what was not givenAnother man denounced him to the King saying Sire suchandsuch a man has taken what was not given thus speaking evil of anotherThus from the not giving of property to the needythe speaking evil of others increased and in consequence peoples lifespan decreased their beauty decreasedand as a result the children of those whose lifespan had been twenty thousand years lived only for ten thousandAnd of the generation that lived for ten thousand years some were beautiful and some were uglyAnd those who were ugly being envious of those who were beautiful committed adultery with others wivesThus from the not giving of property to the needy sexual misconduct increased and in consequence peoples lifespan decreased their beauty decreasedand as a result the children of those whose lifespan had been ten thousand years lived for only five thousandAnd among the generation whose lifespan was five thousand years two things increased harsh speech and idle chatterin consequence of which peoples lifespan decreased their beauty decreasedand as a result the children of those whose lifespan had been five thousand years lived some for twoandahalf thousand years and some for only two thousandAnd among the generation whose lifespan was twoanda half thousand years covetousness and hatred increasedand in consequence peoples lifespan decreased their beauty decreasedand as a result the children of those whose lifespan had been twoandahalf thousand years lived for only a thousandAmong the generation whose lifespan was a thousand years false opinions increasedand as a result the children of those whose lifespan had been a thousand years lived for only five hundredAnd among the generation whose lifespan was five hundred years three things increasedincest excessive greed and deviant practices and as a result the children of those whose lifespan had been five hundred years lived some for two hundred and fifty years some for only two hundredAnd among those whose lifespan was two hundred and fifty years these things increasedlack of respect for mother and father for ascetics and Brahmins and for the head of the clanThus from the not giving of property to the needylack of respect for mother and father for ascetics and Brahmins and for the head of the clan increasedand in consequence peoples lifespan and beauty decreasedand the children of those whose lifespan had been twoandahalf centuries lived for only a hundred yearsMonks a time will come when the children of these people will have a lifespan of ten yearsAnd with them girls will be marriageable at five years oldAnd with them these flavours will disappear ghee butter sesameoil molasses and saltAmong them kudrusagrainb will be the chief foodjust as rice and curry are todayAnd with them the ten courses of moral conduct will completely disappear and the ten courses of evil will prevail exceedinglyfor those of a tenyear lifespan there will be no word for moral so how can there be anyone who acts in a moral wayThose people who have no respect for mother or father for ascetics and Brahmins for the head of the clan will be the ones who enjoy honour and prestigeJust as it is now the people whoshow respect for mother and father for ascetics and Brahmins for the head of the clan who are praised and honoured so it will be with those who do the oppositeAmong those of a tenyear lifespan no account will be taken of mother or aunt of mothers sisterinlaw of teachers wife or of ones fathers wives and so on all will be promiscuous in the world like goats and sheep fowl and pigs dogs and jackalsAmong them fierce enmity will prevail one for another fierce hatred fierce anger and thoughts of killingmother against child and child against mother father against child and child against father brother against brother brother against sisterjust as the hunter feels hatred for the beast he stalksAnd for those of a tenyear lifespan there will come to be a swordinterval of seven daysduring which they will mistake one another for wild beastsSharp swords will appear in their handsand thinking There is a wild beast they will take each others lives with those swordsBut there will be some beings who will think Let us not kill or be killed by anyone Let us make for some grassy thickets or junglerecesses or clumps of trees for rivers hard to ford or inaccessible mountains and live on roots and fruits of the forestAnd this they will do for seven daysThen at the end of the sever days they will emerge from their hidingplaces and rejoice together of one accord saying Good beings I see that you are aliveAnd then the thought will occur to those beings It is only because we became addicted to evil ways that we suffered this loss of our kindredso let us now do goodWhat good things can we doLet us abstain from the taking of life that will be a good practiceAnd so they will abstain from the taking of life and having undertaken this good thing will practise itAnd through having undertaken such wholesome things they will increase in lifespan and beautyAnd the children of those whose lifespan was ten years will live for twenty yearsThen it will occur to those beings It is through having taken to wholesome practices that we have increased in lifespan and beautyso let us perform still more wholesome practicesLet us refrain from taking what is not given from sexual misconduct from lying speech from slander from harsh speech from idle chatter from covetousness from illwill from wrong views let us abstain from three things incest excessive greed and deviant practices let us respect our mothers and fathers ascetics and Brahmins and the head of the clan and let us persevere in these wholesome actionsAnd so they will do these thingsand on account of this they will increase in lifespan and in beautyThe children of those whose lifespan is twenty years will live to be forty their children will live to be eighty their children to be a hundred and sixty their children to be three hundred and twenty their children to be six hundred and fortythe children of those whose lifespan is six hundred and forty years will live for two thousand years their children for four thousand their children for eight thousand and their children for twenty thousandThe children of those whose lifespan is twenty thousand years will live to be forty thousand and their children will attain to eighty thousand years  Among the people with an eighty thousandyear lifespan girls will become marriageable at five hundredAnd such people will know only three kinds of disease greed fasting and old ageAnd in the time of those people this continent of Jambudipa will be powerful and prosperous and villages towns and cities will be but a cocks flight one from the nextThis Jambudipa like Avici will be as thick with people as the jungle is thick with reeds and rushesAt that time the Varanasi of today will be a royal city called Ketumati powerful and prosperous crowded with people and wellsuppliedIn Jambudipa there will be eightyfour thousand cities headed by Ketumati as the royal capitalAnd in the time of the people with an eighty thousand year lifespan there will arise in the capital city of Ketumati a king called Sankha a wheelturning monarch a righteous monarch of the law conqueror of the four quartersAnd in that time of the people with an eighty thousand year lifespan there will arise in the world a Blessed Lord an Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha named Metteyya endowed with wisdom and conduct a WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans enlightened and blessedjust as I am nowHe will thoroughly know by his own superknowledge and prodaim this universe with its devas and maras and Brahmas its ascetics and Brahmins and this generation with its princes and people just as I do nowHe will teach the Dhamma lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle lovely in its ending in the spirit and in the letter and proclaim just as I do now the holy life in its fullness and purityHe will be attended by a company of thousands of monks just as I am attended by a company of hundredsThen King Sankha will reerect the palace once built by King MahaPanadaand having lived in it will give it up and present it to the ascetics and Brahmins the beggars the wayfarers the destitute Then shaving off hair and beard he will don yellow robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness under the supreme Buddha MetteyyaHaving gone forth he will remain alone in seclusion ardent eager and resolute and before long he will have attained in this very life by his own superknowledge and resolution that unequalled goal of the holy life for the sake of which young men of good family go forth from the household life into homelessness and will abide thereinMonks be islands unto yourselves be a refuge unto yourselves with no other refuge Let the Dhamma be your island let the Dhamma be your refuge with no other refugeAnd how does a monk dwell as an island unto himself Here a monk abides contemplating body as body ardent clearly aware and mindful having put aside hankering and fretting for the worldhe abides contemplating feelings as feelings he abides contemplating mind as mind he abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects ardent clearly aware and mindful having put aside hankering and fretting for the worldKeep to your own preserves monks to your ancestral hauntsIf you do so your lifespan will increase your beauty will increase your happiness will increase your wealth will increase your power will increaseAnd what is length of life for a monkHere a monk develops the road to power which is concentration of intention accompanied by effort of will the road to power which is concentration of energy the road to power which is concentration of consciousness the road to power which is concentration of investigation accompanied by effort of willBy frequently practising these four roads to power he can if he wishes live for a full century or the remaining part of a centuryThat is what I call length of life for a monkAnd what is beauty for a monkHere a monk practises right conduct is restrained according to the discipline is perfect in behaviour and habits sees danger in the slightest fault and trains in the rules of training he has undertakenThat is beauty for a monkAnd what is happiness for a monkHere a monk detached from sensedesires enters the first jhanathe second third fourth jhana purified by equanimity and mindfulnessThat is happiness for a monkAnd what is wealth for a monkHere a monk with his heart filled with lovingkindness dwells suffusing one quarter the secondthe thirdthe fourthThus he dwells suffusing the whole world upwards downwards across  everywhere always with a mind filled with lovingkindness abundant unbounded without hate or illwillThen with his heart filled with compassion with his heart filled with sympathetic joy with his heart filled with equanimityhe dwells suffusing the whole world upwards downwards across everywhere always with a mind filled with equanimity abundant unbounded without hate or illwillThat is wealth for a monkAnd what is power for a monkHere a monk by the destruction of the corruptions enters into and abides in that cor ruptionless liberation of heart and liberation by wisdom which he has attained in this very life by his own superknowledge and realisationThat is power for a monkMonks I do not consider any power so hard to conquer as the power of MaraIt is just by this buildingup of wholesome states that this merit increases Thus the Lord spokeand the monks were delighted and rejoiced at his wordsTHUS HAVE I HEARD Once the Lord was staying at Savatthi at the mansion of Migaras mother in the East ParkAnd at that time Vasettha and Bharadvaja were living among the monks hoping to become monks themselvesAnd in the evening the Lord rose from his secluded meditation and came out of the mansion and started walking up and down in its shadeVasettha noticed thisand he said to Bharadvaja Friend Bharadvaja the Lord has come out and is walking up and downLet us approach him We might be fortunate enough to hear a talk on Dhamma from the Lord himself Yes indeed said Bharadvajaso they went up to the Lord saluted him and fell into step with himThen the Lord said to Vasettha Vasettha you two are Brahmins bom and bred and you have gone forth from the household life into homelessness from Brahmin families Do not the Brahmins revile and abuse youIndeed Lord the Brahmins do revile and abuse us They dont hold back with their usual flood of reproaches Well Vasettha what kind of reproaches do they fling at you Lord what the Brahmins say is this The Brahmin caste is the highest caste other castes are basethe Brahmin caste is fair other castes are darkBrahmins are purified nonBrahmins are notthe Brahmins are the true children of Brahma born from his mouth bom of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of BrahmaAnd you you have deserted the highest class and gone over to the base class of shaveling petty ascetics servants dark fellows bom of Brahmas footIts not right its not proper for you to mix with such peopleThat is the way the Brahmins abuse us LordThen Vasettha the Brahmins have forgotten their ancient tradition when they say thatBecause we can see Brahmin women the wives of Brahmins who menstruate and become pregnant have babies and give suckAnd yet these wombbom Brahmins talk about being born from Brahmas mouth  These Brahmins misrepresent Brahma tell lies and earn much demeritThere are Vasettha these four castes the Khattiyas the Brahmins the merchants and the artisansAnd sometimes a Khattiya takes life takes what is not given commits sexual misconduct tells lies indulges in slander harsh speech or idle chatter is grasping malicious or of wrong viewsThus such things as are immoral and considered so blameworthy and considered so to be avoided and considered so ways unbefitting an Ariyan and considered so black with black result and blamed by the wise are sometimes to be found among the Khattiyas and the same applies to Brahmins merchants and artisansSometimes too a Khattiya refrains from taking life is not grasping malicious or of wrong viewsThus such things as are moral and considered so blameless and considered so to be followed and considered so ways befitting an Ariyan and considered so bright with bright results and praised by the wise are sometimes to be found among the Khattiyas and likewise among Brahmins merchants and artisansNow since both dark and bright qualities which are blamed and praised by the wise are scattered indiscriminately among the four castesthe wise do not recognise the claim about the Brahmin caste being the highestWhy is thatBecause Vasettha anyone from the four castes who becomes a monk an Arahant who has destroyed the corruptions who has lived the life done what had to be done laid down the burden reached the highest goal destroyed the fetter of becoming and become emancipated through superknowledge  he is proclaimed supreme by virtue of Dhamma and not of nonDhammaDhammas the best thing for people In this life and the next as wellThis illustration will make clear to you how Dhamma is best in this world and in the nextKing Pasenadi of Kosala knows The ascetic Gotama has gone forth from the neighbouring clan of the SakyansNow the Sakyans are vassals of the King of KosalaThey offer him humble service and salute him rise and do him homage and pay him fitting serviceAnd just as the Sakyans offer the King humble service   so likewise does the King offer humble service to the Tathagata thinking If the ascetic Gotama is wellborn I am ill bornif the ascetic Gotama is strong I am weakif the ascetic Gotama is pleasant to look at I am illfavouredif the ascetic Gotama is influential I am of little influenceNow it is because of honouring the Dhamma making much of the Dhamma esteeming the Dhamma doing reverent honciage to the Dhamma that King Pasenadi does humble service to the Tathagata and pays him fitting serviceDhammas the best thing for people In this life and the next as wellVasettha all of you though of different birth name clan and family who have gone forth from the household life into homelessnessif you are asked who you are should reply We are ascetics followers of the SakyanHe whose faith in the Tathagata is settled rooted established solid unshake able by any ascetic or Brahmin any deva or mara or Brahma or anyone in the world can truly say I am a true son of Blessed Lord born of his mouth born of Dhamma created by Dhamma an heir of DhammaWhy is thatBecause Vasettha this designates the Tathagata The Body of Dhamma that is The Body of Brahma or Become Dhamma that is Become BrahmaThere comes a time Vasettha when sooner or later after a long period this world contractsAt a time of contraction beings are mostly born in the Abhassara Brahma worldAnd there they dwell mindmade feeding on delight selfluminous moving through the air glorious  and they stay like that for a very long timeBut sooner or later after a very long period this world begins to expand againAt a time of expansion the beings from the Abhassara Brahma world having passed away from there are mostly reborn in this worldHere they dwell mindmade feeding on delight self luminous moving through the air glorious  and they stay like that for a very long timeAt that period Vasettha there was just one mass of water and all was darkness blinding darknessNeither moon nor sun appeared no constellations or stars appeared night and day were not distinguished nor months and fortnights no years or seasons and no male and female beings being reckoned just as beingsAnd sooner or later after a very long period of time savoury earth spread itself over the waters where those beings were It looked just like the skin that forms itself over hot milk as it coolsIt was endowed with colour smell and taste It was the colour of fine ghee or butterand it was very sweet like pure wild honeyThen some being of a greedy nature said I say what can this be  and tasted the savoury earth on its fingerIn so doing it became taken with the flavour and craving arose in itThen other beings taking their cue from that one also tasted the stuff with their fingersThey too were taken with the flavour and craving arose in themSo they set to with their hands breaking off pieces of the stuff in order to eat itAnd the result of thiswas that their selfluminance disappearedAnd as a result of the disappearance of their selfluminance the moon and the sun appearednight and day were distinguishedmonths and fortnights appearedand the year and its seasonsTo that extent the world reevolvedAnd those beings continued for a very long time feasting on this savoury earth feeding on it and being nourished by itAnd as they did so their bodies became coarser and a difference in looks developed among themSome beings became goodlooking others uglyAnd the goodlooking ones despised the others saying We are betterlooking than they are And because they became arrogant and conceited about their looks the savoury earth disappearedAt this they came together and lamentedcrying Oh that flavour Oh that flavourAnd so nowadays when people say Oh that flavour when they get something nicethey are repeating an ancient saying without realising itAnd then when the savoury earth had disappeared a fungus cropped upin the manner of a mushroomIt was of a good colour smell and taste It was the colour of fine ghee or butterand it was very sweet like pure wild honeyAnd those beings set to and ate the fungusAnd this lasted for a very long timeAnd as they continued to feed on the fungus so their bodies became coarser still and the difference in their looks increased still moreAnd the goodlooking ones despised the othersAnd because they became arrogant and conceited about their looks the sweet fungus disappearedNext creepers appeared shooting up like bamboo and they too were very sweet like pure wild honeyAnd those beings set to and fed on those creepersAnd as they did so their bodies became even coarser and the difference in their looks increased still moreAnd they became still more arrogant and so the creepers disappeared tooAt this they came togetherand lamented crying Alas our creepers gone What have we lostAnd so now today when people on being asked why they are upset say Oh what have we lostthey are repeating an ancient saying without realising itAnd then after the creepers had disappeared rice appeared in open spaces free from powder and from husks fragrant and cleangrainedAnd what they had taken in the evening for supper had grown again and was ripe in the morningand what they had taken in the morning for breakfast was ripe again by evening with no sign of reapingAnd these beings set to and fed on this rice and this lasted for a very long timeAnd as they did so their bodies became coarser still and the difference in their looks became even greater And the females developed female sexorgans and the males developed male organsAnd the women became excessively preoccupied with men and the men with womenOwing to this excessive preoccupation with each other passion was aroused and their bodies burnt with lustAnd later because of this burning they indulged in sexual activityBut those who saw them indulging threw dust ashes or cowdung at them crying Die you filthy beastHow can one being do such things to anotherJust as today in some districts when a daughterinlaw is led out some people throw dirt at her some ashes and some cowdungwithout realising that they are repeating an ancient observanceWhat was considered bad form in those days is now considered good formAnd those beings who in those days indulged in sex were not allowed into a village or town for one or two monthsAccordingly those who indulged for an excessively long period in such immoral practicesbegan to build themselves dwellings so as to indulge under coverNow it occurred to one of those beings who was inclined to laziness Well now why should I be bothered to gather rice in the evening for supper and in the morning for breakfastWhy shouldnt I gather it all at once for both mealsAnd he did soThen another one came to him and said Come on lets go ricegatheringNo need my friend Ive gathered enough for both meals Then the other following his example gathered enough rice for two days at a time sayingThat should be about enough Then another being came and said to that second one Come on lets go ricegathering No need my friend Ive gathered enough for two days However when those beings made a store of rice and lived on thathuskpowder and husk began to envelop the grain and where it was reaped it did not grow again and the cut place showed and the rice grew in separate clustersAnd then those beings came together lamenting Wicked ways have become rife among usat first we were mindmade feeding on delightand the rice grows in separate clustersSo now let us divide up the rice into fields with boundaries So they did soThen Vasettha one greedynatured being while watching over his own plot took another plot that was not given to him and enjoyed the fruits of itSo they seized hold of him and said Youve done a wicked thing taking anothers plot like thatDont ever do such a thing againI wont he saidbut he did the same thing a second and a third timeAgain he was seized and rebuked and some hit him with their fists some with stones and some with sticksAnd in this way Vasettha taking what was not given and censuring and lying and punishment took their originThen those beings came together and lamented the arising of these evil things among them taking what was not given censuring lying and punishmentAnd they thought Suppose we were to appoint a certain being who would show anger where anger was due censure those who deserved it and banish those who deserved banishmentAnd in return we would grant him a share of the rice So they went to the one among them who was the handsomest the bestlooking the most pleasant and capable and asked him to do this for them in return for a share of the rice and he agreedThe Peoples Choice is the meaning of MahaSammata which is the first regular title to be introducedLord Of The Fields is the meaning of Khattiya the second such titleAnd He Gladdens Others With Dhamma is the meaning of Raja the third title to be introducedThis then Vasettha is the origin of the class of Khattiyas in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them They originated among these very same beingslike ourselves no differentand in accordance with Dhamma not otherwiseDhammas the best thing for people In this life and the next as wellThen some of these beings thought Evil things have appeared among beings such as taking what is not given censuring lying punishment and banishmentWe ought to put aside evil and unwholesome things And they did soThey Put Aside Evil And Uwholesome Things is the meaning of Brahmin which is the first regular title to be introduced for such peopleThey made leafhuts in forest places and meditated in them With the smoking fire gone out with pestle cast aside gathering alms for their evening and morning meals they went away to a village town or royal city to seek their foodand then they returned to their leaf huts to meditatePeople saw this and noted how they meditatedThey Meditate is the meaning of Jhayaka which is the second regular title to be introducedHowever some of those beings not being able to meditate in leafhuts settled around towns and villages and compiled booksPeople saw them doing this and not meditatingNow These Do Not Meditate is the meaning of Ajjhayaka which is the third regular title to be introducedAt that time it was regarded as a low designation but now it is the higherThis then Vasettha is the origin of the class of Brahmins in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them Their origin was from among these very same beings like themselves no different and in accordance with Dhamma not otherwiseDhammas the best thing for people In this life and the next as wellAnd then Vasettha some of those beings having paired off adopted various trades and this Various is the meaning of Vessa which came to be the regular title for such peopleThis then is the origin of the class of Vessas in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for themTheir origin was from among these very same beingsAnd then Vasettha those beings that remained went in for huntingThey Are Base Who Live By The Chase and that is the meaning of Sudda which came to be the regular title for such peopleThis then is the origin of the class of Suddas in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them Their origin was from among these very same beingsAnd then Vasettha it came about that some Khattiya dissatisfied with his own Dhamma went forth from the household life into homelessness thinking I will become an ascetic And a Brahmin did likewise a Vessa did likewise and so did a SuddaAnd from these four classes the class of ascetics came into existence Their origin was from among these very same beings like themselves no different and in accordance with Dhamma not otherwiseDhammas the best thing for people In this life and the next as wellAnd Vasettha a Khattiya who has led a bad life in body speech and thought and who has wrong view will in consequence of such wrong views and deeds at the breaking up of the body after death be reborn in a state of loss an ill fate the downfall the hellstateSo too will a Brahmin a Vessa or a SuddaLikewise a Khattiya who has led a good life in body speech and thought and who has right view will in consequence of such right view and deeds at the breakingup of the body after death be reborn in a good destiny in a heaven stateSo too will a Brahmin a Vessa or a SuddaAnd a Khattiya who has performed deeds of both kinds in body speech and thought and whose view is mixed will in consequence of such mixed views and deeds at the breakingup of the body after death experience both pleasure and painSo too will a Brahmin a Vessa or a SuddaAnd a Khattiya who is restrained in body speech and thought and who has developed the seven requisites of enlightenment will attain to Parinibbana in this very lifeSo too will a Brahmin a Vessa or a SuddaAnd Vasettha whoever of these four castes as a monk becomes an Arahant who has destroyed the corruptions done what had to be done laid down the burden attained to the highest goal completely destroyed the fetter of becoming and become liberated by the highest insight he is declared to be chief among them in accordance with Dhammaand not otherwiseDhammas the best thing for people In this life and the next as wellVasettha it was Brahma Sanankumara who spoke this verseThe Khattiyas best among those who value clanHe with knowledge and conduct is best of gods and men This verse was rightly sung not wronglyrightly spoken not wronglyconnected with profit not unconnectedI too say VasetthaThe Khattiyas best among those who value clanHe with knowledge and conduct is best of gods and menThus the Lord spokeand Vasettha and Bharadvaja were delighted and rejoiced at his wordsThus have I heard Once the Lord was staying at Rajagaha at the Squirrels Feeding Place in the Bamboo GroveAnd at that time Sigalaka the householders son having got up early and gone out of Rajagaha was paying homage with wet clothes and hair and with joined palms to the different directions to the east the south the west the north the nadir and the zenithAnd the Lord having risen early and dressed took his robe and bowl and went to Rajagaha for almsAnd seeing Sigalaka paying homage to the different directionshe said Householders son why have you got up early to pay homage to the different directionsLord my father when he was dying told me to do soAnd so Lord out of respect for my fathers words which I revere honour and hold sacred I have got up thus early to pay homage in this way to the six directionsThis is what I heard  On one occasion the Buddha was living near the town of Rajagaha at a spot in the Bamboo Grove called the Squirrels Feeding PlaceAt that time a young householder named Sigalaka arose early and set out from Rajagaha with freshly washed clothes and hair With palms together held up in reverence he was paying respect towards the six directions that is east south west north lower and upperMeanwhile the Buddha dressed himself in the early morning took his bowl and robe and went in to Rajagaha on alms roundOn the way he saw Sigalaka worshipping the six directionsSeeing this the Buddha said to him Young man why have you risen in the early morning and set out from Rajagaha to worship in such a way Dear sir my father on his deathbed urged me My son you must worship the directionsSo dear sir realizing honoring respecting and holding sacred my fathers request I have risen in the early morning and set out from Rajagaha to worship in this wayBut householders son that is not the right way to pay homage to the six directions according to the Ariyan disciplineWell Lord how should one pay homage to the six directions according to the Ariyan disciplineIt would be good if the Blessed Lord were to teach me the proper way to pay homage to the six directions according to the Ariyan disciplineThen listen carefully pay attention and I will speakYes Lord said Sigalakaand the Lord saidYoung householder it is by abandoning the four defilements of action by not doing evil from the four causes by not following the six ways of wasting ones substance  through avoiding these fourteen evil ways  that the Ariyan disciple covers the six directions and by such practice becomes a conqueror of both worldsso that all will go well with him in this world and the nextand at the breakingup of the body after death he will go to a good destiny a heavenly worldBut young man that is not how the six directions should be worshipped according to the discipline of the noble onesThen how dear sir should the six directions be worshipped according to the discipline of the noble onesI would appreciate it if you would teach me the proper way this should be doneVery well young man listen and pay careful attention while I tell youYes dear sir agreed SigalakaThe Buddha said thisYoung man by abandoning the four impure actions a noble disciple refrains from harmful deeds rooted in four causes and avoids the six ways of squandering wealth So these fourteen harmful things are removed The noble disciple now with the six directions protected has entered upon a path for conquering both worldsfirmly grounded in this world and the nextAt the dissolution of the body after death a good rebirth occurs in a heavenly worldWhat are the four defilements of action that are abandonedTaking life is one taking what is not given is one sexual misconduct is one lying speech is oneThese are the four defilements of action that he abandonsThus the Lord spoke  And the WellFarer having spoken the Teacher addedTaking life and stealing lyingAdultery the wise reproveWhat four impure actions are abandonedThe harming of living beings is an impure action taking what is not given is an impure action sexual misconduct is an impure action and false speech is an impure actionThese four are abandonedThat is what the Buddha said  Summing up in verse the sublime teacher saidHarming living beings taking what is not given False speechand pursuing the loved one of another These the wise surely do not praiseWhat are the four causes of evil from which he refrainsEvil action springs from attachment it springs from illwill it springs from folly it springs from fearIf the Ariyan disciple does not act out of attachment illwill folly or fear he will not do evil from any one of the four causesThus the Lord spoke  And the WellFarer having spoken the Teacher addedDesire and hatred fear and folly He who breaks the law through theseLoses all his fair repute Like the moon at waningtimeDesire and hatred fear and folly He who never yields to theseGrows in goodness and repute Like the moon at waxingtimeWhat are the four causes of harmful deedsGoing astray through desire hatred delusion or fear the noble disciple does harmful deedsBut young man not going astray through desire hatred delusion or fear the noble disciple does not perform harmful deedsThat is what the Buddha said  Summing up in verse the sublime teacher saidDesire hatred delusion or fear Whoever transgresses the Dhamma by theseHas a reputation that comes to ruin Like the moon in the waning fortnightDesire hatred delusion or fear Whoever transgresses not the Dhamma by theseHas a reputation that comes to fullness Like the moon in the waxing fortnightAnd which are the six ways of wasting ones substance that he does not followAddiction to strong drink and sloth producing drugs is one way of wasting ones substance haunting the streets at unfitting times is one attending fairs is one being addicted to gambling is one keeping bad company is one habitual idleness is oneAnd what six ways of squandering wealth are to be avoidedYoung man heedlessness caused by intoxication roaming the streets at inappropriate times habitual partying compulsive gambling

foes in friendly guisethe man who is all take is one the great talker is one the flatterer is one and the fellow spendthrift is oneThe man who is all take can be seen to be a false friend for four reasonshe takes everything he wants a lot for very littlewhat he must do he does out of fear and he seeks his own endsThe great talker can be seen to be a false friend for four reasonshe talks of favours in the past and in the future he mouths empty phrases of goodwill and when something needs to be done in the present he pleads inability owing to some disasterThe flatterer can be seen to be a false friend for four reasonshe assents to bad actions he dissents from good actions he praises you to your face and he disparages you behind your backThe fellowspendthrift can be seen to be a false friend for four reasonshe is a companion when you indulge in strong drink when you haunt the streets at unfitting times when you frequent fairs and when you indulge in gamblingThus the Lord spoke  And the WellFarer having spoken the Teacher addedThe friend who seeks what he can get The friend who talks but empty wordsThe friend who merely flatters you The friend who is a fellowwastrelThese four are really foes not friends The wise man recognising thisShould hold himself aloof  from them As from some path of panic fearYoung man be aware of these four enemies disguised as friendsthe taker the talker the flatterer and the reckless companionThe taker can be identified by four thingsby only taking asking for a lot while giving littleperforming duty out of fear and offering service in order to gain somethingThe talker can be identified by four thingsby reminding of past generosity promising future generosity mouthing empty words of kindness and protesting personal misfortune when called on to helpThe flatterer can be identified by four thingsby supporting both bad and good behavior indiscriminately praising you to your face and putting you down behind your backThe reckless companion can be identified by four thingsby accompanying you in drinking roaming around at night partying and gamblingThat is what the Buddha said  Summing up in verse the sublime teacher saidThe friend who is all take The friend of empty wordsThe friend full of flattery And the reckless friendThese four are not friends but enemies The wise understand thisAnd keep them at a distance As they would a dangerous pathHouseholders son there are these four types who can be seen to be loyal friendsthe friend who is a helper is one the friend who is the same in happy and unhappy times is one the friend who points out what is good for you is one and the friend who is sympathetic is oneThe helpful friend can be seen to be a loyal friend in four wayshe looks after you when you are inattentive he looks after your possessions when you are inattentive he is a refuge when you are afraid and when some business is to be done he lets you have twice what you ask forThe friend who is the same in happy and unhappy times can be seen to be a loyal friend in four wayshe tells you his secrets he guards your secrets he does not let you down in misfortune he would even sacrifice his life for youThe friend who points out what is good for you can be seen to be a loyal friend in four wayshe keeps you from wrongdoing he supports you in doing good he informs you of what you did not know and he points out the path to heavenThe sympathetic friend can be seen to be a loyal friend in four wayshe does not rejoice at your misfortune he rejoices at your good fortune he stops others who speak against you and he commends others who speak in praise of youThus the Lord spoke  And the WellFarer having spoken thus the Teacher addedThe friend who is a helper and The friend in times both good and badThe friend who shows the way thats right The friend whos full of sympathyThese four kinds of friends the wise Should know at their true worthand he Should cherish them with care just like A mother with her dearest childThe wise man trained and disciplined Shines out like a beaconfireHe gathers wealth just as the bee Gathers honeyand it grows Like an anthill higher yetWith wealth so gained the layman can Devote it to his peoples goodHe should divide his wealth in four One part he may enjoy at will Two parts he should put to workThe fourth part he should set aside As reserve in times of needYoung man be aware of these four goodhearted friendsthe helper the friend who endures in good times and bad the mentor and the compassionate friendThe helper can be identified by four thingsby protecting you when you are vulnerable and likewise your wealth being a refuge when you are afraid and in various tasks providing double what is requestedThe enduring friend can be identified by four thingsby telling you secrets guarding your own secrets closely not abandoning you in misfortune and even dying for youThe mentor can be identified by four thingsby restraining you from wrongdoing guiding you towards good actions telling you what you ought to know and showing you the path to heavenThe compassionate friend can be identified by four thingsby not rejoicing in your misfortune delighting in your good fortune preventing others from speaking ill of you and encouraging others who praise your good qualitiesThat is what the Buddha said  Summing up in verse the sublime teacher saidThe friend who is a helper The friend through thick and thinThe friend who gives good counsel And the compassionate friendThese four are friends indeed The wise understand thisAnd attend on them carefully Like a mother her own childThe wise endowed with virtue Shine forth like a burning fireGathering wealth as bees do honeyAnd heaping it up like an ant hillOnce wealth is accumulated Family and household life may followBy dividing wealth into four parts True friendships are boundOne part should be enjoyed Two parts invested in businessAnd the fourth set aside Against future misfortunesThus I have heard at one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Rājagaha on the Vultures Peak MountainThen the Four Great Kings with a great army of yakkhas with a great army of gandhabbas with a great army of kumbhaṇḍas with a great army of nāgas having set up a protection over the four quarters having set serried troops at the four directions having set up a barricade at the four directions at the end of the night having lit up the whole of Vultures Peak with their surpassing beauty approached the Gracious One and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One they sat down on one sideThen of those yakkhas some after worshipping the Gracious One sat down on one side Some exchanged greetings with the Gracious One and after exchanging polite and courteous greetings sat down on one side Some after raising their hands in respectful salutation to the Gracious One sat down on one side Some after announcing their name and family sat down on one side Some while keeping silent sat down on one sideThen while sitting on one side the Great King Vessavaṇa said this to the Gracious One There are reverend Sir some high ranking yakkhas who are not pleased with the Gracious Onethere are reverend Sir some high ranking yakkhas who are pleased with the Gracious Onethere are reverend Sir some middle ranking yakkhas who are not pleased with the Gracious Onethere are reverend Sir some middle ranking yakkhas who are pleased with the Gracious Onethere are reverend Sir some low ranking yakkhas who are not pleased with the Gracious Onethere are reverend Sir some low ranking yakkhas who are pleased with the Gracious OneBut reverend Sir almost all of the yakkhas are not pleased with the Gracious OneWhat is the reason for thatBecause reverend Sir the Gracious One preaches the Dhamma of refraining from killing living creatures preaches the Dhamma of refraining from taking what has not been given preaches the Dhamma of refraining from sexual misconduct preaches the Dhamma of refraining from false speech preaches the Dhamma of refraining from liquor wines or intoxicants which cause heedlessnessBut reverend Sir almost all of the yakkhas do not refrain from killing living creatures do not refrain from taking what has not been given do not refrain from sexual misconduct do not refrain from false speech do not refrain from liquors wines or intoxicants which cause heedlessnessTo them that is neither dear nor appealingThere are reverend Sir disciples of the Gracious One in the wilderness who are practising in remote jungle dwelling places where there is little sound little noise which have a lonely atmosphere lying hidden away from men which are suitable for seclusionAnd there are high ranking yakkhas settled there who are not pleased with the word of the Gracious OneTo please them reverend Sir may the Gracious One learn this ṭānāṭiya protection for the monks nuns laymens and laywomens guard protection freedom from harm and comfortable livingThe Gracious One by keeping silent gave consentThen the Great King Vessavaṇa having understood the Gracious Ones consent on that occasion recited this ṭānāṭiya protectionMay you revere Vipassī the glorious Visionarymay you revere Sikhī

Kings rose from their seats and after worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One vanished right thereThen some yakkhas rose from their seats and after worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One vanished right thereSome exchanged greetings with the Gracious One and after exchanging polite and courteous greetings vanished right thereSome after raising their hands in respectful salutation to the Gracious One vanished right thereSome after announcing their name and family vanished right thereAnd some while keeping silent vanished right thereThe first recital is finishedThus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was living on the Vultures Peak near Rajagaha Then four great kings having placed a guard over the four quarters with a large army of Yakkhas of Gandhabbas of Kumbhandas of Nagas having placed troops having placed a barricade of soldiers on four sides came to the presence of the Blessed One when the night was far advanced illuminating the entire Vultures Peak with their surpassing radiance saluted the Blessed One and sat on one sideFrom among the Yakkhas some saluted the Blessed One and sat on one side some exchanged greetings with the Blessed One conversing in a friendly and courteous manner and sat on one side some saluted him with clasped hands and sat on one side some announced their name and lineage and sat on one side some sat on one side in silenceThen the great King Vessavana  who was seated on one side said to the Blessed One Venerable Sir  there are eminent Yakkhas who are not pleased with the Blessed Onethere are also eminent Yakkhas pleased with the Blessed OneThere are Yakkhas of middle rank who are not pleased with the Blessed Oneand there are those who are pleased with the Blessed OneThere are Yakkhas of inferior rank who are not pleased with the Blessed Oneand there are those who are pleased with the Blessed OneThe Yakkhas bhante as a rule are not pleased with the Blessed OneWhat is the reason for thisWell the Blessed One teaches the Dhamma to establish abstention from killing from stealing from sexual misconduct from false speech and from liquor that causes intoxication and negligence   To them such teaching is unpleasant and unpalatableSurely bhante there are disciples of the Blessed One They frequent the remote recesses of forest and woodland wilderness where there is no sound no tumult where breezes are void of human contact and suitable for mans seclusion and quiet contemplationThere are eminent Yakkhas who haunt these forests who have no faith in the word of the Blessed OneBhante may the Blessed One learn the Atanata protection so that the displeased Yakkhas may be pleased so that the monks and nuns laymen and laywomen may be at ease guarded protected and unharmedThe Blessed One gave consent by his silenceThen the great King Vessavana knowing that the Blessed One had consented recited the Atanatiya protectionHomage to Vipassi possessed of the eye and splendorHomage to Sikhi

monks nuns laymens and laywomens guard protection freedom from harm and comfortable livingThe Gracious One said thisand those monks were uplifted and greatly rejoiced in what was said by the Gracious OneThe ṭānāṭiyasutta is finishedThen the Gracious One when that night had passed addressed the monks saying This night monks the Four Great Kings with a great army of yakkhas with a great army of gandhabbas with a great army of kumbhaṇḍas with a great army of nāgas having set up a protection over the four quarters having set serried troops at the four directions having set up a barricade at the four directions at the end of the night having lit up the whole of Vultures Peak with their surpassing beauty approached me and after approaching and worshipping me they sat down on one sideThen

hands in respectful salutation to me sat down on one sideSome after announcing their name and family sat down on one sideSome while keeping silent sat down on one sideThen while sitting on one side monks the Great King Vessavaṇa said this to meThere are reverend Sir some high ranking yakkhas who are not pleased with the Gracious OneWhat is the reason for thatBecause reverend Sir the Gracious One preaches the Dhamma of refraining from killing living creatures preaches the Dhamma of refraining from taking what has not been given preaches the Dhamma of refraining from sexual misconduct preaches the Dhamma of refraining from false speech preaches the Dhamma of refraining from liquor wines or intoxicants which cause heedlessnessBut reverend Sir almost all of the yakkhas do not refrain from killing living creatures do not refrain from taking what has not been given do not refrain from sexual misconduct do not refrain from false speech do not refrain from liquors wines or intoxicants which cause heedlessnessTo them that is neither dear nor appealingThere are reverend Sir disciples of the Gracious One in the wilderness who are practising in remote jungle dwelling places where there is little sound little noise which have a lonely atmosphere lying hidden away from men which are suitable for seclusionnd there are high ranking yakkhas settled there who are not pleased with the word of the Gracious One To please then reverend Sir may the Gracious One learn this ṭānāṭiya protection for the monks nuns laymens and laywomens guard protection freedom from harm and comfortable livingAnd I monks by keeping silent gave consentThen the Great King Vessavaṇa monks having understood my consent on that occasion recited this ṭānāṭiya protectionThus have I heard  Once the Lord was

HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Kuru country at a town of the Kurus named KammasadhammaThere he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus Venerable sir they repliedThe Blessed One said thisThere is monks this one way to the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow and distress for the disappearance of pain and sadness for the gaining of the right path for the realisation of Nibbana  that is to say the four foundations of mindfulnessWhat are the fourHere monks a monk abides contemplating body as body ardent clearly aware and mindful having put aside hankering and fretting for the world he abides contemplating feelings as feelings  he abides contemplating mind as mind  he abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects ardent clearly aware and mindful having put aside hankering and fretting for the worldThis is the direct path for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow  lamentation for the disappearance of pain  distress for the attainment of the right method  for the realization of unbindingin other words the four establishings of mindfulnessWhich fourThere is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itselfardent alert  mindfulsubduing greed  distress with reference to the world He remains focused on feelings mind mental qualities in  of themselvesardent alert  mindfulsubduing greed  distress with reference to the worldBhikkhus this is the direct path  for the purification of beings  for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation for the disappearance of pain and grief for the attainment of the true way for the realisation of Nibbana  namely the four foundations of mindfulness What are the fourHere bhikkhus a bhikkhu  abides contemplating the body as a body ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world  He abides contemplating feelings as feelings ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world He abides contemplating mind as mind ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world He abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the worldAnd how monks does a monk abide contemplating the body as bodyHere a monk having gone into the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty place sits down cross legged holding his body erect having established mindfulness before himMindfully he breathes in mindfully he breathes outBreathing in a long breath he knows that he breathes in a long breath and breathing out a long breath he knows that he breathes out a long breathBreathing in a short breath he knows that he breathes in a short breath and breathing out a short breath he knows that he breathes out a short breathHe trains himself thinking I will breathe in conscious of the whole body  He trains himself thinking I will breathe out conscious of the whole body He trains himself thinking I will breathe in calming the whole bodily process  He trains himself thinking I will breathe out calming the whole bodily process Just as a skilled turner or his assistant in making a long turn knows that he is making a long turn or in making a short turn knows that he is making a short turn so too a monk in breathing in a long breath knows that he breathes in a long breathand so trains himself thinking I will breathe out calming the whole bodily process So he abides contemplating body as body internally contemplating body as body externally contemplating body as body both internally and externallyHe abides contemplating arising phenomena in the body he abides contemplating vanishing phenomena in the body he abides contemplating both arising and vanishing phenomena in the bodyOr else mindfulness that there is body is present to him just to the extent necessary for knowledge and awareness And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the worldAnd that monks is how a monk abides contemplating body as bodyAnd how does a monk remain focused on the body in  of itselfThere is the case where a monkhaving gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty buildingsits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and establishing mindfulness to the foreAlways mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes outBreathing in long he discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long Or breathing in short he discerns I am breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns I am breathing out short He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body he trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication he trains himself I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication Just as a dexterous turner or his apprentice when making a long turn discerns I am making a long turn or when making a short turn discerns I am making a short turn in the same way the monk when breathing in long discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long  He trains himself I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication he trains himself I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication In this way he remains focused internally on the body in  of itself or externally on the body in  of itself

the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to the bodyOr his mindfulness that There is a body is maintained to the extent of knowledge  remembrance And he remains independent unsustained by not clinging to anything in the worldThis is how a monk remains focused on the body in  of itselfAnd how bhikkhus does a bhikkhu abide contemplating the body as a bodyHere a bhikkhu gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut sits down having folded his legs crosswise set his body erect and established mindfulness in front of himever mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes outBreathing in long he understands I breathe in long or breathing out long he understands I breathe out longBreathing in short he understands I breathe in short or breathing out short he understands I breathe out shortHe trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body of breath he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body of breathHe trains thus I shall breathe in tranquillizing the bodily formation he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquillizing the bodily formationJust as a skilled turner or his apprentice when making a long turn understands I make a long turn or when making a short turn understands I make a short turn so too breathing in long a bhikkhu understands I breathe in longhe trains thus I shall breathe out tranquillizing the bodily formationIn this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally or he abides contemplating the body as a body externally or he abides contemplating the body as a body both internally and externallyOr else he abides contemplating in the body its arising factors or he abides contemplating in the body its vanishing factors or he abides contemplating in the body both its arising and

mindfulness he enters the third jhanaAnd having given up pleasure and pain and with the disappearance of former gladness and sadness he enters and remains in the fourth jhana which is beyond pleasure and pain and purified by equanimity and mindfulnessThis is called Right ConcentrationAnd that monks is called the way of practice leading to the cessation of suffering  So he abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects internally contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects externally contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects both internally and externallyHe abides contemplating arising phenomena in mindobjects he abides contemplating vani shingphenomena in mindobjects he abides contemplating both arising and vanishing phenomena in mindobjectsOr else mindfulness that there are mindobjects is present just to the extent necessary for knowledge and awareness And he abides detached not grasping at anything in the worldAnd that monks is how a monk abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects in respect of the Four Noble TruthsWhoever monks should practise these four foundations of mindfulness for just seven years may expect one of two results either Arahantship in this life or if there should be some substrate left the state of a NonReturnerLet alone seven years whoever should practise them for just six years   five years   four years   three years   two years   one year ihay expect one of two results   let alone one yearwhoever should practise them for just seven months six months   five months   four months   three months   two months   one month   half a month may expect one of two results  let alone half a month whoever should practise these four foundations of mindfulness for just one week may expect one of two results either Arahantship in this life or if there should be some substrate left the state of a NonReturnerIt was said There is monks this one way to the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow and distress for the disappearance of pain and sadness for the gaining of the right path for the realisation of Nibbana  that is to say the four foundations of mindfulnessand it is for this reason that it was saidThus the Lord spokeand the monks rejoiced and were delighted at his wordsd And what is the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stressJust this very noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationAnd what is right viewKnowledge with reference to stress knowledge with reference to the origination of stress knowledge with reference to the cessation of stress knowledge with reference to the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is called right viewAnd what is right resolveResolve for renunciation resolve for freedom from ill will resolve for harmlessness This is called right resolveAnd what is right speechAbstaining from lying from divisive speech from abusive speech  from idle chatter This is called right speechAnd what is right actionAbstaining from taking life from stealing  from sexual misconduct This is called right actionAnd what is right livelihoodThere is the case where a disciple of the noble ones having abandoned dishonest livelihood keeps his life going with right livelihood This is called right livelihoodAnd what is right effortThere is the case where a monk generates desire endeavors arouses persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the nonarising of evil unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the sake of the abandoning of evil unskillful qualities that have arisen for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the maintenance nonconfusion increase plenitude development  culmination of skillful qualities that have arisenThis is called right effortAnd what is right mindfulnessThere is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itselfardent alert  mindfulsubduing greed  distress with reference to the world He remains focused on feelings in  of themselves the mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselvesardent alert  mindfulsubduing greed  distress with reference to the worldThis is called right mindfulnessAnd what is right concentrationThere is the case where a monkquite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualitiesenters  remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationWith the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhāna rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluationinternal assuranceWith the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body He enters  remains in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding With the abandoning of pleasure  painas with the earlier disappearance of elation  distresshe enters  remains in the fourth jhāna purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor painThis is called right concentrationThis is called the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stressIn this way he remains focused internally on mental qualities in  of themselves or externally on mental qualities in  of themselves or both internally  externally on mental qualities in  of themselvesOr he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to mental qualities on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to mental qualities or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to mental qualitiesOr his mindfulness that There are mental qualities is maintained to the extent of knowledge  remembrance And he remains independent unsustained by not clinging to anything in the worldThis is how a monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the four noble truthsE Conclusion Now if anyone would develop these four establishings of mindfulness in this way for seven years one of two fruits can be expected for him either gnosis right here  now orif there be any remnant of clingingsustenancenonreturnLet alone seven yearsIf anyone would develop these four establishings of mindfulness in this way for six years five four three two years one

distress for the attainment of the right method  for the realization of unbindingin other words the four establishings of mindfulness Thus was it said and in reference to this was it said That is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsIn this way he abides contemplating mindobjects as mind objects internally or he abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects externally or he abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects both internally and externallyOr else he abides contemplating in mindobjects their arising factors or he abides contemplating in mindobjects their vanishing factors or he abides contemplating in mindobjects both their arising and vanishing factorsOr else mindfulness that there are mindobjects is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and mindfulness And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the worldThat is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects in terms of the Four Noble TruthsBhikkhus if anyone should develop these four foundations of mindfulness in such a way for seven years one of two fruits could be expected for him either

true way for the realisation of Nibbana  namely the four foundations of mindfulness So it was with reference to this that it was saidThat is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsAt SavatthiThen King Pasenadi Kosala approached the Blessed One in the middle of the day and on arrival having bowed down sat to one side As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Well now great king where are you coming from in the middle of the day Just now lord I was engaged in the sort of royal affairs typical of headanointed noblewarrior kings intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures who have attained stable control in their country and who rule having conquered a great sphere of territory on earthWhat do you think great king Suppose a man trustworthy and reliable were to come to you from the eastand on arrival would say If it please your majesty you should know that I come from the eastThere I saw a great mountain as high as the clouds coming this way crushing all living beings in its pathDo whatever you think should be doneThen a second man were to come to you from the west Then a third man were to come to you from the north Then a fourth man were to come to you from the southand on arrival would say If it please your majesty you should know that I come from the southThere I saw a great mountain as high as the clouds coming this way crushing all living beingsDo whatever you think should be doneIf great king such a great peril should arise such a terrible destruction of human life  the human state being so hard to obtain  what should be doneIf lord such a great peril should arise such a terrible destruction of human life  the human state being so hard to obtain  what else should be done but Dhammaconduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deeds I inform you great king I announce to you great king aging and death are rolling in on youWhen aging and death are rolling in on you great king what should be done As aging and death are rolling in on me lord what else should be done but Dhammaconduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deedsThere are lord elephant battles fought by headanointed noblewarrior kings intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures who have attained stable control in their country and who rule having conquered a great sphere of territory on earth but there is no use for those elephant battles no scope for them when aging and death are rolling inThere are cavalry battles chariot battles infantry battles but there is no use for those infantry battles no scope for them when aging and death are rolling inIn this royal court there are counselors who when the enemies arrive are capable of dividing them by their witsbut there is no use for those battles of wits no scope for them when aging and death are rolling inIn this royal court there is abundant bullion and gold stored in vaults and depositories and with such wealth we are capable of buying off enemies when they comebut there is no use for those battles of wealth no scope for them when aging

aging and death are rolling in on you what else should be done but Dhammaconduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deeds That is what the Blessed One said Having said that the One WellGone the Teacher further said thisLike massive boulders mountains pressing against the skymoving in from all sides crushing the four directionsso aging and death come rolling over living beingsnoble warriors brahmans merchants workers outcastes  scavengersThey spare nothing They trample everythingHere elephant troops can hold no ground nor can chariots or infantrynor can a battle of wits or wealth win outSo a wise person seeing his own goodsteadfast secures confidence in the Buddha Dhamma  SanghaOne who practices the Dhamma in thought word  deedreceives praise here on earth and after death rejoices in heavenOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThere he addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks responded to himThe Blessed One saidMonks once the devas  asuras were arrayed for battleThen Sakka the chief of the devas addressed the devas of the ThirtythreeIf dear sirs when the devas have gone into battle there should arise fear terror or horripilation then on that occasion you should catch sight of the top of my standardFor when you have caught sight of the top of my standard whatever fear terror or horripilation there is will be abandonedIf you cant catch sight of the top of my standard then you should catch sight of the top of the devaking Pajapatis standardFor when you have caught sight of the top of the devaking Pajapatis standard whatever fear terror or horripilation there is will be abandonedIf you cant catch sight of the top of the devaking Pajapatis standard then you should catch sight of the top of the devaking

of the devaking Varunas standard then you should catch sight of the top of the devaking Isanas standardFor when you have caught sight of the top of the devaking Isanas standard whatever fear terror or horripilation there is will be abandoned But monks when the top of the devachief Sakkas standard is caught sight of or when the top of the devaking Pajapatis standard is caught sight of or when the top of the devaking Varunas standard is caught sight of or when the top of the devaking Isanas standard is caught sight of whatever fear terror or horripilation there is may be abandoned or may not be abandonedWhy is thatBecause Sakka the chief of the devas is not devoid of passion not devoid of aversion not devoid of delusion He feels fear feels terror feels dread He runs awayBut I tell you this If  when you have gone into the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building  there should arise fear terror or horripilation then on that occasion you should recollect me Indeed the

Sangha whatever fear terror or horripilation where is will be abandonedWhy is thatBecause the Tathagata  worthy  rightly selfawakened  is devoid of passion devoid of aversion devoid of delusion He

by way of reply to the Blessed OneThereupon he spoke as followsMonks I shall relate a former incident There arose a battle between the Devas and AsurasThen Sakka the Lord of the devas addressed the

Head together with a thousand bhikkhusThere the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus all is burningAnd what bhikkhus is the all that is burningThe eye is burning forms are buming eyeconsciousness is burning eyecontact is burningand whatever feeling arises with eyecontact as conditionwhether pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasantthat too is burningBurning with whatBurning with the fire of lust with the fire of hatred with the fire of delusion burning with birth aging and death with sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair I sayBurning with whatBurning with the fire of lust with the fire of hatred with the fire of delusion buming with birth aging and death with sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair I saySeeing thus bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards the eye towards forms towards eyeconsciousness towards eyecontact towards whatever feeling arises with eyecontact as conditionwhether pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasantExperiencing revulsion he becomes dispassionate Through dispassion his mind is  liberated When it is liberated there comes the knowledge Its liberatedHe understands Destroyed is birth the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more for this state of being This is what the Blessed One saidElated those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed Ones statementAnd while this discourse was being spoken the minds of the thousand bhikkhus were liberated from the taints by nonclingingI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Gaya at Gaya Head with  monksThere he addressed the monks Monks the All is aflameWhat All is aflameThe eye is aflame Forms are aflame Consciousness at the eye is aflame Contact at the eye is aflameAnd whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye  experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain  that too is aflameAflame with whatAflame with the fire of passion the fire of aversion the fire of delusion Aflame I tell you with birth aging  death with sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairsAflame with whatAflame with the fire of passion the fire of aversion the fire of delusion Aflame I say with birth aging  death with sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairsSeeing thus the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with the eye disenchanted with forms disenchanted with consciousness at the eye disenchanted with contact at the eye And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain With that too he grows disenchantedDisenchanted he becomes dispassionate Through dispassion he is fully released With full release there is the knowledge Fully releasedHe discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for this world That is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted at his wordsAnd while this explanation was being given the hearts of the  monks through no clinging  were fully released from fermentationeffluentsThe mind is burning  and whatever feeling arises with mindcontact as condition whether pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant that too is burningThe intellect is aflame Ideas are aflame Consciousness at the intellect is aflame Contact at the intellect is aflameAnd whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the intellect  experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain  that too is aflameAt SavatthiBhikkhus I will

and displeasure in regard to the world This is called right mindfulnessAnd what bhikkhus is right concentrationHere bhikkhus secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhana which is accompanied by thought and examination with rapture and happiness born of seclusionWith the subsiding of thought and examination he enters and dwells in the second jhana which has internal confidence and unification of mind is without thought and examination and has rapture and happiness born of concentrationWith the fading away as well of rapture he dwells equanimous and mindful and clearly comprehending he experiences happiness with the body he enters and dwells in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare He is equanimous mindful one who dwells happilyWith the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous passing away of joy and displeasure he enters and dwells in the fourth jhana which is neither painful nor pleasant and includes the purification of mindfulness by equanimity This is called right concentrationOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrel SanctuaryNow on that occasion the Venerable Mahakassapa was dwelling in the Pipphali Cave sick afflicted gravely illThen in the evening the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and approached the Venerable Mahakassapa He sat down in the appointed seatand said to the Venerable MahakassapaI hope you are bearing up Kassapa I hope you are getting betterI hope that your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing and that their subsiding not their increase is to be discernedVenerable sir I am not bearing up I am not getting betterStrong painful feelings are increasing in me not subsiding and their increase not their subsiding is to be discernedThese seven factors of enlightenment Kassapa have been rightly expounded by me when developed and cultivated they lead to direct knowledge to enlightenment to

alms in SavatthiLet us go to the park of the wanderers of other sectsThen those bhikkhus went to the park of the wanderers of other sectsThey exchanged greetings with those wanderers and when they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk sat down to one sideThe wanderers then said to themFriends the ascetic Gotama teaches the Dhamma to his disciples thus Come bhikkhus abandon the five hindrances the corruptions of the mind that weaken wisdom and develop correctly the seven factors of enlightenmentWe too teach the Dhamma to our disciples thus Come friends abandon the five hindrances the corruptions of the mind that weaken wisdom and develop correctly the seven factors of enlightenmentSo friends what here is the distinction the disparity the difference between the ascetic Gotama and us that is regarding the one Dhamma teaching and the other regarding the one manner of instruction and the other Then those bhikkhus neither delighted in nor rejected the statement of those wanderers Without delighting in it without rejecting it they rose from their seats and left thinking We shall learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of the Blessed OneThen when those bhikkhus had walked for alms in Savatthi and had returned from the alms round after their meal they approached the Blessed One Having paid homage to him they sat down to one sideand reported to him the entire discussion between those wanderers and themselvesThe Blessed One said Bhikkhus when wanderers of other sects speak thus they should be asked Friends is there a method of exposition by means of which the five hindrances become ten and the seven factors of enlightenment become fourteenBeing asked thus those wanderers would not be able to reply and further they would meet with vexationFor what reasonBecause that would not be within their domainI do not see anyone bhikkhus in this world with its devas Mara and Brahma in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins its devas and humans who could satisfy the mind with an answer to these questions except the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata or one who has heard it from themAnd what bhikkhus is the method of exposition by means of which the five hindrances become tenWhatever sensual desire there is for the internal is a hindrance whatever sensual desire there is for the external is also a hindranceThus what is spoken of concisely as the hindrance of sensual desirebecomes by this method of exposition twofoldWhatever ill will there is towards the internal is a hindrance whatever ill will there is towards the external

of things external is also the enlightenment factor of mindfulnessThus what is spoken of concisely as the enlightenment factor of mindfulnessbecomes by this method of exposition twofoldWhenever one discriminates things internally with wisdom examines them makes an investigation of them that is the enlightenment factor of discrimination of states whenever one discriminates things externally with

exposition twofoldThis bhikkhus is the method of exposition by means of which the seven factors of enlightenment become fourteenThus have I heard At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at IsipatanaThere the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus of the group of five thus Bhikkhus these two extremes should not be followed by one gone forth  What twoThat which is this pursuit of sensual happiness in sense pleasures which is low vulgar the way of the ordinary person ignoble not connected to the goal and that which is this pursuit of selfmortification which is painful ignoble not connected to the goalBhikkhus without veering towards either of these two extremes the One Attuned to Reality has awakened to the middle way which gives rise to vision which gives rise to knowledge which leads to peace to higher knowledge to full awakening to NibbānaAnd what bhikkhus is that middle way awakened to by the One Attuned to Reality which gives rise to vision which gives rise to knowledge which leads to peace to higher knowledge to full awakening to NibbānaIt is just this Noble Eightfactored Path that is to say right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right mental unificationThis bhikkhus is that middle way awakened to by the One Attuned to Reality which gives rise to vision which gives rise to knowledge which leads to peace to higher knowledge to full awakening to NibbānaNow this bhikkhus for the spiritually ennobled ones is the true reality which is pain birth is painful aging is painful illness is painful death is painful sorrow lamentation physical pain unhappiness and distress are painful union with what is disliked is painful separation from what is liked is painful not to get what one wants is painful in brief the five bundles of graspingfuel are painfulNow this bhikkhus for the spiritually ennobled ones is the painoriginating true reality It is this craving which leads to renewed existence accompanied by delight and attachment seeking delight now here now there that is craving for sensepleasures craving for existence craving for extermination Now this bhikkhus for the spiritually ennobled ones is the painceasing true reality It is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving the giving up and relinquishing of it freedom from it nonreliance on itNow this bhikkhus for the spiritually ennobled ones is the true reality which is the way leading to the cessation of pain It is this Noble Eightfactored Path that is to say right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right mental unificationThis for the spiritually ennobled ones is the true reality of pain in me bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before there arose vision knowledge wisdom true knowledge and lightNow on this This  for the spiritually ennobled ones the true reality of pain  is to be fully understood in me bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before there arose vision knowledge wisdom true knowledge and lightNow on this This  for the spiritually ennobled ones the true reality of pain  has been fully understood in me bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before there arose vision knowledge wisdom true knowledge and light in me bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before there arose vision knowledge wisdom true knowledge and light with respect to This for the spiritually ennobled ones is the painoriginating true realityThis  for the spiritually ennobled ones the painoriginating true reality  is to be abandonedand This  for the spiritually ennobled ones the painoriginating true reality  has been abandoned in me bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before there arose vision knowledge wisdom true knowledge and light with respect to This for the spiritually ennobled ones is the painceasing true realityThis  for the spiritually ennobled ones the painceasing true reality  is to be personally experienced andThis  for the spiritually ennobled ones the painceasing true reality  has been personally experienced in me bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before there arose vision knowledge wisdom true knowledge and light with respect to This for the spiritually ennobled ones is the true reality which is the way leading to the cessation of painThis  for the spiritually ennobled ones the true reality which is the way leading to the cessation of pain  is to be developed andThis  for the spiritually ennobled ones the true reality which is way leading to the cessation of pain  has been developedSo long bhikkhus as my knowledge and seeing of these four true realities for the spiritually ennobled ones as they really are in their three phases and twelve modes was not thoroughly purified in this way then so long in the world with its devas māras and brahmās in this population with its renunciants and brahmans its devas and humans I did not claim to be fully awakened to the unsurpassed perfect awakeningBut when bhikkhus my knowledge and vision of these four true realities for the spiritually ennobled ones as they really are in their three phases and twelve modes was thoroughly purified in this way then in the world with its devas māras and brahmās in this population with its renunciants and brahmans its devas and humans I claimed to be fully awakened to the unsurpassed perfect awakeningIndeed knowledge and seeing arose in me Unshakeable is the liberation of my mind this is my last birth now there is no more renewed existence This is what the Blessed One saidElated the bhikkhus of the group of five delighted in the Blessed Ones statementAnd while this explanation was being spoken there arose in the venerable Koṇḍañña the dustfree stainless vision of the Basic Pattern whatever is patterned with an origination all that is patterned with a cessationAnd when the Wheel of the Basic Pattern had been set in motion by the Blessed One the earthdwelling devas raised a cry At Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana the unsurpassed Wheel of the Basic Pattern has been set in motion by the Blessed One which cannot be stopped by any renunciant or brahman or māra or brahmā or by anyone in the world Having heard the cry of the earthdwelling devas the devas of the Four Great Kings raised the same cryHaving heard it the Thirtythree devas took it up then the Yāma devas then the Contented devas then the devas Who Delight in Creating then the devas With Mastery in the Creations of Others and then the devas of the brahmā groupThus at that moment at that instant at that second the cry spread as far as the brahmā worldand this ten thousandfold world system shook quaked and trembled and an immeasurable glorious radiance appeared in the world surpassing the divine majesty of the devasThen the Blessed One uttered this inspiring utterance the honorable Koṇḍañña has indeed understood The honorable Koṇḍañña has indeed understoodIn this way the venerable Koṇḍañña acquired the name Koṇḍañña Who Has UnderstoodAt KapilavatthuNow on that occasion Sarakani the Sakyan had diedand the Blessed One had declared him to be a streamenterer no longer bound to the nether world fixed in destiny with enlightenment as his destinationThereupon a number of Sakyans having met and assembled deplored this grumbled and complained about it saying It is wonderful indeed sir It is amazing indeed sirNow who here wont be a streamentererthe Blessed One has declared to be a streamenterer  with enlightenment as his destinationSarakani the Sakyan was one who had failed to fulfil the training Then Mahanama the Sakyan approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to one sideand reported this matter to himThe Blessed One said Mahanama when over a long time a lay follower has gone for refuge to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha how could he go to the nether worldFor if one speaking rightly were to say of anyone He was a lay follower who had gone for refuge over a long time to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha it is of Sarakani the Sakyan that one could rightly say thisMahanama over a long time Sarakani the Sakyan had gone for refuge to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha SO how could he go to the nether worldHere Mahanama some person is completely dedicated to the Buddha and has full confidence in him thus The Blessed one is   teacher of devas and humans the Enlightened the Blessed OneAnd so in regard to the Dhamma and the Sangha He is one of joyous wisdom of swift wisdom and he attained liberationBy the destruction of the taints in very life he enters and dwells in the taintless liberation of mind liberation by wisdom realizing it for himself with direct howledgeThis person Mahanama is freed from hell the animal realm and the domain of ghosts freed from the plane of misery the bad destinations the nether worldHere Mahansma some person is completely dedicated to the Buddha and has full confidence in him And so in regard to the Dhamma and the Sangha He is one of joyous wisdom of swift wisdom yet he has not attained liberationWith the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he has become one who attains final knowledge early in this very life or one who attains final knowledge at the time of death or an attainer of Nibbana in the interval or an attainer of Nibbana upon landing or an attain er of Nibbana without exertion or an attainer of Nibbana with exertion or one bound upstream heading towards the Akanittha realmThis person too Mahanama is freed from hell the animal realm and the domain of ghosts freed from the plane of misery the bad destinations the nether worldHere Mahanama some person is completely dedicated to the Buddha and has full confidence in him And so in regard to the Dhamma and the Sangha He is not one of joyous wisdom nor of swift wisdom and he has not attained liberationWith the utter destruction of three fetters and with the diminishing of greed hatred and delusion he is a oncereturner who after coming back to this world only one more time will make an end to sufferingThis person too Mahanama is freed from hell the animal realm and the domain of ghosts freed from the plane of misery the bad destinations the nether worldHere Mahanama some person is completely dedicated to the Buddha and has full confidence in him   And so in regard to the Dhamma and the Sangha He is not one of joyous wisdom nor of swift wisdom and he has not attained liberationWith the utter destruction of three fetters he is a streamenterer no longer bound to the nether world fixed in destiny with enlightenment as his destinationThis person too Mahanama is freed from hell the animal realm and the domain of ghosts freed from the plane of misery the bad destinations the nether worldHere Mahanama some person is not completely dedicated to the Buddha and does not have full confidence in him thus The Blessed One is    teacher of devas and humans the Enlightened One the Blessed One And so in regard to the Dhamma and the Sangha He is not one of joyous wisdom nor of swift wisdom and he has not attained liberation However he has these five things the faculty of faith  the faculty of wisdomAnd the after teachings proclaimed by the Tathagata are accepted by being pondered to a sufficient degree with wisdomThis person too Mahanama is one who does not go to hell the animal realm or the domain of ghosts to the plane of misery the bad destinations the nether worldHere Mahanama some person is not completely dedicated to the Buddha and does not have full confidence in him  And so in regard to the Dhamma and the Sangha He is not one of joyous wisdom nor of swift wisdom and he has not attained liberation However he has these five things the faculty of faith   the faculty of wisdomAnd he has sufficient faith in the Tathagata sufficient devotion to himThis person too Mahanama is one who does not go to hell the animal realm or the domain of ghosts to the plane of misery the bad destinations the nether worldSuppose Mahanama there is a bad field a bad piece of ground with stumps not cleared and the seeds sown there would be broken spoilt damaged by wind and sun unfertile not planted securely and the sky would not send down a proper rainfallWould those seeds come to growth increase and expansion No venerable sirSo too Mahanama here a Dhamma is badly expounded badly proclaimed unemancipating not conducive to peace by one who is not perfectly enlightened This I say is like the bad fieldAnd the disciple dwells in that Dhamma practising in accordance with it practising it properly conducting himself accordingly This I say is like the bad seedSuppose Mahandma there is a good field a good piece of ground well cleared of stumps and the seeds sown there would be unbroken unspoilt undamaged by wind and sun fertile planted securely and the sky would send down a proper rainfallWould those seeds come to growth increase and expansionYes venerable sirSo too Mahansma here a Dhamma is well expounded well proclaimed emancipating conducive to peace proclaimed by one who is perfectly enlightened This I say is like the good fieldAnd the disciple dwells in that Dhamma practising in accordance with it practising it properly conducting himself accordingly This I say is like the good seedHow much more then Sarakani the SakyanMahanama Sarakani the Sakyan was one who fulfilled the training at the time of deathSarakani the Sakyan after he diedRuler of the Gods I declare that there are two kinds of I happiness the kind to be pursued and the kind to be I avoidedThe same applies to unhappinessand equanimityWhy have I declared this in regard to happinessThis is how I understood happiness When I observed that in the pursuit of such happiness unwholesome factors increased and wholesome factors decreased then that happines was to be avoidedAnd whe I abserved that in the pursuit of such happiness unwholesome factors decreased and wholesome ones increased then that happines was to be sought afterNow of such happiness as is accompanied by thinking and pondering and of that which is not so accompanied the latter is the more excellentThe same applies to unhappinessAnd this Ruler of the Gods is the practice that monk has undertaken who has reached the right way leading to the cessation of the tendency to proliferationAnd Sakka expressed his delight at the Lords answerand to equanimityAnd that man might say Sir there is something called the Gandhara charmIt is by means of this that that monk becomes manyWhat do you think Kevaddha would not a sceptic say that to a believerHe would LordAnd that man might say Sir there is something called the Manika charm It is by means of this that that monk can read the minds of others And that is why seeing the danger of such miracles I despise themAnd I Kevaddha have experienced these three miracles by my own superknowledgebut they replied We dont knowbut the ThirtyThree Godsmay knowwho said We dont knowbut Sakka lord of the godsmay knowVasavatti saidThe devas of Brahmas retinuemay knowThus have I heard At SavatthiThere the Blessed One said this Bhikkhus form is impermanent feeling is impermanent perception is impermanent volitional formations are impermanent consciousness is impermanentSeeing thus bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards form revulsion towards feeling revulsion towards perception revulsion towards volitional formations revulsion towards consciousnessExperiencing revulsion he becomes dispassionate Through dispassion his mind is liberatedWhen it is liberated there comes the knowledge Its liberatedHe understands Destroyed is birth the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more for this state of being  asked you where the four great elements cease without remainderI asked where the four great elements  earth water fire air  cease without remainderand the householder Kevaddha delighted rejoiced at his wordsthis is called the path leading to the unconditionedI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Pava in Cunda the silversmiths mango groveThen Cunda the silversmith went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Cunda of whose rites of purification do you approve The brahmans of the Western lands lord  those who carry water pots wear garlands of water plants worship fire  purify with water they have declared purification rites of which I approve And what kind of purification rites have they declared those brahmans of the Western lands who carry water pots wear garlands of water plants worship fire  purify with water There is the case where the brahmans of the Western lands get their disciples to undertake their practice thus Come now my good man Get up at the proper time from your bed and touch the earth If you dont touch the earth touch wet cow dung If you dont touch wet cow dung touch green grass If you dont touch green grass worship a fire If you dont worship a fire pay homage to the sun with clasped hands If you dont pay homage to the sun with clasped hands go down into the water three times by nightfallThese are the purification rites declared by the brahmans of the Western lands  of which I approve Cunda the purification rites declared by the brahmans of the Western lands  are one thing the purification in the discipline of the noble ones is something else entirely But how is there purification in the discipline of the noble ones lordIt would be good if the Blessed One would teach me how there is purification in the discipline of the noble ones Then in that case Cunda listen  pay close attention I will speak As you say lord Cunda the silversmith respondedThe Blessed One saidThere are three ways in which one is made impure by bodily action four ways in which one is made impure by verbal action and three ways in which one is made impure by mental actionAnd how is one made impure in three ways by bodily actionThere is the case where a certain person takes life is a hunter bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beingsHe takes what is not givenHe takes in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by themHe engages in sensual misconductHe gets sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their Dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another manThis is how one is made impure in three ways by bodily actionAnd how is one made impure in four ways by verbal actionThere is the case where a certain person engages in false speechWhen he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty ie a royal court proceeding if he is asked as a witness Come  tell good man what you know If he doesnt know he says I know  If he does know he says I dont know  If he hasnt seen he says I have seen  If he has seen he says I havent seenThus he consciously tells lies for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of a certain rewardHe engages in divisive speechWhat he has heard here he tells there to break those people apart from these people here What he has heard there he tells here to break these people apart from those people thereThus breaking apart those who are united and stirring up strife between those who have broken apart he loves factionalism delights in factionalism enjoys factionalism speaks things that create factionalismHe engages in abusive speechHe speaks words that are harsh cutting bitter to others abusive of others provoking anger and destroying concentrationHe engages in idle chatter He speaks out of season speaks what isnt factual what isnt in accordance with the goal the Dhamma  the Vinaya words that are not worth treasuringThis is how one is made impure in four ways by verbal actionAnd how is one made impure in three ways by mental actionThere is the case where a certain person is covetousHe covets the belongings of others thinking O that what belongs to others would be mineHe bears ill will corrupt in the resolves of his heart May these beings be killed or cut apart or crushed or destroyed or may they not exist at allHe has wrong view is warped in the way he sees things There is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions There is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no brahmans or contemplatives who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselvesThis is how one is made impure in three ways by mental actionThese Cunda are the ten courses of unskillful actionWhen a person is endowed with these ten courses of unskillful action then even if he gets up at the proper time from his bed and touches the earth he is still impure If he doesnt touch the earth he is still impureIf he touches wet cow dung he is still impure If he doesnt touch wet cow dung he is still impureIf he touches green grass  If he doesnt touch green grass If he worships a fire  If he doesnt worship a fire If he pays homage to the sun with clasped hands  If he doesnt pay homage to the sun with clasped hands If he goes down into the water three times by nightfall  If he doesnt go down into the water three times by nightfall he is still impureWhy is thatBecause these ten courses of unskillful action are impure and cause impurityFurthermore as a result of being endowed with these ten courses of unskillful action rebirth in hell is declared rebirth in an animal womb is declared rebirth in the realm of hungry shades is declared  that or any other bad destinationNow Cunda there are three ways in which one is made pure by bodily action four ways in which one is made pure by verbal action and three ways in which one is made pure by mental actionAnd how is one made pure in three ways by bodily actionThere is the case where a certain person abandoning the taking of life abstains from the taking of life He dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beingsAbandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not givenHe does not take in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by themAbandoning sensual misconduct he abstains from sensual misconduct He does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their Dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another manThis is how one is made pure in three ways by bodily actionAnd how is one made pure in four ways by verbal actionThere is the case where a certain person abandoning false speech abstains from false speechWhen he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty if he is asked as a witness Come  tell good man what you know If he doesnt know he says I dont know  If he does know he says I know  If he hasnt seen he says I havent seen  If he has seen he says I have seenThus he doesnt consciously tell a lie for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of any rewardAbandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speech What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people here What he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people thereThus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concordAbandoning abusive speech he abstains from abusive speechHe speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing  pleasing to people at largeAbandoning idle chatter he abstains from idle chatter He speaks in season speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the Dhamma  the Vinaya He speaks words worth treasuring seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goalThis is how one is made pure in four ways by verbal actionAnd how is one made pure in three ways by mental actionThere is the case where a certain person is not covetousHe does not covet the belongings of others thinking O that what belongs to others would be mineHe bears no ill will and is not corrupt in the resolves of his heart He thinks May these beings be free from animosity free from oppression free from trouble and may they look after themselves with easeHe has right view and is not warped in the way he sees things There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificed There are fruits  results of good  bad actions There is this world  the next world There is mother  father There are spontaneously reborn beings there are brahmans  contemplatives who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselvesThis is how one is made pure in three ways by mental actionThese Cunda are the ten courses of skillful actionWhen a person is endowed with these ten courses of skillful action then even if he gets up at the proper time from his bed and touches the earth he is still pure If he doesnt touch the earth he is still pureIf he touches wet cow dung he is still pure If he doesnt touch wet cow dung he is still pureIf he touches green grass  If he doesnt touch green grass If he worships a fire  If he doesnt worship a fire If he pays homage to the sun with clasped hands  If he doesnt pay homage to the sun with clasped hands If he goes down into the water three times by nightfall  If he doesnt go down into the water three times by nightfall he is still pureWhy is thatBecause these ten courses of skillful action are pure and cause purityFurthermore as a result of being endowed with these ten courses of skillful action rebirth among the devas is declared rebirth among human beings is declared  that or any other good destination When this was said Cunda the silversmith said to the Blessed One Magnificent lord Magnificent Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the community of monks May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeBhikkhus there are these four strivingsWhat fourStriving by restraint striving by abandonment striving by development and striving by protectionAnd what bhikkhus is striving by restraintHere having seen a form with the eye a bhikkhu does not grasp its marks and featuresSince if he left the eye faculty unrestrained bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him he practices restraint over it he guards the eye faculty he undertakes the restraint of the eye facultyHaving heard a sound with the ear  Having smelled an odor with the nose   Having tasted a taste with the tongue   Having felt a tactile object with the body   Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind a bhikkhu does not grasp its marks and features Since if he left the mind faculty unrestrained bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him he practices restraint over it he guards the mind faculty he undertakes the restraint of the mind facultyThis is called striving by restraintAnd what is striving by abandonmentHere a bhikkhu does not tolerate an arisen sensual thought he abandons it dispels it terminates it and obliterates it He does not tolerate an arisen thought of ill will  an arisen thought of harming   bad unwholesome states whenever they arise he abandons them dispels them  terminates them and obliterates them This is called striving by abandonmentAnd what is striving by developmentHere a bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness which is based upon seclusion dispassion and cessation maturing in release He develops the enlightenment factor of discrimination of phenomena   the enlightenment factor of energy  the enlightenment factor of rapture  the enlightenment factor of tranquility  the enlightenment factor of concentration  the enlightenment factor of equanimity which is based upon seclusion dispassion and cessation maturing in releaseThis is called striving by development And what is striving by protectionHere a bhikkhu protects an arisen excellent object of concentration the perception of a skeleton the perception of a worminfested corpse the perception of a livid corpse the perception of a festering corpse the perception of a fissured corpse the perception of a bloated corpseThis is called striving by protectionThese bhikkhus are the four kinds of strivingRestraint and abandonment development and protectionthese four strivings were taught by the Kinsman of the SunBy these means an ardent bhikkhu here can attain the destruction of sufferingThen Anathapindika the householder surrounded by about

immediately curedThe Venerable Girimānanda rose from that afflictionand that is how his affliction was curedThus have I heard At one time the Exalted One was staying near Savatthi at the Eastern monastery in the mansion Migaras motherThen Visakha Migaras mother approached the Exalted One having approached and bowed down she sat down in a suitable placeWhen she was seated the Exalted One spoke thus to Visakha Migaras Mother Visakha when the Uposatha undertaken with its eight component practices is entered on it is of great fruit of great advantage of great splendor of great rangeAnd how Visakha is the Uposatha undertaken with its eight component practices entered on is of great fruit great advantage great splendor and great rangeHere Visakha a noble disciple considers thus For all their lives the Arahants dwell having abandoned killing living beings refrain from killing living beings they have laid down their staffs laid down their weapons they are conscientious sympathetic compassionate for the good of all living beingsSo today I dwell for this night and day having abandoned killing living beings refraining from killing living beings I am one who has laid down my staff

is given themselves become clean without thieving So today I dwell for this night and day having abandoned taking what is not given refraining from taking what is not given I am a taker of what is given one who expects only what is given by myself become clean without thieving By this practice following after the Arahants the Uposatha will be entered on by me It is undertaken by this second

great splendor of great rangeHow great a fruit How great an advantage How great a splendor How great a rangeJust as though Visakha one might have power dominion and kingship over sixteen great countries abounding in the seven treasures  that is to say Anga Magadha Kasi Kosala Vajji Malla Ceti Vansa Kure Pañcala Maccha Surasena Assaka Avanti Gandhara and Kamboja yet it is not worth a sixteenth part of the Uposatha undertaken with its eight practicesFor what reasonMiserable is kingship over men compared with heavenly blissThat which among men is fifty years Visakha is one night and day of the devas of the Four Great KingsTheir month has thirty of those daysTheir year twelve of those monthsThe lifespan of the devas of the Four Great Kings is five hundred of those heavenly

Their month has thirty of those days Their year twelve of those months The lifespan of the Nimmanarati devas is eight thousand of those heavenly years Now here a certain woman or man having entered on the Uposatha undertaken with the eight practices at the break up of the body after death may arise to fellowship with the Nimmanarati devas  such a thing indeed is known Visakha It was in connection with this that I have said Miserable is kingship over men compared with heavenly bliss That which among men is sixteen hundred years Visakha is one night and day of the Paranimmitavasavatti devasTheir month has thirty of those daysTheir year twelve of those monthsThe lifespan of the Paranimmitavasavatti devas is sixteen thousand of those heavenly yearsNow here a certain woman or man having entered on the Uposatha undertaken with the eight practices at the break up of the body after death may arise to fellowship with the Paranimmitavasavatti devas  such a thing indeed is known VisakhaIt was in connection with this that I have said Miserable is kingship over men compared with heavenly blissKill no life nor take what is not givenspeak no lie nor be an alcoholicrefrain from sex and unchaste conductat night do not eat outoftime foodneither bear garlands nor indulge with perfumeand make your bed a mat upon the groundthis indeed is called the eightpart uposathataught by the Buddha gone to dukkhas endThe radiance of the sun and moonboth beautiful to see follow on from each other dispelling the darknessas they go through the heavensillumining the sky and brightening the quartersand the treasure found between thempearls and crystals and auspicious turquoisesgold nuggets and the gold called oremonetary gold with gold dust carried down compared with the eightpart uposatha though they are enjoyedare not a sixteenth part as the shining of the moon in all the groups of starsHence indeed the woman and the man who are virtuousenter on uposatha having eight partsand having made merits bringing forth happinessblameless they obtain heavenly abodesThey stand beyond the walls and at the junctions and crossroadsthey stand at the doorposts having come to their former homesBut when abundant food and drink both staple and nonstaple is preparedno one remembers these beings because of their past unwholesome deedsThus those who are compassionate give to their departed relativesat the right time pure excellent suitable drink and foodThinking May this go to our relatives may our relatives be happyThose who have gathered the departed relatives who have assembledaround the food and drink respectfully offer their thankssaying  May our relatives live long Those to whom we owe this gainfor we have been honoured those who give are not without rewardFor in that place there is no ploughing and cattlerearing is not found theresimilarly there is no trading or buying and selling of goldThe departed in that place who have died have to subsist on giftsJust as water that rains on the highlands flows down to the lowlandsso too what has been given here is of benefit to the departedJust as rivers that are full flow and fill up the oceanso too what has been given here is of benefit to the departedThinking He gave to me he worked for me he was my relative my friend my companionhe should give gifts for the departed remembering what they have done beforeFor no tears or grief or any other lamentationsare of any use to the departed as long as their relatives continue grieving in this wayBut that gift that has been given and well placed in the Sanghais of benefit to them for a long time immediately it is of benefitThis then is the definition of a relatives duties and by this great honour has been done to the departedstrength has also been given to the monks and no little merit has been produced by youWithout the walls they stand and wait And at the junctions and roadforksReturning to their erstwhile homes They wait beside the jambs of gatesBut when a rich feast is set out With food and drink of every kindThe fact that no man does recall These creatures stems from their past actsSo they who are compassionate At heart do give for relativesSuch drink and food as may be pure And good and fitting at these times Then let this be for relatives May relatives have happinessThese ghosts of the departed kin Foregathered and assembled thereWill eagerly their blessing give For plentiful rich food and drink So may our relatives live long Owing to whom we have this gainFor honour to us has been done No giver ever lacked the fruitNow there is never ploughing there Nor any cattleherding foundNor merchandizing just the same Nor bartering for coin of goldThe ghosts of the departed kin Live there on giving given hereAs water showered on the hill Flows down to reach the hollow valeSo giving given here can serve The ghosts of the departed kinAs riverbeds when full can bear The water down to fill the seaSo giving given here can serve The ghosts of the departed kin He gave to me he worked for me He was my kin friend intimateGive gifts then for departed onesRecalling what they used to doNo weeping nor yet sorrowing Nor any kind of mourningaids Departed Ones whose kin remain Unhelpful to them acting thusBut when this offering is given Well placed in the Community For themthen it can serve them long In future and at once as wellThe True Idea for relatives has thus been shown And how high honour to departed ones is doneAnd how the bhikkhus can be given strength as well And how great merit can be stored away by youI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was living among the Magadhans at Dakkhinagiri in the brahman village of EkanalaNow at that time approximately  of the brahman Kasi Bharadvajas plows were yoked at the sowing timeThen in the early morning putting on his lower robe and taking his bowl  robes the Blessed One went to where Kasi Bharadvaja was workingNow at that time Kasi Bharadvajas fooddistribution was underwaySo the Blessed One went to Kasi Bharadvajas fooddistribution and on arrival stood to one sideKasi Bharadvaja saw the Blessed One standing for almsand on seeing him said to him I contemplative plow  sow Having plowed  sown I eatYou too contemplative should plow  sow Having plowed  sown you eat I too brahman plow  sow Having plowed  sown I eat But contemplative I dont see the Master Gotamas yoke or plow plowshare goad or oxenand yet the Master Gotama says this I too brahman plow  sow Having plowed  sown I eat Then the Kasi Bharadvaja addressed the Blessed One with a verseYou claim to be a plowman but I dont see your plowingBeing asked tell us about your plowing so that we may know your plowingThe Buddha Conviction is my seed austerity my rain discernment my yoke  plow conscience my polemind my yoketie mindfulness my plowshare  goadGuarded in body guarded in speech restrained in terms of belly  foodI make truth a weedinghook and composure my unyokingPersistence my beast of burden bearing me toward rest from the yoketakes me without turning back to where having gone one doesnt grieveThats how my plowing is plowed It has as its fruit the deathlessHaving plowed this plowing one is unyoked from all suffering  stressThen Kasi Bharadvaja having heaped up milkrice in a large bronze serving bowl offered it to the Blessed One saying May Master Gotama eat this milkriceThe master is a plowman for the Master Gotama plows the plowing that has as its fruit the deathless Whats been chanted over with verses shouldnt be eaten by me Thats not the nature brahman of one whos seen rightlyWhats been chanted over with verses Awakened Ones reject That being their nature brahman this is their way of lifea fullyperfected great seer his fermentations ended his anxiety stilled with otherfood  drink serve for that is the field for one looking for meritThen to whom Master Gotama should I give this milkrice Brahman I dont see that person in this world  with its devas Maras  Brahmas in this generation with its royalty  common people  by whom this milkrice having been eaten would be rightly digested aside from a Tathagata or a Tathagatas discipleIn that case brahman throw the milkrice away in a place without vegetation or dump it in water with no living beings So Kasi Bharadvaja dumped the milkrice in water with no living beingsAnd the milkrice when dropped in the water hissed  sizzled seethed  steamedJust as an iron ball heated all day when tossed in the water hisses  sizzles seethes  steams in the same way the milkrice when dropped in the water hissed  sizzled seethed  steamedThen Kasi Bharadvaja  in awe his hair standing on end  went to the Blessed One and on arrival throwing himself down with his head at the Blessed Ones feet said to him Magnificent Master Gotama MagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Community of monks Let me obtain the going forth in Master Gotamas presence let me obtain admission Then the brahman Kasi Bharadvaja obtained the going forth in the Blessed Ones presence he obtained admissionAnd not long after his admission  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute  he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the celibate life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the celibate life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for the sake of this worldAnd so Ven Bharadvaja became another one of the arahantsThus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Magadhans at Dakkhinagiri near the brahmin village of EkanalaNow on that occasion the brahmin Kasi Bharadvaja Bharadvaja the Ploughman had five hundred ploughs fastened to their yokes at the time of sowingThen in the morning the Blessed One dressed and taking bowl and robe went to the place where the brahmin Kasi Bharadvaja was at workNow on that occasion the brahmin Kasi Bharadvajas food distribution was taking placeThen the Blessed One approached the place of the food distribution and stood to one sideThe brahmin Kasi Bharadvaja saw the Blessed One standing for almsand said to him Recluse I plough and sow and when I ploughed and sown I eatYou too ascetic ought to plough and sow then when you have ploughed and sown you will eatI too brahmin plough and sow and when I have ploughed and sown I eatBut we do not see Master Gotamas yoke or plough or ploughshare or goad or oxenyet Master Gotama says I too brahmin plough and sow and when I have ploughed and sown I eatThen the brahmin Kasi Bharadviija addressed the Blessed One in verseYou claim to be a man who works the plough But I do not see your ploughingIf youre a ploughman answer me How should we understand your ploughingThe Blessed One Faith is the seed austerity the rain Wisdom my yoke and plough Shame is the polemind the yoketie Mindfulness my ploughshare and goadGuarded in body guarded in speech Controlled in my appetite for foodI use truth as my weedinghook And gentleness as my unyokingEnergy is my beast of burden Carrying me to security from bondageIt goes ahead without stopping To where having gone one does not sorrowIn such a way this ploughing is done Which has the Deathless as its fruitHaving finished this work of ploughing One is released from all suffering Let Master Gotama eatThe worthy is a ploughman since Master Gotama does ploughing that has even the Deathless as its fruit Food over which verses have been sung Is not fit to be eaten by me This brahmin is not the principle Observed by those who seeThe Enlightened Ones reject such food Over which verses have been sung As such a principle exists O brahmin This is their rule of conductThe consummate one the great seer With taints destroyed and remorse stilled with otherfood and drink Serve For he is the field for one seeking meritMagnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master GotamaThe Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by Master Gotama as though he were turning upright what had been turned upside down revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see formsI go for refuge to Master Gotama and to the Dhamma and to the Bhikkhu SanghaThus I have heard Once the Blessed One was staying among the Magadhans at Dakkhinagiri in the brahman village EkanalaAt that time the brahman Kasibharadvajas five hundred ploughs were fastened to the yokes at the sowingtimeThen in the morning having dressed himself and taken bowl and robe the Blessed One went to where the brahman Kasibharadvaja was at workAt that time the brahman Kasibharadvajas fooddistribution was taking placeThen the Blessed One went to where the fooddistribution was taking place and stood on one sideThe brahman Kasibharadvaja saw the Blessed One standing there for almsand said this I ascetic plough and sow and when I have ploughed and sown I eatYou too ascetic should plough and sow and eat when you have ploughed and sown I too brahman do plough and sow and when I have ploughed and sown I eat But we do not see the venerable Gotamas yoke or plough or ploughshare or goad or oxenbut nevertheless the venerable Gotama speaks thus I too Brahman do plough and sow and when I have ploughed and sown I eatThen the Brahman Kasibharadvaja addressed the Blessed One with a verseYou say you are a ploughman but we do not see your ploughingBeing asked tell us about your ploughing so that we may know your ploughing  Faith is the seed penance is the rain wisdom is my yoke and plough modesty is the polemind is the tie mindfulness is my ploughshare and goadI am guarded in body and guarded in speech restrained in my belly in respect of foodI make truth my weedinghook and meekness my unyokingEnergy is my beast of burden bearing me to restfromexertionit goes without turning back to where having gone one does not grieveThus is this ploughing of mine ploughed It has the deathfree as its fruitHaving ploughed this ploughing one is freed from all misery Then the brahman Kasibharadvaja having heaped up ricegruel in a large bronze dish offered it to the Blessed One saying Let the venerable Gotama eat ricegruel the venerable one is truly a ploughman since the venerable Gotama ploughs the ploughing which has the deathfree as its fruitIt is not right for me to eat what has been sung over with verses This brahman is not the doctrine of those who see rightlyBuddhas reject what has been sung over with verses As long as the doctrine exists this is their way of lifeBut a fullyaccomplished great seer whose asavas are destroyed whose remorse is calmed with otherfood and drink serve for this is the field for one who is looking for merit Shall I then venerable Gotama give this ricegruel to anyoneI do not see brahman in the world including the devas Mara and Brahma among beings including ascetics and brahmans devas and men that man by whom this ricegruel if eaten could be digested properly except the Tathagata or a disciple of the TathagataTherefore brahman either throw that ricegruel away in a place where there is little grass or immerse it in water devoid of living thingsThe brahman Kasibharadvaja immersed that ricegruel in water devoid of living beingsThen that ricegruel immersed in the water hissed and seethed and steamed and smokedJust as a ploughshare which has been heated all day hisses and seethes and steams and smokes when thrown into water in the same way that ricegruel when thrown into the water hissed and seethed and steamed and smokedThen the brahman Kasibharadvaja trembling with his hair standing on end went up to the Blessed One and fell with his head at his feet and said this to the Blessed One Wonderful venerable Gotama wonderful venerable GotamaJust as venerable Gotama one might set upright what has been overturned or uncover that which has been covered or point out the way to one who had gone astray or bring an oillamp into the darkness so that those with eyes might see shapes in the same way the doctrine has been declared by the venerable Gotama in manifold waysI go to the venerable Gotama as a refuge and to the Doctrine and to the Order of Bhikkhus May I gain admission to the Order in the presence of the venerable Gotama may I obtain ordinationThe Brahman Kasibharadvaja obtained admission in the presence of the Blessed One and he obtained ordinationThen when the venerable Bharadvaja had not long been ordained and was dwelling alone secluded vigilant ardent resolute after a short time he himself learned realised and attained in this world of phenomena that unsurpassed goal of the holy life for the sake of which men of good family rightly go forth from the house to the houseless stateHe understood Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived that which was to be done has been done there is nothing more for this stateThen the venerable Bharadvaja became one of the arahatsThus have I heard Once the Exalted One was dwelling at Anathapindikas monastery in the Jeta Grove near SavatthiNow when the night was far spent a certain deity whose surpassing splendor illuminated the entire Jeta Grove came to the presence of the Exalted One and drawing near respectfully saluted Him and stood at one sideStanding thus he addressed the Exalted One in verseThe Deity we ask thee O Gotama about mans declineHaving come here with our questions to

the unsuccessful manOne with little wealth but great craving is born in a khattiya familyHe desires kingship in this world That is the cause of the unsuccessful manSeeing these failures in the world a wise mana noble one endowed with insight resorts to the blissful worldThus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindikas monasteryThen in the forenoon the Blessed One having dressed himself took bowl and robe and entered the city of Savatthi for almsNow at that time a fire was burning and an offering was being prepared in the house of the brahman AggikabharadvajaThen the Blessed One while on his alms round came to the brahmans residenceThe brahman seeing the Blessed One some way offsaid this Stay there you shaveling stay there you wretched monk stay there you outcastWhen he spoke thus the Blessed One said to the brahman Do you know brahman who an outcast is and what the conditions are that make an outcastNo indeed Venerable Gotama I do not know who an outcast is nor the conditions that make an outcast It is good if Venerable Gotama were to explain the Dhamma to me so that I may know who an outcast is and what the conditions are that make an outcast Listen then brahman and pay attention I will speak Yes Venerable Sir replied the brahmanWhosoever is angry harbors hatred and is reluctant to speak well of others perverted in views deceitful  know him as an outcastWhosoever in this world kills living beings once born or twice bornin whom there is no sympathy for living beings  know him as an outcastWhosoever destroys and besieges villages and hamletsand becomes notorious as an oppressor  know him as an outcastBe it in the village or in the forestwhosoever steals what belongs to others what is not given to

by birth is one an outcast not by birth is one a brahmanBy deed one becomes an outcast by deed one becomes a brahmanKnow ye by the example I now cite There was an outcasts son Sopaka who became known as MatangaThis Matanga attained the highest fame so difficult to gainMany were the warriors and brahmans who went to attend on himMounting the celestial chariot along the passionfree high road reached the Brahma realm having given up sense desiresHis birth did not prevent him from being reborn in the Brahma realmThere are brahmans born in the family of preceptors kinsmen of hymnsThey are often seen committing evil deedsIn this life itself they are despised in the next they are born in an evil state of existenceHigh birth does not prevent them from falling into a woeful state or from censureNot by birth is one an outcast not by birth is one a brahmanBy deed one becomes an outcast by deed one becomes an brahmanWhen the Buddha had thus spoken the Brahman Aggikabharadvaja said to the Blessed One Excellent O Venerable Gotama excellentThus have I heard Once the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in the Jetavana in Anathapindikas parkThen in the morning having dressed himself and taken bowl and robe the Blessed One entered Savatthi to begAt that time the sacrificial fire was burning in the house of the brahman Aggikabharadvaja and the offering was held aloftThen the Blessed One going on an uninterrupted begging round in Savatthi came to the house of the brahman AggikabharadvajaThe brahman Aggikabharadvaja saw the Blessed One coming from afar offand said this to him Stop there shaveling stop there wretched ascetic stop there outcasteWhen this was said the Blessed One said this to the brahman Aggikabharadvaja Do you know brahman what an outcaste is or the things that make an outcasteI do not know Gotama an outcaste is or the things that make an outcaste It would be a good thing for me for the venerable Gotama so to teach me the doctrine that I may know what an outcaste is and the things that make an outcasteThen listen brahman pay careful attention I shall tell youYes venerable one replied the brahman Aggikabharadvaja to the Blessed OneWhatever man is angry rancorous evil and hypocriticalhas wrong views and is deceitful him one should know to be an outcasteWhoever in this world harms living creatures whether onceborn or twicebornwhoever has no compassion for a living creature him one should know to be an outcasteWhoever destroys or besieges villages and townsand is notorious as an oppressor him one should know to be an outcasteWhoever in a village or a foresttakes by theft what has not been given to him and is cherished by others him one should know to be an outcasteWhoever indeed having contracted a debt when urged to repay it abscondssaying I have no debt to you him one should know to be an outcasteWhoever indeed because of desire for some trifle strikes a person going along the roadand takes the trifle him one should know to be an outcasteWhatever man for his own sake or for anothers sake or for wealthspeaks falsely when asked in person him one should know to be an outcasteWhoever is seen misbehaving among the wives of relatives or friendsby force or with their consent him one should know to be an outcasteWhoever does not support his mother or father when they are old and past their youthalthough being able him one should know to be an outcasteWhoever his mother or father or brother or sister or motherinlawstrikes or angers with his words him one should know to be an outcasteWhoever being asked for what is profitable teaches what is profitlessand gives advice in an obscure manner him one should know to be and outcasteWhoever having done an evil action wants no one to know that he is responsiblewhoever has concealed his actions him one should know to be an outcasteWhoever indeed having gone to anothers house and having eaten pure fooddoes not honour the other in return when he comes to his house him one should know to be an outcasteWhoever a brahman or ascetic or even another mendicantby speaking falsely deceives him one should know to be an outcasteWhoever when mealtime has arrived with his words a brahman or asceticangers and does not give food him one should know to be an outcasteWhoever wrapped up in delusion relates here what has never happenedand desiring some trifle in payment him

is avaricious craftyimmodest shows no remorse him one should know to be an outcasteWhoever reviles the Buddha or a disciple of hisa wanderer or a householder him one should know to be an outcasteWhoever indeed while not being an arahat professes to be an arahata thief in the world including Brahma he indeed is the lowest of the outcastesThese indeed are called outcastes whom I have declared to youNot by birth does one become an ortcaste not by birth does one become a brahmanBy ones action one becomes an outcaste by ones action one becomes a brahmanKnow it by this also as I give this examplethere was a lowcaste Candala well known as MatangaThat Matanga gained the highest fame which is very hard to obtainMany khattiyas and brahmans came to serve himHe set out on the unpolluted great way which leads to the devasand having discarded passion and sensual pleasures he reached the world of BrahmaBirth did not keep him from being born in the world of BrahmaAlthough brahmans are born into a family of scholars and have the vedas as their kinsmennevertheless they too are again and again discovered in the midst of evil deedsThey are blameworthy in this world of phenomena and a bad transition is destined in their future stateBirth does not keep them from a bad transition or from blameNot by birth does one become an outcaste not by birth does one become a brahmanBy ones action one becomes an outcaste by ones action one becomes a brahmanWhen this was said the brahman Aggikabharadvaja said this to the Blessed One Wonderful venerable Gotama wonderful venerable GotamaWhat should be done by one with skill in good The State of Peace to have attained is thisHe would be able right upright And meek and gentle and not proudContented easy to support Unbusy frugaland serene In faculties prudent modest Not fawning upon familiesHe would no slight thing do at all That other wise men might deploreThen he would think  Joyful and safe Let every creatures heart

I heard Once the Blessed One was staying at Alavi in the haunt of the yakkha AlavakaThen the yakkha Alavaka went up to the Blessed One and said to him Go out asceticYes sir said the Blessed One and went outGo in ascetic said the yakkhayes Sir said the Blessed One and went inA second time the yakkha Alavaka said this to the Blessed One Go out asceticA fourth time the yakkha Alavaka said this to the Blessed One Go out asceticThen I shall not go out sirdo whatever you mustI shall ask you a question asceticIf you do not answer me I shall either strike down your mind or split your heart or seize you by the feet and throw you over the GangesI do not see anyone sir in the world including the devas Mara and Brahma among beings including ascetics and brahmans devas and men who could strike down my mind or split my heart or seize me by the feet and throw me over the GangesNevertheless ask what you wish Then the yakkha Alaveka addressed the Blessed One with a verseWhat in this world is the best wealth for a man What when well practised brings happinessWhat indeed is the sweetest of flavours Living in what way do they say ones life is best Faith is the best wealth for a man in this world
