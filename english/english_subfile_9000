And before long he does so
And he having thus gone forth might dwell  in solitude
And if people were to tell you this 
would you then say That man must come back and be a steward as before
No indeed Lord
For we should pay homage to him we should rise and invite him and press him to receive from us robes food lodging medicines for sickness and requisites and make arrangements for his proper protection 
What do you think Sire
Is that one fruit of the homeless life visible here and now
Certainly Lord
Then that Sire is the second such fruit of the homeless life
But Lord can you show me any other reward visible here and now as a fruit of the homeless life that is more excellent and perfect than these 
I can Sire
Please listen Your Majesty pay proper attention and I will speak
Yes Lord said King Ajatasattu
and the Lord went on Your Majesty it happens that a Tathagata arises in the world an Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans enlightened and blessed
He having realised it by his own superknowledge proclaims this world with its devas maras and Brahmas its princes and people
He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle lovely in its ending in the spirit and in the letter and displays the fullyperfected and purified holy life
This Dhamma is heard by a householder or a householders son or one reborn in some family or other
Having heard this Dhamma he gains faith in the Tathagata
Having gained this faith he reflects The household life is close and dusty the homeless life is free as air
It is not easy living the household life to live the fullyperfected holy life purified and polished like a conchshell
Suppose I were to shave off my hair and beard don yellow robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness
And after some time he abandons his property small or great leaves his circle of relatives small or great shaves off his hair and beard dons yellow robes and goes forth into the homeless life
And having gone forth he dwells restrained by the restraint of the rules persisting in right behaviour seeing danger in the slightest faults observing the commitments he has taken on regarding body deed and word devoted to the skilled and purified life perfected in morality with the sense doors guarded skilled in mindful awareness and content
And how Sire is a monk perfected in morality
Abandoning the taking of life the he dwells refraining from taking life
without stick or sword scrupulous compassionate trembling for the welfare of all living beings
Thus the worldling would praise the Tathagata
Abandoning the taking of what is not given the he dwells refraining from taking what is not given living purely accepting what is given awaiting what is given without stealing
Abandoning unchastity the he lives far from it aloof from the villagepractice of sex
Abandoning false speech the he dwells refraining from false speech a truthspeaker one to be relied on trustworthy dependable not a deceiver of the world
Abandoning malicious speech he does not repeat there what he has heard here to the detriment of these or repeat here what he has heard there to the detriment of those
Thus he is a reconciler of those at variance and an encourager of those at one rejoicing in peace loving it delighting in it one who speaks up for peace
Abandoning harsh speech he refrains from it He speaks whatever is blameless pleasing to the ear agreeable reaching the heart urbane pleasing and attractive to the multitude
Abandoning idle chatter he speaks at the right time what is correct and to the point of Dhamma and discipline He is a speaker whose words are to be treasured seasonable reasoned welldefined and connected with the goal
Thus the worldling would praise the Tathagata
The he is a refrainer from damaging seeds and crops He eats once a day and not at night refraining from eating at improper times
He avoids watching dancing singing music and shows
He abstains from using garlands perfumes cosmetics ornaments and adornments
He avoids using high or wide beds

elephants cattle horses and mares

he refrains from running errands
from buying and selling
from cheating with false weights and measures
from bribery and corruption deception and insincerity
from wounding killing imprisoning highway robbery and taking food by force
Thus the worldling would praise the Tathagata
 Whereas gentlemen some ascetics and Brahmins feeding on the food of the faithful are addicted to the destruction of such seeds
as are propagated from roots from stems from joints from cuttings from seeds the he refrains from such destruction
Thus the worldling would praise the Tathagata
Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins feeding on the food of the faithful remain addicted to the enjoyment of storedup goods
such as food drink clothing carriages beds perfumes meat the he refrains from such enjoyment
Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins remain addicted to attending such shows
as dancing singing music displays recitations handmusic cymbals and drums fairy shows acrobatic and conjuring tricks combats of elephants buffaloes bulls goats rams cocks and quail fighting with staves boxing wrestling shamfights parades manoeuvres and military reviews the he refrains from attending such displays
Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins remain addicted to such games and idle pursuits
as eight or tenrow chess chess in the air hopscotch spillikins dicing hitting sticks handpictures ballgames blowing through toy pipes playing with toy ploughs turning somersaults playing with toy windmills measures carriages and bows guessing letters guessing thoughts mimicking deformities the he refrains from such idle pursuits
Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins remain addicted to high and wide beds and long chairs
couches adorned with animal figures fleecy or variegated coverlets coverlets with hair on both sides or one side silk coverlets embroidered with gems or without elephant horse or chariotrugs choice spreads of atitelopehide couches with awnings or with red cushions at both ends the he refrains from such high and wide beds
Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins remain addicted to such forms of selfadornment and embellishment
as rubbing the body with perfumes massaging bathing in scented water shampooing using mirrors ointments garlands scents unguents cosmetics bracelets headbands fancy sticks bottles swords sunshades decorated sandals turbans gems yaktail fans longfringed white robes the he refrains from such selfadornment
Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins remain addicted to such unedifying conversation
as about kings robbers ministers armies dangers wars food drink clothes beds garlands perfumes relatives carriages villages towns and cities countries women heroes street and well gossip talk of the departed desultory chat speculations about land and sea talk about being and nonbeing the he refrains from such conversation
Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins remain addicted to disputation
such as You dont understand this doctrine and discipline  I do How could you understand this doctrine and discipline Your way is all wrong  mine is right I am consistent  you arent You said last what you should have said first and you said first what you should have said last What you took so long to think up has been refuted Your argument has been overthrown youre defeated Go on save your doctrine  get out of that if you can the he refrains from such disputation
Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins remain addicted to such things as running errands and messages
such as for kings ministers nobles Brahmins householders and young men who say Go here  go there Take this there  bring that from there the he refrains from such errandrunning
Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins remain addicted to deception patter hinting belittling and are always on the make for further gains
he refrains from such deception
Thus the worldling would praise the Tathagata
Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins feeding on the food of the faithful make their living by such base arts such wrong means of livelihood
as palmistry divining by signs portents dreams bodymarks mousegnawings fireobla tions oblations from a ladle of husks ricepowder rice grains ghee or oil from the mouth or of blood reading the fingertips house and gardenlore skill in charms ghost lore earthhouse lore snakelore poisonlore ratlore bird lore crowlore foretelling a persons lifespan charms against arrows knowledge of animals cries the he refrains from such base arts and wrong means of livelihood
Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins make their living by such base arts
as judging the marks of gems sticks clothes swords spears arrows weapons women men boys girls male and female slaves elephants horses buffaloes bulls cows goats rams cocks quail iguanas bamboorats tortoises deer the he refrains from such base arts
Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins make their living by such base arts as predicting
The chiefs will march out  the chiefs will march back Our chiefs will advance and the other chiefs will retreat Our chiefs will win and the other chiefs will lose The other chiefs will win and ours will lose Thus there will be victory for one side and defeat for the other the he refrains from such base arts
Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins make their living by such base arts
as predicting an eclipse of the moon the sun a star that the sun and moon will go on their proper course  will go astray that a star will go on its proper course  will go astray that there will be a shower of meteors a blaze in the sky an earthquake thunder a rising setting darkening brightening of the moon the sun the stars and such will be the outcome of these things the he refrains from such base arts and wrong means of livelihood
Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins make their living by such base arts
as predicting good or bad rainfall a good or bad harvest security danger disease health or accounting computing calculating poetic composition philosophising the he refrains from such base arts and wrong means of livelihood
Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins make their living by such base arts
as arranging the giving and taking in marriage engagements and divorces declaring the time for saving and spending bringing good or bad luck procuring abortions using spells to bind the tongue binding the jaw making the hands jerk causing deafness getting answers with a mirror a girlmedium a deva worshipping the sun or Great Brahma breathing fire invoking the goddess of luck the he refrains from such base arts and wrong means of livelihood
Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins feeding on the food of the faithful make their living by such base arts such wrong means of livelihood
as appeasing the devas and redeeming vows to them making earthhouse spells causing virility or impotence preparing and consecrating building sites giving ritual rinsings and bathings making sacrifices giving emetics purges expectorants and phlegmagogues giving ear eye nosemedicine ointments and counterointments eyesurgery surgery pediatry using balms to counter the sideeffects of previous remedies A monk refrains from such base arts and wrong means of livelihood
Thus he is perfected in morality 
And then Sire that monk who is perfected in morality sees no danger from any side owing to his being restrained by morality
Just as a dulyanointed Khattiya king having conquered his enemies by that very fact sees no danger from any side so the monk on account of his morality sees no danger anywhere
He experiences in himself the blameless bliss that comes from maintaining this Ariyan morality
In this way Sire he is perfected in morality
And how Sire is he a guardian of the sensedoors
Here a monk on seeing a visible object with the eye does not grasp at its major signs or secondary characteristics
Because greed and sorrow evil unskilled states would overwhelm him if he dwelt leaving this eyefaculty unguarded so he practises guarding it he protects the eyefaculty develops restraint of the eyefaculty
On hearing a sound with the ear  on smelling an odour with the nose  on tasting a flavour with the tongue   on feeling an object with the body  
on thinking a thought with the mind he does not grasp at its major signs or secondary characteristics  he develops restraint of the mindfaculty
He experiences within himself the blameless bliss that comes from maintaining this Ariyan guarding of the faculties
In this way Sire a monk is a guardian of the sense doors
And how Sire is a monk accomplished in mindfulness and clear awareness
Here a monk acts with clear awareness in going forth and back in looking ahead or behind him in bending and stretching in wearing his outer and inner robe and carrying his bowl in eating drinking chewing and swallowing in evacuating and urinating in walking standing sitting lying down in waking in speaking and in keeping silent he acts with clear awareness
In this way a monk is accomplished in mindfulness and clear awareness
And how is a monk contented
Here a monk is satisfied with a robe to protect his body with alms to satisfy his stomach
and having accepted sufficient he goes on his way
Just as a bird with wings flies hither and thither burdened by nothing but its wings
so he is satisfied
In this way Sire a monk is contented
Then he equipped with this Ariyan morality with this Ariyan restraint of the senses with this Ariyan contentment finds a solitary lodging at the root of a forest tree in a mountain cave or gorge a charnelground a junglethicket or in the open air on a heap of straw
Then having eaten after his return from the almsround he sits down crosslegged holding his body erect and concentrates on keeping mindfulness established before him 
Abandoning worldly desires he dwells with a mind freed from worldly desires and his mind is purified of them
Abandoning illwill and hatred   and by compassionate love for the welfare of all living beings his mind is purified of ill will and hatred
Abandoning slothandtorpor  perceiving light mindful and clearly aware his mind is purified of slothandtorpor
Abandoning worryandflurry  and with an inwardly calmed mind his heart is purified of worryand flurry
Abandoning doubt he dwells with doubt left behind without uncertainty as to what things are wholesome his mind is purified of doubt
Just as a man who had taken a loan to develop his business
and whose business had prospered
might pay off his old debts and with what was left over could support a wife
might think Before this I developed my business by borrowing
but now it has prospered
and he would rejoice and be glad about that
Just as a man who was ill suffering terribly sick with no appetite and weak in body
might after a time recover and regain his appetite and bodily strength
and he might think Before this I was ill
and he would rejoice and be glad about that
Just as a man might be bound in prison
He might think Before this I was in prison
and he would rejoice and be glad about that
Just as a man might be a slave not his own master dependent on another unable to go where he liked
and after some time he might be freed from slavery able to go where he liked
might think Before this I was a slave
 And he would rejoice and be glad about that
Just as a man laden with goods and wealth might go on a long journey through the desert where food was scarce and danger abounded
and after a time he would get through the desert and arrive safe and sound at the edge of a village
might think Before this I was in danger
now I am safe at the edge of a village
and he would rejoice and be glad about that
As long Sire as a monk does not perceive the disappearance of the five hindrances in himself he feels as if in debt in sickness in bonds in slavery on a desert journey
But when he perceives the disappearance of the five hindrances in himself it is as if he were freed from debt from sickness from bonds from slavery from the perils of the desert
And when he knows that these five hindrances have left him gladness arises in him from gladness comes delight from the delight in his mind his body is tranquillised with a tranquil body he feels joy and with joy his mind is concentrated
Being thus detached from sensedesires detached from unwholesome states he enters and remains in the first jhana which is with thinking and pondering bom of detachment filled with delight and joy
And with this delight and joy bom of detachment he so suffuses drenches fills and irradiates his body that there is no spot in his entire body that is untouched by this delight and joy bom of detachment
Just as a skilled bathman or his assistant kneading the soappowder which he has sprinkled with water forms from it in a metal dish a soft lump so that the ball of soappowder becomes one oleaginous mass bound with oil so that nothing escapes  so this monk suffuses drenches fills and irradiates his body so that no spot remains untouched
This Sire is a fruit of the homeless life visible here and now that is more excellent and perfect than the former ones
Again a monk with the subsiding of thinking and pondering by gaining inner tranquillity and oneness of mind enters and remains in the second jhana which is without thinking and pondering born of concentration filled with delight and joy
And with this delight and joy born of concentration he so suffuses his body that no spot remains untouched
Just as a lake fed by a spring with no inflow from east west north or south where the raingod sends moderate showers from time to time
the water welling up from below mingling with cool water would suffuse fill and irradiate that cool water so that no part of the pool was untouched by it 
so with this delight and joy bom of concentration he so suffuses his body that no spot remains untouched
This Sire is a fruit more excellent and perfect than the former ones
Again a monk with the fading away of delight remains imperturbable mindful and clearly aware and experiences in himself that joy of which the Noble Ones say Happy is he who dwells with equanimity and mindfulness and he enters and remains in the third jhana
And with this joy devoid of delight he so suffuses his body that no spot remains untouched
Just as if in a pond of blue red or white lotuses in which the flowers bom in the water grown in the water not growing out of the water are fed from the waters depths those blue red or white lotuses would be suffused  with the cool water  so with this joy devoid of delight the monk so suffuses his body that no spot remains untouched
This is a fruit of the homeless life more excellent and perfect than the former ones
Again a monk having given up pleasure and pain and with the disappearance of former gladness and sadness enters and remains in the fourth jhana which is beyond pleasure and pain and purified by equanimity and mindfulness And he sits suffusing his body with that mental purity and clarification So that no part of his body is untouched by it
Just as if a man were to sit wrapped from head to foot in a white garment so that no part of him was untouched by that garment  so his body is suffused 
This is a fruit of the homeless life more excellent and perfect than the former ones
And so with mind concentrated purified and cleansed unblemished free from impurities malleable workable established and having gained imperturbability he directs and inclines his mind towards knowing and seeing
And he knows This my body is material made up from the four great elements bom of mother and father fed on rice and gruel impermanent liable to be injured and abraded broken and destroyed and this is my consciousness which is bound to it and dependent on it 
It is just as if there were a gem a beryl pure excellent well cut into eight facets clear bright unflawed perfect in every respect
strung on a blue yellow red white or orange cord
A man with good eyesight taking it in his hand and inspecting it would describe it as such
In the same way Sire a monk with mind concentrated purified and cleansed   directs his mind towards knowing and seeing
And he knows This my body is material made up of the four great elements  and this is my consciousness which is bound to it and dependent on it
This is a fruit of the homeless life more excellent and perfect than the former ones
And he with mind concentrated having gained imperturbability applies and directs his mind to the production of a mindmade body
And out of this body he produces another body having a form mindmade complete in all its limbs and faculties
It is just as if a man were to draw out a reed from its sheath
He might think This is the reed this is the sheath reed and sheath are different Now the reed has been pulled from the sheath
Or as if a man were to draw a sword from the scabbard
He might think This is the sword this is the scabbard sword and scabbard are different Now the sword has been drawn from the scabbard
Or as if a man were to draw a snake from its old skin
He might think This is the snake this is the skin
snake and skin are different Now the snake has been drawn from its skin
In the same way a monk with mind concentrated  directs his mind to the production of a mindmade body
He draws that body out of this body having form mindmade complete with all its limbs and faculties
This is a fruit of the homeless life more excellent and perfect than the former ones
And he with mind concentrated applies and directs his mind to the various supernormal powers
He then enjoys different powers being one he becomes many  being many he becomes one he appears and disappears he passes through fences walls and mountains unhindered as if through air
he sinks into the ground and emerges from it as if it were water
he walks on the water without breaking the surface as if on land
he flies crosslegged through the sky like a bird with wings
he even touches and strokes with his hand the sun and moon mighty and powerful as they are
and he travels in the body as far as the Brahma world
Just as a skilled potter or his assistant can make from wellprepared clay whatever kind of bowl he likes
or just as a skilled ivorycarver or his assistant can produce from well prepared ivory any object he likes
or just as a skilled goldsmith or his assistant can make any gold article he likes 
so the monk with mind concentrated enjoys various supernormal powers
This is a fruit of the homeless life
And he with mind concentrated  applies and directs his mind to the divine ear
With the divine ear purified and surpassing that of human beings he hears sounds both divine and human whether far or near
Just as a man going on a long journey
might hear the sound of a big drum a small drum a conch cymbals or a kettledrum
and he might think That is a big druma kettledrum
so the monk with mind concentrated 
hears sounds divine or human far or near
This is a fruit of the homeless life more excellent and perfect than the former ones
And he with mind concentrated  applies and directs his mind to the knowledge of others minds
He knows and distinguishes with his mind the minds of other beings or other persons He knows the mind with passion to be with passion he knows the mind without passion to be without passion  He knows the mind with hate to be with hate he knows the mind without hate to be without hate He knows the deluded mind to be deluded he knows the undeluded mind to be undeluded He knows the narrow mind to be narrow he knows the broad mind to be broad He knows the expanded mind to be expanded he knows the unexpanded mind to be unexpanded He knows the surpassed mind to be surpassed he knows the unsurpassed mind to be unsurpassed He knows the concentrated mind to be concentrated he knows the unconcentrated mind to be unconcentrated He knows the liberated mind to be liberated he knows the unliberated mind to be unliberated
Just as a woman or a man or young boy fond of his appearance might examine his face in a brightly polished mirror or in water and by examination would know whether there was a spot there or not so the monk with mind concentrated  directs his mind to the knowledge of others minds 
This is a fruit of the homeless life
And he with mind concentrated  applies and directs his mind to the knowledge of previous existences
He remembers many previous existences one birth two three four five births ten twenty thirty forty fifty births a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand births several periods of contraction of expansion of both contraction and expansion There my name was soandso my clan was soandso my caste was soandso my food was suchandsuch I experienced suchandsuch pleasant and painful conditions I lived for so long Having passed away from there I arose there There my name was soandso   And having passed away from there I arose here
Thus he remembers various past births their conditions and details
It is just as if a man were to go from his village to another from that to yet another
and thence return to his home village
He might think I came from my own village to that other one where I stood sat spoke or remained silent like this and from that one I went to another where I stood sat spoke or remained silent like this and from there I have just returned to my own village
Just so the monk with mind concentrated  
remembers past births 
This is a fruit of the homeless life
And he with mind concentrated   applies and directs his mind to the knowledge of the passingaway and arising of beings
With the divine eye purified and surpassing that of humans he sees beings passing away and arising base and noble wellfavoured and illfavoured to happy and unhappy destinations as kamma directs them and he knows These beings on account of misconduct of body speech or thought or disparaging the Noble Ones have wrong view and will suffer the kammic fate of wrong view
At the breakingup of the body after death they are reborn in a lower world a bad destination a state of suffering hell
But these beings on account of good conduct of body speech or thought of praising the Noble Ones have right view and will reap the kammic reward of right view At the breakingup of the body after death they are reborn in a good destination a heavenly world
Thus with the divine eye  he sees beings passing away and realising 
Tt is just as if there were a lofty building at a crossroads
and a man with good eyesight standing there might see people entering or leaving a house walking in the street or sitting in the middle of the crossroads
And he might think These are entering a house
 Just so with the divine eye    he sees beings passing away and realising 
This is a fruit of the homeless life
And he with mind concentrated purified and cleansed unblemished free from impurities malleable workable established and having gained imperturbability applies and directs his mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the corruptions
He knows as it really is This is suffering he knows as it really is This is the origin of suffering he knows as it really is This is the cessation of suffering he knows as it really is This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering
And he knows as it really is These are the corruptions This is the origin of the corruptions This is the cessation of the corruptions This is the path leading to the cessation of the corruptions
And through his knowing and seeing his mind is delivered from the corruption of sense desire from the corruption of becoming from the corruption of ignorance and the knowledge arises in him This is deliverance and he knows Birth is finished the holy life has been led done is what had to be done there is nothing further here 
Just as if Sire in the midst of the mountains there were a pond clear as a polished mirror
where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see oystershells gravel banks and shoals of fish on the move or stationary
And he might think This pond is clear
there are oystershells 
just so with mind concentrated  
he knows Birth is finished the holy life has been led done is what had to be done there is nothing further here
This Sire is a fruit of the homeless life visible here and now which is more excellent and perfect than the previous fruits
And Sire there is no fruit of the homeless life visible here and now that is more excellent and perfect than this
At this King Ajatasattu exclaimed Excellent Lord excellent
It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down or to point out the way to one who had got lost or to bring an oillamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways
And I Lord go for refuge to the Blessed Lord to the Dhamma and to the Sangha
May the Blessed Lord accept me from this day forth as a layfollower as long as life shall last
Transgression overcame me Lord foolish erring and wicked as I was in that I for the sake of the throne deprived my father that good man and just king of his life
May the Blessed Lord accept my confession of my evil deed that I may restrain myself in future
Indeed Sire transgression overcame you when you deprived your father that good man and just king of his life
But since you have acknowledged the transgression and confessed it as is right we will accept it
For he who acknowledges his transgression as such and confesses it for betterment in future will grow in the Ariyan discipline 
At this King Ajatasattu said Lord permit me to depart now I am busy and have much to do
Do now Your Majesty as you think fit 
Then King Ajatasattu rejoicing and delighting at these words rose from his seat saluted the Lord and departed with his right side towards him
As soon as the King had gone the Lord said The King is done for
his fate is sealed monks 
But if the King had not deprived his father that good man and just king of his life then as he sat here the pure and spotless Dhamma eye would have arisen in him
Thus the Lord spoke
and the monks delighted rejoiced at his words
Thus have I heard Once the Lord was staying at Nalanda in Pavarikas mango grove
And the householder Kevaddha came to the Lord prostrated himself before him and sat down to one side
He then said Lord this Nalanda is rich prosperous populous and full of people who have faith in the Lord
It would be well if the Lord were to cause some monk to perform superhuman feats and miracles In this way Nalanda would come to have even more faith ip the Lord
The Lord replied Kevaddha this is not the way I teach Dhamma to the monks by saying Go monks and perform superhuman feats and miracles for the whiteclothed lay people 
For a second time Kevaddha said Lord I would not be importunate but I still say This Nalanda is rich prosperous 
And the Lord replied as before
When Kevaddha repeated his request for a third time
the Lord said Kevaddha there are three kinds of miracle that I have declared having realised them by my own insight
Which three
The miracle of psychic power the miracle of telepathy the miracle of instruction 
What is the miracle of psychic power
Here Kevaddha a monk displays various psychic powers in different ways
Being one he becomes many being many he becomes one and he travels in the body as far as the Brahma world
Then someone who has faith and trust sees him doing these things
He tells this to someone else who is sceptical and un believing saying It is wonderful sir it is marvellous the great power and skill of that ascetic
And that is why Kevaddha seeing the danger of such miracles I dislike reject and despise them
And what is the miracle of telepathy
Here a monk reads the minds of other beings of other people reads their mental states their thoughts and ponderings and says That is how your mind is that is how it inclines that is in your heart
Then someone who has faith and trust sees him doing these things
He tells this to someone else who is sceptical and unbelieving saying It is wonderful sir it is marvellous the great power and skill of that ascetic
And what is the miracle of instruction
Here Kevaddha a monk gives instruction as follows Consider in this way dont consider in that direct your mind this way not that way give up that gain this and persevere in it
That Kevaddha is called the miracle of instruction
Again Kevaddha a Tathagata arises in the world an Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans enlightened and blessed He having realised it by his own superknowledge proclaims this world with its devas maras and Brahmas its princes and people He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle lovely in its ending in the spirit and in the letter and displays the fullyperfected and purified holy life
A disciple goes forth and practises the moralities  He guards the sensedoors and attains the four jhanas 
he attains various insights  he realises the Four Noble Truths the path and the cessation of the corruptions  and he knows There is nothing further here
That Kevaddha is called the miracle of instruction
Once Kevaddha in this order of monks the thought occurred to a certain monk I wonder where the four great elements  the earth element the water element the fire element the air element  cease without remainder
And that monk attained to such a state of mental concentration that the way to the devarealms appeared before him
Then coming to the Realm of the devas of the Four Great Kings he asked those devas Friends where do the four great elements  earth water fire and air  cease without remainder
At this question the devas of the Four Great Kings said to him Monk we dont know where the four great elements cease without remainder
But the Four Great Kings are loftier and wiser than we are
They may know where the four great elements cease
So that monk went to the Four Great Kings and asked the same question
So that monk went to the ThirtyThree Gods
Sakka lord of the gods said
The Yama devas may know  The Yama devas said Suyama son of the devas may know  Suyama said The Tusita devas may know  The Tusita devas said Santusita son of the devas may know   Santusita said The Nimmanarati devas may know  The Nimmanarati devas said Sunimmita son of the devas may know  Sunimitta said The ParanimmitaVasavatti devas may know  The ParanimmitaVasavatti devas said Vasavatti son of the devas may know
Then that monk by the appropriate concentration made the way to the Brahma world appear before him
He went to the devas of Brahmas retinue and asked them
They said We dont know
But there is Brahma Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Lord the Maker and Creator the Ruler Appointer and Orderer Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be He is loftier and wiser than we are
He would know where the four great elements cease without remainder
And where friends is this Great Brahma now
Monk we do not know when how and where Brahma will appear But when the signs are seen  when a light appears and a radiance shines forth  then Brahma will appear Such signs are an indication that he will appear
Then it was not long before the Great Brahma appeared
And that monk went up to him and said Friend where do the four great elements  earth water fire air  cease without remainder
to which the Great Brahma replied Monk I am Brahma Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Lord the Maker and Creator the Ruler Appointer and Orderer Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be
A second time the monk said Friend I did not ask if you are Brahma Great Brahma
And a second time the Great Brahma replied as before
And a third time the monk said Friend I did not ask you that
Then Kevaddha the Great Brahma took that monk by the arm led him aside and said Monk these devas believe there is nothing Brahma does not see there is nothing he does not know there is nothing he is unaware of
That is why I did not speak in front of them
But monk I dont know where the four great elements cease without remainder
And therefore monk you have acted wrongly you have acted incorrectly by going beyond the Blessed Lord and going in search of an answer to this question elsewhere
Now monk you just go to the Blessed Lord and put this question to him and whatever answer he gives accept it
So that monk as swiftly as a strong man might flex or unflex his arm vanished from the Brahma world and appeared in my presence
He prostrated himself before me then sat down to one side and said Lord where do the four great elements  the earth element the water element the fire element and the air element  cease without remainder 
I replied Monk once upon a time seafaring merchants when they set sail on the ocean took in their ship a land sighting bird
When they could not see the land themselves they released this bird
The bird flew to the east to the south to the west to the north it flew to the zenith and to the intermediate points of the compass
If it saw land anywhere it flew there
But if it saw no land it returned to the ship
In the same way monk you have been as far as the Brahma world searching for an answer to your question and not finding it and now you come back to me
But monk you should not ask your question in this way Where do the four great elements  the earth element the water element the fire element the air element  cease without remainder
Instead this is how the question should have been put
Where do earth water fire and air no footing find
Where are long and short small and great fair and foul 
Where are nameandform wholly destroyed
And the answer is
Where consciousness is signless boundless all luminous
Thats where earth water fire and air find no footing
There both long and short small and great fair and foul 
There nameandform are wholly destroyed
With the cessation of consciousness this is all destroyed
Thus the Lord spoke
 Thus have I heard Once the Lord was touring Kosala with a large number of monks some five hundred and he came to a Kosalan Brahmin village called Icchanankala
And he stayed in the dense jungle of Icchanankala
At that time the Brahmin Pokkharasati was living at Ukkhattha a populous place full of grass timber water and corn which had been given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift and with royal powers
 And Pokkharasati heard say The ascetic Gotama son of the Sakyans who has gone forth from the Sakya clan   is staying in the dense jungle of Icchanankala
And concerning that Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about This Blessed Lord is an Arahant a fullyenlightened Buddha perfected in knowledge and conduct a WellFarer Knower of the worlds unequalled Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans a Buddha a Blessed Lord
He proclaims this world with its gods maras Brahmas the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and people having come to know it by his own knowledge
He teaches a Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending in the spirit and in the letter and he displays the fullyperfected thoroughly purified holy life
And indeed it is good to see such Arahants
 Now at that time Pokkharasati had a pupil the youth Ambattha who was a student of the Vedas who knew the mantras perfected in the Three Vedas a skilled expounder of the rules and rituals the lore of sounds and meanings and fifthly oral tradition complete in philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man admitted and accepted by his master in the Three Vedas with the words What I know you know what you know I know
 And Pokkharasati said to Ambattha Ambattha my son the ascetic Gotama is staying in the dense jungle of Icchanankala
And concerning that Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about
Now you go to see the ascetic Gotama and find out whether this report is correct or not and whether the Reverend Gotama is as they say or not
In that way we shall put the Reverend Gotama to the test
 Sir how shall I find out whether the report is true
or whether the Reverend Gotama is as they say or not
 According to the tradition of our mantras Ambattha the great man who is possessed of the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man has only two courses open to him
If he lives the household life he will become a ruler a wheelturning righteous monarch of the law conqueror of the four quarters who has established the security of his realm and is possessed of the seven treasures
These are
the WheelTreasure the Elephant Treasure the HorseTreasure the JewelTreasure the Woman Treasure the HouseholderTreasure and as seventh the CounsellorTreasure
He has more than a thousand sons who are heroes of heroic stature conquerors of the hostile army
He dwells having conquered this seagirt land without stick or sword by the law
But if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness then he will become an Arahant a fullyenlightened Buddha one who draws back the veil from the world
And Ambattha I am the passeron of the mantras and you are the receiver
 Very good sir said Ambattha at Pokkharasatis words and he got up passed by Pokkharasati with his right side got into his chariot drawn by a mare and accompanied by a number of young men headed for the dense jungle of Icchanankala
He drove as far as the carriage would go then alighted and continued on foot
 At that time a number of monks were walking up and down in the open air
Ambattha approached them and said Where is the Reverend Gotama to be found just now
We have come to see the Reverend Gotama
 The monks thought This is Ambattha a youth of good family and a pupil of the distinguished Brahmin Pokkharasati
The Lord would not mind having a conversation with such a young man
And they said to Ambattha That is his dwelling with the door closed Go quietly up to it go on to the verandah without haste cough and knock on the bolt The Lord will open the door to you
 Ambattha went up to the dwelling and on to the verandah coughed and knocked
The Lord opened the door
and Ambattha went in
The young men entered exchanged courtesies with the Lord and sat down to one side
But Ambattha walked up and down while the Lord sat there uttered some vague words of politeness and then stood so speaking before the seated Lord
And the Lord said to Ambattha Well now Ambattha would you behave like this if you were talking to venerable and learned Brahmins teachers of teachers as you do with me walking and standing while I am sitting and uttering vague words of politeness
 No Reverend Gotama
A Brahmin should walk with a walking Brahmin stand with a standing Brahmin sit with a sitting Brahmin and lie down with a Brahmin who is lying down
But as for those shaven little ascetics menials black scourings from Brahmas foot with them it is fitting to speak just as I do with the Reverend Gotama
But Ambattha you came here seeking something Whatever it was you came for you should listen attentively to hear about it
Ambattha you have not perfected your training Your conceit of being trained is due to nothing but inexperience
But Ambattha was angry and displeased at being called untrained and he turned on the Lord with curses and insults Thinking The ascetic Gotama bears me illwill he said Reverend Gotama the Sakyans are fierce roughspoken touchy and violent Being of menial origin being menials they do not honour respect esteem revere or pay homage to Brahmins
With regard to this it is not proper   that they do not pay homage to Brahmins
This was the first time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of being menials
But Ambattha what have the Sakyans done to you 
Reverend Gotama once I went to Kapilavatthu on some business for my teacher the Brahmin Pokkharasati
and I came to the Sakyans meetinghall
And at that time a lot of Sakyans were sitting on high seats in their meetinghall poking each other with their fingers laughing and playing about together and it seemed to me that they were just making fun of me and no one offered me a seat
With regard to this it is not proper that they do not pay homage to the Brahmins
This was the second time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of being menials
But Ambattha even the quail that little bird can talk as she likes on her own nest
Kapilavatthu is the Sakyans home Ambattha They do not deserve censure for such a trifle
Reverend Gotama there are four castes the Khattiyas the Brahmins the merchants and the artisans
And of these four castes three  the Khattiyas the merchants and the artisans  are entirely subservient to the Brahmins
With regard to this it is not proper that they should not pay homage to the Brahmins
This was the third time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of being menials
Then the Lord thought This young man goes too far in abusing the Sakyans Suppose I were to ask after his clan name
So he said Ambattha what is your clan
I am a Kanhayan Reverend Gotama
Ambattha in former days according to those who remember the ancestral lineage the Sakyans were the masters and you are descended from a slavegirl of the Sakyans
For the Sakyans regard King Okkaka as their ancestor
At one time King Okkaka to whom his queen was dear and beloved wishing to transfer the kingdom to her son banished his elder brothers from the kingdom  Okkamukha Karandu Hatthimya and Sinipura
And these being banished made their home on the flank of the Himalayas beside a lotuspond where there was a big grove of teaktrees
And for fear of contaminating the stock they cohabited with their own sisters
Then King Okkaka asked his ministers and counsellors Where are the princes living now
and they told him
At this King Okkaha exclaimed They are strong as teak  these princes they are real Sakyans
And that is how the Sakyans got their wellknown name And the King was the ancestor of the Sakyans
Now King Okkaka had a slavegirl called Disa
who gave birth to a black child
The black thing when it was bom exclaimed Wash me mother Bath me mother Deliver me from this dirt and I will bring you profit
Because Ambattha jast as people today use the term hobgoblin as a term of abuse so in thouse days they said black 
And they said As soon as he was bom he spoke He is bom a Kanha a hobgoblin
That is how in former days 
the Sakyans were the masters and you are descended from a slave girl of the Sakyans
On hearing this the young men said Reverend Gotama do not humiliate Ambattha too much with talk of his being descended from a slavegirl
Ambattha is wellborn of a good family he is very learned he is wellspoken a scholar well able to hold his own in this discussion with the Reverend Gotama
Then the Lord said to the young men If you consider that Ambattha is illborn not of a good family unlearned illspoken no scholar unable to hold his own in this discussion with the ascetic Gotama then let Ambattha be silent and you conduct this discussion with me
But if you think he is able to hold his own then you be quiet and let him discuss with me
Ambattha is wellborn Reverend Gotama   We will be silent he shall continue
Then the Lord said to Ambattha Ambattha I have a fundamental question for you which you will not like to answer
If you dont answer or evade the issue if you keep silent or go away your head will split into seven pieces
What do you think Ambattha Have you heard from old and venerable Brahmins teachers of teachers where the Kanhayans came from or who was their ancestor
At this Ambattha remained silent
The Lord asked him a second time
Again Ambattha remained silent
and the Lord said Answer me now Ambattha this is not a time for silence
Whoever Ambattha does not answer a fundamental question put to him by a Tathagata by the third asking has his head split into seven pieces
And at that moment Vajirapani the yakkha holding a huge iron club flaming ablaze and glowing up in the sky just above Ambattha was thinking If this young man Ambattha does not answer a proper question put to him by the Blessed Lord by the third time of asking Ill split his head into seven pieces
The Lord saw Vajirapani and so did Ambattha
And at the sight Ambattha was terrified and unnerved his hairs stood on end and he sought protection shelter and safety from the Lord Crouching down close to the Lord he said What did the Reverend Gotama say
May the Reverend Gotama repeat what he said
What do you think Ambattha Have you heard who was the ancestor of the Kanhayans
 Yes I have heard it just as the Reverend Gotama said
that is there the Kanhayans came from he was their ancestor
Hearing this the young men made a loud noise and clamour So Ambattha is illborn not of a good family bom of a slavegirl of the Sakyans
and the Sakyans are Ambatthas masters
We disparaged the ascetic Gotama thinking he was not speaking the truth
Then the Lord thought It is too much the way these young men humiliate Ambattha for being the son of a slavegirl I must get him out of this
So he said to the young men Dont disparage Ambattha too much for being the son of a slavegirl
That Kanha was a mightly sage
He went to the south country learnt the mantras of the Brahmins there and then went to King Okkaka and asked for his daughter Maddarupi
And King Okkaka furiously angry exclaimed So this fellow the son of a slavegirl wants my daughter and put an arrow to his bow
But he was unable either to shoot the arrow or to withdraw it
Then the ministers and counsellors came to the sage Kanha and said Spare the king Reverend Sir spare the king
The king will be safe but if he looses the arrow downwards the earth will quake as far as his kingdom extends
Reverend Sir spare the king spare the land
The king and the land will besafe but if he looses the arrow upwards as far as his realm extends the god will not let it rain for seven years
Reverend Sir spare the king and the land and may the god let it rains
The king and the land will be safe and the god will let it rain but if the king points the arrow at the crown prince the prince will be completely safe
Then the ministers exclaimed Let King Okkaka point the arrow at the crown prince
the prince will be perfectly safe
The king did so and the prince was unharmed
Then King Okkaka terrified and fearful of divine punishment gave away his daughter Maddarupi
So young men do not disparage Ambattha too much for being the son of a slave girl That Kanha was a mighty sage
Then the Lord said Ambattha what do you think Suppose a Khattiya youth were to wed a Brahmin maiden and there was a son of the union
Would that son of a Khattiya youth and a Brahmin maiden receive a seat and water from the Brahmins
He would Reverend Gotama
Would they allow him to eat at funeralrites at riceoffer ings at sacrifices or as a guest
 They would Reverend Gotama
Would they teach him mantras or not
They would Reverend Gotama
Would they keep their women covered or uncovered
Uncovered Reverend Gotama
But would the Khattiyas sprinkle him with the Khattiya consecration
No Reverend Gotama
Why not
Because Reverend Gotama he is not wellborn on his mothers side
What do you think Ambattha Suppose a Brahmin youth were to wed a Khattiya maiden and there was a son of the union
Would that son of a Khattiya youth and a Brahmin maiden receive a seat and water from the Brahmins
He would Reverend Gotama
But would the Khattiyas sprinkle him with the Khattiya consecration
 No Reverend Gotama
Why not
Because Reverend Gotama he is not wellborn on his fathers side
So Ambattha the Khattiyas through a man taking a woman or a woman taking a man are senior to the Brahmins
What do you think Ambattha Take the case of a Brahmin who for some reason has had his head shaved by the Brahmins has been punished with a bag of ashes and banished from the country or the city
Would he receive a seat and water from the Brahmins
No Reverend Gotama
Would they allow him to eat   as a guest
No Reverend Gotama
Would they teach him mantras or not
They would not Reverend Gotama
Would they keep their women covered or uncovered
Covered Reverend Gotama
What do you think Ambattha Take the case of a Khattiya who   had his head shaved by the Khattiyas   and has been banished from the country or the city
Would he receive a seat and water from the Brahmins
He would Reverend Gotama
Would they keep their women covered or uncovered
Uncovered Reverend Gotama
But that Khattiya has so far reached the extreme of humiliation that he has been banished from the country or the city
So even if a Khattiya has suffered extreme humiliation he is superior and the Brahmins inferior
Ambattha this verse was pronounced by Brahma Sanankumara
The Khattiyas best
among those who value clan
He with knowledge and conduct
is best of gods and men
This verse was rightly sung not wrongly rightly spoken not wrongly connected with profit not unconnected
And Ambattha I too say this
The Khattiyas best
aming those who value clan
He with knowledge and conduct
is best of gods and men
End of first recitationsection
 But Reverend Gotama what is this conduct what is this knowledge 
Ambattha it is not from the standpoint of the attainment of unexcelled knowledgeandconduct that reputation based on birth and clan is declared nor on the conceit which says You are worthy of me you are not worthy of me
For wherever there is a giving a taking in marriage there is always this talk and this conceint
But those who are enslaved by such things are far from the attainment of the unexcelled knowledgeandconduct
which is attained by abandoning all such things
 But Reverend Gotama what is this conduct what is this knowledge 
Ambattha a Tathagata arises in this world an Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans enlightened and blessed
He having realised it by his own superknow ledge proclaims this world with its devas maras and Brahmas its princes and people
He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle lovely in its ending in the spirit and in the letter and displays the fully perfected and purified holy life
Thus he develops conduct
And beyond this there is no further development of knowledge and conduct that is higher or more perfect
But Ambattha in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and condact there are four paths of failure 
What are they
In the first place an ascetic or Brahmin who has not managed to gain this unexcelled attainment takes his carryingpole and plunges into the depths of the forest thinking I will live on windfalls
But in this way he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained
This is the first path of failure
Again an ascetic or Brahmin   being unable to live on windfalls takes a spade and basket thinking I will live on tubers and roots
This is the second path of failure
Again an ascetic or Brahmin being unable to live on tubers and roots makes a firehearth at the edge of a village or small town and sits tending the flame
This is the third path of failure
Again an ascetic or Brahmin being unable to tend the flame erects a house with four doors at the crossroads thinking Whatever ascetic or Brahmin arrives from the four quarters I will honour to the best of my strength and ability
But in this way he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct
This is the fourth path of failure
 What do you think Ambattha Do you and your teacher live in accordance with this unexcelled knowledge and conduct
No indeed Reverend Gotama
Who are my teacher and I in comparison
Well then Ambattha could you and your teacher being unable to gain this go with your carryingpoles into the depths of the forest intending to live on windfalls
No indeed Reverend Gotama
Well then Ambattha could you and your teacher being unable to gain this live on tubers and roots
sit tending the flame
No indeed Reverend Gotama
erect a house
 And so Ambattha not only are you and your teacher incapable of attaining this unexcelled knowledge and conduct
but even the four paths of failure are beyond you
And yet you and your teacher the Brahmin Pokkharasati utter these words These shaven little ascetics menials black scrapings from Brahmas foot what converse can they have with Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas   even though you cant even manage the duties of one who has failed
See Ambattha how your teacher has let you down
We are far from it
 Ambattha the Brahmin Pokkharasati lives by the grace and favour of King Pasenadi of Kosala
And yet the King does not allow him to have audience face to face
When he confers with the King it is through a curtain
Why should the King not grant audience face to face to one on whom he has bestowed a proper and blameless source of revenue
See how your teacher has let you down
 What do you think Ambattha Suppose King Pasenadi was sitting on the neck of an elephant or on horseback or was standing on the chariotmat conferring with his ministers and princes about something
And suppose he were to step aside
And suppose he were to step aside and some workman or workmans servant were to come along and stand in his place And standing there he might say This is what King Passenadi of Kosala says
Would he be speaking the Kings words
as if he were the Kings equal
No indeed Reverend Gotama
 Well then Ambattha it is just the same thing Those who were as you say the first sages of the Brahmins the makers and expounders of the mantras whose ancient verses are chanted pronounced and collected by the Brahmins of today  Atthaka Vamaka Vamadeva Vessamitta Yamataggi Angirasa Bharadvaja Vasettha Kassapa Bhagu  whose mantras are said to be passed on to you and your teacher yet you do not thereby become a sage or one practised in the way of a sage  such a thing is not possible
 What do you think Ambattha What have you heard said by Brahmins who are venerable aged the teachers of teachers Those first sages Atthaka Bhagu  did they enjoy themselves wellbathed perfumed their hair and beards trimmed adorned with garlands and wreaths dressed in white clothes indulging in the pleasures of the five senses and addicted to them as you and your teacher do now
No Reverend Gotama
Or did they eat special fine rice with the black spots removed with various soups and curries as you and your teacher do now
No Reverend Gotama
Or did they amuse themselves with women dressed up in flounces and furbelows as you and your teacher do now
No Reverend Gotama
Or did they ride around in chariots drawn by mares with braided tails that they urged on with long goadsticks
No Reverend Gotama
Or did they have themselves guarded in fortified towns with palisades and barricades by men with long swords 
No Reverend Gotama
So Ambattha neither you nor your teacher are a sage or one trained in the way of a sage
And now as for your doubts and perplexities concerning me we will clarify these by your asking me and by my answering your questions
Then descending from his lodging the Lord started to walk up and down
and Ambattha did like wise
And as he walked along with the Lord Ambattha looked out for the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man on the Lords body
And he could see all of them except for two
He was in doubt and perplexity about two of these marks he could not make up his mind or be certain about the sheathed genitals or the large tongue
And the Lord being aware of his doubts
effected by his psychic power that Ambattha could see his sheathed genitals
and then sticking out his tongue he reached out to lick both ears and both nostrils and then covered the whole circle of his forehead with his tongue
Then Ambattha thought The ascetic Gotama is equipped with all the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man complete and with none missing
Then he said to the Lord Reverend Gotama may I go now I have much business much to do
Ambattha do what you now think fit
So Ambattha got back into his chariot drawn by mares and departed
Meanwhile the Brahmin Pokkharasati had gone outside and was sitting in his park with a large number of Brahmins just waiting for Ambattha
Then Ambattha came to the park
He rode in the chariot as far as it would go and then continued on foot to where Pokkharasati was saluted him and sat down to one side
Then Pokkharasati said  Well dear boy did you see the Reverend Gotama
I did sir
And was the Reverend Gotama such as he is reported to be and not otherwise And is he of such nature and not otherwise
Sir he is as he is reported to be and he is of such nature and not otherwise
He is possessed of the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man all complete with none missing
But was there any conversation between you and the ascetic Gotama
There was sir
And what was this conversation about
So Ambattha told Pokkharasati all that had passed between the Lord and himself
At this Pokkharasati exclaimed Well youre a fine little scholar a fine wise man a fine expert in the Three Vedas Anyone going about his business like that ought when he dies at the breakingup of the body to go to the downfall to the evil path to ruin to hell
You have heaped insults on the Reverend Gotama as a result of which he has brought up more and more things against us
Youre a fine little scholar He was so angry and enraged that he kicked Ambattha over
and wanted to start out at once to see the Lord
But the Brahmins said It is far too late sir to go to see the ascetic Gotama today
The Reverend Pokkharasati should go to see him tomorrow
Then Pokkharasati having had fine hard and soft food prepared in his own home set out by the light of torches from Ukkattha for the jungle of Icchanankala
He went by chariot as far as possible then continued on foot to where the Lord was
Having exchanged courtesies with the Lord he sat down to one side and said
Venerable Gotama did not our pupil Ambattha come to see you
He did Brahmin
And was there any conversation between you
There was
And what was this conversation about
Then the Lord told Pokkharasati all that had passed between him and Ambattha
At this Pokkharasati said to the Lord Reverend Gotama Ambattha is a young fool May the Reverend Gotama pardon him
Brahmin may Ambattha be happy
Then Pokkharasati looked out for the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man on the Lords body
and he could see all of them exept for two
the sheathed genitals and the large tongue
but the Lord set his mind at rest about these 
And Pokkharasati said to the Lord May the Reverend Gotama accept a meal from me today together with his order of monks
And the Lord consented by silence
Seeing his acceptance Pokkharasati said to the Lord It is time Reverend Gotama the meal is ready
And the Lord having dressed in the early morning and taken his robe and bowl went with his order of monks to Pokkharasatis residence and sat down on the prepared seat
Then Pokkharasati personally served the Lord with choice hard and soft food and the young men served the monks
And when the Lord had taken his hand from the bowl Pokkharasati sat down to one side on a low stool
And as Pokkharasati sat there the Lord delivered a graduated discourse on generosity on morality and on heaven showing the danger degradation and corruption of sense desires and the profit of renunciation
And when the Lord knew that Pokkharasatis mind was ready pliable free from the hindrances joyful and calm then he preached a sermon on Dhamma in brief on suffering its origin its cessation and the path
And just as a clean cloth from which all stains have been removed receives the dye perfectly so in the Brahmin Pokkharasati as he sat there there arose the pure and spotless Dhammaeye and he knew Whatever things have an origin must come to cessation
And Pokkharasati having seen attained experienced and penetrated the Dhamma having passed beyond doubt transcended uncertainty having gained perfect confidence in the Teachers doctrine without relying on others said Excellent Lord excellent
It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down or to point out the way to one who had got lost or to bring an oillamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways
I go with my son my wife my ministers and counsellors for refuge to the Reverend Gotama to the Dhamma and to the Sangha
May the Reverend Gotama accept me as a lay follower who has taken refuge from this day forth as long as life shall last
And whenever the Reverend Gotama visits other families or layfollowers in Ukkattha may he also visit the family of Pokkharasati
Whatever young men and maidens are there will revere the Reverend Gotama and rise before him will give him a seat and water and will be glad at heart and that will be for their welfare and happiness for a long time
Well said Brahmin
Thus have I heard Once the Lord was travelling among the Angas with a large company of some five hundred monks and he arrived at Campa
At Campa he stayed by Gaggaras lotuspond
At that time the Brahmin Sonadanda was living at Campa a populous place full of grass timber water and com which had been given to him by King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha as a royal gift and with royal powers
And the Brahmins and householders of Campa heard say The ascetic Gotama of the Sakyans who has gone forth from the Sakya clan is travelling among the Angas and is staying by Gaggaras lotuspool
And concerning that Blessed Lord Gotama a good report has been spread about This Blessed Lord is an Arahant a fullyenlightened Buddha perfected in knowledge and conduct a WellFarer Kriower of the worlds unequalled Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans a Buddha a Blessed Lord
He proclaims this world with its gods maras Brahmas the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and people having come to know it by his own knowledge
He teaches a Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending in the spirit and in the letter and he displays the fullyperfected thoroughly purified holy life
And indeed it is good to see such Arahants
Thereupon the Brahmins and householders of Campa leaving Campa in great crowds in vast numbers went to Gaggaras lotuspond
Just then the Brahmin Sonadanda had gone up to his verandah for his midday rest
Seeing all the Brahmins and householders making for Gaggaras lotuspond
he asked his steward the reason
Sir it is the ascetic Gotama of the Sakyans
 
That is why they are going to see him
Well then steward go to the Brahmins and householders of Campa and say to them Please wait gentlemen the Brahmin Sonadanda will come to see the ascetic Gotama
And the steward conveyed this message to the Brahmins and householders of Campa
Now at that time some five hundred Brahmins from various provinces were in Campa on some business
and they heard that Sonadanda intended to visit the ascetic Gotama
So they called upon him and asked if this were true
So it is gentlemen I am going to visit the ascetic Gotama
Sir do not visit the ascetic Gotama
it is not fitting that you should do so
If the Reverend Sonadanda goes to visit the ascetic Gotama his reputation will decrease and that of the ascetic Gotama will increase
This being so it is not right that the Reverend Sonadanda should visit the ascetic Gotama but rather the ascetic Gotama should visit him
The Reverend Sonadanda is wellborn on both the mothers and the fathers side of pure descent to the seventh generation unbroken of irreproachable birth
and therefore he should not call on the ascetic Gotama but rather the ascetic Gotama should call on him
The reverend Sonadanda is possessed of great wealth and resources
The Reverend Sonadanda is a scholar versed in the mantras accomplished in the Three Vedas a skilled expounder of the rules and rituals the lore of sounds and meanings and fifthly oral tradition  an expounder fully versed in natural philosophy and the marks of a Great Man
The Reverend Sonadanda is handsome goodlooking pleasing of the most beautiful complexion in form and countenance like Brahma of no mean appearance
He is virtuous of increasing virtue endowed with increasing virtue
He is wellspoken of pleasing address polite of pure and clear enunciation speaking to the point
He is the teachers teacher of many teaching the mantras to three hundred youths
and many young men come from different districts and regions seeking to learn the mantras in his presence desirous to learn them from him
He is aged grown old venerable advanced in years long past his youth whereas the ascetic Gotama is youthful and newly gone forth as a wanderer
The Reverend Sonadanda is esteemed made much of honoured revered worshipped by King Seniya Bimbisara
and by Brahmin Pokkharasati
He lives at Campa a populous place full of grass timber water and com which has been given to him by King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha as a royal gift and with royal powers
This being so
it is not proper that he should visit the ascetic Gotama but rather the ascetic Gotama should visit him
At this Sonadanda replied
Now listen gentlemen as to why it is fitting for us to visit the Reverend Gotama and why it is not fitting for him to visit us
The ascetic Gotama is wellborn on both sides of pure descent to the seventh generation unbroken of it reproachable birth
   Therefore it is fitting for us to visit him
He went forth leaving a great body of kinsmen
In fact he gave up much gold and wealth to go forth both hidden away and openly displayed
The ascetic Gotama while youthful a blackhaired youth in the prime of his young days in the first stage of life went forth from the household life into homelessness
Leaving his grieving parents weeping with tearstained faces having cut off his hair and beard and put on yellow robes he went forth into homelessness
He is handsome
  virtuous
   wellspoken
   the teachers teacher of many
He has abandoned sensuality and dispelled vanity
He teaches action and the results of action honouring the blameless Brahmin way of life
He is a wanderer of high birth of a leading Khattiya family
He is a wanderer from a wealthy family of great wealth and possessions
People come to consult him from foreign kingdoms and foreign lands
Many thousands of devas have taken refuge with him
This good report has been spread about him This Blessed Lord is an Arahant a fullyenlightened Buddha perfected in knowledge and conduct 
He bears the thirty two marks of a Great Man
He is welcoming kindly of speech courteous genial clear and ready of speech
He is attended by four assemblies revered honoured esteemed and worshipped by them
Many devas and humans are devoted to him
Whenever he stays in any town or village that place is not troubled by nonhuman beings
He has a crowd a multitude of followers is a teacher of many he is consulted by the chief of the various leaders of sects
It is not the way with the ascetic Gotamas reputation as it is with that of some ascetics and Brahmins about whom this or that is reported 
the ascetic Gotamas fame is based on his achievment of unsurpassed wisdom and conduct
Indeed King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha has gone for refuge to him together with his son his wife his followers and his ministers
So have King Pasenadi of Kosala
and the Brahmin Pokkharasati
He is revered honoured esteemed and worshipped by them
The ascetic Gotama has arrived in Campa and is staying by Gaggaras lotuspond
And whatever ascetics and Brahmins come to our territory are our guests
And we should revere honour esteem and worship guests
Having come to Gaggaras lotuspond the ascetic Gotama is such a guest and should be treated as such
Therefore it is not proper that he should come to us
but rather we should go to him
However much I might praise the ascetic Gotama that praise is insufficient
he is beyond all praise
On hearing this the Brahmins said to Sonadanda Sir since you praise the ascetic Gotama so much then even if he were to live a hundred yojanas from here it would be fitting for a believing clansman to go with a shoulderbag to visit him
And so sir we shall all go to visit the ascetic Gotama
And so Sonadaijda went with a large company of Brahmins to Gaggaras lotuspond
But when Sonadanda had traversed the junglethickets he thought If I ask the ascetic Gotama a question he might say to me That Brahmin is not a fitting question it is not at all a fitting question and then the company might despise me saying Sonadanda is a fool he has no sense he cant put a proper question to the ascetic Gotama
And if anyone were despised by this company his reputation would suffer
and then his income would suffer
for our income depends on the gaining of a reputation
Or if the ascetic Gotama were to ask me a question my answer might not satisfy him and he might say That is not the right way to answer this question And then the companymight despise me
And if having come into the presence of the ascetic Gotama I were to turn away without showing myself this company might despise me
Then Sonadanda approached the Lord exchanged courtesies with him
and sat down to one side
Some of the Brahmins and householders made obeisance to the Lord some exchanged courtesies with him some saluted him with joined palms some announced their name and clan and some sat down to one side in silence
So Sonadanda took his seat with many thoughts going through his mind If I ask the ascetic Gotama a question he might say to me That Brahmin is not a fitting question
If only the ascetic Gotama would ask me a question from my own field of the Three Vedas Then I could give him an answer that would satisfy him
And the Lord reading his mind thought This Sonadanda is worried
Suppose I were to ask him a question from his own field as a teacher of the Three Vedas
So he said to Sonadanda By how many qualities do Brahmins recognise a Brahmin How would one declare truthfully and without falling into falsehood I am a Brahmin
Then Sonadanda thought Now what I wanted hoped for desired and longed for has happened
  Now I can give him an answer that will satisfy him
Straightening up and looking round the assembly he said Reverend Gotama there are five such qualities
What are they
A Brahmin is wellborn on both the mothers and the fathers side of pure descent to the seventh generation he is a scholar versed in the mantras he is handsome pleasing he is virtuous he is learned and wise and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle
These are the five qualities of a true Brahmin
But if one of these five qualities were omitted could not one be recognised as a true Brahmin being possessed of four of these qualities
It is possible Gotama
We could leave out appearance
for what does that matter
If a Brahmin had the other four qualities he could be recognised as a true Brahmin
But could not one of these four qualities be omitted leaving three whereby one could be recognised as a true Brahmin
It is possible Gotama
We could leave out the mantras
for what do they matter
If he had the other three qualities he could be recognised as a true Brahmin
But could not one of these three qualities be omitted  
It is possible Gotama
We could leave out birth
for what does that matter
If a Brahmin is virtuous of increasing virtue  and if he is learned and wise and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle 
then he can be recognised as a true Brahmin and truthfully claim to be so
At this the Brahmins said to Sonadanda Dont say that Sonadanda dont say it
The Reverend Sonadanda is decrying appearance the mantras and birth
he is actually adopting the ascetic Gotamas own words
Then the Lord said to the Brahmins If you think the Brahmin Sonadanda is not concentrating on his task is using wrong words is lacking in wisdom and is not fit to converse with the ascetic Gotama then let him cease and you talk to me
But if you think he is learned speaks properly is wise and fit to converse with the ascetic Gotama then you cease and let him speak
Then Sonadanda said to the Lord Let that be Reverend Gotama and be silent I will answer in this matter
To the Brahmins he said Do not say the Reverend Sonadanda is decrying appearance
and adopting the ascetic Gotamas own words
I do not decry appearance mantras or birth
Now at that time Sonadandas nephew a young man called Angaka was sitting in the assembly
and Sonadanda said Gentlemen do you see my nephew Agaka
 Yes sir
Angaka is handsome goodlooking pleasing of supremely fair complexion in form and countenance like Brahma of no mean appearance and there is none in this assembly his equal except the ascetic Gotama
He is a scholar 
I was his mantrateacher
He is wellborn on both sides 
I know his parents
But if Angaka were to take life take what is not given commit adultery tell lies and drink strong drink  what would good looks or mantras or birth profit him
But it is because a Brahmin is virtuous because he is wise
on account of these two points that he can truthfully daclare I am a Brahmin
But Brahmin if one were to omit one of these two points could one truthfully declare I am a Brahmin
No Gotama
For wisdom is purified by morality and morality is purified by wisdom
where one is the other is
the moral man has wisdom and the wise man has morality
and the combination of morality and wisdom is called the highest thing in the world
Just as one hand washes the other or one foot the other so wisdom is purified by morality and this combination is called the highest thing in the world
So it is Brahmin Wisdom is purified by morality and morality is purified by wisdom
where one is the other is
the moral man has wisdom and the wise man has morality
and the combination of morality and wisdom is called the highest thing in the world
But Brahmin what is this morality
and what is this wisdom
We only know this much Gotama
It would be well if the Reverend Gotama were to explain the meaning of this
Then listen Brahmin pay proper attention and I will tell you
Yes sir said Sonadanda in reply
and the Lord said Brahmin a Tathagata arises in this world an Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans enlightened and blessed He having realised it by his own superknowledge proclaims this world with its devas maras and Brahmas its princes and people He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle lovely in its ending in the spirit and in the letter and displays the fully perfected and purified holy life A disciple goes forth and practises the moralities  he guards the sense doors etc 
That Brahmin is morality He attains the four jhanas  he attains various insights  and the cessation of the corruptions  Thus he develops wisdom
That Brahmin is wisdom
At these words Sonsdsnds said Excellent Lord excellent
It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down or to point out the way to one who had got lost or to bring an oillamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways
And I go for refuge to the Blessed Lord Gotama to the Dhamma and to the Sangha
May the Reverend Gotama accept me from this day forth as a layfollower as long as life shall last
And may the Reverend Gotama and his order of monks accept a meal from me tomorrow
The Lord assented by silence
Then Sonadanda seeing his assent rose saluted the Lord passed by to his right and departed
As day was breaking he caused hard and soft food to be prepared in his own home and when it was ready he announced Reverend Gotama it is time the meal is ready
And the Lord having risen early went with robe and bowl and attended by his monks to Sonadandas residence and sat down on the prepared seat
And Sonadanda served the Buddha and his monks with the finest foods with his own hands until they were satisfied
And when the Lord had eaten and taken his hand away from the bowl Sonadanda took a low stool and sat down to one side
Then he said to the Lord  Reverend Gotama if when I have gone into the assembly I were to rise and salute the Lord the company would despise me
In that case my reputation would suffer
and if a mans reputation suffers his income suffers
So if on entering the assembly I should join my palms in greeting may the Reverend Gotama take it as if I had risen from my seat
And if on entering the assembly I should take off my turban may you take it as if I had bowed at your feet
Or if when riding in my carriage I were to alight to salute the Lord the company would despise me
 
So if when I am riding in my carriage I raise my goad may you take it as if I had alighted from my carriage
and if I lower my hand may you take it as if I had bowed my head at your feet
Then the Lord having instructed Sonadanda with a talk on Dhamma inspired him fired him with enthusiasm and delighted him rose from his seat and departed
Thus have I heard Once the Lord was travelling through Magadha with a large company of some five hundred monks and he arrived at a Brahmin village called Khanumata
And there he stayed at the Ambalatthika park
Now at that time the Brahmin Kutadanta was living at Khanumata a populous place full of grass timber water and com which had been given to him by King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha as a royal gift and with royal powers
And Kutadanta planned a great sacrifice
seven hundred bulls seven hundred bullocks seven hundred heifers seven hundred hegoats and seven hundred rams were all tied up to the sacrificial posts
And the Brahmins and householders of Khanumata heard say The ascetic Gotama is staying at Ambalatthika
And concerning that Blessed Lord Gotama a good report has been spread about This Blessed Lord is an Arahant a fully enlightened Buddha perfected in knowledge and conduct a WellFarer Knower of the worlds unequalled Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans a Buddha a Blessed Lord
He proclaims this world with its gods maras and Brahmas the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and people having come to know it by his own knowledge
He teaches a Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending in the spirit and in the letter and he displays the fullyperfected thoroughly purified holy life
And indeed it is good to see such Arahants
And at that the Brahmins and householders leaving Khanumata in great numbers went to Ambalatthika
Just then Kutadanta had gone up to his verandah for his midday rest
Seeing all the Brahmins and householders making for Ambalatthika
he asked his steward the reason
The steward replied Sir it is the ascetic Gotama
concerning whom a good report has been spread about This Blessed Lord is an Arahant  a Buddha a Blessed Lord
That is why they are going to see him
Then Kutadanta thought I have heard that the ascetic Gotama understands how to conduct successfully the triple sacrifice with its sixteen requisites
Now I do not understand all this
but I want to make a big sacrifice
Suppose I were to go to the ascetic Gotama and ask him about the matter
So he sent his steward to the Brahmins and householders of Khanumata
to ask them to wait for him
And at that time several hundred Brahmins were staying at Khanumata intending to take part in Kutadantas sacrifice
Hearing of his intention to visit the ascetic Gotama
they went
and asked him if this were true
So it is gentlemen I am going to visit the ascetic Gotama
Sir do not visit the ascetic Gotama
This being so it is not proper that the Reverend Kutadanta should visit the ascetic Gotama
but rather the ascetic Gotama should visit him
Then Kutadanta said to the Brahmins
Now listen gentlemen as to why it is fitting for us to visit the Reverend Gotama and why it is not fitting for him to visit us
The ascetic Gotama has arrived in Khanumata and is staying at Ambalatthika
And whatever ascetics or Brahmins come to our territory are our guests
He is beyond all praise
On hearing this the Brahmins said Sir since you praise the ascetic Gotama so much then even if he were to live a hundred yojanas from here it would be fitting for a believing clansman to go with a shoulderbag to visit him
And sir we shall all go to visit the ascetic Gotama
And so Kutadanta went with a large company of Brahmins to Ambalatthika
He approached the Lord exchanged courtesies with him and sat down to one side
Some of the Brahmins and householders of Khanumata made obeisance to the Lord some exchanged courtesies with him some saluted him with joined palms some announced their name and clan and some sat down to one side in silence
Sitting to one side Kutadanta addressed the Lord Reverend Gotama I have heard that you understand how to conduct successfully the triple sacrifice with its sixteen requisites
Now I do not understand all this
but I want to make a big sacrifice
It would be well if the ascetic Gotama were to explain this to me
Then listen Brahmin pay proper attention and I will explain
Yes sir said Kutadanta
and the Lord said  Brahmin once upon a time there was a king called Mahavijita  He was rich of great wealth and resources with an abundance of gold and silver of possessions and requisites of money and moneys worth with a full treasury and granary
And when King Mahavijita was musing in private the thought came to him I have acquired extensive wealth in human terms I occupy a wide extent of land which I have conquered Suppose now I were to make a great sacrifice which would be to my benefit and happiness for a long time
And calling his ministerchaplain he told him his thought
I want to make a big sacrifice
Instruct me Reverend Sir how this may be to my lasting benefit and happiness
The chaplain replied Your Majestys country is beset by thieves it is ravaged villages and towns are being destroyed the countryside is infested with brigands
If Your Majesty were to tax this region that would be the wrong thing to do
Suppose Your Majesty were to think I will get rid of this plague of robbers by executions and imprisonment or by confiscation threats and banishment the plague would not be properly ended
Those who survived would later harm Your Majestys realm
However with this plan you can completely eliminate the plague
To those in the kingdom who are engaged in cultivating crops and raising cattle let Your Majesty distribute grain and fodder
to those in trade give capital
to those in goverment service assign proper living wages
Then those people being intent on their own occupations will not harm the kingdom Your Majestys revenues will be great
the land will be tranquil and not beset by thieves
and the people with joy in their hearts will play with their children and will dwell in open houses
And saying So be it the king accepted the chaplains advice he gave grain and fodder
capital to those in trade
propper living wages
and the people with joy in their hearts dwell in open houses
Then King Mahavijita sent for the chaplain and said I have got rid of the plague of robbers following your plan my revenue has grown
the land is tranquil and not beset by thieves and the people with joy in their hearts play with their children and dwell in open houses
Now I wish to make a great sacrifice
Instruct me as to how this may be done to my lasting benefit and happiness
For this Sire you should send for your Khattiyas from town and country
your advisers and counsellors the most influential Brahmins and the wealthy householders of your realm and say to them I wish to make a great sacrifice Assist me in this gentlemen that it may be to my lasting benefit and happiness
The King agreed and did so
Sire let the sacrifice begin now is the time Your Majesty
These four assenting groups will be the accessories for the sacrifice
King Mahavijita is endowed with eight things He is wellborn on both sides of irreproachable birth He is handsome of no mean appearance He is rich   with a full treasury and granary He is powerful having a fourbranched army that is loyal dependable making bright his reputation among his enemies He is a faithful giver and host not shutting his door against ascetics Brahmins and wayfarers beggars and the needy  a fountain of goodness He is very learned in what should be learnt He knows the meaning of whatever is said saying This is what that means He is a scholar accomplished wise competent to perceive advantage in the past the future or the present
King Mahavijita is endowed with these eight things
These constitute the accessories for the sacrifice
The Brahmin chaplain is endowed with four things
He is wellborn   He is a scholar versed in the mantras  He is virtuous of increasing virtue endowed with increasing virtue He is learned accomplished and wise and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle
He has these four qualities
These constitute the accessories to the sacrifice
Then prior to the sacrifice the Brahmin chaplain taught the King the three modes
It might be that Your Majesty might have some regrets about the intended sacrifice I am going to lose a lot of wealth
or during the sacrifice I am losing a lot of wealf
or after the sacrifice I have lost a lot of wealth In such cases Your Majesty should not entertain such regrets
Then prior to the sacrifice the chaplain dispelled the Kings qualms with ten conditions for the recipient
Sire there will come to the sacrifice those who take life and those who abstain from taking life
To those who take life so will be to them
but those who abstain from taking life will have a successful sacrifice and will rejoice in it and their hearts may be calmed within
There will come those who take what is not given and those who refrain those who indulge in sexual misconduct and those who refrain those who tell lies indulge in calumny harsh and frivolous speech those who are covetous and those who are not those who harbour illwill and those who do not those who have wrong views and those who have right views
To those who have wrong views it will turn out accordingly
but those who have right views will have a successful sacrifice and will rejoice in it and their hearts may be calmed within
So the chaplain dispelled the Kings doubts with ten conditions
So the chaplain instructed the King who was making the great sacrifice with sixteen reasons urged him inspired him and gladdened his heart Someone might say King Mahavijita is making a great sacrifice but he has not invited his Khattiyas
his advisers and counsellors the most influential Brahmins and wealthy housholders
But such words would not be in accordance with the truth
since the King has invited them
Thus the King may know that he will have a successful sacrifice and rejoice in it and his heart will be calmed within
Or someone might say King Mahavijita is making a great sacrifice but he is not wellborn on both sides 
But such words would not be in accordance with the truth
Or someone might say His chaplain is not wellborn
But such words would not be in accordance with the truth
Thus the chaplain instructed the King with sixteen reasons
In this sacrifice Brahmin no bulls were slain no goats or sheep no cocks and pigs nor were various living beings subjected to slaughter nor were trees cut down for sacrificial posts nor were grasses mown for the sacrificial grass
and those who are called slaves or servants or workmen did not perform their tasks for fear of blows or threats weeping and in tears
But those who wanted to do something did it those who did not wish to did not they did what they wanted to do and not what they did not want to do
The sacrifice was carried out with ghee oil butter curds honey and molasses
Then Brahmin the Khattiyas the ministers and counsellors the influential Brahmins the wealthy householders of town and country having received a sufficient income came to King Mahavijita and said We have brought sufficient wealth Your Majesty please accept it
But gentlemen I have collected together sufficient wealth Whatever is left over you take away
At the Kings refusal they went away to one side and consulted together It is not right for us to take this wealth back to our own homes
The King is making a great sacrifice Let us follow his example
Then the JKhattiyas put their gifts to the east of the sacrificial pit
the advisers and counsellors set out theirs to the south
the Brahmins to the west
and the wealthy housholders to the north
And in this sacrifice no bulls were slain nor were living beings subjected to slaughter
Those who wanted to do something did it those who did not wish to did not
The sacrifice was carried out with ghee oil butter curds honey and molasses
Thus there were the four assenting groups and King Mahavijita was endowed with eight things and the chaplain with four things in three modes This Brahmin is called the sixteenfold successful sacrifice in three modes
At this the Brahmins shouted loudly and noisily What a splendid sacrifice What a splertdid way to perform a sacrifice
But Kutadanta sat in silence
And the Brahmins asked him why he did not applaud the ascetic Gotamas fine words
He replied It is not that I do not applaud them
My head would split open if I did not
But it strikes me that the ascetic Gotama does not say I have heard this or It must have been like this but he says It was like this or like that at the time
And so gentlemen it seems to me that the ascetic Gotama must have been at that time either King Mahavijita the lord of the sacrifice or else the Brahmin chaplain who conducted the sacrifice for him
Does the Reverend Gotama acknowledge that he performed or caused to be performed such a sacrifice and that in consequence at death after the breakingup of the body he was reborn in a good sphere a heavenly state
 I do Brahmin I was the Brahmin chaplain who conducted that sacrifice
And Reverend Gotama is there any other sacrifice that is simpler less difficult more fruitful and profitable than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen attributes
 There is Brahmin
What is it Reverend Gotama
 Wherever regular family gifts are given to virtuous ascetics these constitute a sacrifice more fruitful and profitable than that
Why Reverend Gotama and for what reason is this better 
Brahmin no Arahants or those who have attained the Arahant path will attend such a sacrifice
Why
Because there they see beatings and throttlings so they do not attend
But they will attend the sacrifice at which regular family gifts are given to virtuous ascetics
because there there are no beatings or throttlings
That is why this kind of sacrifice is more fruitful and profitable
But Reverend Gotama is there any other sacrifice that is more profitable than either of these
 There is Brahmin
What is it Reverend Gotama
 Brahmin if anyone provides shelter for the Sangha coming from the four quarters that constitutes a more profitable sacrifice
But Reverend Gotama is there any sacrifice that is more profitable than these three
 There is Brahmin
What is it Reverend Gotama
 Brahmin if anyone with a pure heart goes for refuge to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha that constitutes a sacrifice more profitable than any of these three
But Reverend Gotama is there any sacrifice that is more profitable than these four
 There is Brahmin
What is it Reverend Gotama
 Brahmin if anyone with a pure heart undertakes the precepts  to refrain from taking life from taking what is not given from sexual immorality from lying speech and from taking strong drink and sloth producing drugs 
that constitutes a sacrifice more profitable than any of these four
But Reverend Gotama is there any sacrifice that is more profitable than these five
 There is Brahmin
What is it Reverend Gotama
 Brahmin a Tathagata arises in this world an Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans enlightened and blessed
Thus a monk is perfected in morality He attains the four jhanas 
That Brahmin is a sacrifice    more profitable
He attains various insights  and the cessation of the corruptions  He knows There is nothing further in this world
That Brahmin is a sacrifice that is simpler less difficult more fruitful and more profitable than all the others
And beyond this there is no sacrifice that is greater and more perfect
Excellent Reverend Gotama excellent
may the Reverend Gotama accept me as a layfollower from this day forth as long as life shall last
And Reverend Gotama I set free the seven hundred bulls seven hundred bullocks seven hundred heifers seven hundred hegoats and seven hundred rams I grant them life let them be fed with green grass and given cool water to drink and let cool breezes play upon them 
Then the Lord delivered a graduated discourse to Kutadanta on generosity on morality and on heaven showing the danger degradation and corruption of sensedesires and the profit of renunciation
And when the Lord knew that Kutadantas mind was ready pliable free from the hindrances joyful and calm then he preached a sermon on Dhamma in brief on suffering its origin its cessation and the path
And just as a clean doth from which all stains have been removed receives the dye perfectly so in the Brahmin Kutadanta as he sat there there arose the pure and spotless Dhammaeye and he knew Whatever things have an origin must come to cessation
Then Kutadanta having seen attained experienced and penetrated the Dhamma having passed beyond doubt transcended uncertainty having gained perfect confidence in the Teachers doctrine without relying on others said May the Reverend Gotama and his order of monks accept a meal from me tomorrow
The Lord assented by silence
Then Kutadanta seeing his consent rose saluted the Lord passed by to his right and departed
As day was breaking he caused hard and soft food to be prepared at his place of sacrifice and when it was ready he announced Reverend Gotama it is time the meal is ready
And the Lord having risen early went with robe and bowl and attended by his monks to Kutadantas place of sacrifice and sat down on the prepared seat
And Kutadanta served the Buddha and his monks with the finest foods with his own hands until they were satisfied
And when the Lord had eaten and taken his hand away from the bowl Kutadanta took a low stool and sat down to one side
Then the Lord having instructed Kutadanta with a talk on Dhamma inspired him fired him with enthusiasm and delighted him rose from his seat and departed
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now on that occasion Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer together with a large following of about  wanderers had taken up residence in the debating hall near the Tiṇḍuka tree in the singlepavilion park of Queen Mallikā
Then the Blessed One early in the morninghaving adjusted his lower robe and taking his bowl  outer robeentered Sāvatthī for alms
Then the thought occurred to him While its still too early to go into Sāvatthī for alms
why dont I go to the debating hall near the Tiṇḍuka tree in the singlepavilion park of Queen Mallikā to see Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer
So he went to the debating hall near the Tiṇḍuka tree in the singlepavilion park of Queen Mallikā
Now on that occasion Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer was sitting with his large following of wanderers all making a great noise  racket discussing many kinds of bestial topics of conversation
conversation about kings robbers  ministers of state armies alarms  battles food  drink clothing furniture garlands  scents relatives vehicles villages towns cities the countryside women  heroes the gossip of the street  the well tales of the dead tales of diversity the creation of the world  of the sea talk of whether things exist or not
Then Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer saw the Blessed One coming from afar and on seeing him hushed his following Be quiet good sirs Dont make any noise
Here comes the contemplative Gotama
He is fond of quietude and speaks in praise of quietude
Maybe if he perceives our group as quiet he will consider it worth his while to come our way
So the wanderers fell silent
Then the Blessed One went to Poṭṭhapāda
and Poṭṭhapāda said to him Come Blessed One
Welcome Blessed One
Its been a long time since the Blessed One has gone out of his way to come here
Sit down Blessed One This seat has been prepared
So the Blessed One sat on the prepared seat
Poṭṭhapāda taking a lower seat sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him For what topic of conversation are you gathered together here In the midst of what topic of conversation have you been interrupted
When this was said Poṭṭhapāda replied Never mind lord about the topic of conversation for which we have gathered here
It wont be difficult for the Blessed One to hear about that later
For the past few days a discussion has arisen among the many sects of contemplatives  brahmans gathered and sitting together in the debating hall concerning the ultimate cessation of perception How is there the ultimate cessation of perception
With regard to this some said A persons perception arises and ceases without cause without reason
When it arises one is percipient
When it ceases one is not percipient
Thats how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception
Then someone else said No thats not how it is
Perception is a persons self
which comes and goes
When it comes one is percipient
When it goes one is not percipient
Thats how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception
Then someone else said No thats not how it is
for there are contemplatives  brahmans of great power great potency
They draw perception in and out of a person
When they draw it in one is percipient
When they draw it out one is not percipient
Thats how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception
Then someone else said No thats not how it is
for there are devas of great power great potency
They draw perception in and out of a person
When they draw it in one is percipient
When they draw it out one is not percipient
Thats how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception
Then the memory of the Blessed One arose within me Ah the Blessed One Ah the One WellGonewho surely is wellskilled in these matters
The Blessed One is skilled and expert in the ultimate cessation of perception
So what lord is the ultimate cessation of perception
In this regard Poṭṭhapāda those contemplatives  brahmans who say that a persons perception arises  ceases without cause without reason are wrong from the very start
Why is that
Because a persons perception arises  ceases with a cause with a reason
With training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases
And what is that training
There is the case where a Tathāgata appears in the world worthy and rightly selfawakened as in DN  
This is how a monk is consummate in virtue Seeing that these five hindrances have been abandoned within him he becomes glad Glad he becomes enraptured Enraptured his body grows tranquil His body tranquil he is sensitive to pleasure Feeling pleasure his mind becomes concentrated
Quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities the monk enters  remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
His earlier perception of sensuality ceases
and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of seclusion On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of seclusion
And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases
Then with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations the monk enters  remains in the second jhāna rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluationinternal assurance
His earlier perception of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of seclusion ceases
and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of concentration On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of concentration
And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases
And further with the fading of rapture the monk remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body He enters  remains in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding
His earlier perception of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of concentration ceases
and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of equanimity On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of equanimity
And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases
And further with the abandoning of pleasure  painas with the earlier disappearance of elation  distressthe monk enters  remains in the fourth jhāna purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
His earlier perception of a refined truth of equanimity ceases
and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of neither pleasure nor pain On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of neither pleasure nor pain
And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases
And further with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of multiplicity Infinite space the monk enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space
His earlier perception of a refined truth of neither pleasure nor pain ceases
and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space
And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases
And further with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space Infinite consciousness the monk enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
His earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space ceases
and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases
And further with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness There is nothing enters  remains in the dimension of nothingness
His earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness ceases
and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of nothingness On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of nothingness
And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases
Now when the monk is percipient of himself here then from there to there step by step he touches the peak of perception
As he remains at the peak of perception the thought occurs to him Thinking is bad for me Not thinking is better for me
If I were to think and will this perception of mine would cease and a grosser perception would appear What if I were neither to think nor to will
So he neither thinks nor wills and as he is neither thinking nor willing
that perception ceases and another grosser perception does not appear
He touches cessation
This Poṭṭhapāda is how there is the alert stepby step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception
Now what do you think Poṭṭhapāda Have you ever before heard of such an alert stepby step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception
No lord
And here is how I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One When the monk is percipient of himself here then from there to there step by step he touches the peak of perception As he remains at the peak of perception the thought occurs to him Thinking is bad for me Not thinking is better for me
If I were to think and will this perception of mine would cease and a grosser perception would appear What if I were neither to think nor to will
So he neither thinks nor wills and as he is neither thinking nor willing that perception ceases and another grosser perception does not appear
He touches cessation
This Poṭṭhapāda is how there is the alert stepby step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception
Thats right Poṭṭhapāda
But lord does the Blessed One describe one peak of perception or many peaks of perception
Poṭṭhapāda I describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perception
And how does the Blessed One describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perception
In whatever way one touches cessation Poṭṭhapāda thats the way I describe the peak of perception
Thats how I describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perception
Now lord does perception arise first and knowledge after or does knowledge arise first and perception after or do perception  knowledge arise simultaneously
Poṭṭhapāda perception arises first and knowledge after And the arising of knowledge comes from the arising of perception
One discerns Its in dependence on this that my knowledge has arisen
Through this line of reasoning one can realize how perception arises first and knowledge after and how the arising of knowledge comes from the arising of perception
Now lord is perception a persons self or is perception one thing and self another
What self do you posit Poṭṭhapāda
I posit a gross self possessed of form made up of the four great elements earth water fire and wind feeding on physical food
Then Poṭṭhapāda your self would be gross possessed of form made up of the four great elements feeding on physical food
That being the case then for you perception would be one thing and self another
And its through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another
even as there remains this gross selfpossessed of form made up of the four great elements and feeding on foodone perception arises for that person as another perception passes away
Its through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another
Then lord I posit a mindmade self complete in all its parts not inferior in its faculties
Then Poṭṭhapāda your self would be mindmade complete in all its parts not inferior in its faculties That being the case then for you perception would be one thing and self another
And its through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another
even as there remains this mindmade selfcomplete in all its parts not inferior in its facultiesone perception arises for that person as another perception passes away
Its through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another
Then lord I posit a formless self made of perception
Then Poṭṭhapāda your self would be formless and made of perception That being the case then for you perception would be one thing and self another
And its through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another
even as there remains this formless self made of perception one perception arises for that person as another perception passes away
Its through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another
Is it possible for me to know lord whether perception is a persons self or if perception is one thing and self another
Poṭṭhapādahaving other views other practices other satisfactions other aims other teachersits hard for you to know whether perception is a persons self or if perception is one thing and self another
Well then lord ifhaving other views other practices other satisfactions other aims other teachersits hard for me to know whether perception is a persons self or if perception is one thing and self another then is it the case that the cosmos is eternal that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless
Poṭṭhapāda I havent expounded that the cosmos is eternal that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless
Then is it the case that the cosmos is not eternal that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless
Poṭṭhapāda I havent expounded that the cosmos is not eternal that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless
Then is it the case that the cosmos is finite the cosmos is infinite the soul  the body are the same the soul is one thing and the body another after death a Tathāgata exists after death a Tathāgata does not exist after death a Tathāgata both exists  does not exist after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless
Poṭṭhapāda I havent expounded that after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless
But why hasnt the Blessed One expounded these things
Because they are not conducive to the goal are not conducive to the Dhamma are not basic to the holy life They dont lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to selfawakening to unbinding Thats why I havent expounded them
And what has the Blessed One expounded
I have expounded that This is stress 
This is the origination of stress 
This is the cessation of stress 
This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress
And why has the Blessed One expounded these things
Because they are conducive to the goal conducive to the Dhamma and basic to the holy life They lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to selfawakening to unbinding Thats why I have expounded them
So it is Blessed One So it is O One WellGone
Well now its time for the Blessed One to do as he sees fit
Then the Blessed One got up from his seat and left
Not long after he had left the wanderers with sneering words jeered at Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer from all sides So whatever the contemplative Gotama says Sir Poṭṭhapāda rejoices in his every word So it is Blessed One So it is O One WellGone
But we dont understand the contemplative Gotama as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is eternal or the cosmos is not eternal or whether after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist
When this was said Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer replied to the wanderers I too dont understand the contemplative Gotama as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is eternal or the cosmos is not eternal or whether after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist But the contemplative Gotama describes a genuine authentic and accurate practice grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the Dhamma
And when a genuine authentic and accurate practice grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the Dhamma is being explained why shouldnt a knowledgeable person such as myself rejoice in the wellspokenness of the contemplative Gotamas wellspoken words
Then two or three days later Citta the elephant trainers son and Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer went to the Blessed One On their arrival Citta bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side
while Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer greeted the Blessed One courteously
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One The other day not long after the Blessed One had left the wanderers with sneering words jeered at me from all sides So whatever the contemplative Gotama says Sir Poṭṭhapāda rejoices in his every word So it is Blessed One So it is O One WellGone
But we dont understand the contemplative Gotama as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is eternal or the cosmos is not eternal or  whether after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist
When this was said I replied to the wanderers I too dont understand the contemplative Gotama as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is eternal or the cosmos is not eternal or whether after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist But the contemplative Gotama describes a genuine authentic and accurate practice grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the Dhamma
And when a genuine authentic and accurate practice grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the Dhamma is being explained why shouldnt a knowledgeable person such as myself rejoice in the wellspokenness of the contemplative Gotamas wellspoken words
The Buddha Poṭṭhapāda all those wanderers are blind and have no eyes You alone among them have eyes
I have taught and declared some teachings to be categorical and some teachings to be not categorical
And what are the teachings that I have taught and declared to be not categorical
 The cosmos is eternal I have taught and declared to be a not categorical teaching The cosmos is not eternal  The cosmos is finite  The cosmos is infinite  The soul  the body are the same  The soul is one thing and the body another  After death a Tathāgata exists  After death a Tathāgata does not exist  After death a Tathāgata both exists  does not exist  After death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist I have taught and declared to be a not categorical teaching
And why have I taught and declared these teachings to be not categorical
Because they are not conducive to the goal are not conducive to the Dhamma are not basic to the holy life They dont lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to unbinding
Thats why I have taught and declared them to be not categorical
And what have I taught and declared to be categorical teachings
 This is stress I have taught and declared to be a categorical teaching
 This is the origination of stress 
This is the cessation of stress 
This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress I have taught and declared to be a categorical teaching
And why have I taught and declared these teachings to be categorical
Because they are conducive to the goal conducive to the Dhamma and basic to the holy life They lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to unbinding
Thats why I have taught and declared them to be categorical
There are some contemplatives  brahmans with a doctrine  view like this After death the self is exclusively happy and free from disease
I approached them and asked them Is it true that you have a doctrine  view like this After death the self is exclusively happy and free from disease
When asked this they replied Yes
So I asked them But do you dwell having known or seen an exclusively happy world
When asked this they said No
So I asked them But have you ever been aware of a self exclusively happy for a day or a night or for half a day or half a night
When asked this they said No
So I asked them But do you know that This is the path this is the practice for the realization of an exclusively happy world
When asked this they said No
So I asked them But have you heard the voices of devas reborn in an exclusively happy world saying Practice well my dears Practice straightforwardly my dears for the realization of an exclusively happy world because it was through such a practice that we ourselves have been reborn in an exclusively happy world
When asked this they said No
So what do you think Poṭṭhapāda When this is the case dont the words of those contemplatives  brahmans turn out to be unconvincing
Yes lord When this is the case the words of those contemplatives  brahmans turn out to be unconvincing
Poṭṭhapāda its as if a man were to say Im in love with the most beautiful woman in this country
and other people were to say to him Well my good man this most beautiful woman in this country with whom you are in love do you know if shes of the warrior caste the brahman caste the merchant caste or the laborer caste
and when asked this he would say No
Then they would say to him Well then do you know her name or clan name Whether shes tall short or of medium height Whether shes dark fair or ruddyskinned Do you know what village or town or city shes from
When asked this he would say No
Then they would say to him So youve never known or seen the woman youre in love with
When asked this he would say Yes
So what do you think Poṭṭhapāda When this is the case dont the words of that man turn out to be unconvincing
Yes lord
In the same way there are some contemplatives  brahmans with a doctrine  view like this After death the self is exclusively happy and free from disease 
Dont the words of those contemplatives  brahmans turn out to be unconvincing
Yes lord
Poṭṭhapāda its as if a man at a crossroads were to build a staircase for ascending to a palace
and other people were to say to him Well my good man this palace for which you are building a staircase Do you know whether its east west north or south of here Whether its high low or in between
and when asked this he would say No
Then they would say to him So you dont know or see the palace for which you are building a staircase
When asked this he would say Yes
So what do you think Poṭṭhapāda When this is the case dont the words of that man turn out to be unconvincing
Yes lord
In the same way there are some contemplatives  brahmans with a doctrine  view like this After death the self is exclusively happy and free from disease 
Dont the words of those contemplatives  brahmans turn out to be unconvincing
Yes lord When this is the case the words of those contemplatives  brahmans turn out to be unconvincing
Poṭṭhapāda there are these three appropriations of a self the gross appropriation of a self the mindmade appropriation of a self and the formless appropriation of a self
And what is the gross appropriation of a self
Possessed of form made up of the four great elements feeding on physical food this is the gross appropriation of a self
And what is the mindmade appropriation of a self
Possessed of form mindmade complete in all its parts not inferior in its faculties this is the mindmade appropriation of a self
And what is the formless appropriation of a self
Formless and made of perception this is the formless appropriation of a self
I teach the Dhamma for the abandoning of the gross appropriation of a self such that when you practice it defiling mental qualities will be abandoned bright mental qualities will grow and you will enter  remain in the culmination  abundance of discernment having known  realized it for yourself in the here  now
If the thought should occur to you that when defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown and one enters  remains in the culmination  abundance of discernment having known  realized it for oneself in the here  now ones abiding is stressfulpainful you should not see it in that way
When defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown and one enters  remains in the culmination  abundance of discernment having known  realized it for oneself in the here  now there is joy rapture calm mindfulness alertness and a pleasanthappy abiding
I also teach the Dhamma for the abandoning of the mindmade appropriation of a self
When defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown and one enters  remains in the culmination  abundance of discernment having known  realized it for oneself in the here  now there is joy rapture calm mindfulness alertness and a pleasanthappy abiding
 for the abandoning of the formless appropriation of a self such that when you practice it defiling mental qualities will be abandoned bright mental qualities will grow and you will enter  remain in the culmination  abundance of discernment having known  realized it for yourself in the here  now
In the past I have been asked What friend is the gross appropriation of a self for whose abandoning you teach the Dhamma such that when you practice it defiling mental qualities will be abandoned bright mental qualities will grow and you will enter  remain in the culmination  abundance of discernment having known  realized it for yourself in the here  now When asked this I would answer This friend is that gross appropriation of a self for whose abandoning I teach the Dhamma
In the past I have been asked What friend is the mindmade appropriation of a self the formless appropriation of a self for whose abandoning you teach the Dhamma When asked this I would answer This friend is that gross appropriation of a self for whose abandoning I teach the Dhamma
What do you think Poṭṭhapāda When this is the case dont those words turn out to be convincing
Yes lord When this is the case those words turn out to be convincing
Poṭṭhapāda its as if a man at a crossroads were to build a staircase for ascending to a palace
and other people were to say to him Well my good man this palace for which you are building a staircase Do you know whether its east west north or south of here Whether its high low or in between
He would say This friends is the palace to which I am building a staircase The staircase is right under the palace
So what do you think Poṭṭhapāda When this is the case dont the words of that man turn out to be convincing
Yes lord
In the same way in the past I have been asked What friend is the gross appropriation of a self the mindmade appropriation of a self the formless appropriation of a self for whose abandoning you teach the Dhamma When asked this I would answer This friend is that gross appropriation of a self for whose abandoning I teach the Dhamma
What do you think Poṭṭhapāda When this is the case dont those words turn out to be convincing
Yes lord When this is the case those words turn out to be convincing
When this was said Citta the elephant trainers son said to the Blessed One When there is a gross appropriation of a self is it the case then that ones mindmade appropriation of a self and formless appropriation of a self are null  void and only ones gross appropriation of a self is true
And when there is a mindmade appropriation of a self is it the case then that ones gross appropriation of a self and formless appropriation of a self are null  void and only ones mindmade appropriation of a self is true
And when there is a formless appropriation of a self is it the case then that ones gross appropriation of a self and mindmade appropriation of a self are null  void and only ones formless appropriation of a self is true
Citta when there is a gross appropriation of a self its not classified either as a mindmade appropriation of a self or as a formless appropriation of a self Its classified just as a gross appropriation of a self
When there is a mindmade appropriation of a self its not classified either as a gross appropriation of a self or as a formless appropriation of a self Its classified just as a mindmade appropriation of a self
When there is a formless appropriation of a self its not classified either as a gross appropriation of a self or as a mindmade appropriation of a self It is classified just as a formless appropriation of a self
Suppose they were to ask you Did you exist in the past Did you not not exist Will you exist in the future Will you not not exist Do you exist now Do you not not exist Thus asked how would you answer
 Thus asked lord I would answer I existed in the past I did not not exist I will exist in the future I will not not exist I exist now I do not not exist 
Thats how I would answer
Suppose Citta they were to ask you Whatever your past appropriation of a self Is that alone your true appropriation of self while the future  present ones are null  void
Whatever your future appropriation of a self Is that alone your true appropriation of a self while the past  present ones are null  void
Whatever your present appropriation of a self Is that alone your true appropriation of a self while the past  future ones are null  void
Thus asked how would you answer
Thus asked lord I would answer Whatever my past appropriation of a self on that occasion that alone was my true appropriation of a self while future  present ones were null  void
Whatever my future appropriation of a self on that occasion that alone will be my true appropriation of a self while the past  present ones will be null  void
Whatever my present appropriation of a self on that occasion that alone is my true appropriation of a self while the past  future ones are null  void
In the same way Citta when there is a gross appropriation of a self 
its classified just as a gross appropriation of a self
When there is a mindmade appropriation of a selfWhen there is a formless appropriation of a self its not classified either as a gross appropriation of a self or as a mindmade appropriation of a self Its classified just as a formless appropriation of a self
Just as when milk comes from a cow curds from milk butter from curds ghee from butter and the skimmings of ghee from ghee
When there is milk its not classified as curds butter ghee or skimmings of ghee Its classified just as milk
When there are curds When there is butter When there is ghee When there are the skimmings of ghee theyre not classified as milk curds butter or ghee Theyre classified just as the skimmings of ghee
In the same way when there is a gross appropriation of a self its classified just as a gross appropriation of a self When there is a mindmade appropriation of a self When there is a formless appropriation of a self its not classified either as a gross appropriation of a self or as a mindmade appropriation of a self Its classified just as a formless appropriation of a self
Citta these are the worlds designations the worlds expressions the worlds ways of speaking the worlds descriptions with which the Tathāgata expresses himself but without grasping to them
When this was said Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms
in the same way has Master Gotamathrough many lines of reasoningmade the Dhamma clear
I go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of monks
May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life
But Citta the elephant trainers son said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent
in the same way has Master Gotamathrough many lines of reasoningmade the Dhamma clear
I go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of monks
Let me obtain the going forth in the Blessed Ones presence Let me obtain acceptance
So Citta the elephant trainers son obtained the going forth in the Blessed Ones presence he obtained acceptance
And not long after his Acceptancedwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolutehe in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now
He knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for the sake of this world
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned
And thus Ven Elephanttrainers Son became another one of the arahants
Thus have I heard Once the Lord was touring Kosala with a large company of some five hundred monks He came to a Kosalan Brahmin village called Manasakata
He came to a Kosalan Brahmin village called Manasakata and stayed to the north of the village in a mangogrove on the bank of the River Aciravati
And at that time many very wellknown and prosperous Brahmins were staying at Manasakata including Canki Ta rukkha Pokkharasati Janussoni and Todeyya
And Vasettha and Bharadvaja went strolling along the road and as they did so an argument broke out between them on the subject of right and wrong paths
The young Brahmin Vasettha said This is the only straight path this is the direct path the path of salvation that leads one who follows it to union with Brahma as is taught by the Brahmin Pokkharasati
And the young Brahmin Bharadvaja said This is the only straight path as taught by the Brahmin Tarukkha
And Vasettha could not convince Bharadvaja nor could Bharadvaja convince Vasettha
Then Vasettha said to Bharadvaja This ascetic Gotama is staying to the north of the village
and concerning this Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about  
Let us go to the ascetic Gotama and ask him
and whatever he tells us we shall accept
And Bharadvaja agreed
So the two of them went to see the Lord
Having exchanged courtesies with him they sat down to one side
and Vasettha said Reverend Gotama as we were strolling along the road we got to discussing right and wrong paths
I said This is the only straight path as is taught by the Brahmin Pokkharasati
and Bharadvaja said This is the only straight path   as is taught by the Brahmin Tarukkha
This is our dispute our quarrel our difference
So Vasettha you say that the way to union with Brahma is that taught by the Brahmin Pokkharasati
and Bharadvaja says it is that taught by the Brahmin Tarukha
What is the dispute the quarrel the difference all about
Right and wrong paths Reverend Gotama
There are so many kinds of Brahmins who teach different paths the Ad dhariya the Tittiriya the Chandoka the Chandava the Brah macariya Brahmins  do all these ways lead to union with Brahma
Just as if there were near a town or village many different paths  do all these come together at that place And likewise do the ways of the various Brahmins lead the one who follows them to union with Brahma
You say They lead Vasettha
 I say They lead Reverend Gotama
You say They lead Vasettha
 I say They lead Reverend Gotama
You say They lead Vasettha
 I say They lead Reverend Gotama
But Vasettha is there then a single one of these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas who has seen Brahma face to face
 No Reverend Gotama
Then has the teachers teacher of any one of them seen Brahma face to face
 No Reverend Gotama
Then has the ancestor seven generations back of the teacher of one of them seen Brahma face to face
 No Reverend Gotama
Well then Vasettha what about the early sages of those Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas the makers of the mantras the expounders of the mantras whose ancient verses are chanted pronounced and collected by the Brahmins of today and sung and spoken about  such as Atthaka Vamaka Vamadeva Vessamitta Yamataggi Angirasa Bharadvaja Vasettha Kassapa Bhagu 
did they ever say We know and see when how and where Brahma appears
 No Reverend Gotama
So Vasettha not one of these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas has seen Brahma face to face
nor has one of their teachers
or teachers teachers
nor even the ancestor seven generations back of one of their teachers
Nor could any of the early sages say We know and see when how and where Brahma appears
So what these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas are saying is We teach this path to union with Brahma that we do not know or see
this is the only straight path leading to union with Brahma
What do you think Vasettha Such being the case does not what these Brahmins declare turn out to be illfounded
 Yes indeed Reverend Gotama
Well Vasettha when these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas teach a path that they do not know or see saying
This is the only straight path this cannot possibly be right
Just as a file of blind men go on clinging to each other and the first one sees nothing the middle one sees nothing and the last one sees nothing 
so it is with the talk of these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas the first one sees nothing the middle one sees nothing the last one sees nothing
The talk of these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas turns out to be laughable mere words empty and vain
What do you think Vasettha Do these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas see the sun and moon just as other people do and when the sun and moon rise and set do they pray sing praises and worship with clasped hands
 They do Reverend Gotama
What do you think Vasettha These Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas who can see the sun and moon just as other people do   can they point out a way to union with the sun and moon saying This is the only straight path that leads to union with the sun and moon
 No Reverend Gotama
So Vasettha these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas cannot point out a way to union with the sun and moon which they have seen
And too none of them has seen Brahma face to face
nor has even the ancestor seven generations back of one of their teachers
Nor could any of the early sages say We know and see when how and where Brahma appears
Does not what these Brahmins declare turn out to be illfounded
 Yes indeed Reverend Gotama
Vasettha it is just as if a man were to say I am going to seek out and love the most beautiful girl in the country
They might say to him  Do you know what caste she belongs to
 No
Well do you know her name her clan whether she is tall or short dark or lightcomplex ioned or where she comes from
 No
And they might say Well then you dont know or see the one you seek for and desire
 and he would say No
Does not the talk of that man turn out to be stupid
 Certainly Reverend Gotama
Then Vasettha it is like this not one of these Brahmins   has seen Brahma face to face nor has one of their teachers 
Yes indeed Reverend Gotama
That is right Vasettha When these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas teach a path that they do not know and see this cannot possibly be right
Vasettha it is just as if a man were to build a staircase for a palace at a crossroads
People might say This staircase for a palace  do you know whether the palace will face east or west north or south or whether it will be high low or of medium height
 and he would say No
And they might say Well then you dont know or see what kind of a palace you are building the staircase for
 and he would say No
Does not the talk of that man turn out to be stupid
 Certainly Reverend Gotama
Vasettha it is just as if this River Aciravati were brimful of water so that a crow could drink out of it
and a man should come along wishing to cross over to get to the other side to get across
and standing on this bank were to call out Come here other bank come here
What do you think Vasettha Would the other bank of the River Aciravati come over to this side on account of that mans calling begging requesting or wheedling
 No Reverend Gotama
Well now Vasettha those Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas who persistently neglect what a Brahmin should do and persistently do what a Brahmin should not do declare We call on Indra Soma Varuna Isana Pajapati Brahma Mahiddhi Yama
But that such Brahmins who persistently neglect what a Brahmin should do will as a consequence of their calling begging requesting or wheedling attain after death at the breakingup of the body to union with Brahma  that is just not possible
Vasettha it is just as if this River Aciravati were brimful of water so that a crow could drink out of it
and a man should come wishing to cross over
but he was bound and pinioned on this side by a strong chain with his hands behind his back
What do you think Vasettha Would that man be able to get to the other side
 No Reverend Gotama
In just the same way Vasettha in the Ariyan discipline these five strands of sensedesire are called bonds and fetters
Which five
Forms seen by the eye which are agreeable loved charming attractive pleasurable arousing desire
sounds heard by the ear smells smelt by the nose tastes savoured by the tongue contacts felt by the body which are agreeable  arousing desire
These five in the Ariyan discipline are called bonds and fetters
And Vasettha those Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas are enslaved infatuated by these five strands of sensedesire which they enjoy guiltily unaware of danger knowing no way out
But that such Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas who persistently neglect what a Brahmin should do who are enslaved by these five strands of sensedesire knowing no way out should attain after death at the breakingup of the body to union with Brahma  that is just not possible
It is just as if this River Aciravati were brimful of water so that a crow could drink out of it
and a man should come along wishing to cross over 
and were to lie down on this bank covering his head with a shawl
What do you think Vasettha Would that man be able to get to the other side
 No Reverend Gotama
In the same way Vasettha in the Ariyan discipline these five hindrances are called obstacles hindrances cover ingsup envelopings
Which five
The hindrance of sensuality of illwill of slothandtorpor of worryandflurry of doubt
These five are called obstacles hindrances coveringsup en velopings
And these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas are caught up hemmed in obstructed entangled in these five hindrances
But that such Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas who persistently neglect what a Brahmin should do and who are caught up entangled in these five hindrances should attain after death at the breakingup of the body to union with Brahma  that is just not possible
What do you think Vasettha What have you heard said by Brahmins who are venerable aged the teachers of teachers Is Brahma encumbered with wives and wealth or unencumbered
 Unencumbered Reverend Gotama
Is he full of hate or without hate
 Without hate Reverend Gotama
Is he full of illwill or without illwill
 Without illwill Reverend Gotama
Is he impure or pure
 Pure Reverend Gotama
Is he disciplined or undisciplined
 Disciplined Reverend Gotama
And what do you think Vasettha Are the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas encumbered with wives and wealth or unencumbered
 Encumbered Reverend Gotama
Are they full of hate or without hate
 Full of hate Reverend Gotama
Are they full of illwill or without illwill
 Full of illwill Reverend Gotama
Are they impure or pure
 Impure Reverend Gotama
Are they disciplined or undisciplined
 Undisciplined Reverend Gotama
So Vasettha the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas are encumbered with wives and wealth and Brahma is unencumbered
Is there any communion anything in common between these encumbered Brahmins and the unencumbered Brahma
 No Reverend Gotama
That is right Vasettha That these encumbered Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas should after death at the breakingup of the body be united with the unencumbered Brahma  that is just not possible
Likewise do these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas and full of hate full of illwill impure undisciplined have any communion anything in common with the disciplined Brahma
No Reverend Gotama
That is right Vasettha That these undisciplined Brahmins should after death be united with Brahma is just not possible
But these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas having sat down on the bank sink down despairingly thinking maybe to find a dry way across
Therefore their threefold knowledge is called the threefold desert the threefold wilderness the threefold destruction
At these words Vasettha said Reverend Gotama I have heard them say The ascetic Gotama knows the way to union with Brahma
What do you think Vasettha Suppose there were a man here born and brought up in Manasakata
and somebody who had come from Manasakata and and had missed the road should ask him the way
Would that man bom and bred in Manasakata be in a state of confusion or perplexity
No Reverend Gotama
And why not
Because such a man would know all the paths
Vasettha it might be said that such a man on being asked the way might be confused or perplexed  but the Tathagata on being asked about the Brahma world and the way to get there would certainly not be confused or perplexed
For Vasettha I know Brahma and the world of Brahma and the way to the world of Brahma and the path of practice whereby the world of Brahma may be gained
At this Vasettha said Reverend Gotama I have heard them say The ascetic Gotama teaches the way to union with Brahma
It would be good if the Reverend Gotama were to teach us the way to union with Brahma may the Reverend Gotama help the people of Brahma
Then Vasettha listen pay proper attention and I will tell you
Very good Reverend Sir said Vasettha
The Lord said  Vasettha a Tathagata arises in the world an Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha
Then with his heart filled with lovingkindness he dwells suffusing one quarter
the second
the third
the fourth
Thus he dwells suffusing the whole world upwards downwards across everywhere always with a heart filled with lovingkindness abundant unbounded without hate or illwill
Just as if a mighty trumpeter were with little difficulty to make a proclamation to the four quarters so by this meditation Vasettha by this liberation of the heart through loving kindness he leaves nothing untouched nothing unaffected in the sensuous sphere
This Vasettha is the way to union with Brahma
Then with his heart filled with compassion with sympathetic joy with equanimity he dwells suffusing one quarter
the second
the third
the fourth
Thus he dwells suffusing the whole world upwards downwards across everywhere always with a heart filled with equanimity abundant unbounded without hate or illwill
Just as if a mighty trumpeter were with little difficulty to make a proclamation to the four quarters
so by this meditation Vasettha by this liberation of the heart through compassion  through sympathetic joy through equanimity he leaves nothing untouched nothing unaffected in the sensuous sphere
This Vasettha is the way to union with Brahma
What do you think Vasettha Is a monk dwelling thus encumbered with wives and wealth or unencumbered
Unencumbered Reverend Gotama
He is without hate
without illwill
pure and
disciplined Reverend Gotama
Then Vasettha the monk is unencumbered and Brahma is unencumbered
Has that unencumbered monk anything in common with the unencumbered Brahma
Yes indeed Reverend Gotama
That is right Vasettha Then that an unencumbered monk after death at the breakingup of the body should attain to union with the unencumbered Brahma  that is possible
Likewise a monk without hate without illwill pure disciplined 
Then that a disciplined monk after death at the breakingup of the body should attain to union with Brahma  that is possible
At this the young Brahmins Vasettha and Bharadvaja said to the Lord Excellent Reverend Gotama excellent
It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down or to point out the way to one who had got lost or to bring an oillamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there
Just so the Reverend Gotama has expounded the Dhamma in various ways
We take refuge in the Reverend Gotama in the Dhamma and in the Sangha
May the Reverend Gotama accept us as layfollowers having taken refuge from this day forth as long as life shall last
Very good Sire said Vassakara and having had the state carriages harnessed he mounted one of them and drove in state from Rajagaha to Vultures Peak
riding as far as the ground would allow then continuing on foot to where the Lord was He exchanged courtesies with the Lord
then sat down to one side
and delivered the Kings message
Very well sire said the brahman Vassakara in assent to Ajatasattu king of Magadha And he ordered a large number of magnificent carriages to be made ready mounted one himself and accompanied by the rest drove out to Rajagaha towards Vultures Peak
He went by carriage as far as the carriage could go then dismounting he approached the Blessed One on foot
After exchanging courteous greetings with the Blessed One together with many pleasant words
he sat down at one side and addressed the Blessed One thus Venerable Gotama Ajatasattu the king of Magadha pays homage at the feet of the Venerable Gotama and wishes him good health strength ease vigour and comfort
He desires to wage war against the Vajjis
and he has spoken in this fashion These Vajjis powerful and glorious as they are I shall annihilate them I shall make them perish I shall utterly destroy them
Responding As you say sire to Ajātasattu Vedehiputta the King of Magadha Vassakāra the brahman the chief minister of Magadha had auspicious vehicles yoked got into an auspicious vehicle left Rājagaha with the auspicious vehicles and drove toward Vulture Peak Mountain
Going in his vehicle as far as there was ground for a vehicle getting down from his vehicle he approached the Blessed One on foot On arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he told the Blessed One Ajātasattu Vedehiputta the king of Magadha Master Gotama shows reverence with his head to Master Gotamas feet and asks whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfort
Master Gotama Ajātasattu Vedehiputta the king of Magadha wants to attack the Vajjians
He says I will cut down these Vajjiansso mighty so powerful I will destroy the Vajjians I will bring these Vajjians to ruinthese Vajjians
Now the Venerable Ananda was standing behind the Lord fanning him
And the Lord said Ananda have you heard that the Vajjians hold regular and frequent assemblies
 I have heard Lord that they do
Ananda as long as the Vajjians hold regular and frequent assemblies they may be expected to prosper and not decline
Have you heard that the Vajjians meet in harmony break up in harmony and carry on their business in harmony
 I have heard Lord that they do
Ananda as long as the Vajjians meet in harmony break up in harmony and carry on their business in harmony they may be expected to prosper and not decline
Have you heard that the Vajjians do not authorise what has not been authorised already and do not abolish what has been authorised but proceed according to what has been authorised by their ancient tradition
 I have Lord
 Have you heard that they honour respect revere and salute the elders among them and consider them worth listening to
 that they do not forcibly abduct others wives and daughters and compel them to live with them
that they honour respect revere and salute the Vajjian shrines at home and abroad not withdrawing the proper support made and given before
 that proper provision is made for the safety of Arahants so that such Arahants may come in future to live there and those already there may dwell in comfort
 I have Lord
Ananda so long as such proper provision is made the Vajjians may be expected to prosper and not decline
Then the Lord said to the Brahmin Vassakara Once Brahmin when I was at the Sarandada Shrine in Vesali
I taught the Vajjians these seven principles for preventing decline
and as long as they keep to these seven principles as long as these principles remain in force the Vajjians may be expected to prosper and not decline
At this Vassakara replied Reverend Gotama if the Vajjians keep to even one of these principles they may be expected to prosper and not decline
 far less all seven
Certainly the Vajjians will never be conquered by King Ajatasattu by force of arms but only by means of propaganda and setting them against one another
And now Reverend Gotama may I depart I am busy and have much to do
Brahmin do as you think fit
Then Vassakara rejoicing and delighted at the Lords words rose from his seat and departed
At that time the Venerable Ananda was standing behind the Blessed One fanning him
and the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda thus What have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis have frequent gatherings and are their meetings well attended
I have heard Lord that this is so
So long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their decline
What have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis assemble and disperse peacefully and attend to their affairs in concord 
I have heard Lord that they do
So long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their decline
What have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis neither enact new decrees nor abolish existing ones but proceed in accordance with their ancient constitutions 
I have heard Lord that they do
So long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their decline
What have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis show respect honor esteem and veneration towards their elders and think it worthwhile to listen to them 
I have heard Lord that they do
So long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their decline
What have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis refrain from abducting women and maidens of good families and from detaining them 
I have heard Lord that they refrain from doing so
So long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their decline
What have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis show respect honor esteem and veneration towards their shrines both those within the city and those outside it and do not deprive them of the due offerings as given and made to them formerly 
I have heard Lord that they do venerate their shrines and that they do not deprive them of their offerings
So long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their decline
What have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis duly protect and guard the arahats so that those who have not come to the realm yet might do so and those who have already come might live there in peace 
I have heard Lord that they do
So long Ananda as this is the case  the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their decline
And the Blessed One addressed the brahman Vassakara in these words Once brahman I dwelt at Vesali at the Sarandada shrine
and there it was that I taught the Vajjis these seven conditions leading to welfare
So long brahman as these endure among the Vajjis and the Vajjis are known for it their growth is to be expected not their decline
Thereupon the brahman Vassakara spoke thus to the Blessed One If the Vajjis Venerable Gotama were endowed with only one or another of these conditions leading to welfare their growth would have to be expected not their decline
What then of all the seven
No harm indeed can be done to the Vajjis in battle by Magadhas king Ajatasattu except through treachery or discord
Well then Venerable Gotama we will take our leave for we have much to perform much work to do
Do as now seems fit to you brahman
And the brahman Vassakara the chief minister of Magadha approving of the Blessed Ones words and delighted by them rose from his seat and departed
Now on that occasion Ven nanda was standing behind the Blessed One fanning him
So the Blessed One addressed Ven nanda Have you heard nanda that the Vajjians meet often and meet a great deal
I have heard lord that the Vajjians meet often and meet a great deal
As long as the Vajjians meet often and meet a great deal nanda their growth can be expected not their decline
Have you heard nanda that the Vajjians meet in harmony adjourn from their meetings in harmony and conduct their Vajjian business in harmony
I have heard that lord
As long as the Vajjians meet in harmony adjourn from their meetings in harmony and conduct their Vajjian business in harmony nanda their growth can be expected not their decline
Have you heard nanda that the Vajjians neither decree what has been undecreed nor repeal what has been decreed but conduct themselves having undertaken the ancient Vajjian laws as they have been decreed
I have heard that lord
As long as the Vajjians neither decree what has been undecreed nor repeal what has been decreed but conduct themselves having undertaken the ancient Vajjian laws as they have been decreed nanda their growth can be expected not their decline
Have you heard nanda that the Vajjians honor respect venerate and do homage to the Vajjian elders of the Vajjis regarding them as worth listening to
I have heard that lord
As long as the Vajjians honor respect venerate and do homage to the Vajjian elders of the Vajjis regarding them as worth listening to nanda their growth can be expected not their decline
Have you heard nanda that the Vajjians do not roughly drag off women  girls of good families and take them captive
I have heard that lord

Have you heard nanda that the Vajjians honor respect venerate and do homage to the Vajjian shrines both inside and out and that they do not let the righteous offerings done in the past and given in the past to those shrines fall into decline 
I have heard that lord

Have you heard nanda that righteous protection watch and guarding for arahants is wellprovided by the Vajjians If there are any arahants who have yet to come to our domain may they come and may the arahants who have come to our domain live in comfort
I have heard that lord 
As long as righteous protection watch and guarding for arahants is wellprovided by the Vajjians If there are any arahants who have yet to come to our domain may they come and may the arahants who have come to our domain live in comfort nanda their growth can be expected not their decline 
Then the Blessed One addressed Vassakāra the brahman the chief minister of Magadha Once brahman I was staying near Vesālī at the Sārandada shrine
There I taught the Vajjians these seven conditions that lead to no decline
As long as these seven conditions endure among the Vajjians and as long as the Vajjians remain steadfast in these seven conditions the Vajjians growth can be expected not their decline
When this was said Vassakāra the brahman the chief minister of Magadha said to the Blessed One Master Gotama even if the Vajjians are endowed with only one of these conditions that lead to no decline the Vajjians growth can be expected not their decline
to say nothing of all seven
Nothing can be done to the Vajjians by King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta the king of Magadha through force of armsexcept by befriending them and sowing dissension 
Well then Master Gotama we must go now Many are our duties many our responsibilities 
Then do brahman what you think it is now time to do
Then Vassakāra the brahman the chief minister of Magadha delighting in and approving of the Blessed Ones words got up from his seat and left
Soon after Vassakara had gone the Lord said Ananda go to whatever monks there are round about Rajagaha and summon them to the assembly hall
Very good Lord said Ananda and did so
Then he came to the Lord saluted him stood to one side and said Lord the order of monks is assembled Now is the time for the Lord to do as he sees fit
Then the Lord rose from his seat went to the assembly hall sat down on the prepared seat
and said Monks I will teach you seven things that are conducive to welfare Listen pay careful attention and I will speak
Yes Lord said the monks
and the Lord said
As long as the monks hold regular and frequent assemblies they may be expected to prosper and not decline
As long as they meet in harmony break up in harmony and carry on their business in harmony they may be expected to prosper and not decline
As long as they do not authorise what has not been authorised already and do not abolish what has been authorised but proceed according to what has been authorised by the rules of training
as long as they honour respect revere and salute the elders of long standing who are long ordained fathers and leaders of the order
as long as they do not fall prey to desires which arise in them and lead to rebirth
as long as they are devoted to forestlodgings
as long as they preserve their personal mindfulness so that in future the good among their companions will come to them and those who have already come will feel at ease with them 
as long as the monks hold to these seven things and are seen to do so they may be expected to prosper and not decline
I will tell you another seven things conducive to welfare
As long as monks do not rejoice delight and become absorbed in works
 in chattering
in sleeping
in company
in evil desires
in mixing and associating with evil friends
as long as they do not rest content with partial achievements
as long as the monks hold to these seven things and are seen to do so they may be expected to prosper and not decline
I will tell you another seven things conducive to welfare   As long as monks continue with faith with modesty with fear of doing wrong with learning with aroused vigour with established mindfulness with wisdom
I will tell you another seven things
As long as monks develop the enlightenmentfactors of mindfulness of investigation of phenomena of energy of delight of tranquillity of concentration of equanimity
I will tell you another seven things
As long as monks develop the perception of impermanence of nonself of impurity of danger of overcoming of dispassion of cessation  they may be expected to prosper and not decline
Monks I will tell you six things that are conducive to communal living
 
As long as monks both in public and in private show lovingkindness to their fellows in acts of body
speech and thought
share with their virtuous fellows whatever they receive as a rightful gift including the contents of their almsbowls which they do not keep to themselves
keep consistently unbroken and unaltered those rules of conduct that are spotless leading to liberation praised by the wise unstained and conducive to concentration and persist therein with their fellows both in public and in private
continue in that noble view that leads to liberation to the utter destruction of suffering remaining in such awareness with their fellows both in public and in private
As long as monks hold to these six things and are seen to do so they may be expected to prosper and not decline
And then the Lord while staying at Vultures Peak gave a comprehensive discourse This is morality this is concentration this is wisdom
Concentration when imbued with morality brings great fruit and profit
Wisdom when imbued with concentration brings great fruit and profit
The mind imbued with wisdom becomes completely free from the corruptions that is from the corruption of sensuality of becoming of false views and of ignorance
And when the Lord had stayed at Rajagaha as long as he wished he said to the Venerable Ananda Come Ananda let us go to Ambalatthika
Very good Lord
said Ananda and the Lord went there with a large company of monks
And the Lord stayed in the royal park at Ambalatthika
and there he delivered a comprehensive discourse This is morality this is concentration this is wisdom
Having stayed at Ambalatthika as long as he wished the Lord said to Ananda Let us go to Nalanda and they did so
At Nalanda the Lord stayed in Pavarikas mangogrove
Then soon after Vassakaras departure the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda thus Go now Ananda and assemble in the hall of audience as many bhikkhus as live around Rajagaha
Very well Lord And the Venerable Ananda did as he was requested
and informed the Blessed One The community of bhikkhus is assembled Lord Now let the Blessed One do as he wishes
Thereupon the Blessed One rose from his seat went up to the hall of audience took his appointed seat there
and addressed the bhikkhus thus Seven conditions leading to welfare I shall set forth bhikkhus Listen and pay heed to what I shall say

So long bhikkhus as these six conditions leading to welfare endure among the bhikkhus and the bhikkhus are known for it their growth is to be expected not their decline
And the Blessed One living at Rajagaha at the hill called Vultures Peak often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdom
Great becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct
great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration

Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven nandahaving had all the monks living in dependence on Rājagaha gather at the assembly hallapproached the Blessed One On arrival having bowed down to him he stood to one side

While staying there near Rājagaha on Vulture Peak Mountain the Blessed One often gave this Dhamma talk to the monks Such is virtue such is concentration such is discernment
Concentration nurtured with virtue is of great fruit great reward
Discernment nurtured with concentration is of great fruit great reward
The mind nurtured with discernment is rightly released from the effluents i e  the effluent of sensuality the effluent of becoming the effluent of ignorance 
Then the Blessed One having stayed near Rājagaha as long as he pleased said to Ven nanda Come nanda we will head for Ambalaṭṭhikā 
As you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One together with a large Saṅgha of monks went to Ambalaṭṭhikā

While staying there near Ambalaṭṭhikā at the Royal Cottage the Blessed One often gave this Dhamma talk to the monks Such is virtue such is concentration such is discernment
Concentration nurtured with virtue is of great fruit great reward
Discernment nurtured with concentration is of great fruit great reward
The mind nurtured with discernment is rightly released from the effluents i e  the effluent of sensuality the effluent of becoming the effluent of ignorance 
Then the Blessed One having stayed near Ambalaṭṭhikā as long as he pleased said to Ven nanda Come nanda we will head for Nāḷandā 
As you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One together with a large Saṅgha of monks went to Nāḷandā There he stayed near Nāḷandā at the Pāvādika mango grove
Then the Venerable Sariputta came to see the Lord saluted him sat down to one side
and said It is clear to me Lord that there never has been will be or is now another ascetic or Brahmin who is better or more enlightened than the Lord
You have spoken boldly with a bulls voice Sariputta you have roared the lions roar of certainty
How is this Have all the Arahant Buddhas of the past appeared to you and were the minds of all those Lords open to you so as to say These Lords were of such virtue such was their teaching such their wisdom such their way such their liberation
 No Lord
And have you perceived all the Arahant Buddhas who will appear in the future
 No Lord
Well then Sariputta you know me as the Arahant Buddha and do you know The Lord is of such virtue such is his teaching such his wisdom such his way such his liberation
 No Lord
So Sariputta you do not have knowledge of the minds of the Buddhas of the past the future or the present
Thus Sariputta have you not spoken boldly with a bulls voice and roared the lions roar of certainty with your declaration 
Lord the minds of the Arahant Buddhas of the past future and present are not open to me But I know the drift of the Dhamma
Lord it is as if there were a royal frontier city with mighty bastions and a mighty encircling wall in which was a single gate at which was a gatekeeperwise skilled and clever who kept out strangers and let in those he knew
And he constantly patrolling and following along a path might not see the joins and clefts in the bastion even such as a cat might creep through
But whatever larger creatures entered or left the city must all go through this very gate
And it seems to me Lord that the drift of the Dhamma is the same All those Arahant Buddhas of the past attained to supreme enlightenment by abandoning the five hindrances defilements of mind that weaken the understanding having firmly established the four foundations of mindfulness in their minds and realised the seven factors of enlightenment as they really are
All the Arahant Buddhas of the future will do likewise
and you Lord who are now the Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha have done the same
Then while staying at Nalanda in Pavarikas mango grove the Lord gave a comprehensive discourse to the monksThis is morality this is concentration this is wisdom
Then the Venerable Sariputta went to the Blessed One respectfully greeted him sat down at one side
and spoke thus to him This faith Lord I have in the Blessed One that there has not been there will not be nor is there now another recluse or brahman more exalted in Enlightenment than the Blessed One
Lofty indeed is this speech of yours Sariputta and lordly A bold utterance a veritable sounding of the lions roar
But how is this Sariputta Those Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of the past  do you have direct personal knowledge of all those Blessed Ones as to their virtue their meditation their wisdom their abiding and their emancipation 
Not so Lord
Then how is this Sariputta Those Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of the future  do you have direct personal knowledge of all those Blessed Ones as to their virtue their meditation their wisdom their abiding and their emancipation 
Not so Lord
Then how is this Sariputta Of me who am at present the Arahant the Fully Enlightened One do you have direct personal knowledge as to my virtue my meditation my wisdom my abiding and my emancipation 
Not so Lord
Then it is clear Sariputta that you have no such direct personal knowledge of the Arahats the Fully Enlightened Ones of the past the future and the present
How then dare you set forth a speech so lofty and lordly an utterance so bold a veritable sounding of the lions roar saying This faith Lord I have in the Blessed One that there has not been there will not be nor is there now another recluse or brahman more exalted in Enlightenment than the Blessed One 
No such direct personal knowledge indeed is mine Lord of the Arahants the Fully Enlightened Ones of the past the future and the present and yet I have come to know the lawfulness of the Dhamma
Suppose Lord a kings frontier fortress was strongly fortified with strong ramparts and turrets and it had a single gate and there was a gatekeeper intelligent experienced and prudent who would keep out the stranger but allow the friend to enter
As he patrols the path that leads all around the fortress he does not perceive a hole or fissure in the ramparts even big enough to allow a cat to slip through
So he comes to the conclusion Whatever grosser living things are to enter or leave this city they will all have to do so just by this gate
In the same way Lord I have come to know the lawfulness of the Dhamma For Lord all the Blessed Ones Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of the past had abandoned the five hindrances the mental defilements that weaken wisdom had well established their minds in the four foundations of mindfulness had duly cultivated the seven factors of enlightenment and were fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment
And Lord all the Blessed Ones Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of the future will abandon the five hindrances the mental defilements that weaken wisdom will well establish their minds in the four foundations of mindfulness will duly cultivate the seven factors of enlightenment and will be fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment
And the Blessed One too Lord being at present the Arahant the Fully Enlightened One has abandoned the five hindrances the mental defilements that weaken wisdom has well established his mind in the four foundations of mindfulness has duly cultivated the seven factors of enlightenment and is fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment
And also in Nalanda in the mango grove of Pavarika the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdom
Great becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct
great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration
utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom
Then Ven Sāriputta went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there Ven Sāriputta said to the Blessed One Lord I have confidence in the Blessed One that there neither has been nor will be nor is currently found a contemplative or brahman whose direct knowledge of selfawakening is greater than that of the Blessed One
Grand is this bullstatement you have spoken Sāriputta categorical this lions roar you have roared Lord I have confidence in the Blessed One that there neither has been nor will be nor is currently found a contemplative or brahman whose direct knowledge of selfawakening is greater than that of the Blessed One
So then Sāriputta have you encompassed with your awareness the awareness of all the worthy ones the rightly selfawakened ones that have been in the past and known Such was their virtue such their Dhamma such their discernment such their dwelling such their release
No lord 
Then have you encompassed with your awareness the awareness of all the worthy ones the rightly selfawakened ones that will be in the future and known Such will be their virtue such their Dhamma such their discernment such their dwelling such their release 
No lord 
Then have you encompassed with your awareness my awarenessthe awareness of the worthy one the rightly selfawakened one in the presentand known Such is his virtue such his Dhamma such his discernment such his dwelling such his release 
No lord 
Then Sāriputta if you dont have knowledge of the awareness of the worthy ones the rightly selfawakened ones of the past future  present
how is it that just now you spoke this grand bullstatement and roared this categorical lions roar Lord I have confidence in the Blessed One that there neither has been nor will be nor is currently found a contemplative or brahman whose direct knowledge of selfawakening is greater than that of the Blessed One
Lord I dont have knowledge of the awareness of the worthy ones the rightly selfawakened ones of the past future  present but I have known the consistency of the Dhamma
Its as if there were a royal frontier city with strong ramparts strong walls  arches and a single gate In it would be a wise competent  intelligent gatekeeper to keep out those he didnt know and to let in those he did
Walking along the path encircling the city he wouldnt see a crack or an opening in the walls big enough for even a cat to slip through
The thought would occur to him Whatever large creatures enter or leave the city all enter or leave it through this gate 
In the same way I have known the consistency of the Dhamma All those who were worthy ones the rightly selfawakened ones in the past awoke to the unexcelled right selfawakening after having abandoned the five hindrancesthose defilements of awareness that weaken discernmenthaving wellestablished their minds in the four establishings of mindfulness and having developed as they have come to be the seven factors for awakening
All those who will be worthy ones the rightly selfawakened ones in the future will awaken to the unexcelled right selfawakening after having abandoned the five hindrancesthose defilements of awareness that weaken discernmenthaving wellestablished their minds in the four establishings of mindfulness and having developed as they have come to be the seven factors for awakening
The Blessed One who is now the worthy one the rightly selfawakened one has awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening after having abandoned the five hindrancesthose defilements of awareness that weaken discernmenthaving wellestablished his mind in the four establishings of mindfulness and having developed as they have come to be the seven factors for awakening 
While staying there near Nāḷandā at the Pāvādika mango grove the Blessed One often gave this Dhamma talk to the monks Such is virtue such is concentration such is discernment
Concentration nurtured with virtue is of great fruit great reward
Discernment nurtured with concentration is of great fruit great reward
The mind nurtured with discernment is rightly released from the effluents i e  the effluent of sensuality the effluent of becoming the effluent of ignorance 
And having stayed at Nalanda as long as he wished the Lord said to Ananda Let us go to Pataligama
And they did so
At Pataligama they heard say The Lord has arrived here
And the layfollowers of Pataligama came to the Lord saluted him sat down to one side
and said May the Lord consent to stay at our resthouse
And the Lord consented by silence
Understanding his consent they rose from their seats saluted the Lord and passing him by to the right went to the resthouse and strewed the floor prepared seats provided a waterpot and filled the oillamp
Then they went to the Lord saluted him stood to one side and said All is ready at the resthouse Lord Now is the time to do as the Lord wishes
Then the Lord dressed took his robe and bowl and went with his monks to the resthouse where he washed his feet went in and sat down facing east with his back against the central pillar
And the monks having washed their feet went in and sat down with their backs to the west wall facing east and with the Lord sitting in front of them
And the lay followers of Pataligama having washed their feet went in and sat down with their backs to the east wall facing west and with the Lord before them
Then the Lord addressed the layfollowers of Pataligama Householders there are these five perils to one of bad morality of failure in morality
What are they
In the first place he suffers great loss of property through neglecting his affairs
In the second place he gets a bad reputation for immorality and misconduct
In the third place whatever assembly he approaches whether of Khattiyas Brahmins householders or ascetics he does so diffidently and shyly
In the fourth place he dies confused
In the fifth place after death at the breaking up of the body he arises in an evil state a bad fate in suffering and hell
These are the five perils to one of bad morality
When the Blessed One had stayed at Nalanda as long as he pleased he addressed the Venerable Ananda thus Come Ananda let us go to Pataligama
So be it Lord
And the Blessed One took up his abode at Pataligama together with a large community of bhikkhus
Then the devotees of Pataligama came to know The Blessed One they say has arrived at Pataligama
And they approached the Blessed One respectfully greeted him sat down at one side
and addressed him thus May the Blessed One Lord kindly visit our council hall
And the Blessed One consented by his silence
Knowing the Blessed Ones consent the devotees of Pataligama rose from their seats respectfully saluted him and keeping their right sides towards him departed for the council hall Then they prepared the council hall by covering the floor all over arranging seats and water and setting out an oil lamp Having done this they returned to the Blessed One respectfully greeted him
and standing at one side announced Lord the council hall is ready with the floor covered all over seats and water prepared and an oil lamp has been set out Let the Blessed One come Lord at his convenience
And the Blessed One got ready and taking his bowl and robe went to the council hall together with the company of bhikkhus After rinsing his feet the Blessed One entered the council hall and took his seat close to the middle pillar facing east
The community of bhikkhus after rinsing their feet also entered the council hall and took seats near the western wall facing east so that the Blessed One was before them
And the devotees of Pataligama after rinsing their feet and entering the council hall sat down near the eastern wall facing west so that the Blessed One was in front of them
Thereupon the Blessed One addressed the devotees of Pataligama thus The immoral man householders by falling away from virtue encounters five perils
great loss of wealth through heedlessness
an evil reputation
a timid and troubled demeanor in every society be it that of nobles brahmans householders or ascetics
death in bewilderment
and at the breaking up of the body after death rebirth in a realm of misery in an unhappy state in the nether world in hell
Then the Blessed One having stayed near Nāḷandā as long as he pleased said to Ven nanda Come nanda we will head for Pāṭali Village
As you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One together with a large Saṅgha of monks went to Pāṭali Village
The lay followers of Pāṭali Village heard The Blessed One they say has reached Pāṭali Village
So they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to him Lord may the Blessed One acquiesce to the resthouse hall 
The Blessed One acquiesced with silence
Sensing his acquiescence the lay followers of Pāṭali Village got up from their seats and bowing down to him and circumambulating him went to the resthouse hall On arrival they spread it all over with felt rugs arranged seats set out a water vessel and raised an oil lamp Then they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him stood to one side
As they were standing there they said to him Lord the resthouse hall has been covered all over with felt rugs seats have been arranged a water vessel has been set out and an oil lamp raised May the Blessed One do what he thinks it is now time to do 
So the Blessed One in the evening after adjusting his lower robe and taking his bowl  outer robe went together with the Saṅgha of monks to the resthouse hall On arrival he washed his feet entered the hall and sat with his back to the central post facing east
The Saṅgha of monks washed their feet entered the hall and sat with their backs to the western wall facing east ranged around the Blessed One
The lay followers of Pāṭali Village washed their feet entered the hall and sat with their backs to the eastern wall facing west ranged around the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One addressed the lay followers of Pāṭali Village Householders there are these five drawbacks coming from an unvirtuous persons defect in virtue
Which five
There is the case where an unvirtuous person defective in virtue by reason of heedlessness undergoes the lossconfiscation of great wealth
This is the first drawback coming from an unvirtuous persons defect in virtue
And further the bad reputation of the unvirtuous person defective in virtue gets spread about
This is the second drawback coming from an unvirtuous persons defect in virtue
And further whatever assembly the unvirtuous person defective in virtue approacheswhether of noble warriors brahmans householders or contemplativesheshe does so without confidence  abashed
This is the third drawback coming from an unvirtuous persons defect in virtue
And further the unvirtuous person defective in virtue dies confused
This is the fourth drawback coming from an unvirtuous persons defect in virtue
And further the unvirtuous person defective in virtueon the breakup of the body after deathreappears in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hell
This is the fifth drawback coming from an unvirtuous persons defect in virtue
These householders are the five drawbacks coming from an unvirtuous persons defect in virtue
And householders there are these five advantages to one of good morality and of success in morality
What are they
In the first place through careful attention to his affairs he gains much wealth
In the second place he gets a good reputation for morality and good conduct
In the third place whatever assembly he approaches whether of Khattiyas Brahmins householders or ascetics he does so with confidence and assurance
In the fourth place he dies unconfused
In the fifth place after death at the breakingup of the body he arises in a good place a heavenly world
These are the five advantages to one of good morality and of success in morality
Then the Lord instructed inspired fired and delighted the layfollowers of Pataligama with talk on Dhamma until far into the night Then he dismissed them saying Householders the night is nearly over Now it is time for you to do as you think fit
Very good Lord they said and rising and saluting the Lord they passed him by to the right and departed
And the Lord spent the remainder of the night in the resthouse left empty by their departure
Five blessings householders accrue to the righteous man through his practice of virtue 
great increase of wealth through his diligence
a favorable reputation
a confident deportment without timidity in every society be it that of nobles brahmans householders or ascetics
a serene death
and at the breaking up of the body after death rebirth in a happy state in a heavenly world
And the Blessed One spent much of the night instructing the devotees of Pataligama in the Dhamma rousing edifying and gladdening them after which he dismissed them saying The night is far advanced householders You may go at your convenience
So be it Lord And the devotees of Pataligama rose from their seats respectfully saluted the Blessed One and keeping their right sides towards him departed
And the Blessed One soon after their departure retired into privacy
Householders there are these five rewards coming from a virtuous persons consummation in virtue
Which five
There is the case where a virtuous person consummate in virtue by reason of heedfulness acquires a great mass of wealth
This is the first reward coming from a virtuous persons consummation in virtue
And further the fine reputation of the virtuous person consummate in virtue gets spread about
This is the second reward coming from a virtuous persons consummation in virtue
And further whatever assembly the virtuous person consummate in virtue approacheswhether of noble warriors brahmans householders or contemplativesheshe does so with confidence  unabashed
This is the third reward coming from a virtuous persons consummation in virtue
And further the virtuous person consummate in virtue dies unconfused
This is the fourth reward coming from a virtuous persons consummation in virtue
And further the virtuous person consummate in virtueon the breakup of the body after deathreappears in a good destination a heavenly world
This is the fifth reward coming from a virtuous persons consummation in virtue
These householders are the five rewards coming from a virtuous persons consummation in virtue 
Then the Blessed Onehaving instructed urged roused  encouraged the lay followers of Pāṭali Village for a large part of the night with Dhamma talkdismissed them saying The night is far gone householders Do what you think it is now time to do
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One the lay followers of Pāṭali Village got up from their seats and bowing down to him and circumambulating him left
Then the Blessed One not long after they had left entered an empty building
Now at this time Sunidha and Vassakara the Maga dhan ministers were building a fortress in Pataligama as a defence against the Vajjians
And at that time a multitude of thousands of devas were taking up lodging in Pataligama
And in the parts where powerful devas settled they caused the minds of the most powerful royal officials to pick those sites for their dwellings
and where middle and l
owerranking devas settled so too they caused the minds of royal officials of corresponding grade to pick those sites for their dwellings
And the Lord with his divine eye surpassing that of humans saw the thousands of devas taking up residence in Pataligama
And getting up at break of day he said to the Venerable Ananda Ananda who is building a fortress at Pataligama
 Lord Sunidha and Vassakara the Magadhan ministers are building a fortress against the Vajjians
Ananda just as if they had taken counsel with the ThirtyThree Gods Sunidha and Vassakara are building a fortress at Pataligama
I have seen with my divine eye how thousands of devas were taking up lodging there 
Ananda as far as the Ariyan realm extends as far as its trade extends this will be the chief city Pataliputta scattering its seeds far and wide
And Pataliputta will face three perils from fire from water and from internal dissension
Then Sunidha and Vassakara called on the Lord and having exchanged courtesies stood to one side and said May the Reverend Gotama accept a meal from us tomorrow with his order of monks
And the Lord consented by silence
Understanding his consent Sunidha and Vassakara went home and there had a fine meal of hard and soft food prepared When it was ready they reported to the Lord Reverend Gotama the meal is ready
Then the Lord having dressed in the morning took his robe and bowl went with the order of monks to the residence of Sunidha and Vassakara and sat down on the prepared seat
Then Sunidha and Vassakara served the Buddha and his order of monks with choice soft and hard foods till they were satisfied
And when the Lord took his hand away from the bowl they sat down on low stools to one side
And as they sat there the Lord thanked them with these verses
In whatever realm the wise man makes his home
He should feed the virtuous leaders of the holy life
Whatever devas there are who report this offering
They will pay him respect and honour for this
They tremble for him as a mother for her son
And he for whom devas tremble ever happy is
Then the Lord rose from his seat and took his departure
Sunidha and Vassakara followed closely behind the Lord saying Whichever gate the ascetic Gotama goes out by today that shall be called the Gotama gate
and whichever ford he uses to cross the Ganges that shall be called the Gotama ford
And so the gate by which the Lord went out was called the Gotama Gate
And then the Lord came to the River Ganges
And just then the river was so full that a crow could drink out of it
And some people were looking for a boat and some were looking for a raft and some were binding together a raft of reeds to get to the other side
But the Lord as swiftly as a strong man might stretch out his flexed arm or flex it again vanished from this side of the Ganges and reappeared with his order of monks on the other shore
And the Lord saw those people who were looking for a boat looking for a raft and binding together a raft of reeds to get to the other side
And seeing their intentions he uttered this verse on the spot
When they want to cross the sea the lake or pond
People make a bridge or raft  the wise have crossed already
End of first recitationsection
At that time Sunidha and Vassakara the chief ministers of Magadha were building a fortress at Pataligama in defense against the Vajjis
And deities in large numbers counted in thousands had taken possession of sites at Pataligama
In the region where deities of great power prevailed officials of great power were bent on constructing edifices
and where deities of medium power
and lesser power prevailed officials of medium and lesser power were bent on constructing edifices
And the Blessed One saw with the heavenly eye pure and transcending the faculty of men the deities counted in thousands where they had taken possession of sites in Pataligama
And rising before the night was spent towards dawn the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda thus Who is it Ananda that is erecting a city at Pataligama
Sunidha and Vassakara Lord the chief ministers of Magadha are building a fortress at Pataligama in defence against the Vajjis
It is Ananda as if Sunidha and Vassakara had taken counsel with the gods of the Thirtythree
For I beheld Ananda with the heavenly eye pure and transcending the faculty of men a large number of deities counted in thousands that have taken possession of sites at Pataligama
In the region where deities of great power prevail officials of great power are bent on constructing edifices
and where deities of medium
and lesser power prevail officials of medium and lesser power are bent on constructing edifices
Truly Ananda as far as the Aryan race extends and trade routes spread this will be the foremost city Pataliputta a tradecenter
But Pataliputta Ananda will be assailed by three perils  fire water and dissension
Then Sunidha and Vassakara went to the Blessed One and after courteous greeting to the Blessed One and exchanging many pleasant words they stood at one side and addressed him thus May the Venerable Gotama please accept our invitation for tomorrows meal together with the community of bhikkhus
And the Blessed One consented by his silence
Knowing the Blessed Ones consent Sunidha and Vassakara departed for their own abodes where they had choice food hard and soft prepared And when it was time they announced to the Blessed One It is time Venerable Gotama the meal is ready
Thereupon the Blessed One got ready in the forenoon and taking bowl and robe he went together with the community of bhikkhus to the abode of Sunidha and Vassakara where he took the seat prepared for him
And Sunidha and Vassakara themselves attended on the community of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha and served them with choice food hard and soft
When the Blessed One had finished his meal and had removed his hand from the bowl they took low seats and sat down at one side
And the Blessed One thanked them with these stanzas
Wherever he may dwell the prudent man
Ministers to the chaste and virtuous
And having to these worthy ones made gifts He shares his merits with the local devas
And so revered they honor him in turn
Are gracious to him even as a mother Is towards her own her only son
And he who thus enjoys the devas grace And is by them beloved good fortune sees
After this the Blessed One rose from his seat and departed
Then Sunidha and Vassakara followed behind the Blessed One step by step saying Through whichever gate the recluse Gotama will depart today that we will name the Gotamagate
and the ford by which he will cross the river Ganges shall be named the Gotamaford
And so it came to pass where the gate was concerned
But when the Blessed One came to the river Ganges
it was full to the brim so that crows could drink from it
And some people went in search of a boat or float while others tied up a raft because they desired to get across
But the Blessed One as quickly as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or draw in his outstretched arm vanished from this side of the river Ganges and came to stand on the yonder side
And the Blessed One saw the people who desired to cross searching for a boat or float while others were binding rafts
And then the Blessed One seeing them thus gave forth the solemn utterance
They who have bridged the ocean vast Leaving the lowlands far behind
While others still their frail rafts bind Are saved by wisdom unsurpassed
Now on that occasion Sunidha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha were building a city at Pāṭali Village to preempt the Vajjians
And on that occasion many devas by the thousands were occupying sites in Pāṭali Village
In the area where devas of great influence occupied sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of great influence were inclined to build their homes
In the area where devas of middling influence occupied sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of middling influence were inclined to build their homes
In the area where devas of low influence occupied sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of low influence were inclined to build their homes
The Blessed One with the divine eyepurified and surpassing the humansaw those devas by the thousands occupying sites in Pāṭali Village
Then getting up in the last watch of the night the Blessed One addressed Ven nanda nanda who is building a city at Pāṭali Village 
Sunidha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha lord are building a city at Pāṭali Village to preempt the Vajjians 
nanda its as if they had consulted the Devas of the Thirtythree Thats how Sunidha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha are building a city at Pāṭali Village to preempt the Vajjians
Just now nandawith the divine eyepurified and surpassing the humanI saw many devas by the thousands occupying sites in Pāṭali Village
In the area where devas of great influence occupy sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of great influence are inclined to build their homes
In the area where devas of middling influence occupy sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of middling influence are inclined to build their homes
In the area where devas of low influence occupy sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of low influence are inclined to build their homes
nanda as far as the sphere of the Ariyans extends as far as merchants roads extend this will be the supreme city Pāṭaliputta where the seedpods of the Pāṭali plant break open
There will be three dangers for Pāṭaliputta from fire from water or from the breaking of alliances 
Then Sunidha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies they stood to one side As they were standing there they said to him May Master Gotama acquiesce to our meal today together with the Saṅgha of monks
The Blessed One acquiesced with silence
Then Sunidha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha understanding the Blessed Ones acquiescence went to their resthouse On arrival after having exquisite staple  nonstaple food prepared in their resthouse they announced the time to the Blessed One Its time Master Gotama The meal is ready 
Then the Blessed One early in the morning adjusted his lower robe andtaking his bowl  outer robewent together with the Saṅgha of monks to the resthouse of Sunidha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha On arrival he sat down on the seat laid out
Sunidha  Vassakāra with their own hands served  satisfied the Saṅgha of monks with the Buddha at its head with exquisite staple  nonstaple food
Then when the Blessed One had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl Sunidha  Vassakāra taking a low seat sat to one side
As they were sitting there the Blessed One gave his approval with these verses
In whatever place a wise person makes his dwelling
there providing food for the virtuous the restrained leaders of the holy life
he should dedicate that offering to the devas there
They receiving honor will honor him being respected will show him respect
As a result they will feel sympathy for him like that of a mother for her child her son
A person with whom the devas sympathize always meets with auspicious things
Then the Blessed One having given his approval to Sunidha  Vassakāra with these verses got up from his seat and left
And on that occasion Sunidha  Vassakāra followed right after the Blessed One By whichever gate Gotama the contemplative departs today that will be called the Gotama Gate
And by whichever ford he crosses over the Ganges River that will be called the Gotama Ford 
So the gate by which the Blessed One departed was called the Gotama Gate
Then he went to the Ganges River
Now on that occasion the Ganges River was full up to the banks so that a crow could drink from it
Some people were searching for boats some were searching for floats some were binding rafts in hopes of going from this shore to the other
So the Blessed Onejust as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended armdisappeared from the near bank of the Ganges River and reappeared on the far bank together with the Saṅgha of monks
He saw that some people were searching for boats some were searching for floats some were binding rafts in hopes of going from this shore to the other
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Those who cross the foaming flood having made a bridge avoiding the swamps
while people are binding rafts intelligent people have already crossed
 The Lord said to Ananda Let us go to Kotigama
Very good Lord said Ananda
and the Lord went with a large company of monks to Kotigama
and stayed there
Then the Lord addressed the monks thus
Monks it is through not understanding not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that I as well as you have for a long time run on and gone round the cycle of birthanddeath
What are they
By not understanding the Noble Truth of Suffering we have fared on
by not understanding the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering
of the Cessation of Suffering
and of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering we have fared on round the cycle of birthanddeath
And by the understanding the penetration of the same Noble Truth of Suffering of the Origin of Suffering of the Cessation of Suffering and of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering the craving for becoming has been cut off the support of becoming has been destroyed there is no more rebecoming
The Lord having said this
the WellFarer having spoken the Teacher said
Not seeing the Four Noble Truths as they are
Having long traversed the round from life to life
These being seen becomings supports pulled up
Sorrows root cut off rebirth is done
Then the Lord while staying at Kotigama gave a comprehensive discourse This is morality this is concentration this is wisdom
Concentration when imbued with morality brings great fruit and profit
Wisdom when imbued with concentration brings great fruit and profit
The mind imbued with wisdom becomes completely free from the corruptions that is from the corruption of sensuality of becoming of false views and of ignorance
Now the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to Kotigama
So be it Lord
And the Blessed One took up his abode at Kotigama together with a large community of bhikkhus
And the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying
Bhikkhus it is through not realizing through not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that this long course of birth and death has been passed through and undergone by me as well as by you
What are these four
They are the noble truth of suffering
the noble truth of the origin of suffering
the noble truth of the cessation of suffering
and the noble truth of the way to the cessation of suffering
But now bhikkhus that these have been realized and penetrated cut off is the craving for existence destroyed is that which leads to renewed becoming and there is no fresh becoming
Thus it was said by the Blessed One
And the Happy One the Master further said
Through not seeing the Four Noble Truths
Long was the weary path from birth to birth
When these are known removed is rebirths cause
The root of sorrow plucked then ends rebirth
And also at Kotigama the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdom
Great becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct
great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration
utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom
Then the Blessed One said to Ven nanda Come nanda we will head for Koṭi Village
As you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One together with a large Saṅgha of monks went to Koṭi Village
There he stayed near Koṭi Village
And there he addressed the monks
Its through not awakening to or penetrating four noble truths monks that we have transmigrated and wandered on for such a long time you  I
Which four
Its through not awakening to or penetrating the noble truth of stress that we have transmigrated and wandered on for such a long time you  I
Its through not awakening to or penetrating the noble truth of the origination of stress
Its through not awakening to or penetrating the noble truth of the cessation of stress
Its through not awakening to or penetrating the noble truth of the path of practice leading to cessation of stress that we have transmigrated and wandered on for such a long time you  I
 this noble truth of stress has been awakened to  penetrated the noble truth of the origination of stress has been awakened to  penetrated the noble truth of the cessation of stress has been awakened to  penetrated the noble truth of the path of practice leading to cessation of stress has been awakened to  penetrated Craving for becoming has been crushed the guide to becoming ie clinging is ended There now is no furtherbecoming
That is what the Blessed One said
Having said it the Teacher the One WellGone said further
From lack of vision of the four noble truths
we have wandered a long time simply in these births  those
These are now seen the guide to becoming is removed
crushed is the root of suffering  stress There is now no furtherbecoming
While staying there near Koṭi Village the Blessed One often gave this Dhamma talk to the monks Such is virtue such is concentration such is discernment
Concentration nurtured with virtue is of great fruit great reward
Discernment nurtured with concentration is of great fruit great reward
The mind nurtured with discernment is rightly released from the effluents i e  the effluent of sensuality the effluent of becoming the effluent of ignorance 
When the Lord had stayed at Kotigama as long as he wished he said Ananda let us go to Nadika
Very good Lord said Ananda
and the Lord went with a large company of monks to Nadika
where he stayed at the Brick House
And the Venerable Ananda came to the Lord saluted him sat down to one side
and said Lord the monk Salha
and the nun Nanda have died at Nadika What rebirth have they taken after death
The layfollower Sudatta
and the laywomanfollower Sujata
the layfollowers Kakudha
Kalinga Nikata Katissabha Tuttha Santuttha Bhadda and Subhadda have all died in NadikaWhat rebirths have they taken
Ananda the monk Salha by the destruction of the corruptions attained in this life through his own superknowledge the uncorrupted liberation of mind the liberation by wisdom
The nun Nanda by the destruction of the five lower fetters has been spontaneously reborn and will gain Nibbana from that state without returning to this world
The lay follower Sudatta by the destruction of three fetters and the reduction of greedhatred and delusion is a OnceRetumer who will come back once more to this world and then make an end of suffering
The laywomanfollower Sujata by the destruction of three fetters is a StreamWinner incapable of falling into states of woe certain of attaining Nibbana
The layfollower Kakudha by the destruction of the five lower fetters has been spontaneously reborn and will gain Nibbana from that state without returning to this world
Likewise Kalinga Nikata Katissabha Tuttha Santuttha Bhadda and Subhadda
Ananda in Nadika more than fifty layfollowers have by the destruction of the five lower fetters been spontaneously reborn and will gain Nibbana from that state without returning to this world
Rather more than ninety by the destruction of three fetters and the reduction of greed hatred and delusion are OnceRetumers who will come back once more to this world and then make an end of suffering
And well over five hundred by the destruction of three fetters are StreamWinners incapable of falling into states of woe certain of attaining Nibbana
When the Blessed One had stayed at Kotigama as long as he pleased he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to Nadika
So be it Lord
And the Blessed One took up his abode in Nadika together with a large community of bhikkhus
staying in the Brick House
Then the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One and after greeting him respectfully sat down at one side
And he said to the Blessed One Here in Nadika Lord there have passed away the bhikkhu Salha
and the bhikkhuni Nanda
Likewise there have passed away the layman Sudatta
and the laywoman Sujata
likewise the layman Kakudha
Kalinga Nikata Katissabha Tuttha Santuttha Bhadda and Subhadda What is their destiny Lord What is their future state
The bhikkhu Salha Ananda through the destruction of the taints in this very lifetime has attained to the taintfree deliverance of mind and deliverance through wisdom having directly known and realized it by himself
The bhikkhuni Nanda Ananda through the destruction of the five lower fetters  has arisen spontaneously and will come to final cessation in that very place not liable to return from that world
The layman Sudatta Ananda through the destruction of the three fetters  and the lessening of lust hatred and delusion has become a oncereturner and is bound to make an end of suffering after having returned but once more to this world
The laywoman Sujata Ananda through the destruction of the three fetters has become a streamenterer and is safe from falling into the states of misery assured and bound for Enlightenment
The layman Kakudha Ananda through the destruction of the five lower fetters  has arisen spontaneously  and will come to final cessation in that very place not liable to return from that world
So it is with Kalinga Nikata Katissabha Tuttha Santuttha Bhadda and Subhadda
and with more than fifty laymen in Nadika
More than ninety laymen who have passed away in Nadika Ananda through the destruction of the three fetters and the lessening of lust hatred and delusion have become oncereturners and are bound to make an end of suffering after having returned but once more to this world
More than five hundred laymen who have passed away in Nadika Ananda through the complete destruction of the three fetters have become streamenterers and are safe from falling into the states of misery assured and bound for Enlightenment
Then the Blessed One having stayed near Koṭi Village as long as he pleased said to Ven nanda Come nanda we will head for Nādikā
As you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One together with a large Saṅgha of monks went to Nādikā
There he stayed near Nādikā at the Brick Hall
Then Ven nanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there Ven nanda said to the Blessed One Lord the monk named Sāḷha has died in Nādikā What is his destination what his future state
The nun named Nandā has died in Nādikā What is her destination what her future state
The male layfollower named Sudatta has died in Nādikā What is his destination what his future state

nanda the monk Sāḷha with the ending of effluents dwelt in the effluentfree awarenessrelease and discernmentrelease having directly known and realized them for himself right in the hereandnow
The nun Nandā with the ending of the five lower fetters has spontaneously arisen there to be totally unbound destined never again to return from that world

layfollowers who have died in Nādikā with the ending of the first three fetters are streamwinners never again destined for states of destitution certain headed for selfawakening
Ananda it is not remarkable that that which has come to be as a man should die
But that you should come to the Tathagata to ask the fate of each of those who have died that is a weariness to him
Therefore Ananda I will teach you a way of knowing Dhamma called the Mirror of Dhamma whereby the Ariyan disciple if he so wishes can discern of himself I have destroyed hell animalrebirth the realm of ghosts all downfall evil fates and sorry states I am a Stream Winner incapable of falling into states of woe certain of attaining Nibbana
And what is this Mirror of Dhamma by which he can know this
Here Ananda this Ariyan disciple is possessed of unwavering confidence in the Buddha thus This Blessed Lord is an Arahant a fullyenlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct the WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans enlightened and blessed
He is possessed of unwavering faith in the Dhamma thus Wellproclaimed by the Lord is the Dhamma visible here and now timeless inviting inspection leading onward to be comprehended by the wise each one for himself
He is possessed of unwavering confidence in the Sangha thus Welldirected is the Sangha of the Lords disciples of upright conduct on the right path on the perfect path that is to say the four pairs of persons the eight kinds of humans The Sangha of the Lords disciples is worthy of offerings worthy of hospitality worthy of gifts worthy of veneration an unsurpassed field of merit in the world
And he is possessed of morality dear to the Noble Ones unbroken without defect unspotted without inconsistency liberating uncorrupted and conducive to concentration
This Ananda is the Mirror of Dhamma whereby the Aryan disciple can discern of himself I have destroyed hell I am a StreamWinner certain of attaining Nibbana
Then the Lord staying at Nadika in the Brick House gave a comprehensive discourse to the monks
This is morality this is concentration this is wisdom
And when the Lord had stayed at Nadika as long as he wished
he went with a large company of monks to Vesall
where he stayed at Ambapalis grove
And there the Lord addressed the monks Monks a monk should be mindful and clearly aware this is our charge to you
And how is a monk mindful
Here a monk abides contemplating the body as body earnestly clearly aware mindful and having put away all hankering and fretting for the world
and likewise with regard to feelings mind and mindobjects
That is how a monk is mindful
And how is a monk clearly aware
Here a monk when going forward or backward is aware of what he is doing in looking forward or back he is aware of what he is doing in bending and stretching he is aware of what he is doing in carrying his inner and outer robe and bowl he is aware of what he is doing in eating drinking chewing and savouring he is aware of what he is doing in passing excrement or urine he is aware of what he is doing in walking standing sitting or lying down in keeping awake in speaking or in staying silent he is aware of what he is doing
That is how a monk is clearly aware
A monk should be mindful and clearly aware this is our charge to you
But truly Ananda it is nothing strange that human beings should die
But if each time it happens you should come to the Tathagata and ask about them in this manner indeed it would be troublesome to him
Therefore Ananda I will give you the teaching called the Mirror of the Dhamma possessing which the noble disciple should he so desire can declare of himself There is no more rebirth for me in hell nor as an animal or ghost nor in any realm of woe A streamenterer am I safe from falling into the states of misery assured am I and bound for Enlightenment
And what Ananda is that teaching called the Mirror of Dhamma possessing which the noble disciple may thus declare of himself
In this case Ananda the noble disciple possesses unwavering faith in the Buddha thus The Blessed One is an Arahant the Fully Enlightened One perfect in knowledge and conduct the Happy One the knower of the world the paramount trainer of beings the teacher of gods and men the Enlightened One the Blessed One
He possesses unwavering faith in the Dhamma thus Well propounded by the Blessed One is the Dhamma evident timeless inviting investigation leading to emancipation to be comprehended by the wise each for himself
He possesses unwavering faith in the Blessed Ones Order of Disciples thus Well faring is the Blessed Ones Order of Disciples righteously wisely and dutifully that is to say the four pairs of men the eight classes of persons The Blessed Ones Order of Disciples is worthy of honor of hospitality of offerings of veneration  the supreme field for meritorious deeds in the world
And he possesses virtues that are dear to the Noble Ones complete and perfect spotless and pure which are liberating praised by the wise uninfluenced  and favorable to concentration of mind
This Ananda is the teaching called the Mirror of the Dhamma whereby the noble disciple may thus know of himself There is no more rebirth for me in hell nor as an animal or ghost nor in any realm of woe A streamenterer am I safe from falling into the states of misery assured am I and bound for Enlightenment
And also in Nadika in the Brick House the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus
Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdom
Great becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct
great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration
utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom
When the Blessed One had stayed in Nadika as long as he pleased he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to Vesali
So be it O Lord
And the Blessed One took up his abode in Vesali together with a large community of bhikkhus
and stayed in Ambapalis grove
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying
Mindful should you dwell bhikkhus clearly comprehending thus I exhort you
And how bhikkhus is a bhikkhu mindful
When he dwells contemplating the body in the body earnestly clearly comprehending and mindfully after having overcome desire and sorrow in regard to the world
and when he dwells contemplating feelings in feelings the mind in the mind and mental objects in mental objects earnestly clearly comprehending and mindfully after having overcome desire and sorrow in regard to the world
then is he said to be mindful
And how bhikkhus does a bhikkhu have clear comprehension
When he remains fully aware of his coming and going his looking forward and his looking away his bending and stretching his wearing of his robe and carrying of his bowl his eating and drinking masticating and savoring his defecating and urinating his walking standing sitting lying down going to sleep or keeping awake his speaking or being silent
then is he said to have clear comprehension
Mindful should you dwell bhikkhus clearly comprehending thus I exhort you
Its not amazing nanda that anyone who has become a human being would die
But if with every death you approach the Tathāgata and ask about this matter that would be wearisome for him
Therefore nanda I will teach you the Dhammadiscourse called the Dhammamirror endowed with which a disciple of the noble ones if heshe so desires may predict for him or herself Hell is ended for me animal wombs are ended the state of the hungry ghosts is ended planes of deprivation the bad destinations the lower realms are ended I am a streamwinner never again destined for the lower realms certain headed for selfawakening
And what is the Dhammamirror Dhammadiscourse endowed with which a disciple of the noble ones if heshe so desires may predict for him or herself Hell is ended for me animal wombs are ended the state of the hungry ghosts is ended planes of deprivation the bad destinations the lower realms are ended I am a streamwinner never again destined for the lower realms certain headed for selfawakening
There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Awakened One Indeed the Blessed One is worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in clearknowing  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the cosmos unexcelled trainer of people fit to be tamed teacher of devas  human beings awakened blessed

While staying there near Nādikā in the Brick House the Blessed One often gave this Dhamma talk to the monks
Such is virtue such is concentration such is discernment
Concentration nurtured with virtue is of great fruit great reward
Discernment nurtured with concentration is of great fruit great reward
The mind nurtured with discernment is rightly released from effluents i e  the effluent of sensuality the effluent of becoming the effluent of ignorance 
Then the Blessed One having stayed near Nādikā as long as he pleased said to Ven nanda Come nanda we will head for Vesālī
As you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One together with a large Saṅgha of monks went to Vesālī
There he stayed near Vesālī in Ambapālīs grove
And there he addressed the monks
Stay mindful monks and alert This is our instruction to you all
And how is a monk mindful
There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itselfardent alert  mindfulsubduing greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelings mind mental qualities in  of themselvesardent alert  mindfulsubduing greed  distress with reference to the world
This is how a monk is mindful
And how is a monk alert
When going forward  returning he makes himself alert when looking toward  looking away when bending  extending his limbs when carrying his outer cloak his upper robe  his bowl when eating drinking chewing  savoring when urinating  defecating when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking  remaining silent he makes himself alert
This is how a monk is alert
Stay mindful monks and alert This is our instruction to you all
Now Ambapali the courtesan heard that the Lord had arrived at Vesall and was staying at her grove
She had the best carriages made ready
and drove from Vesali to her park
She drove as far as the ground would allow then alighted and went on foot to where the Lord was She saluted the Lord and sat down to one side
and as she sat the Lord instructed inspired fired and delighted her with a talk on Dhamma
And being thus delighted Ambapali said Lord may the Lord consent to take a meal from me tomorrow with his order of monks
The Lord consented by silence
and Ambapali understanding his acceptance rose from her seat saluted the Lord and passing him by to the right departed
And the Licchavis of Vesall heard that the Lord had arrived at Vesall and was staying at Ambapalls grove
So they had the best carriages made ready and drove out of Vesall
And some of the young Licchavis were all in blue with blue makeup blue clothes and blue adornment while some were in yellow some in red some in white with white makeup white clothes and white adornment
And Ambapali met the young Licchavis axle to axle wheel to wheel yoke to yoke
And they said to her Ambapali why do you drive up against us like that
 Because young sirs the Blessed Lord has been invited by me for a meal with his order of monks
Ambapali give up this meal for a hundred thousand pieces
Young sirs if you were to give me all Vesall with its revenues I would not give up such an important meal
Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers saying Weve been beaten by the mangowoman weve been cheated by the mangowoman
And they set out for Ambapalls grove
And the Lord having seen the Licchavis from afar
said Monks any of you who have not seen the ThirtyThree Gods just look at this troop of Licchavis Take a good look at them and you will get an idea of the ThirtyThree Gods
Then the Licchavis drove in their carriages as far as the ground would allow then they alighted and went on foot to where the Lord was saluted him and sat down to one side
And as they sat the Lord instructed inspired fired and delighted them with a talk on Dhamma
And being thus delighted they said Lord may the Lord consent to take a meal from us tomorrow with his order of monks
But Licchavis I have already accepted a meal for tomorrow from the courtesan Ambapali
And the Licchavis snapped their fingers saying Weve been beaten by the mangowoman weve been cheated by the mangowoman
Then having rejoiced and delighted in his talk they rose from their seats saluted the Lord and passing him by on the right departed
And Ambapali when night was nearly over having had choice hard and soft food prepared at her home announced to the Lord that the meal was ready
Having dressed and taken robe and bowl the Lord went with the order of monks to Ambapalls residence and sat down on the prepared seat
And she served the Buddha and his monks with choice hard and soft food till they were satisfied
And when the Lord had taken his hand from the bowl Ambapali took a low stool and sat down to one side
So seated she said Lord I give this park to the order of monks with the Buddha as its head
The Lord accepted the park
and then he instructed inspired fired and delighted her with a talk on Dhamma after which he rose from his seat and departed
Then while staying at Vesall the Lord delivered a comprehensive discourse to the monks This is morality this is concentration this is wisdom 
Then Ambapali the courtesan came to know The Blessed One they say has arrived at Vesali and is now staying in my Mango Grove
And she ordered a large number of magnificent carriages to be made ready mounted one of them herself and accompanied by the rest
drove out from Vesali towards her park
She went by carriage as far as the carriage could go then alighted and approaching the Blessed One on foot she respectfully greeted him and sat down at one side
And the Blessed One instructed Ambapali the courtesan in the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened her
Thereafter Ambapali the courtesan spoke to the Blessed One saying May the Blessed One O Lord please accept my invitation for tomorrows meal together with the community of bhikkhus
And by his silence the Blessed One consented
Sure then of the Blessed Ones consent Ambapali the courtesan rose from her seat respectfully saluted him and keeping her right side towards him took her departure
Then the Licchavi of Vesali came to know The Blessed One they say has arrived at Vesali and is now staying in Ambapalis grove
And they ordered a large number of magnificent carriages to be made ready each mounted one and accompanied by the rest drove out from Vesali
Now of these Licchavis some were in blue with clothing and ornaments all of blue while others were in yellow red and white
And it so happened that Ambapali the courtesan drove up against the young Licchavis axle by axle wheel by wheel and yoke by yoke
Thereupon the Licchavis exclaimed Why do you drive up against us in this fashion Ambapali 
Thus it is indeed my princes and not otherwise For the Blessed One is invited by me for tomorrows meal together with the community of bhikkhus
Give up the meal Ambapali for a hundred thousand
But she replied Even if you were to give me Vesali sirs together with its tributary lands I would not give up a meal of such importance
Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers in annoyance See friends We are defeated by this mango lass We are utterly outdone by this mango lass
But they continued on their way to Ambapalis grove
And the Blessed One beheld the Licchavis from afar as they drove up
Then he spoke to the bhikkhus saying Those of you bhikkhus who have not yet seen the Thirtythree gods may behold the assembly of the Licchavis and may gaze on them for they are comparable to the assembly of the Thirtythree gods
Then the Licchavis drove their carriages as far as the carriages could go then alighted and approaching the Blessed One on foot they respectfully greeted him and sat down at one side
The Blessed One instructed the Licchavis in the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened them
Thereafter the Licchavis spoke to the Blessed One saying May the Blessed One O Lord please accept our invitation for tomorrows meal together with the community of bhikkhus
The invitation for tomorrows meal Licchavis has been accepted by me from Ambapali the courtesan
Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers in annoyance See friends We are defeated by this mango lass We are utterly outdone by this mango lass
And then the Licchavis approving of the Blessed Ones words and delighted with them rose from their seats respectfully saluted him and keeping their right sides towards him took their departure
Then after the night had passed Ambapali the courtesan had choice food hard and soft prepared in her park and announced it to the Blessed One It is time O Lord the meal is ready
Thereupon the Blessed One got ready in the forenoon and taking bowl and robe he went together with the community of bhikkhus to Ambapalis dwelling and there he took the seat prepared for him
And Ambapali herself attended on the community of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha and served them with choice food hard and soft
And when the Blessed One had finished his meal and had removed his hand from his bowl Ambapali the courtesan took a low seat and placing herself at one side
spoke to the Blessed One saying This park O Lord I offer to the community of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha
And the Blessed One accepted the park
He then instructed Ambapali in the Dhamma and having roused edified and gladdened her he rose from his seat and departed
And also at Vesali in Ambapalis grove the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdom
Great becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct
great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration
utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom
Then Ambapālī the courtesan heard The Blessed One they say has arrived at Vesālī and is staying near Vesālī in my mango amba grove
Then having auspicious vehicles yoked she got into an auspicious vehicle left Vesālī with the auspicious vehicles
and drove toward her own garden the grove
Going in her vehicle as far as there was ground for a vehicle getting down from her vehicle she approached the Blessed One on foot On arrival having bowed down to him she sat to one side
As she was sitting there the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged her with a talk on Dhamma
Then Ambapālī the courtesaninstructed urged roused  encouraged with the Blessed Ones talk on Dhammasaid to him Lord may the Blessed One acquiesce to my meal tomorrow together with the Saṅgha of monks
 The Blessed One acquiesced with silence
Then Ambapālī the courtesan understanding the Blessed Ones acquiescence got up from her seat and bowing down to him and circumambulating him left
Then the Licchavis of Vesālī heard The Blessed One they say has arrived at Vesālī and is staying near Vesālī in Ambapālīs grove
Then having auspicious vehicles yoked the Licchavis got into the auspicious vehicles and left Vesālī with the auspicious vehicles
Now some of those Licchavis were dark blue with dark blue complexions dark blue clothing  dark blue ornaments Some of those Licchavis were yellow with yellow complexions yellow clothing  yellow ornaments Some of those Licchavis were red with red complexions red clothing  red ornaments Some of those Licchavis were white with white complexions white clothing  white ornaments
Then Ambapālī the courtesan driving axle to axle wheel to wheel yoke to yoke brought those young Licchavis to a halt
So those Licchavis said to her Hey Ambapālī what are you doingdriving axle to axle wheel to wheel yoke to yokebringing the young Licchavis to a halt 
Because young masters I have invited the Blessed One together with the Saṅgha of monks for tomorrows meal
Give us that meal Ambapālī for 
Even if the masters gave me Vesālī with all its revenue I still wouldnt give up such a great meal
Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers How weve been defeated by Little Ambapālī How weve been cheated by Little Ambapālī
Then the Licchavis set out for Ambapālīs grove
The Blessed One saw them coming from afar
and on seeing them he said to the monks Those monks who have never before seen the Devas of the Thirtythree look at the assembly of Licchavis Gaze at the assembly of Licchavis Regard the assembly of Licchavis as like the assembly of the Thirtythree
Then the Licchavis going in their vehicles as far as there was ground for vehicles got down from their vehicles and approached the Blessed One on foot On arrival having bowed down to him they sat to one side
As they were sitting there the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged them with a talk on Dhamma
Then the Licchavisinstructed urged roused and encouraged with the Blessed Ones talk on Dhammasaid to him Lord may the Blessed One acquiesce to our meal tomorrow together with the Saṅgha of monks 
Licchavis I have already acquiesced to Ambapālī the courtesans meal tomorrow 
Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers How weve been defeated by Little Ambapālī How weve been cheated by Little Ambapālī
Then the Licchavis delighting in and approving of the Blessed Ones words got up from their seats and bowing down to him and circumambulating him left
Then Ambapālī the courtesan at the end of the nightafter having exquisite staple  nonstaple food prepared in her own gardenannounced the time to the Blessed One Its time lord The meal is ready 
Then the Blessed One early in the morning adjusted his lower robe andtaking his bowl  outer robewent together with the Saṅgha of monks to Ambapālī the courtesans meal offering On arrival he sat down on the seat laid out
Ambapālī the courtesan with her own hands served  satisfied the Saṅgha of monks with the Buddha at its head with exquisite staple  nonstaple food
Then when the Blessed One had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl Ambapālī the courtesan taking a low seat sat to one side
As she was sitting there she said to the Blessed One Lord I give this garden to the Saṅgha of monks with the Buddha at its head 
The the Blessed One accepted the garden
Thenhaving instructed urged roused  encouraged Ambapālī the courtesan with a talk on Dhammagot up from his seat and left
While staying there near Vesālī in Ambapālīs grove the Blessed One often gave this Dhamma talk to the monks Such is virtue such is concentration such is discernment
Concentration nurtured with virtue is of great fruit great reward
Discernment nurtured with concentration is of great fruit great reward
The mind nurtured with discernment is rightly released from the effluents i e  the effluent of sensuality the effluent of becoming the effluent of ignorance 
And when the Lord had stayed at Ambapalls grove as long as he wished
he went with a large company of monks to the little village of Beluva
where he stayed
There the Lord said to the monks You monks should go to anywhere in Vesall where you have friends or acquaintances or supporters and spend the Rains there
I shall spend the Rains here in Beluva
Very good Lord replied the monks and they did so
but the Lord spent the Rains in Beluva
And during the Rains the Lord was attacked by a severe sickness witlj sharp pains as if he were about to die
But he endured all this mindfully clearly aware and without complaining
He thought It is not fitting that I should attain final Nibbana without addressing my followers and taking leave of the order of monks
I must hold this disease in check by energy and apply myself to the force of life
He did so
and the disease abated
Then the Lord having recovered from his sickness as soon as he felt better went outside and sat on a prepared seat in front of his dwelling
Then the Venerable Ananda came to him saluted him sat down to one side 
and said Lord I have seen the Lord in comfort and I have seen the Lords patient enduring And Lord my body was like a drunkards
I lost my bearings and things were unclear to me because of the Lords sickness The only thing that was some comfort to me was the thought The Lord will not attain final Nibbana until he has made some statement about the order of monks
But Ananda what does the order of monks expect of me
I have taught the Dhamma Ananda making no inner and outer
the Tathagata has no teachers fist in respect of doctrines
If there is anyone who thinks I shall take charge of the order or The order should refer to me let him make some statement about the order
but the Tathagata does not think in such terms
So why should the Tathagata make a statement about the order
Ananda I am now old worn out venerable one who has traversed lifes path I have reached the term of life
which is eighty
Just as an old cart is made to go by being held together with straps so the Tathagatas body is kept going by being strapped up
It is only when the Tathagata withdraws his attention from outward signs and by the cessation of certain feelings enters into the signless concentration of mind that his body knows comfort
Therefore Ananda you should live as islands unto yourselves being your own refuge with no on else as your refuge with the Dhamma as an island with the Dhamma as your refuge with no other refuge
And how does a monk live as an island unto himself with no other refuge
Here Ananda a monk abides contemplating the body as body earnestly clearly aware mindful and having put away all hankering and fretting for the world and likewise with regard to feelings mind and mindobjects
That Ananda is how a monk lives as an island unto himself with no other refuge
And those who now in my time or afterwards live thus they will become the highest if they are desirous of learning
End of second recitationsection
When the Blessed One had stayed in Ambapalis grove as long as he pleased he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to the village of Beluva
So be it Lord
And the Blessed One took up his abode in the village of Beluva together with a large community of bhikkhus
At that time the Blessed One spoke to the bhikkhus saying Go now bhikkhus and seek shelter anywhere in the neighborhood of Vesali where you are welcome among acquaintances and friends and there spend the rainy season
As for me I shall spend the rainy season in this very place in the village of Beluva
So be it O Lord the bhikkhus said
But when the Blessed One had entered upon the rainy season there arose in him a severe illness and sharp and deadly pains came upon him
And the Blessed One endured them mindfully clearly comprehending and unperturbed
Then it occurred to the Blessed One It would not be fitting if I came to my final passing away without addressing those who attended on me without taking leave of the community of bhikkhus
Then let me suppress this illness by strength of will resolve to maintain the life process and live on
And the Blessed One suppressed the illness by strength of will resolved to maintain the life process and lived on
So it came about that the Blessed Ones illness was allayed
And the Blessed One recovered from that illness and soon after his recovery he came out from his dwelling place and sat down in the shade of the building on a seat prepared for him
Then the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One respectfully greeted him and sitting down at one side he spoke to the Blessed One
saying Fortunate it is for me O Lord to see the Blessed One at ease again Fortunate it is for me O Lord to see the Blessed One recovered For truly Lord when I saw the Blessed Ones sickness it was as though my own body became weak as a creeper
every thing around became dim to me and my senses failed me Yet Lord I still had some little comfort in the thought that the Blessed One would not come to his final passing away until he had given some last instructions respecting the community of bhikkhus
Thus spoke the Venerable Ananda but the Blessed One answered him saying What more does the community of bhikkhus expect from me Ananda
I have set forth the Dhamma without making any distinction of esoteric and exoteric doctrine
there is nothing Ananda with regard to the teachings that the Tathagata holds to the last with the closed fist of a teacher who keeps some things back
Whosoever may think that it is he who should lead the community of bhikkhus or that the community depends upon him it is such a one that would have to give last instructions respecting them
But Ananda the Tathagata has no such idea as that it is he who should lead the community of bhikkhus or that the community depends upon him
So what instructions should he have to give respecting the community of bhikkhus
Now I am frail Ananda old aged far gone in years and my life is spent
This is my eightieth year
Even as an old cart Ananda is held together with much difficulty so the body of the Tathagata is kept going only with supports
It is Ananda only when the Tathagata disregarding external objects with the cessation of certain feelings attains to and abides in the signless concentration of mind that his body is more comfortable
Therefore Ananda be islands unto yourselves refuges unto yourselves seeking no external refuge with the Dhamma as your island the Dhamma as your refuge seeking no other refuge
And how Ananda is a bhikkhu an island unto himself a refuge unto himself seeking no external refuge with the Dhamma as his island the Dhamma as his refuge seeking no other refuge
When he dwells contemplating the body in the body earnestly clearly comprehending and mindfully after having overcome desire and sorrow in regard to the world
when he dwells contemplating feelings in feelings the mind in the mind and mental objects in mental objects earnestly clearly comprehending and mindfully after having overcome desire and sorrow in regard to the world
then truly he is an island unto himself a refuge unto himself seeking no external refuge having the Dhamma as his island the Dhamma as his refuge seeking no other refuge
Those bhikkhus of mine Ananda who now or after I am gone abide as an island unto themselves as a refuge unto themselves seeking no other refuge having the Dhamma as their island and refuge seeking no other refuge it is they who will become the highest if they have the desire to learn
Then the Blessed One having stayed in Ambapālīs grove as long as he pleased said to Ven nanda Come nanda we will head for Veḷuva Village
As you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One together with a large Saṅgha of monks went to Veḷuva Village
There he stayed near Veḷuva Village
And there he addressed the monks Come monks enter the Rains retreat around Vesālī with your friends acquaintances  eating companions
As for me I will enter the Rains retreat right here near Veḷuva Village
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One the monks entered the Rains retreat around Vesālī with their friends acquaintances  eating companions
The Blessed One entered the Rains retreat right there near Veḷuva Village
Then in the Blessed One when he had entered the Rains retreat there arose a severe disease with intense pains  deadly
But the Blessed One endured itmindful alert  not struck down by it
The thought occurred to him It would not be proper for me to totally unbind without having addressed my attendants or taken leave of the Saṅgha of monks
Why dont I bending back this disease with persistence keep determining the fabrications of life
 So the Blessed One bending back the disease with persistence kept determining the fabrications of life
And his disease calmed down
Then the Blessed Onehaving recovered from being ill not long recovered from the illnesswent out of the dwelling and sat down on a seat laid out behind the dwelling
Then Ven nanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One What a happy sight to see the Blessed Ones comfort What a happy sight to see the Blessed Ones being at ease Because of the Blessed Ones illness my own body felt as if it were drugged
I lost my bearings Things were unclear to me Yet I still took a measure of reassurance in the thought that the Blessed One would not totally unbind as long as he hadnt given at least some pronouncement concerning the Saṅgha of monks 
What more does the Saṅgha of monks want from me nanda
I have taught the Dhamma without making an inside or outside 
The Tathāgata has no closed fist with regard to teachings
To whomever the thought occurs I will govern the Saṅgha of monks or The Saṅgha of monks looks to me he should give some pronouncement concerning the Saṅgha of monks
But the thought doesnt occur to the Tathāgata that I will govern the Saṅgha of monks or The Saṅgha of monks looks to me
 So why should he give some pronouncement concerning the Saṅgha of monks
I am now aged nanda old elderly advanced in years having come to the last stage of life  years old
Just as an old cart is kept going with the help of bamboo strips the Tathāgatas body is kept going with the help of bamboo strips as it were
When the Tathāgatanot attending to any theme at all and with the cessation of certain feelingsenters  remains in the themeless concentration of awareness that is when his body is more at ease
So nanda you should all live with yourselves as your island yourselves as your refuge with no other as your refuge with the Dhamma as your island the Dhamma as your refuge with no other as your refuge
And how does a monk live with himself as his island himself as his refuge with no other as his refuge with the Dhamma as his island the Dhamma as his refuge with no other as his refuge
There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itselfardent alert  mindfulsubduing greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelings in  of themselves mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselvesardent alert  mindfulsubduing greed  distress with reference to the world
This is how a monk lives with himself as his island himself as his refuge with no other as his refuge with the Dhamma as his island the Dhamma as his refuge with no other as his refuge
For those who now or when I am gone live with themselves as their island themselves as their refuge with no other as their refuge with the Dhamma as their island the Dhamma as their refuge not with another as their refuge will be my foremost monks those who are desirous of training
 Then the Lord rising early dressed took his robe and bowl and entered Vesall for alms
Having eaten on his return from the almsround he said to the Venerable Ananda Bring a mat Ananda We will go to the Capala Shrine for the siesta
Very good Lord said Ananda and getting a mat he followed behind
Then the Lord came to the Capala Shrine and sat down on the prepared seat
Ananda saluted the Lord and sat down to one side
and the Lord said Ananda Vesali is delightful the Udena Shrine is delightful the Gotamaka Shrine is delightful the Sattambaka Shrine is delightful the Bahuputta Shrine is delightful the Capala Shrine is delightful
Ananda whoever has developed the four roads to power practised them frequently made them his vehicle made them his base established them become familiar with them and properly undertaken them could undoubtedly live for a century or the remainder of one
The Tathagata has developed these powers   properly undertaken them And he could Ananda undoubtedly live for a century or the remainder of one
But the Venerable Ananda failing to grasp this broad hint this clear sign did not beg the Lord Lord may the Blessed Lord stay for a century may the WellFarer stay for a century for the benefit and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit and happiness of devas and humans so much was his mind possessed by Mara 
And a second time and a third time
Then the Lord said Ananda go now and do what seems fitting to you
Very good Lord said Ananda and rising from his seat he saluted the Lord passed by on the right and sat down under a tree some distance away
Then the Blessed One getting ready in the forenoon took bowl and robe and went into Vesali for alms
After the alms round and meal on his return he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Take up a mat Ananda and let us spend the day at the Capala shrine
So be it Lord And the Venerable Ananda took up a mat and followed behind the Blessed One step by step
And the Blessed One went to the Capala shrine and sat down on the seat prepared for him
And when the Venerable Ananda had seated himself at one side after he had respectfully saluted the Blessed One
the Lord said to him Pleasant Ananda is Vesali pleasant are the shrines of Udena Gotamaka Sattambaka Bahuputta Sarandada and Capala
And the Blessed One said Whosoever Ananda has developed practiced employed strengthened maintained scrutinized and brought to perfection the four constituents of psychic power could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of it
The Tathagata Ananda has done so Therefore the Tathagata could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of it
But the Venerable Ananda was unable to grasp the plain suggestion the significant prompting given by the Blessed One As though his mind was influenced by Mara he did not beseech the Blessed One May the Blessed One remain O Lord May the Happy One remain O Lord throughout the worldperiod for the welfare and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit well being and happiness of gods and men
And when for a second and a third time the Blessed One repeated his words the Venerable Ananda remained silent
Then the Blessed One said to the Venerable Ananda Go now Ananda and do as seems fit to you
Even so O Lord And the Venerable Ananda rising from his seat respectfully saluted the Blessed One and keeping his right side towards him took his seat under a tree some distance away
Then the Blessed One early in the morning adjusted his lower robe andtaking his bowl  outer robewent into Vesālī for alms
Then having gone for alms in Vesālī after the meal returning from his alms round he addressed Ven nanda Get a sitting cloth nanda We will go to the Pāvāla shrine for the days abiding 
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven nanda followed along behind the Blessed One carrying the sitting cloth
Then the Blessed One went to the Pāvāla shrine and on arrival sat down on the seat laid out
Seated the Blessed One addressed Ven nanda Vesālī is refreshing nanda Refreshing too are the Udena shrine the Gotamaka shrine the Sattamba shrine the ManySon shrine the Sāranda shrine the Pāvāla shrine 
Anyone nanda in whom the four bases of power are developed pursued given a means of transport given a grounding steadied consolidated and wellundertaken couldif he wantedremain for an eon or the remainder of an eon
In the Tathāgata nanda the four bases of power are developed pursued given a means of transport given a grounding steadied consolidated and wellundertaken He couldif he wantedremain for an eon or the remainder of an eon 
But Ven nandaeven when the Blessed One had given such a blatant sign such a blatant hintwasnt able to understand his meaning He didnt beg of him Lord may the Blessed One remain for an eon May the One WellGone remain for an eonfor the benefit of the many for the happiness of the many out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of human beings  devas It was as if his mind was possessed by Māra
A second time A third time the Blessed One addressed Ven nanda Vesālī is refreshing nanda Refreshing too are the Udena shrine the Gotamaka shrine the Sattamba shrine the ManySon shrine the Sāranda shrine the Pāvāla shrine
Anyone nanda in whom the four bases of power are developed pursued given a means of transport given a grounding steadied consolidated and wellundertaken couldif he wantedremain for an eon or the remainder of an eon
In the Tathāgata nanda the four bases of power are developed pursued given a means of transport given a grounding steadied consolidated and wellundertaken He couldif he wantedremain for an eon or the remainder of an eon 
But Ven nandaeven when the Blessed One had given such a blatant sign such a blatant hintwasnt able to understand his meaning He didnt request of him Lord may the Blessed One remain for an eon May the One WellGone remain for an eonfor the benefit of the many for the happiness of the many out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of human beings  devas  It was as if his mind was possessed by Māra
Then the Blessed One addressed Ven nanda Go nanda Do what you think it is now time to do
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven nanda got up from his seat and bowing down to him and circumambulating him went to sit under a tree not far from the Blessed One
Soon after Ananda had left Mara the Evil One came to the Lord stood to one side and said Lord may the Blessed Lord now attain final Nibbana may the WellFarer now attain final Nibbana
Now is the time for the Blessed Lords final Nibbana
Because the Blessed Lord has said this Evil One I will not take final Nibbana till I have monks and disciples who are accomplished trained skilled learned knowers of the Dhamma trained in conformity with the Dhamma correctly trained and walking in the path of the Dhamma who will pass on what they have gained from their Teacher teach it declare it establish it expound it analyse it make it clear till they shall be able by means of the Dhamma to refute false teachings that have arisen and teach the Dhamma of wondrous effect 
And now Lord the Blessed Lord has such monks and disciples
May the Blessed Lord now attain final Nibbana may the WellFarer now attain final Nibbana Now is the time for the Blessed Lords final Nibbana
And the Blessed Lord has said I will not take final Nibbana till I have nuns and female disciples who are accomplished
till I have laymen followers
till I have laywomenfollowers 
May the Blessed Lord now take final Nibbana
And the Blessed Lord has said Evil One I will not take final Nibbana till this holy life has been successfully established and flourishes is widespread wellknown far and wide wellpro claimed among mankind everywhere
And all this has come about
May the Blessed Lord now attain final Nibbana may the WellFarer now attain final Nibbana Now is the time for the Blessed Lords final Nibbana
At this the Lord said to Mara You need not worry Evil One The Tathagatas final passing will not be long delayed
Three months from now the Tathagata will take final Nibbana
And when the Venerable Ananda had gone away Mara the Evil One approached the Blessed One
And standing at one side he spoke to the Blessed One saying Now O Lord let the Blessed One come to his final passing away let the Happy One utterly pass away The time has come for the Parinibbana of the Lord
For the Blessed One O Lord spoke these words to me I shall not come to my final passing away Evil One until my bhikkhus and bhikkhunis laymen and laywomen have come to be true disciples  wise well disciplined apt and learned preservers of the Dhamma living according to the Dhamma abiding by the appropriate conduct and having learned the Masters word are able to expound it preach it proclaim it establish it reveal it explain it in detail and make it clear until when adverse opinions arise they shall be able to refute them thoroughly and well and to preach this convincing and liberating Dhamma
And now O Lord bhikkhus
and bhikkhunis
laymen and
laywomen have become the Blessed Ones disciples in just this way
So O Lord let the Blessed One come to his final passing away The time has come for the Parinibbana of the Lord
For the Blessed One O Lord spoke these words to me I shall not come to my final passing away Evil One until this holy life taught by me has become successful prosperous farrenowned popular and widespread until it is well proclaimed among gods and men
And this too has come to pass in just this way
So O Lord let the Blessed One come to his final passing away let the Happy One utterly pass away The time has come for the Parinibbana of the Lord
When this was said the Blessed One spoke to Mara the Evil One saying Do not trouble yourself Evil One Before long the Parinibbana of the Tathagata will come about
Three months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass away
Then not long after Ven nanda had left Māra the Evil One went to the Blessed One and on arrival stood to one side
As he was standing there he said to the Blessed One May the Blessed One totally unbind now lord May the One WellGone totally unbind now lord Now is the time for the Blessed Ones total unbinding lord
After all these words were said by the Blessed One Evil One I will not totally unbind as long as my monk disciples are not yet experienced trained attained to confidence desiring rest from the yoke learned maintaining the Dhamma practicing the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma practicing masterfully living in line with the Dhamma declaring the Dhammaafter having learned it from their own teachersteaching it describing it setting it forth revealing it explaining it making it plain wellrefuting in line with the Dhamma any opposing teachings that have arisen teaching the Dhamma with its marvels

May the Blessed One totally unbind now lord May the One WellGone totally unbind now lord Now is the time for the Blessed Ones total unbinding lord 
When this was said the Blessed One said to Māra the Most Evil One Relax Evil One It wont be long until the Tathāgatas total unbinding
In three months time from now the Tathāgata will totally unbind
So the Lord at the Capala Shrine mindfully and in full awareness renounced the lifeprinciple
and when this occurred there was a great earthquake terrible hairraising and accompanied by thunder
And when the Lord saw this he uttered this verse
Gross or fine things become the sage abjured
Calm composed he burst becomings shell
And at the Capala shrine the Blessed One thus mindfully and clearly comprehending renounced his will to live on
And upon the Lords renouncing his will to live on there came a tremendous earthquake dreadful and astonishing and thunder rolled across the heavens
And the Blessed One beheld it with understanding and made this solemn utterance
What causes life unbounded or confined  His process of becoming  this the Sage Renounces
With inward calm and joy he breaks As though a coat of mail his own lifes cause
Thus at the Pāvāla shrinemindful  alertthe Blessed One relinquished the fabrications of life
And as the Blessed One relinquished the fabrications of life there was a great earthquake awesome  hairraising and rolls of the devadrums split 
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Comparing the incomparable with comingintobeing the sage relinquished the fabrication of becoming
Inwardly joyful centered he split his own comingintobeing like a coat of mail
And the Venerable Ananda thought It is marvellous it is wonderful how this great earthquake arises this terrible earthquake so dreadful and hairraising accompanied by thunder
Whatever can have caused it
He went to the Lord saluted him sat down to one side and asked him that question
Ananda there are eight reasons eight causes for the appearance of a great earthquake
This great earth is established on water the water on the wind the wind on space
And when a mighty wind blows
this stirs up the water
and through the stirringup of the water the earth quakes
That is the first reason
In the second place there is an ascetic or Brahmin who has developed psychic powers or a mighty and powerful deva whose earthconsciousness is weakly developed and his waterconsciousness is immeasurable
and he makes the earth shudder and shake and violently quake
That is the second reason
Again when a Bodhisatta descends from the Tusita Heaven mindful and clearly aware into his mothers womb then the earth shudders and shakes and violently quakes
That is the third reason
Again when the Bodhisatta emerges from his mothers womb mindful and clearly aware then the earth shudders and shakes and violently quakes
That is the fourth reason
Again when the Tathagata gains unsurpassed enlightenment then the earth shudders and shakes and violently quakes
That is the fifth reason
Again when the Tathagata sets in motion the Wheel of the Dhamma then the earth shudders and shakes and violently quakes
That is the sixth reason
Again when the Tathagata mindful and clearly aware renounces the lifeprinciple then the earth shudders and shakes and violently quake
Again when the Tathagata gains the Nibbana element without remainder then the earth shudders and shakes and violently quakes
That is the eighth reason
These Ananda are the eight reasons the eight causes for the appearance of a great earthquake
Then it came to the mind of the Venerable Ananda Marvellous it is indeed and most wonderful The earth shakes mightily tremendously Dreadful and astonishing it is how the thunders roll across the heavens
What could be the reason what the cause that so mighty an earthquake should arise
And the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One and respectfully greeting him sat down at one sideThen he spoke to the Blessed One saying Marvellous it is indeed and most wonderful The earth shakes mightily tremendously Dreadful and astonishing it is how the thunders roll across the heavens
What could be the reason what the cause that so mighty an earthquake should arise 
Then the Blessed One said There are eight reasons Ananda eight causes for a mighty earthquake to arise
What are those eight
This great earth Ananda is established upon liquid the liquid upon the atmosphere and the atmosphere upon space
And when Ananda mighty atmospheric disturbances take place
the liquid is agitated
And with the agitation of the liquid tremors of the earth arise
This is the first reason the first cause for the arising of mighty earthquakes
Again Ananda when an ascetic or holy man of great power one who has gained mastery of his mind or a deity who is mighty and potent develops intense concentration on the delimited aspect of the earth element and to a boundless degree on the liquid element
he too causes the earth to tremble quiver and shake
This is the second reason the second cause for the arising of mighty earthquakes
Again Ananda when the Bodhisatta departs from the Tusita realm and descends into his mothers womb mindfully and clearly comprehending
and when the Bodhisatta comes out from his mothers womb mindfully and clearly comprehending
and when the Tathagata becomes fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment
when the Tathagata sets rolling the excellent Wheel of the Dhamma
when the Tathagata renounces his will to live on
and when the Tathagata comes to pass away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains  then too Ananda this great earth trembles quivers and shakes
These Ananda are the eight reasons the eight causes for a great earthquake to arise
Then the thought occurred to Ven nanda How amazing How astounding What a great earthquake What a very great earthquake awesome  hairraising and rolls of the devadrums split 
What is the reason what is the cause for the appearance of the great earthquake
So Ven nanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One How amazing lord How astounding What a great earthquake What a very great earthquake awesome  hairraising and rolls of thunder split 
What lord is the reason what is the cause for the appearance of the great earthquake
nanda there are these eight reasons eight causes for the appearance of a great earthquake
Which eight
This great earth nanda is established on water The water is established on wind The wind is standing on space
There comes a time when a great wind blows
The great wind blowing shakes the water
The water shaken shakes the earth
This is the first reason the first cause for the appearance of a great earthquake
Then nanda there come a time when a brahman of power with mastery of the mind or a deva of great power great might has developed a limited earthperception and an immeasurable liquidperception
He makes this earth shake  shiver quiver  quake
This is the second reason
Then nanda when the bodhisatta falling from the Tusita group mindful  alert descends into his mothers womb the earth shakes  shivers quivers  quakes
This is the third reason
Then nanda when the bodhisatta mindful  alert emerges from his mothers womb the earth shakes  shivers quivers  quakes
This is the fourth reason
Then nanda when the Tathāgata awakens to the unexcelled right selfawakening the earth shakes  shivers quivers  quakes
This is the fifth reason
Then nanda when the Tathāgata sets rolling the unexcelled Dhammawheel the earth shakes  shivers quivers  quakes
This is the sixth reason
Then nanda when the Tathāgata mindful  alert relinquishes the fabrications of life the earth shakes  shivers quivers  quakes
This is the seventh reason
Then nanda when the Tathāgata by means of the unbinding property with no fuel remaining totally unbinds the earth shakes  shivers quivers  quakes
This is the eighth reason the eighth cause for the appearance of a great earthquake
These are the eight reasons the eight causes for the appearance of a great earthquake
Ananda these eight kinds of assemblies
What are they
They are the assembly of Khattiyas the assembly of Brahmins the assembly of householders the assembly of ascetics the assembly of devas of the Realm of the Four Great Kings the assembly of the ThirtyThree Gods the assembly of maras the assembly of Brahmas
I remember well Ananda many hundreds of assemblies of Khattiyas that I have attended
and before I sat down with them spoke to them or joined in their conversation
I adopted their appearance
and speech whatever it might be
And I instructed inspired fired and delighted them with a discourse on Dhamma
And as I spoke with them they did not know me and wondered Who is it that speaks like this  a deva or a man
And having thus instructed them I disappeared
and still they did not know He who has just disappeared  was he a deva or a man
I remember well many hundreds of assemblies of Brahmins of householders of ascetics of devas of the Realm of the Four Great Kings of the ThirtyThree Gods of maras of Brahmas  
and still they did not know He who has just disappeared  was he a deva or a man
 Those Ananda are the eight assemblies
Now there are eight kinds of assemblies Ananda that is to say
assemblies of nobles
And I recall Ananda how I have attended each of these eight kinds of assemblies amounting to hundreds
And before seating myself and starting the conversation or the discussion
I made my appearance resemble theirs
my voice resemble theirs
And so I taught them the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened them
Yet while I was speaking to them thus they did not know me and they would enquire of one another asking Who is he that speaks to us Is it a man or a god 
Then having taught them the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened them I would straightaway vanish
And when I had vanished too they did not know me and they would enquire of one another asking Who is he that has vanishedIs it a man or a god
brahmans householders ascetics of the Four Great Kings of the Thirtythree gods of Maras and of Brahmas
And such Ananda are the eight kinds of assemblies
nanda there are these eight assemblies
Which eight
A noble warrior assembly a brahmans assembly a householder assembly a contemplative assembly a Four Great Kings assembly a Thirtythree assembly a Māra assembly a Brahmā assembly
I can remember approaching many hundreds of noble warrior assemblies
Therebefore seating myself before talking before engaging in conversation
whatever sort of appearance they had that was the sort of appearance I had
whatever sort of accent they had that was the sort of accent I had
And I instructed urged roused  encouraged them with Dhamma talk
While I was speaking they didnt know me Who is this who speaksa deva or a human being
 Having instructed urged roused  encouraged them with Dhamma talk I disappeared
When I had disappeared they didnt know me Who is this who disappeareda deva or a human being
I can remember approaching many hundreds of brahman assemblies many hundreds of householder assemblies many hundreds of contemplative assemblies many hundreds of Four Great King assemblies many hundreds of Thirtythree assemblies many hundreds of Māra assemblies I can remember approaching many hundreds of Brahmā assemblies
Therebefore seating myself before talking before engaging in conversation
whatever sort of appearance they had that was the sort of appearance I had
whatever sort of accent they had that was the sort of accent I had
And I instructed urged roused  encouraged them with Dhamma talk
While I was speaking they didnt know me Who is this person who speaksa deva or a human being
 Having instructed urged roused  encouraged them with Dhamma talk I disappeared

Ananda once I was staying at Uruvela on the bank of the River Neranjara under the Goatherds Banyantree when I had just attained supreme enlightenment
And Mara the Evil One came to me stood to one side
and said May the Blessed Lord now attain final Nibbana may the WellFarer now attain final Nibbana Now is the time for the Blessed Lords final Nibbana
At this I said to Mara
Evil One I will not take final Nibbana till I have monks and disciple who are accomplished trained skilled learned knowers of the Dhamma 
till I have nuns
laymenfollowers
lay womenfollowers who will teach the Dhamma of wondrous effect
I will not take final Nibbana till this holy life has been successfully established and flourishes is widespread well known far and wide wellproclaimed among mankind everywhere
And just now today Ananda at the Capala Shrine Mara came to me stood to one side
and said Lord may the Blessed Lord now attain final Nibbana
Now is the time for the Blessed Lords final Nibbana
And I said You need not worry Evil One
Three months from now the Tathagata will take final Nibbana
So now today Ananda at the Capala Shrine the Tathagata has mindfully and in full awareness renounced the lifeprinciple
Now there are eight liberations Ananda
What are those eight
Oneself having form one perceives forms this is the first liberation
Being unaware of ones own form one perceives forms external to oneself this is the second liberation
Experiencing loveliness one is intent upon it this is the third liberation
By utterly transcending the perceptions of matter by the disappearance of the perceptions of sensereaction and by giving no attention to diversityperceptions one becomes aware of attains to and abides in the sphere of infinite space this is the fourth liberation
By utterly transcending the sphere of infinite space one becomes aware of attains to and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness this is the fifth liberation
By utterly transcending the sphere of infinite consciousness one becomes aware of attains to and abides in the sphere of nothingness this is the sixth liberation
By utterly transcending the sphere of nothingness one attains to and abides in the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception
this is the seventh liberation
By utterly transcending the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception one attains to and abides in the cessation of perception and sensation this is the eighth liberation
These Ananda are the eight liberations
There was a time Ananda when I dwelt at Uruvela on the bank of the Nerañjara River at the foot of the goatherds banyantree soon after my supreme Enlightenment
And Mara the Evil One approached me
saying Now O Lord let the Blessed One come to his final passing away Let the Happy One utterly pass away The time has come for the Parinibbana of the Lord
Then Ananda I answered Mara the Evil One saying
I shall not come to my final passing away Evil One until my bhikkhus and bhikkhunis laymen and laywomen have come to be true disciples  wise well disciplined apt and learned preservers of the Dhamma living according to the Dhamma abiding by appropriate conduct and having learned the Masters word are able to expound it preach it proclaim it establish it reveal it explain it in detail and make it clear until when adverse opinions arise they shall be able to refute them thoroughly and well and to preach this convincing and liberating Dhamma
I shall not come to my final passing away Evil One until this holy life taught by me has become successful prosperous farrenowned popular and widespread until it is well proclaimed among gods and men
And again today Ananda at the Capala shrine Mara the Evil One approached me
saying
Now O Lord bhikkhus and bhikkhunis laymen and laywomen have come to be true disciples of the Blessed One  wise well disciplined apt and learned preservers of the Dhamma living according to the Dhamma abiding in the appropriate conduct and having learned the Masters word are able to expound it preach it proclaim it establish it reveal it explain it in detail and make it clear and when adverse opinions arise they are now able to refute them thoroughly and well and to preach this convincing and liberating Dhamma
And now O Lord this holy life taught by the Blessed One has become successful prosperous farrenowned popular and widespread and it is well proclaimed among gods and men
Therefore O Lord let the Blessed One come to his final passing away Let the Happy One utterly pass away The time has come for the Parinibbana of the Lord
And then Ananda I answered Mara the Evil One saying Do not trouble yourself Evil One Before long the Parinibbana of the Tathagata will come about
Three months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass away
And in this way Ananda today at the Capala shrine the Tathagata has renounced his will to live on
nanda there are these eight emancipations
Which eight
Possessed of form one sees forms This is the first emancipation
Not percipient of form internally one sees forms externally This is the second emancipation
One is intent only on the beautiful This is the third emancipation
With the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of multiplicity Infinite space one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space This is the fourth emancipation
With the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space Infinite consciousness one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness This is the fifth emancipation
With the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness There is nothing one enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness This is the sixth emancipation
With the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness one enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
This is the seventh emancipation
With the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception one enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling This is the eighth emancipation
These nanda are the eight emancipations
One time nanda I was staying in Uruvelā on the bank of the Nerañjarā River at the Goatherd Banyan newly awakened
Then Māra the Evil One approached me and on arrival stood to one side
As he was standing there he said to me May the Blessed One totally unbind now lord May the One WellGone totally unbind now lord Now is the time for the Blessed Ones total unbinding lord
When this was said I said to Māra the Evil One
Evil One I will not totally unbind as long as my monk disciples are not yet experienced trained attained to confidence desiring rest from the yoke learned maintaining the Dhamma practicing the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma practicing masterfully living in line with the Dhamma declaring the Dhammaafter having learned it from their own teachersteaching it describing it setting it forth revealing it explaining it making it plain wellrefuting in line with the Dhamma any opposing teachings that have arisen teaching the Dhamma with its marvels 
Evil One I will not totally unbind as long as my nun disciples
my male layfollower disciples
my female layfollower disciples are not yet experienced trained attained to maturity desiring rest from the yoke learned maintaining the Dhamma practicing the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma practicing masterfully living in line with the Dhamma declaring the Dhammaafter having learned it from their own teachersteaching it describing it setting it forth revealing it explaining it making it plain wellrefuting in line with the Dhamma any opposing teachings that have arisen teaching the Dhamma with its marvels
Evil One I will not totally unbind as long as this holy life of mine is not powerful prosperous widelyspread disseminated among many people wellexpounded as far as there are human beings  devas
And just now nanda at the Pāvāla Shrine Māra the Evil One approached me and on arrival stood to one side
As he was standing here he said to me May the Blessed One totally unbind now lord May the One WellGone totally unbind now lord Now is the time for the Blessed Ones total unbinding lord
After all these words were said by the Blessed One Evil One I will not totally unbind as long as my monk disciples are not yet experienced as long as my nun disciples my male layfollower disciples my female layfollower disciples are not yet experienced as long as this holy life of mine is not powerful prosperous widelyspread disseminated among many people wellexpounded as far as there are human beings  devas
 But now lord the Blessed Ones holy life is powerful prosperous widelyspread disseminated among many people wellexpounded as far as there are human beings  devas
May the Blessed One totally unbind now lord May the One WellGone totally unbind now lord Now is the time for the Blessed Ones total unbinding lord 
When this was said I said to Māra the Most Evil One Relax Evil One It wont be long until the Tathāgatas total unbinding
In three months time from now the Tathāgata will totally unbind
Just now nanda here at the Pāvāla shrinemindful  alertI relinquished the fabrications of life
At this the Venerable Ananda said Lord may the Blessed Lord stay for a century may the WellFarer stay for a century for the benefit and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit and happiness of devas and humans
Enough Ananda
Do not beg the Tathagata it is not the right time for that
And a second and a third time the Venerable Ananda made the same request
Ananda have you faith in the Tathagatas enlightenment
 Yes Lord
Then why do you bother the Tathagata with your request up to three times
 But Lord I have heard from the Lords own lips I have understood from the Lords own lips Whoever has developed the four roads to power could undoubtedly live for a century or for the remainder of one
Have you faith Ananda
 Yes Lord
Then Ananda yours is the fault yours is the failure that having been given such a broad hint such a clear sign by the Tathagata you did not understand and did not beg the Tathagata to stay for a century  
If Ananda you had begged him the Tathagata would twice have refused you but the third time he would have consented
Therefore Ananda yours is the fault yours is the failure
Once Ananda I was staying at Rajagaha at the Vultures Peak
And there I said Ananda Rajagaha is delightful the Vultures Peak is delightful
Whoever has developed the four roads to power could undoubtedly live for a century
But you Ananda in spite of such a broad hint did not understand and did not beg the Tathagata to stay for a century
Once I was staying at Rajagaha in the Banyan Park at Robbers iff at the Satapanni Cave on the side of Mount Vebhara at the Black Rock on the slope of Mount Isigili at the slope by the Snakes Pool in Cool Wood at the Tapoda Park at the Squirrels FeedingGround in Ve luvanain Jivakas mangogrove and also at Rajagaha in the Maddakucchi deerpark  At all these places I said to you Ananda this place is delightful
Whoever has developed the four roads to power could undoubtedly live for a century
Once I was at Vesall at the Udena Shrine
Once I was at Vesall at the Gotamaka Shrine at the Sattambaka Shrine at the Bahuputta Shrine at the Sa randada Shrine And now today at the Capala Shrine I said These places are delightful Ananda whoever has developed the four roads to power
could undoubtedly live for a century or the remainder of one
The Tathagata has developed these powers and he could Ananda undoubtedly live for a century or the remainder of one
But you Ananda failing to grasp this broad hint this clear sign did not beg the Tathagata to stay for a century
If Ananda you had begged him the Tathagata would twice have refused you but the third time he would have consented
Ananda have I not told you before All those things that are dear and pleasant to us must suffer change separation and alteration
So how could this be possible Whatever is born become compounded is liable to decay  that it should not decay is impossible
And that has been renounced given up rejected abandoned forsaken the Tathagata has renounced the lifeprinciple The Tathagata has said once for all The Tathagatas final passing will not be long delayed
Three months from now the Tathagata will take final Nibbana
That the Tathagata should withdraw such a declaration in order to live on is not possible
Now come Ananda we will go to the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest
Very good Lord
And the Lord went with the Venerable Ananda to the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest When he got there he said Ananda go and gather together all the monks living in the vicinity of Vesall and get them to come to the assembly hall
Very good Lord said Ananda and did so
He then returned to the Lord saluted him stood to one side and said Lord the order of monks is gathered together Now is the time for the Lord to do as he wishes
Then the Lord entered the assembly hall and sat down on the prepared seat
Then he said to the monks Monks for this reason those matters which I have discovered and proclaimed should be thoroughly learnt by you practised developed and cultivated so that this holy life may endure for a long time that it may be for the benefit and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit and happiness of devas and humans
And what are those matters
They are The four foundations of mindfulness the four right efforts the four roads to power the five spiritual faculties the five mental powers the seven factors of enlightenment the Noble Eightfold Path
Then the Lord said to the monks And now monks I declare to you  all conditioned things are of a nature to decay  strive on untiringly
The Tathagatas final passing will not be long delayed
Three months from now the Tathagata will take his final Nibbana
Thus the Lord spoke The WellFarer having thus spoken the Teacher said this
Ripe I am in years My lifespans determined
Now I go from you having made myself my refuge
Monks be untiring mindful disciplined
Guarding your minds with wellcollected thought
He who tireless keeps to law and discipline
Leaving birth behind will put an end to woe
End of third recitationsection
At these words the Venerable Ananda spoke to the Blessed One saying May the Blessed One remain O Lord May the Happy One remain O Lord throughout the worldperiod for the welfare and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit well being and happiness of gods and men
And the Blessed One answered saying Enough Ananda
Do not entreat the Tathagata for the time is past Ananda for such an entreaty
But for a second and a third time the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One May the Blessed One remain O Lord May the Happy One remain O Lord throughout the worldperiod for the welfare and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit well being and happiness of gods and men
Then the Blessed One said Do you have faith Ananda in the Enlightenment of the Tathagata
And the Venerable Ananda replied Yes O Lord I do
Then how Ananda can you persist against the Tathagata even up to the third time 
Then the Venerable Ananda said This O Lord I have heard and learned from the Blessed One himself when the Blessed One said to me Whosoever Ananda has developed practiced employed strengthened maintained scrutinized and brought to perfection the four constituents of psychic power could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of it
The Tathagata Ananda has done so
Therefore the Tathagata could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of it
And did you believe it Ananda 
Yes O Lord I did
Then Ananda the fault is yours Herein have you failed inasmuch as you were unable to grasp the plain suggestion the significant prompting given by the Tathagata and you did not then entreat the Tathagata to remain
For if you had done so Ananda twice the Tathagata might have declined but the third time he would have consented
Therefore Ananda the fault is yours herein have you failed
At Rajagaha Ananda when dwelling at Vultures Peak
I spoke to you saying Pleasant Ananda is Rajagaha pleasant is Vultures Peak
Whosoever Ananda has developed
Therefore the Tathagata could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of it
So also at the Banyan Grove at Robbers Cliff at the Sattapanni Cave on the Vebhara Mountain at the Black Rock of Isigili at the Serpents Pool in the Cool Forest at the Tapoda Grove at the Bamboo Grove in the Squirrels Feedingground at Jivakas Mango Grove and at Small Nook in the Deer Park I spoke to you in the same words saying Pleasant Ananda is Rajagaha pleasant are these places
Whosoever Ananda has developed Therefore the Tathagata could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of it
But you Ananda were unable to grasp the plain suggestion the significant prompting given you by the Tathagata and you did not entreat the Tathagata to remain
For if you had done so Ananda twice the Tathagata might have declined but the third time he would have consented
Therefore Ananda the fault is yours herein you have failed
So also at Vesali Ananda at different times the Tathagata has spoken to you saying Pleasant Ananda is Vesali pleasant are the shrines of Udena
Gotamaka Sattambaka Bahuputta Sarandada and Capala
Whosoever Ananda has developed
Therefore the Tathagata could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of it
But you Ananda were unable to grasp the plain suggestion the significant prompting given you by the Tathagata and you did not entreat the Tathagata to remain
For if you had done so Ananda twice the Tathagata might have declined but the third time he would have consented
Therefore Ananda the fault is yours herein you have failed
Yet Ananda have I not taught from the very beginning that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change separation and severance
Of that which is born come into being is compounded and subject to decay how can one say May it not come to dissolution There can be no such state of things
And of that Ananda which the Tathagata has finished with that which he has relinquished given up abandoned and rejected  his will to live on  the Tathagatas word has been spoken once for all Before long the Parinibbana of the Tathagata will come about
Three months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass away
And that the Tathagata should withdraw his words for the sake of living on  this is an impossibility
So then Ananda let us go to the hall of the Gabled House in the Great Forest
And the Venerable Ananda replied So be it Lord
Then the Blessed One with the Venerable Ananda went to the hall of the Gabled House in the Great Forest And there he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Go now Ananda and assemble in the hall of audience all the bhikkhus who dwell in the neighborhood of Vesali
So be it Lord And the Venerable Ananda gathered all the bhikkhus who dwelt in the neighborhood of Vesali and assembled them in the hall of audience
And then respectfully saluting the Blessed One and standing at one side he said The community of bhikkhus is assembled Lord Now let the Blessed One do as he wishes
Thereupon the Blessed One entered the hall of audience and taking the seat prepared for him
he exhorted the bhikkhus saying Now O bhikkhus I say to you that these teachings of which I have direct knowledge and which I have made known to you  these you should thoroughly learn cultivate develop and frequently practice that the life of purity may be established and may long endure for the welfare and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit well being and happiness of gods and men
And what bhikkhus are these teachings
They are the four foundations of mindfulness the four right efforts the four constituents of psychic power the five faculties the five powers the seven factors of enlightenment and the Noble Eightfold Path
These bhikkhus are the teachings of which I have direct knowledge which I have made known to you and which you should thoroughly learn cultivate develop and frequently practice that the life of purity may be established and may long endure for the welfare and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit well being and happiness of gods and men
Then the Blessed One said to the bhikkhus So bhikkhus I exhort you All compounded things are subject to vanish Strive with earnestness
The time of the Tathagatas Parinibbana is near
Three months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass away
And having spoken these words the Happy One the Master spoke again saying
My years are now full ripe the life span left is short
Departing I go hence from you relying on myself alone
Be earnest then O bhikkhus be mindful and of virtue pure
With firm resolve guard your own mind
Whoso untiringly pursues the Dhamma and the Discipline
Shall go beyond the round of births and make an end of suffering
When this was said Ven nanda said to the Blessed One Lord may the Blessed One remain for an eon May the One WellGone remain for an eonfor the benefit of the many for the happiness of the many out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of human beings  devas 
Enough now nanda

What else is there to expect That of anything born become fabricated subject to disintegration you might say O may it not disintegrate The possibility doesnt exist
And that is what the Tathāgata has gotten rid of vomited up released abandoned forfeited It was with the fabrications of life relinquished that this categorical statement was spoken It wont be long until the Tathāgatas total unbinding
In three months time from now the Tathāgata will totally unbind
 For the Tathāgata for the sake of life to rescind that The possibility doesnt exist
Come now nanda We will head for the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest 
As you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One together with Ven nanda went to the Great Forest and to the Gabled Hall On arrival the Blessed One said to Ven nanda Go nanda Have all the monks living in dependence on Vesālī gather at the assembly hall 
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven nandahaving had all the monks living in dependence on Vesālī gather at the assembly hallapproached the Blessed One On arrival having bowed down to him he stood to one side
As he was standing there he said to the Blessed One The Saṅgha of monks has gathered lord May the Blessed One do what he thinks it is now time to do 
Then the Blessed One went to the assembly hall and on arrival sat down on the seat laid out
Having sat down he addressed the monks Monks the qualities I have taught having known them directly You should grasp them thoroughly cultivate them develop them  pursue them so that this holy life may long endure  remain steadfast for the benefit welfare  happiness of the multitude out of sympathy for the world for the benefit welfare  happiness of human beings  devas
And which are the qualities I have taught for the benefit welfare  happiness of human beings  devas
The four establishings of mindfulness the four right exertions the four bases of power the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors for awakening the noble eightfold path
These are the qualities I have taught having known them directly that you should grasp thoroughly cultivate develop  pursue so that this holy life may long endure  remain steadfast for the benefit welfare  happiness of the multitude out of sympathy for the world for the benefit welfare  happiness of human beings  devas 
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks I exhort you monks All fabrications are subject to decay Reach consummation through heedfulness
It wont be long until the Tathāgatas total unbinding
In three months time from now the Tathāgata will totally unbind 
That is what the Blessed One said Having said that the One WellGone said further  Young  old wise  foolish rich  poor all end up dying As a potters clay vessels large  small fired  unfired all end up broken so too life heads to death Then the Teacher said further
Ripe my age little the life remaining to me
Leaving you I will go having made my refuge for myself
Be heedful monks mindful virtuous
With your resolves wellconcentrated look after your minds
He who in this Dhamma  Vinaya remains heedful
leaving the wanderingon through birth will make an end of stress
 Then the Lord having risen early and dressed took his robe and bowl and went into Vesall for alms
Having returned from the almsround and eaten he looked back at Vesall with his elephantlook and said Ananda this is the last time the Tathagata will look upon Vesall
Now we will go to Bhandagama
Very good Lord said Ananda
and the Lord proceeded with a large company of monks to Bhandagama
and stayed there
And there the Lord addressed the monks It is monks through not understanding not penetrating four things that I as well as you have for a long time fared on round the cycle of rebirths
What are the four
Through not understanding the Ariyan morality
through not understanding the Ariyan concentration
through not understanding the Ariyan wisdom
through not understanding the Ariyan liberation I as well as you have for a long time fared on round the cycle of rebirths
And it is by understanding and penetrating the Ariyan morality the Ariyan concentration the Ariyan wisdom and the Ariyan liberation that the craving for becoming has been cut off the tendency towards becoming has been exhausted and there will be no more rebirth
Thus the Lord spokeThe WellFarer having thus spoken the Teacher said this
Morality samadhi wisdom and final release
These glorious things Gotama came to know
The Dhamma hed discerned he taught his monks
He whose vision ended woe to Nibbanas gone
Then the Lord while staying at Bhandagama delivered a comprehensive discourse This is morality this is concentration this is wisdom
Concentration when imbued with morality brings great fruit and profit
Wisdom when imbued with concentration brings great fruit and profit
The mind imbued with wisdom becomes completely free from the corruptions that is from the corruption of sensuality of becoming of false views and of ignorance
Then the Blessed One getting ready in the forenoon took bowl and robe and went into Vesali for alms
After the alms round and meal on his return he looked upon Vesali with the elephants look and said to the Venerable Ananda This Ananda is the last time that the Tathagata will look upon Vesali
Come Ananda let us go to Bhandagama
So be it O Lord
And the Blessed One took up his abode at Bhandagama together with a large community of bhikkhus
And the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Bhikkhus it is through not realizing through not penetrating four principles that this long course of birth and death has been passed through and undergone by me as well as by you
What are those four
They are noble virtue
noble concentration
noble wisdom
and noble emancipation
But now bhikkhus that these have been realized and penetrated cut off is the craving for existence destroyed is that which leads to renewed becoming and there is no fresh becoming
And having spoken these words the Happy One the Master spoke again saying
Virtue concentration wisdom and emancipation unsurpassed 
These are the principles realized by Gotama the renowned
And knowing them he the Buddha to his monks has taught the Dhamma
He the destroyer of suffering the Master the Seer is at peace
And also at Bhandagama the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdom
Great becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct
great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration
utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom
Then the Blessed One early in the morning adjusted his lower robe andtaking his bowl  outer robewent into Vesālī for alms
Having gone for alms in Vesālī after the meal returning from his alms round gazing on Vesālī with an elephants look he addressed Ven nanda nanda this is the Tathāgatas last look at Vesālī
Come nanda we will head for Bhaṇḍa Village
As you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One together with a large Saṅgha of monks went to Bhaṇḍa Village
There the Blessed One stayed near Bhaṇḍa Village
And there he addressed the monks Its through not awakening to or penetrating four qualities monks that we have transmigrated and wandered on for such a long time you  I
Which four
Its through not awakening to or penetrating noble virtue that we have transmigrated and wandered on for such a long time you  I
Its through not awakening to or penetrating noble concentration
Its through not awakening to or penetrating noble discernment
Its through not awakening to or penetrating noble release that we have transmigrated and wandered on for such a long time you  I
 this noble virtue has been awakened to  penetrated noble concentration has been awakened to  penetrated noble discernment has been awakened to  penetrated noble release has been awakened to  penetrated Craving for becoming has been crushed the guide to becoming ie clinging is ended There now is no furtherbecoming 
That is what the Blessed One said Having said it the Teacher the One WellGone said further
Virtue concentration discernment and unexcelled release
These qualities have been awakened to by Gotama the prestigious
Directly knowing this he shows it to the monks the awakened one
the teacher who has made an ending of stress the one with eyes totally unbound
While staying there at Bhaṇḍa Village the Blessed One often gave this Dhamma talk to the monks Such is virtue such is concentration such is discernment
Concentration nurtured with virtue is of great fruit great reward
Discernment nurtured with concentration is of great fruit great reward
The mind nurtured with discernment is rightly released from the effluents i e  the effluent of sensuality the effluent of becoming the effluent of ignorance
And when the Lord had stayed at Bhandagama for as long as he wished he said Ananda let us go to Hatthigama  to Ambagama to Jambugama giving the same discourse at each place Then he said Ananda let us go to Bhoganagara
Very good Lord
said Ananda and the Lord went with a large company of monks to Bhoganagara
At Bhoganagara the Lord stayed at the Ananda Shrine
And here he said to the monks Monks I will teach you four criteria Listen pay close attention and I will speak
Yes Lord replied the monks
Suppose a monk were to say Friends I heard and received this from the Lords own lips this is the Dhamma this is the discipline this is the Masters teaching
then monks you should neither approve nor disapprove his words
Then without approving or disapproving his words and expressions should be carefully noted and compared with the Suttas and reviewed in the light of the discipline
If they on such comparison and review are found not to conform to the Suttas or the discipline the conclusion must be Assuredly this is not the word of the Buddha it has been wrongly understood by this monk
and the matter is to be rejected
But where on such comparison and review they are found to conform to the Suttas or the discipline the conclusion must be Assuredly this is the word of the Buddha it has been rightly understood by this monk
This is the first criterion
Suppose a monk were to say In such and such a place there is a community with elders and distinguished teachers
I have heard and received this from that community
then monks you should neither approve nor disapprove his words  
That is the second criterion
Suppose a monk were to say In such and such a place there are many elders who are learned bearers of the tradition who know the Dhamma the discipline the code of rules 
This is the third criterion
Suppose a monk were to say In such and such a place there is one elder who is learned
 I have heard and received this from that elder 
But where on such comparison and review they are found to conform to the Suttas and the discipline then the conclusion must be Assuredly this is the word of the Buddha it has been rightly understood by this monk
Then the Lord while staying at Bhoganagara delivered a comprehensive discourse This is morality this is concentration this is wisdom
When the Blessed One had stayed at Bhandagama as long as he pleased he spoke to the Venerable Ananda Come Ananda let us go to Hatthigama Ambagama Jambugama to Bhoganagara
So be it Lord
And the Blessed One took up his abode at Bhoganagara together with a large community of bhikkhus
and stayed in the Ananda shrine
And there the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Now bhikkhus I shall make known to you the four great references Listen and pay heed to my words
And those bhikkhus answered saying So be it Lord
Then the Blessed One said
In this fashion bhikkhus a bhikkhu might speak Face to face with the Blessed One brethren I have heard and learned thus This is the Dhamma and the Discipline the Masters Dispensation
Without approval and without scorn but carefully studying the sentences word by word one should trace them in the Discourses and verify them by the Discipline
In that way bhikkhus you should reject it
And in that way bhikkhus you may accept it on the first reference
or In an abode of such and such a name lives a community with elders and a chief
Face to face with that community I have heard and learned thus This is the Dhamma and the Discipline the Masters Dispensation
In that way bhikkhus you should reject it
And in that way bhikkhus you may accept it on the second reference
or In an abode of such and such a name live several bhikkhus who are elders who are learned who have accomplished their course who are preservers of the Dhamma the Discipline and the Summaries
Face to face with those elders I have heard and learned thus This is the Dhamma and the Discipline the Masters Dispensation
And in that way bhikkhus you may accept it on the third reference
or In an abode of such and such a name lives a single bhikkhu who is an elder who is learned who has accomplished his course who is a preserver of the Dhamma the Discipline and the Summaries
Face to face with that elder I have heard and learned thus This is the Dhamma and the Discipline the Masters Dispensation
In such a case bhikkhus the declaration of such a bhikkhu is neither to be received with approval nor with scorn
Without approval and without scorn but carefully studying the sentences word by word one should trace them in the Discourses and verify them by the Discipline
If they are neither traceable in the Discourses nor verifiable by the Discipline one must conclude thus Certainly this is not the Blessed Ones utterance this has been misunderstood by that bhikkhu  or by that community or by those elders or by that elder
In that way bhikkhus you should reject it
But if the sentences concerned are traceable in the Discourses and verifiable by the Discipline then one must conclude thus Certainly this is the Blessed Ones utterance this has been well understood by that bhikkhu  or by that community or by those elders or by that elder
And in that way bhikkhus you may accept it on the fourth reference
These bhikkhus are the four great references for you to preserve
And also at Bhoganagara at the Ananda shrine the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdom
Great becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct
great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration
utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom
Then the Blessed One having stayed near Bhaṇḍa Village as long as he pleased said to Ven nanda Come nanda we will head for Hatthi Village Amba Village Jambu Village to Bhoganagara 
As you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One together with a large Saṅgha of monks went to Bhoganagara
There the Blessed One stayed near Bhoganagara at the nanda shrine
There the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks I will teach you four great standards Listen and pay careful attention
As you say lord the monks responded to him
The Blessed One said
There is the case where a monk says this Facetoface with the Blessed One have I heard this facetoface have I received this This is the Dhamma this is the Vinaya this is the Teachers instruction
 His statement is neither to be approved nor scorned
Without approval or scorn take careful note of his words and make them stand against the suttas and tally them against the Vinaya
If on making them stand against the suttas and tallying them against the Vinaya you find that they dont stand with the suttas or tally with the Vinaya you may conclude This is not the word of the Blessed One this monk has misunderstood it
and you should reject it
But if on making them stand against the suttas and tallying them against the Vinaya you find that they stand with the suttas and tally with the Vinaya you may conclude This is the word of the Blessed One this monk has understood it rightly
Then there is the case where a monk says this In a monastery over there dwells a Saṅgha with wellknown leading elders
Facetoface with that Saṅgha I have heard this facetoface have I received this This is the Dhamma this is the Vinaya this is the Teachers instruction 
Then there is the case where a monk says this In a monastery over there dwell many learned elder monks who know the tradition who have memorized the Dhamma the Vinaya and the Mātikā
Facetoface with those elders I have heard this facetoface have I received this This is the Dhamma this is the Vinaya this is the Teachers instruction 
Then there is the case where a monk says this In a monastery over there dwells an elder monk who knows the tradition who has memorized the Dhamma the Vinaya and the Mātikā
Facetoface with that elder I have heard this facetoface have I received this This is the Dhamma this is the Vinaya this is the Teachers instruction
 His statement is neither to be approved nor scorned
Without approval or scorn take careful note of his words and make them stand against the suttas and tally them against the Vinaya
If on making them stand against the suttas and tallying them against the Vinaya you find that they dont stand with the suttas or tally with the Vinaya you may conclude This is not the word of the Blessed One this monk has misunderstood itand you should reject it
But if on making them stand against the suttas and tallying them against the Vinaya you find that they stand with the suttas and tally with the Vinaya you may conclude This is the word of the Blessed One this monk has understood it rightly
Monks remember these four great standards 
While staying there near Bhoganagara at the nanda shrine the Blessed One often gave this Dhamma talk to the monks Such is virtue such is concentration such is discernment
Concentration nurtured with virtue is of great fruit great reward
Discernment nurtured with concentration is of great fruit great reward
The mind nurtured with discernment is rightly released from the effluents i e  the effluent of sensuality the effluent of becoming the effluent of ignorance 
And when the Lord had stayed at Bhoganagara for as long as he wished he said Ananda let us go to Pava
Very good Lord said Ananda
and the Lord went with a large company of monks to Pava
where he stayed at the mango grove of Cunda the smith
And Cunda heard that the Lord had arrived at Pava and was staying at his mangogrove
So he went to the Lord saluted him and sat down to one side
and the Lord instructed inspired fired and delighted him with a talk on Dhamma
Then Cunda said May the Lord accept a meal from me tomorrow with his order of monks
And the Lord consented by silence
And Cunda understanding his consent rose from his seat saluted the Lord and passing by to the right departed
And as the night was ending Cunda had a fine meal of hard and soft food prepared with an abundance of pigs delight and when it was ready he reported to the Lord Lord the meal is ready
Then the Lord having dressed in the morning took his robe and bowl and went with his order of monks to Cundas dwelling where he sat down on the prepared seat
and said Serve the pigs delight that has been prepared to me
and serve the remaining hard and soft food to the order of monks
Very good Lord said Cunda and did so
Then the Lord said to Cunda Whatever is left over of the pigs delight you should bury in a pit
because Cunda I can see none in this world with its devas maras and Brahmas in this generation with its ascetics and Brahmins its princes and people who if they were to eat it could thoroughly digest it except the Tathagata
Very good Lord said Cunda and having buried the remains of the pigs delight in a pit he came to the Lord saluted him and sat down to one side
Then the Lord having instructed inspired fired and delighted him with a talk on Dhamma rose from his seat and departed
And after having eaten the meal provided by Cunda the Lord was attacked by a severe sickness with bloody diarrhoea and with sharp pains as if he were about to die
But he endured all this mindfully and clearly aware and without complaint
Then the Lord said Ananda let us go to Kusi nara
Very good Lord said Ananda
Having eaten Cundas meal 
He suffered a grave illness painful deathly
From eating a meal of pigs delight
Grave sickness assailed the Teacher
Having purged the Lord then said
Now Ill go to Kusinara town 
When the Blessed One had stayed at Bhoganagara as long as he pleased he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to Pava
So be it Lord
And the Blessed One took up his abode at Pava together with a great community of bhikkhus
and stayed in the Mango Grove of Cunda who was by family a metalworker
And Cunda the metalworker came to know The Blessed One they say has arrived at Pava and is staying in my Mango Grove
And he went to the Blessed One and having respectfully greeted him sat down at one side
And the Blessed One instructed Cunda the metalworker in the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened him
Then Cunda spoke to the Blessed One saying May the Blessed One O Lord please accept my invitation for tomorrows meal together with the community of bhikkhus
And by his silence the Blessed One consented
Sure then of the Blessed Ones consent Cunda the metalworker rose from his seat respectfully saluted the Blessed One and keeping his right side towards him took his departure
And Cunda the metalworker after the night had passed had choice food hard and soft prepared in his abode together with a quantity of sukaramaddava and announced it to the Blessed One saying It is time O Lord the meal is ready
Thereupon the Blessed One in the forenoon having got ready took bowl and robe and went with the community of bhikkhus to the house of Cunda and there sat down on the seat prepared for him
And he spoke to Cunda saying With the sukaramaddava you have prepared Cunda you may serve me
with the other food hard and soft you may serve the community of bhikkhus
So be it Lord And with the sukaramaddava prepared by him he served the Blessed One
and with the other food hard and soft he served the community of bhikkhus
Thereafter the Blessed One spoke to Cunda saying Whatever Cunda is left over of the sukaramaddava bury that in a pit
For I do not see in all this world with its gods Maras and Brahmas among the host of ascetics and brahmans gods and men anyone who could eat it and entirely digest it except the Tathagata alone
And Cunda the metalworker answered the Blessed One saying So be it O Lord And what remained over of the sukaramaddava he buried in a pit  Then he returned to the Blessed One respectfully greeted him and sat down at one side
And the Blessed One instructed Cunda the metalworker in the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened him After this he rose from his seat and departed
And soon after the Blessed One had eaten the meal provided by Cunda the metalworker a dire sickness fell upon him even dysentery and he suffered sharp and deadly pains
But the Blessed One endured them mindfully clearly comprehending and unperturbed
Then the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to Kusinara
And the Venerable Ananda answered So be it Lord
When he had eaten Cundas food I heard
With fortitude the deadly pains he bore
From the sukaramaddava
a sore And dreadful sickness came upon the Lord
But natures pangs he endured
Come let us go To Kusinara was his dauntless word
Then the Blessed One having stayed near Bhoganagara at the nanda shrine as long as he pleased said to Ven nanda Come nanda we will head for Pāvā
As you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One together with a large Saṅgha of monks went to Pāvā
There the Blessed One stayed near Pāvā in the mango grove of Cunda the silversmith
Cunda the silversmith heard The Blessed One they say on reaching Pāvā is staying near Pāvā in my mango grove 
So Cunda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged him with Dhamma talk
Then Cundainstructed urged roused  encouraged by the Blessed Ones Dhamma talksaid to him Lord may the Blessed One acquiesce to my meal tomorrow together with the Saṅgha of monks 
The Blessed One acquiesced with silence
Then Cunda understanding the Blessed Ones acquiescence got up from his seat and bowing down to him and circumambulating him left
Then at the end of the night after having exquisite staple  nonstaple foodincluding a large amount of pigdelicacyprepared in his own home he announced the time to the Blessed One Its time lord The meal is ready 
Then the Blessed One early in the morning adjusted his lower robe andtaking his bowl  outer robewent together with the Saṅgha of monks to Cundas home On arrival he sat down on the seat laid out
Seated he said to Cunda Cunda serve me with the pigdelicacy you have had prepared
and the Saṅgha of monks with the other staple  nonstaple food you have had prepared
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Cunda served the Blessed One with the pigdelicacy he had had prepared
and the Saṅgha of monks with the other staple  nonstaple food he had had prepared
Then the Blessed One said to him Cunda bury the remaining pigdelicacy in a pit
I dont see anyone in the world together with its devas Māras Brahmās in this generation with its contemplatives brahmans its rulers commonfolk in whom when it was ingested it would go to a healthy change aside from the Tathāgata
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Cunda buried the remaining pigdelicacy in a pit went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed Oneafter instructing urging rousing  encouraging him with Dhamma talkgot up from his seat and left
Then in the Blessed One after he had eaten Cundas meal there arose a severe disease accompanied with blood with intense pains  deadly
But the Blessed One endured itmindful alert  not struck down by it
Then he addressed Ven nanda nanda we will go to Kusinārā 
As you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed One
I have heard that on eating Cunda the silversmiths meal
the enlightened one was touched by illness fierce deadly
After he had eaten the pigdelicacy
a fierce sickness arose in the Teacher
After being purged of it the Blessed One said
To the city of Kusinārā I will go 
Then turning aside from the road the Lord went to the foot of a tree and said Come Ananda fold a robe in four for me I am tired and want to sit down
Very good Lord said Ananda and did so
The Lord sat down on the prepared seat 
and said Ananda bring me some water I am thirsty and want to drink
Ananda replied Lord five hundred carts have passed this way The water is churned up by their wheels and is not good it is dirty and disturbed
But Lord the River Kakuttha nearby has clean water pleasant cool pure with beautiful banks delightful
There the Lord shall drink the water and cool his limbs
A second time the Lord said Ananda bring me some water and Ananda replied as before
A third time the Lord said Ananda bring me some water I am thirsty and want to drink
Very good Lord said Ananda and taking his bowl he went to the stream
And that stream whose water had been churned up by the wheels and was not good dirty and disturbed as Ananda approached it began to flow pure bright and unsullied
And the Venerable Ananda thought Wonderful marvellous are the Tathagatas great and mighty powers
This water was churned up by wheels and at my approach it flows pure bright and unsullied
He took water in his bowl brought it to the Lord and told him of his thought saying 
May the Lord drink the water may the WellFarer drink
And the Lord drank the water
Now on the way the Blessed One went aside from the highway and stopped at the foot of a tree And he said to the Venerable Ananda Please fold my upper robe in four Ananda and lay it down I am weary and want to rest awhile
So be it Lord And the Venerable Ananda folded the robe in four and laid it down
And the Blessed One sat down on the seat prepared for him
and said to the Venerable Ananda Please bring me some water Ananda I am thirsty and want to drink
And the Venerable Ananda answered the Blessed One But just now Lord a great number of carts five hundred carts have passed over and the shallow water has been cut through by the wheels so that it flows turbid and muddy
But the Kakuttha River Lord is quite close by and its waters are clear pleasant cool and translucent It is easily approachable and delightfully placed
There the Blessed One can quench his thirst and refresh his limbs
But a second time the Blessed One made his request and the Venerable Ananda answered him as before
And then for a third time the Blessed One said Please bring me some water Ananda I am thirsty and want to drink
Then the Venerable Ananda answered saying So be it Lord And he took the bowl and went to the stream
And the shallow water which had been cut through by the wheels so that it flowed turbid and muddy became clear and settled down pure and pleasant as the Venerable Ananda drew near
Then the Venerable Ananda thought Marvellous and most wonderful indeed is the power and glory of the Tathagata
And he took up water in the bowl and carried it to the Blessed One and said Marvellous and most wonderful indeed is the power and glory of the Tathagata
For this shallow water which had been cut through by the wheels so that it flowed turbid and muddy became clear and settled down pure and pleasant as I drew near
Now let the Blessed One drink the water Let the Happy One drink
And the Blessed One drank the water
Then the Blessed One going down from the road went to a certain tree and on arrival said to Ven nanda nanda please arrange my outer robe folded in four I am tired I will sit down
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven nanda arranged the outer robe folded in four
The Blessed One sat down on the seat laid out
Seated he said to Ven nanda nanda please fetch me some water I am thirsty I will drink 
When this was said Ven nanda said to the Blessed One Lord just now  carts have passed through The meager rivercut by the wheelsflows turbid  disturbed
But the Kakudha river is not far away with pristine water pleasing water cool water pellucid water with restful banks refreshing
There the Blessed One will drink potable water and cool his limbs 
A second time the Blessed One said to Ven nanda nanda please fetch me some water I am thirsty I will drink 
A second time Ven nanda said to the Blessed One Lord just now  carts have passed through The meager watercut by the wheelsflows turbid  disturbed
But the Kakudha River is not far away with pristine water pleasing water cool water pellucid water with restful banks refreshing
There the Blessed One will drink potable water and cool his limbs
A third time the Blessed One said to Ven nanda nanda please fetch me some water I am thirsty I will drink 
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven nandataking a bowlwent to the river
And the meager river that cut by the wheels had been flowing turbid  disturbed on his approach flowed pristine clear  undisturbed
The thought occurred to him How amazing How astoundingthe great power  great might of the Tathāgata
in that this meager river that cut by the wheels was flowing turbid  disturbed on my approach flowed pristine clear  undisturbed
Fetching water with the bowl he went to the Blessed One and on arrival said How amazing How astoundingthe great power  great might of the Tathāgata
in that this meager river that cut by the wheels was flowing turbid  disturbed on my approach flowed pristine clear  undisturbed
Drink the water O Blessed One Drink the water O One WellGone
Then the Blessed One drank the water
At that moment Pukkusa the Malla a pupil of Alara Kalama was going along the main road from Kusinara to Pava
Seeing the Lord sitting under a tree
he went over saluted him and sat down to one side
Then he said It is wonderful Lord it is marvellous how calm these wanderers are
Once Lord Alara Kalama was going along the main road and turning aside he went and sat down under a nearby tree to take his siesta
And five hundred carts went rumbling by very close to him
A man who was walking along behind them came to Alara Kalama and said Lord did you not see five hundred carts go by
 No friend I did not
But didnt you hear them Lord
 No friend I did not
Well were you asleep Lord
 No friend I was not asleep
Then Lord were you conscious
 Yes friend
So Lord being conscious and awake you neither saw nor heard five hundred carts passing close by you even though your outer robe was bespattered with dust
 That is so friend
And that man thought It is wonderful it is marvellous These wanderers are so calm
that though conscious and awake a man neither saw nor heard five hundred carts passing close by him
And he went away praising Alara Kalamas lofty powers
Well Pukkusa what do you think What do you consider is more difficult to do or attain to  while conscious and awake not to see or hear five hundred carts passing nearby or while conscious and awake not to see or hear anything when the raingod streams and splashes when lightning flashes and thunder crashes
Lord how can one compare not seeing or hearing five hundred carts with that  or even six seven eight nine or ten hundred or hundreds of thousands of carts to that
To see or hear nothing when such a storm rages is more difficult
Once Pukkusa when I was staying at Atuma at the threshingfloor
the raingod streamed and splashed lightning flashed and thunder crashed and two farmers brothers and four oxen were killed
And a lot of people went out of Atuma to where the two brothers and the four oxen were killed
And Pukkusa I had at that time gone out of the door of the threshingfloor and was walking up and down outside
And a man from the crowd came to me saluted me and stood to one side
And I said to him Friend why are all these people gathered here
 Lord there has been a great storm and two farmers brothers and four oxen have been killed
But you Lord where have you been
 I have been right here friend
But what did you see Lord
 I saw nothing friend
Or what did you hear Lord
 I heard nothing friend
Were you sleeping Lord
 I was not sleeping friend
Then Lord were you consciousr
Yes friend
So Lord being conscious and awake you neither saw nor heard the great rainfall and floods and the thunder and lightning
 That is so friend
And Pukkusa that man thought It is wonderful it is marvellous These wanderers are so calm
that they neither see nor hear when the raingod streams and splashes lightning flashes and thunder crashes
Proclaiming my lofty powers he saluted me passed by to the right and departed
At this Pukkusa the Malla said Lord I reject the lofty powers of Alara Kalama as if they were blown away by a mighty wind or carried off by a swift stream or river
Excellent Lord excellent
It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down or to point out the way to one who had got lost or to bring an oil lamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways
And I Lord go for refuge to the Blessed Lord the Dhamma and the Sangha
May the Blessed Lord accept me from this day forth as a layfollower as long as life shall last
Then Pukkusa said to one man Go and fetch me two fine sets of robes of clothofgold burnished and ready to wear
Yes Lord the man replied and did so
And Pukkusa offered the robes to the Lord saying Here Lord are two fine sets of robes of clothofgold May the Blessed Lord be graciously pleased to accept them
Well then Pukkusa clothe me in one set and Ananda in the other
Very good Lord said Pukkusa and did so 
Then the Lord instructed inspired fired and delighted Pukkusa the Malla with a talk on Dhamma
Then Pukkusa rose from his seat saluted the Lord passed by to the right and departed
Soon after Pukkusa had gone Ananda having arranged one set of the golden robes on the body of the Lord
observed that against the Lords body it appeared dulled
And he said It is wonderful Lord it is marvellous how dear and bright the Lords skin appears
It looks even brighter than the golden robes in which it is clothed
Just so Ananda There are two occasions on which the Tathagatas skin appears especially clear and bright
Which are they
One is the night in which the Tathagata gains supreme enlightenment the other is the night when he attains the Nibbanaelement without remainder at his final passing
On these two occasions the Tathagatas skin appears especially clear and bright
Tonight Ananda in the last watch in the salgrove of the Mallas near Kusinara between two saltrees the Tathagatas final passing will take place
And now Ananda let us go to the River Kakuttha
Very good Lord said Ananda 
Two golden robes were Pukkusas offering
Brighter shone the Teachers body than its dress
Then the Lord went with a large number of monks to the River Kakuttha He entered the water bathed and drank and emerging went to the mango grove
where he said to the Venerable Cundaka Come Cundaka fold a robe in four for me I am tired and want to lie down
Very good Lord said Cundaka and did so
Then the Lord adopted the lionposture lying on his right side placing one foot on the other mindfully and with clear awareness bearing in mind the time of awakening
And the Venerable Cundaka sat down in front of the Lord
The Buddha having gone to Kakuttha the river
With its clear bright and pleasant waters
Therein the Teacher plunged his weary body
Tathagata  without an equal in the world
Surrounded by the monks whose head he was
The Teacher and Lord Preserver of Dhamma
To the Mango Grove the great Sage went
And to Cundaka the monk he said
On a fourfold robe Ill lie down
And thus adjured by the great Adept
Cundaka placed the fourfold robe
The Teacher laid his weary limbs to rest
While Cundaka kept watch beside him
Then the Lord said to the Venerable Ananda It might happen Ananda that Cunda the smith should feel remorse thinking It is your fault friend Cunda it is by your misdeed that the Tathagata gained final Nibbana after taking his last meal from you
But Cundas remorse should be expelled in this way That is your merit Cunda that is your good deed that the Tathagata gained final Nibbana after taking his last meal from you
For friend Cunda I have heard and understood from the Lords own lips that these two almsgivings are of very great fruit of very great result more fruitful and advantageous than any other
Which two
The one is the almsgiving after eating which the Tathagata attains supreme enlightenment the other that after which he attains the Nib banaelement without remainder at his final passing
These two almsgivings are more fruitful and profitable than all others
Cundas deed is conducive to long life to good looks to happiness to fame to heaven and to lordship
In this way Ananda Cundas remorse is to be expelled
Then the Lord having settled this matter at that time uttered this verse
By giving merit grows
by restraint hatreds checked
He whos skilled abandons evil things
As greed hate and folly wane Nibbanas gained
End of the fourth recitationsection concerning Alara
Now it so happened that one Pukkusa of the Malla clan who was a disciple of Alara Kalama was passing by on his way from Kusinara to Pava
And when he saw the Blessed One seated at the foot of a tree
he approached him respectfully greeted him and sat down at one side
And he spoke to the Blessed One saying Marvellous it is Lord most wonderful it is O Lord the state of calmness wherein abide those who have gone forth from the world
For at one time Lord Alara Kalama was on a journey and he went aside from the highway and sat down by the wayside at the foot of a tree to pass the heat of the day
And it came about Lord that a great number of carts even five hundred carts passed by him one by one
And then Lord a certain man who was following behind that train of carts approached and spoke to him saying Did you sir see a great number of carts that passed you by
 And Alara Kalama answered him I did not see them brother
But the noise sir surely you heard
I did not hear it brother
Then that man asked him Then sir perhaps you slept
 No brother I was not sleeping
Then sir were you conscious
 I was brother
Then that man said Then sir while conscious and awake you still did not see the great number of carts even five hundred carts that passed you by one after another nor heard the noise Why sir your very robe is covered with their dust
And Alara Kalama replied saying So it is brother
And to that man O Lord came the thought Marvellous it is most wonderful indeed it is the state of calmness wherein abide those who have gone forth from the world
And there arose in him great faith in Alara Kalama and he went his way
Now what do you think Pukkusa What is more difficult to do more difficult to meet with  that a man while conscious and awake should not see a great number of carts even five hundred carts that passed him by one after another nor hear the noise or that one conscious and awake in the midst of a heavy rain with thunder rolling lightning flashing and thunderbolts crashing should neither see it nor hear the noise 
What O Lord are five hundred carts  nay six seven eight nine hundred or a thousand or even hundreds of thousands of carts  compared with this
Now one time Pukkusa I was staying at Atuma and had my abode in a barn there
And at that time there was a heavy rain with thunder rolling lightning flashing and thunderbolts crashing And two farmers who were brothers were killed close to the barn together with four oxen
and a great crowd came forth from Atuma to the spot where they were killed
Now at that time Pukkusa I had come out of the barn and was walking up and down in thought before the door
And a certain man from the great crowd approached me respectfully greeted me and stood at one side
And I asked him Why brother has this great crowd gathered together
 And he answered me Just now Lord there was a heavy rain with thunder rolling lightning flashing and thunderbolts crashing And two farmers who were brothers were killed close by together with four oxen
It is because of this that the great crowd has gathered
But where Lord were you 
I was here brother
Yet Lord did you not see it
 I did not see it brother
But the noise Lord you surely heard
 I did not hear it brother
Then that man asked me Then Lord perhaps you slept
 No brother I was not sleeping
Then Lord you were conscious
 I was brother
Then that man said Then Lord while conscious and awake in the midst of a heavy rain with thunder rolling lightning flashing and thunderbolts crashing you neither saw it nor heard the noise
 And I answered him saying I did not brother
And to that man Pukkusa came the thought Marvellous it is most wonderful indeed it is the state of calmness wherein abide those who have gone forth from the world
And there arose in him great faith in me and he respectfully saluted me and keeping his right side towards me he went his way
When this had been said Pukkusa of the Malla clan said to the Blessed One The faith Lord that I had in Alara Kalama I now scatter to the mighty wind I let it be carried away as by a flowing stream
Excellent O Lord most excellent O Lord
It is as if Lord one were to set upright what had been overthrown or to reveal what had been hidden or to show the path to one who had gone astray or to light a lamp in the darkness so that those having eyes might see  even so has the Blessed One set forth the Dhamma in many ways
And so O Lord I take my refuge in the Blessed One the Dhamma and the Community of Bhikkhus
May the Blessed One accept me as his disciple one who has taken refuge until the end of life
Then Pukkusa of the Malla clan spoke to a certain man saying Bring me at once friend two sets of goldenhued robes burnished and ready for wear
And the man answered him So be it sir
And when the robes were brought Pukkusa of the Malla clan offered them to the Blessed One saying May the Blessed One O Lord out of compassion accept this from me
And the Blessed One said Robe me then in one Pukkusa and in the other robe Ananda
So be it Lord And he thereupon robed the Blessed One in one and in the other he robed the Venerable Ananda
And then the Blessed One instructed Pukkusa of the Malla clan in the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened him
And after that Pukkusa rose from his seat respectfully saluted the Blessed One and keeping his right side towards him went his way
And soon after Pukkusa of the Malla clan had departed the Venerable Ananda arranged the set of goldenhued robes burnished and ready for wear about the body of the Blessed One
But when the set of robes was arranged upon the body of the Blessed One it became as though faded and its splendor dimmed
And the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One Marvellous it is O Lord most wonderful indeed it is how clear and radiant the skin of the Tathagata appears
This set of goldenhued robes burnished and ready for wear Lord now that it is arranged upon the body of the Blessed One seems to have become faded its splendor dimmed
It is so Ananda There are two occasions Ananda when the skin of the Tathagata appears exceedingly clear and radiant
Which are these two
The night Ananda when the Tathagata becomes fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment and the night when the Tathagata comes to his final passing away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains
These Ananda are the two occasions on which the skin of the Tathagata appears exceedingly clear and radiant
And now today in the last watch of this very night Ananda in the Mallas Sala Grove in the vicinity of Kusinara between two sala trees the Tathagata will come to his Parinibbana
So now Ananda let us go to the Kakuttha River
Clad in Pukkusas gift the robes of gold
The Masters form was radiant to behold
Then the Blessed One went to the Kakuttha River together with a great community of bhikkhus  And he went down into the water and bathed and drank And coming forth from the water again he went to the Mango Grove
and there spoke to the Venerable Cundaka saying Please fold my upper robe in four Cundaka and lay it down I am weary and would rest awhile
So be it Lord And Cundaka folded the robe in four and laid it down
And the Blessed One lay down on his right side in the lions posture resting one foot upon the other and so disposed himself mindfully and clearly comprehending with the time for rising held in mind
And the Venerable Cundaka sat down right in front of the Blessed One
The Buddha to Kakutthas river came
Where cool and limpid flows the pleasant stream
There washed in water clear his weary frame
The Buddha  he in all the world supreme
And having bathed and drank the Teacher straight
Crossed over the bhikkhus thronging in his wake
Discoursing holy truths the Master great
Towards the Mango Grove his path did take
There to the elder Cundaka he spoke
Lay down my robe please folded into four
Then the elder swift as lightning stroke
Hastened the Teachers bidding to obey
Weary the Lord then lay down on the mat
And Cunda on the ground before him sat
Then the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying It may come to pass Ananda that someone will cause remorse to Cunda the metalworker saying It is no gain to you friend Cunda but a loss that it was from you the Tathagata took his last alms meal and then came to his end
Then Ananda the remorse of Cunda should be dispelled after this manner It is a gain to you friend Cunda a blessing that the Tathagata took his last alms meal from you and then came to his end
For friend face to face with the Blessed One I have heard and learned There are two offerings of food which are of equal fruition of equal outcome exceeding in grandeur the fruition and result of any other offerings of food
Which two
The one partaken of by the Tathagata before becoming fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment and the one partaken of by the Tathagata before passing into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains
By his deed the worthy Cunda has accumulated merit which makes for long life beauty well being glory heavenly rebirth and sovereignty
 Thus Ananda the remorse of Cunda the metalworker should be dispelled
Then the Blessed One understanding that matter breathed forth the solemn utterance
Who gives his virtues shall increase
Who is selfcurbed no hatred bears
Whoso is skilled in virtue evil shuns
And by the rooting out of lust and hate And all delusion comes to be at peace
Now on that occasion Pukkusa Mallaputta a disciple of ḷāra Kālāma was traveling on the road from Kusinārā to Pāvā
He saw the Blessed One sitting at the root of a tree
and on seeing him approached him On arrival having bowed down to him he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Its amazing lord Its astounding the peaceful abiding by which those gone forth abide
Once ḷāra Kālāma while traveling went down from the road and sat not far away at the root of a tree for the days abiding
Then  carts passed by right near him
The a certain man coming along right behind those hundreds of carts approached ḷāra Kālāma and on arrival said to him Venerable sir did you see  carts going past
 No friend I didnt
 But did you hear the sound
 No friend I didnt
 But were you asleep
 No friend I wasnt asleep
 But were you conscious
 Yes friend
 Then venerable sir being conscious  awake when  carts passed by right near you you neither saw them nor heard a soundAnd yet your outer robe is covered with dust
Yes friend
 Then the thought occurred to that man How amazing How astounding the peaceful abiding by which those gone forth abide
in that being conscious  awake when  carts passed by right near he would neither see them nor hear a sound
Having proclaimed immense conviction in ḷāra Kālāma he then left
What do you think Pukkusa Which is more difficult to do more difficult to master one who being conscious  awake when  carts passed by right near would neither see them nor hear a sound or one who being conscious  awake when the raindeva was raining the raindeva was pouring lightningstreaks were shooting out and a thunderbolt splits  would neither see them nor hear a sound 
Lord what would  carts amount toor  carts or  carts or  carts or  carts or  carts or  carts
That would be more difficult to do more difficult to master one who being conscious  awake when the raindeva was raining the raindeva was pouring lightningstreaks were shooting out and a thunderbolt splits  would neither see them nor hear a sound 
One time Pukkusa I was staying near tumā in a threshingbarn
And on that occasion when the raindeva was raining the raindeva was pouring lightningstreaks were shooting out and a thunderbolt split not far from the threshinghouse two farmersbrotherswere killed along with four oxen
Then a large crowd of people came out of tumā to where the two farmersbrotherswere killed along with the four oxen
And on that occasion I having come out of the threshingbarn was doing walking meditation in front of the door to the threshingbarn
A certain man from the great crowd of people approached me and on arrival having bowed down to me stood to one side
As he was standing there I said to him Why friend has this great crowd of people gathered 
Just now lordwhen the raindeva was raining the raindeva was pouring lightningstreaks were shooting out and a thunderbolt split two farmersbrotherswere killed along with four oxen
Thats why this great crowd of people has gathered
But you lord Where were you 
I was right here friend 
But did you see anything 
No friend I didnt 
But did you hear the sound 
No friend I didnt 
But were you asleep 
No friend I wasnt asleep 
But were you conscious 
Yes friend
Then lord being conscious  awake when the raindeva was raining the raindeva was pouring lightningstreaks were shooting out and a thunderbolt split  you neither saw anything nor heard a sound 
Yes friend
Then the thought occurred to that man How amazing How astounding the peaceful abiding by which those gone forth abide
in that when the raindeva was raining the raindeva was pouring lightningstreaks were shooting out and a thunderbolt split  he would neither see them nor hear a sound
Having proclaimed immense conviction in me he circumambulated me and then left
When this was said Pukkusa Mallaputta said to the Blessed One The conviction I had in ḷāra Kālāma I winnow before a high wind or wash away in the swift current of a river
Magnificent lord Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed Onethrough many lines of reasoningmade the Dhamma clear
I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of monks
May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life 
Then Pukkusa Mallaputta addressed a certain man Come now I say Fetch me a pair of goldcolored robes ready to wear 
Responding As you say lord to Pukkusa Mallaputta the man fetched the pair of goldcolored robes ready to wear
Then Pukkusa Mallaputta presented the pair of goldcolored robes ready to wear to the Blessed One May the Blessed One accept this pair of goldcolored robes ready to wear out of kindness 
Very well then Pukkusa Clothe me with one and nanda with the other
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Pukkusa Mallaputta clothed the Blessed One with one and Ven nanda with the other
Then the Blessed One instructed urged roused and encouraged Pukkusa Mallaputta with Dhamma talk
Then Pukkusa Mallaputtainstructed urged roused and encouraged with the Blessed Ones Dhamma talkgot up from his seat and bowing down to the Blessed One and circumambulating him left
Then not long after Pukkusa Mallaputta had left Ven nanda placed the pair of goldcolored robes ready to wear against the Blessed Ones body
Placed against the Blessed Ones body their iridescence seemed as if destroyed
Then Ven nanda said Its amazing lord Its astoundinghow clear  bright the color of the Tathāgatas skin
When this pair of goldcolored robes ready to wear is placed against the Blessed Ones body their iridescence seems as if destroyed
So it is nanda There are two times when the color of the Tathāgatas skin is especially clear  bright
Which two
The night on which the Tathāgata awakens to the unexcelled selfawakening and the night on which the Tathāgata totally unbinds by means of the unbinding property with no fuel remaining
These are the two times when the color of the Tathāgatas skin is especially clear  bright
Today in the last watch of the night between the twin Sal trees in Upavattana the Mallans Sal Forest near Kusinārā the Tathāgatas total unbinding will occur
Come nanda we will head for Kakudha River 
As you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed One
Pukkusa offered a pair of goldcolored robes clothed in which
the Teacher of golden complexion shone brightly
Then the Blessed One together with the large Saṅgha of monks went to the Kakudha River and after arriving at the Kakudha River going down bathing drinking  coming back out went to a mango grove
On arrival the Blessed One said to Ven Cundaka Cundaka please arrange my outer robe folded in four I am tired I will lie down 
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven Cundaka arranged the outer robe folded in four
The Blessed One lying on his right side took up the lions posture placing one foot on top of the othermindful alert and attending to the perception of getting up
Ven Cundaka sat in front of him
The awakened one having gone to the little Kakudha river
with its pristine pleasing water clear
the Teacher seeming very tired
the Tathāgata unequalled in the world
went down bathed drank  came out
Honored surrounded in the midst of the group of monks
the Blessed One Teacher proceeding here in the Dhamma
the great seer went to the mango grove
He addressed the monk named Cundaka
Spread it out folded in four for me to lie down
Ordered by the One of developed mind
Cundaka quickly set it out folded in four
The Teacher lay down seeming very tired
and Cundaka sat down there before him
Then the Blessed One addressed Ven nanda nanda if anyone tries to incite remorse in Cunda the silversmith saying Its no gain for you friend Cunda its illdone by you that the Tathāgata having eaten your last alms totally unbound
then Cundas remorse should be allayed  Its a gain for you friend Cunda its welldone by you that the Tathāgata having eaten your last alms totally unbound
Face to face with the Blessed One have I heard it face to face have I learned it These two alms are equal to each other in fruit equal to each other in result of much greater fruit  reward than any other alms
Which two
The alms that after having eaten it the Tathāgata awakens to the unexcelled right selfawakening And the alms that after having eaten it the Tathāgata unbinds by means of the unbinding property with no fuel remaining
These are the two alms that are equal to each other in fruit equal to each other in result of much greater fruit  reward than any other alms
Venerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to long life Venerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to beauty Venerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to happiness Venerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to heaven Venerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to rank Venerable Cunda the silversmith has accumulated kamma that leads to sovereignty
 In this way nanda Cunda the silversmiths remorse should be allayed 
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
For a person giving merit increases
For one selfrestraining no animosity is amassed
One who is skillful leaves evil behind and
from the ending of passion aversion delusion totally unbinds
  The Lord said Ananda let us cross the Hirannavati River and go to the Mallas salgrove in the vicinity of Kusinara
Very good Lord said Ananda
and the Lord with a large company of monks crossed the river and went to the salgrove
There the Lord said Ananda prepare me a bed between these twin saltrees with my head to the north I am tired and want to lie down
Very good Lord said Ananda and did so
Then the Lord lay down on his right side in the lionposture placing one foot on the other mindful and clearly aware
And those twin saltrees burst forth into an abundance of untimely blossoms
which fell upon the Tathagatas body sprinkling it and covering it in homage
Divine coraltree flowers fell from the sky
divine sandalwood powder fell from the sky sprinkling and covering the Tathagatas body in homage
Divine music
and song sounded from the sky in homage to the Tathagata
And the Lord said Ananda these saltrees have burst forth into an abundance of untimely blossoms
Divine music
and song sound from the sky in homage to the Tathagata
Never before has the Tathagata been so honoured revered esteemed worshipped and adored
And yet Ananda whatever monk nun male or female layfollower dwells practising the Dhamma properly and perfectly fulfils the Dhammaway he or she honours the Tathagata reveres and esteems him and pays him the supreme homage
Therefore Ananda We will dwell practising the Dhamma properly and perfectly fulfil the Dhammaway
 this must be your watchword
Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us cross to the farther bank of the Hiraññavati and go to the Mallas Sala Grove in the vicinity of Kusinara
So be it Lord
And the Blessed One together with a large company of bhikkhus went to the further bank of the river Hiraññavati to the Sala Grove of the Mallas in the vicinity of Kusinara
And there he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying  Please Ananda prepare for me a couch between the twin sala trees with the head to the north I am weary Ananda and want to lie down
So be it Lord And the Venerable Ananda did as the Blessed One asked him to do
Then the Blessed One lay down on his right side in the lions posture resting one foot upon the other and so disposed himself mindfully and clearly comprehending
At that time the twin sala trees broke out in full bloom though it was not the season of flowering
And the blossoms rained upon the body of the Tathagata and dropped and scattered and were strewn upon it in worship of the Tathagata
And celestial mandarava flowers
and heavenly sandalwood powder from the sky rained down upon the body of the Tathagata and dropped and scattered and were strewn upon it in worship of the Tathagata
And the sound of heavenly voices
and heavenly instruments made music in the air out of reverence for the Tathagata
And the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Ananda the twin sala trees are in full bloom though it is not the season of flowering
And the blossoms rain upon the body of the Tathagata and drop and scatter and are strewn upon it in worship of the Tathagata
And celestial coral flowers
and heavenly sandalwood powder from the sky rain down upon the body of the Tathagata and drop and scatter and are strewn upon it in worship of the Tathagata
And the sound of heavenly voices
and heavenly instruments makes music in the air out of reverence for the Tathagata
Yet it is not thus Ananda that the Tathagata is respected venerated esteemed worshipped and honored in the highest degree
But Ananda whatever bhikkhu or bhikkhuni layman or laywoman abides by the Dhamma lives uprightly in the Dhamma walks in the way of the Dhamma it is by such a one that the Tathagata is respected venerated esteemed worshipped and honored in the highest degree
Therefore Ananda  We shall abide by the Dhamma live uprightly in the Dhamma walk in the way of the Dhamma
 thus should you train yourselves
Then the Blessed One said to Ven nanda Come nanda we will head for the far shore of the Hiraññavati River for Upavattana the Mallans Sal Forest near Kusinārā
As you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One with a large Saṅgha of monks went to the far shore of the Hiraññavati River to Upavattana the Mallans Sal Forest near Kusinārā
On arrival he said to Ven nanda nanda please prepare a bed for me between the twin Sal trees with its head to the north I am tired and will lie down 
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven nanda prepared a bed between the twin Sal trees with its head to the north
Then the Blessed One lay down on his right side in the lions sleeping posture with one foot on top of the other mindful  alert 
Now on that occasion the twin Sal trees were in full bloom even though it was not the time for flowering
They showered strewed  sprinkled on the Tathāgatas body in homage to him
Heavenly coraltree blossoms fell from the sky showering strewing  sprinkling the Tathāgatas body in homage to him
Heavenly sandalwood powder fell from the sky showering strewing  sprinkling the Tathāgatas body in homage to him
Heavenly music was playing in the sky in homage to the Tathāgata
Heavenly songs were sung in the sky in homage to the Tathāgata
Then the Blessed One said to Ven nanda nanda the twin Sal trees are in full bloom even though its not the flowering season
They shower strew  sprinkle on the Tathāgatas body in homage to him
Heavenly coraltree blossoms are falling from the sky
 Heavenly sandalwood powder is falling from the sky
 Heavenly music is playing in the sky
 Heavenly songs are sung in the sky in homage to the Tathāgata
But it is not to this extent that a Tathāgata is worshipped honored respected venerated or paid homage to
Rather the monk nun male lay follower or female lay follower who keeps practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma who keeps practicing masterfully who lives in accordance with the Dhamma That is the person who worships honors respects venerates  pays homage to the Tathāgata with the highest homage
So you should train yourselves We will keep practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma we will keep practicing masterfully we will live in accordance with the Dhamma
Thats how you should train yourselves
Just then the Venerable Upavana was standing in front of the Lord fanning him
And the Lord told him to move Move aside monk do not stand in front of me
And the Venerable Ananda thought This Venerable Upavana has for long been the Lords attendant keeping close at hand at his beck and call
And now in his last hour the Lord tells him to stand aside and not stand in front of him
Why ever does he do that
And he asked the Lord about this
Ananda the devas from ten worldspheres have gathered to see the Tathagata
For a distance of twelve yojanas around the Mallas salgrove near Kusinara there is not a space you could touch with the point of a hair that is not filled with mighty devas
and they are grumbling We have come a long way to see the Tathagata
It is rare for a Tathagata a fullyenlightened Buddha to arise in the world
and tonight in the last watch the Tathagata will attain final Nibbana
and this mighty monk is standing in front of the Lord preventing us from getting a last glimpse of the Tathagata
But Lord what kind of devas can the Lord perceive
 Ananda there are skydevas whose minds are earthbound they are weeping and tearing their hair raising their arms throwing themselves down and twisting and turning crying All too soon the Blessed Lord is passing away all too soon the WellFarer is passing away all too soon the Eye of the World is disappearing
And there are earthdevas whose minds are earthbound who do likewise
But those devas who are free from craving endure patiently saying All compounded things are impermanent  what is the use of this
At that time the Venerable Upavana was standing before the Blessed One fanning him
And the Blessed One rebuked him saying Move aside bhikkhu do not stand in front of me
And to the Venerable Ananda came the thought This Venerable Upavana has been in attendance on the Blessed One for a long time closely associating with him and serving him
Yet now right at the end the Blessed One rebukes him
What now could be the reason what the cause for the Blessed One to rebuke the Venerable Upavana saying Move aside bhikkhu do not stand in front of me
And the Venerable Ananda told his thought to the Blessed One
The Blessed One said Throughout the tenfold worldsystem Ananda there are hardly any of the deities that have not gathered together to look upon the Tathagata
For a distance of twelve yojanas around the Sala Grove of the Mallas in the vicinity of Kusinara there is not a spot that could be pricked with the tip of a hair that is not filled with powerful deities
And these deities Ananda are complaining From afar have we come to look upon the Tathagata
For rare in the world is the arising of Tathagatas Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones
And this day in the last watch of the night the Tathagatas Parinibbana will come about
But this bhikkhu of great powers has placed himself right in front of the Blessed One concealing him so that now at the very end we are prevented from looking upon him Thus Ananda the deities complain
Of what kind of deities Lord is the Blessed One aware
There are deities Ananda in space  who are earthlyminded with dishevelled hair they weep with uplifted arms they weep flinging themselves on the ground they roll from side to side lamenting Too soon has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana Too soon has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana Too soon will the Eye of the World vanish from sight
and on earth
But those deities who are freed from passion mindful and comprehending reflect in this way Impermanent are all compounded things How could this be otherwise 
Now on that occasion Ven Upavāṇa was standing in front of the Blessed One fanning him
Then the Blessed One dismissed him saying Go away monk Dont stand in front of me
 Then the thought occurred to Ven nanda For a long time now this Ven Upavāṇa has been an attendant to the Blessed One staying near him and traveling with him
But now in his final hour he dismisses him saying Go away monk Dont stand in front of me
 Now what is the reason what is the cause why the Blessed One dismisses him saying Go away monk Dont stand in front of me 
Then Ven nanda said to the Blessed One For a long time now this Ven Upavāṇa has been an attendant to the Blessed One staying near him and traveling with him
But now in his final hour he dismisses him saying Go away monk Dont stand in front of me
 Now what is the reason what is the cause why the Blessed One dismisses him saying Go away monk Dont stand in front of me 
nanda most of the devatās from ten worldsystems have gathered in order to see the Tathāgata
For twelve leagues all around Upavattana the Mallans Sal Forest near Kusinārā there is not the space even of the tip of a horsetail hair that is not occupied by eminent devatās
The devatās nanda are complaining We have come a long distance to see the Tathāgata
Only once in a long long time does a Tathāgataworthy  rightly selfawakenedarise in the world
Tonight in the last watch of the night the total unbinding of the Tathāgata will occur
And this eminent monk is standing in front of the Blessed One blocking the way We arent getting to see the Blessed One in his final hour 
But lord what is the state of the devatās the Blessed One is paying attention to 
nanda there are devatās who perceive space to be earth Tearing at their hair they are weeping Uplifting their arms they are weeping As if their feet were cut out from under them they fall down and roll back  forth crying All too soon the Blessed One will totally unbind All too soon the One WellGone will totally unbind All too soon the One with Eyes alternate reading the Eye will disappear from the world
Then there are devatās who perceive earth to be earth Tearing at their hair they are weeping Uplifting their arms they are weeping As if their feet were cut out from under them they fall down and roll back  forth crying All too soon the Blessed One will totally unbind All too soon the One WellGone will totally unbind All too soon the One with Eyes will disappear from the world
But those devatās who are free from passion acquiesce mindful  alert Inconstant are fabrications What else is there to expect
Lord formerly monks who had spent the Rains in various places used to come to see the Tathagata
and we used to welcome them so that such welltrained monks might see you and pay their respects
But with the Lords passing we shall no longer have a chance to do this
Ananda there are four places the sight of which should arouse emotion in the faithful
Which are they
Here the Tathagata was bom is the first
Here the Tathagata attained supreme enlightenment is the second
Here the Tathagata set in motion the Wheel of Dhamma is the third
Here the Tathagata attained the Nibbanaelement without remainder is the fourth
And Ananda the faithful monks and nuns male and female layfollowers will visit those places
And any who die while making the pilgrimage to these shrines with a devout heart will at the breakingup of the body after death be reborn in a heavenly world
Formerly Lord on leaving their quarters after the rains the bhikkhus would set forth to see the Tathagata
and to us there was the gain and benefit of receiving and associating with those very revered bhikkhus who came to have audience with the Blessed One and to wait upon him
But Lord after the Blessed One has gone we shall no longer have that gain and benefit
There are four places Ananda that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence
What are the four
Here the Tathagata was born This Ananda is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence
Here the Tathagata became fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment This Ananda is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence
Here the Tathagata set rolling the unexcelled Wheel of the Dhamma This Ananda is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence
Here the Tathagata passed away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains This Ananda is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence
These Ananda are the four places that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence
And truly there will come to these places Ananda pious bhikkhus and bhikkhunis laymen and laywomen reflecting Here the Tathagata was born Here the Tathagata became fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment Here the Tathagata set rolling the unexcelled Wheel of the Dhamma Here the Tathagata passed away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains
And whoever Ananda should die on such a pilgrimage with his heart established in faith at the breaking up of the body after death will be reborn in a realm of heavenly happiness
In the past lord the monks in all directions after ending the Rains retreat came to see the Tathāgata
Thus we got to see  attend to the monks who inspire the heart
But now after the Blessed One is gone we wont get to see or attend to the monks who inspire the heart 
nanda there are these four places that merit being seen by a clansman with conviction that merit his feelings of urgency  dismay savega
Which four
Here the Tathāgata was born is a place that merits being seen by a clansman with conviction that merits his feelings of urgency  dismay
Here the Tathāgata awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening
 Here the Tathāgata set rolling the unexcelled wheel of Dhamma
 Here the Tathāgata totally unbound in the property of unbinding with no fuel remaining is a place that merits being seen by a clansman with conviction that merits his feelings of urgency  dismay
These are the four places that merit being seen by a clansman with conviction that merit his feelings of urgency  dismay
They will come out of conviction nandamonks nuns male lay followers  female lay followersto the spots where Here the Tathāgata was born Here the Tathāgata awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening Here the Tathāgata set rolling the unexcelled wheel of Dhamma Here the Tathāgata totally unbound in the property of unbinding with no fuel remaining
 And anyone who dies while making a pilgrimage to these shrines with a bright confident mind willon the breakup of the body after deathreappear in a good destination a heavenly world
Lord how should we act towards women
 Do not see them Ananda
But if we see them how should we behave Lord
 Do not speak to them Ananda
But if they speak to us Lord how should we behave
 Practise mindfulness Ananda 
Lord what shall we do with the Tathagatas remains
 Do not worry yourselves about the funeral arrangements Ananda
You should strive for the highest goal devote yourselves to the highest goal and dwell with your minds tirelessly zealously devoted to the highest goal
There are wise Khattiyas Brahmins and householders who are devoted to the Tathagata they will take care of the funeral
But Lord what are we to do with the Tathagatas remains
 Ananda they should be dealt with like the remains of a wheelturning monarch
And how is that Lord
 Ananda the remains of a wheelturning monarch are wrapped in a new linencloth This they wrap in teased cotton wool and this in a new cloth
Having done this five hundred times each they enclose the kings body in an oilvat of iron which is covered with another iron pot Then having made a funeralpyre of all manner of perfumes they cremate the kings body
and they raise a stupa at a crossroads
That Ananda is what they do withthe remains of a wheelturning monarch and they should deal with the Tathagatas body in the same way
A stupa should be erected at the crossroads for the Tathagata
And whoever lays wreaths or puts sweet perfumes and colours there with a devout heart will reap benefit and happiness for a long time
Then the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One How Lord should we conduct ourselves towards women
Do not see them Ananda
But Lord if we do see them 
Do not speak Ananda
But Lord if they should speak to us 
Then Ananda you should establish mindfulness
Then the Venerable Ananda said How should we act Lord respecting the body of the Tathagata 
Do not hinder yourselves Ananda to honor the body of the Tathagata
Rather you should strive Ananda and be zealous on your own behalf for your own good Unflinchingly ardently and resolutely you should apply yourselves to your own good
For there are Ananda wise nobles wise brahmans and wise householders who are devoted to the Tathagata and it is they who will render the honor to the body of the Tathagata
Then the Venerable Ananda said But how Lord should they act respecting the body of the Tathagata 
After the same manner Ananda as towards the body of a universal monarch
But how Lord do they act respecting the body of a universal monarch 
The body of a universal monarch Ananda is first wrapped round with new linen and then with teased cotton wool
and so it is done up to five hundred layers of linen and five hundred of cotton wool When that is done the body of the universal monarch is placed in an iron oil vessel which is enclosed in another iron vessel a funeral pyre is built of all kinds of perfumed woods and so the body of the universal monarch is burned
and at a crossroads a stupa is raised for the universal monarch
So it is done Ananda with the body of a universal monarch
And even Ananda as with the body of a universal monarch so should it be done with the body of the Tathagata
and at a crossroads also a stupa should be raised for the Tathagata
And whosoever shall bring to that place garlands or incense or sandalpaste or pay reverence and whose mind becomes calm there  it will be to his well being and happiness for a long time
Lord what course should we follow with regard to womenfolk 
Notseeing nanda
But when there is seeing lord what course should be followed 
Notaddressing nanda 
But when we are addressed what course should be followed 
Mindfulness should be established nanda 
And lord what course should we follow with regard to the Tathāgatas body 
You are not to be concerned about the Tathāgatas funeral
Please nanda strive for the true goal be committed to the true goal dwell heedful ardent  resolute for the sake of the true goal
There are wise nobles wise brahmans  wise householders who are highly confident in the Tathāgata They will conduct the Tathāgatas funeral 
But lord what course should be followed with regard to the Tathāgatas body 
The course they follow with regard to a wheelturning monarchs body nanda is the course that should be followed with regard to the Tathāgatas body 
And what lord is the course they follow with regard to a wheelturning monarchs body
nanda they wrap the wheelturning monarchs body in new linen cloth Having wrapped it in new linen cloth they wrap it in teased cottonwool Having wrapped it in teased cottonwool they wrap it in new linen cloth
Having done this five hundred times they place the body in an iron oilvat cover it with an iron lid make a pyre composed totally of perfumed substances and cremate the body
Then they build a burial mound for the wheelturning monarch at a great fourway intersection
That is the course that they follow with regard to a wheelturning monarchs body
The course they follow with regard to a wheelturning monarchs body nanda is the course that should be followed with regard to the Tathāgatas body
A burial mound for the Tathāgata is to be built at a great fourway intersection
And those who offer a garland a scent or a perfume powder there or bow down there or brighten their minds there That will be for their longterm welfare  happiness
Ananda there are four persons worthy of a stupa
Who are they
A Tathagata Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha is one a Pacceka Buddha is one a disciple of the Tathagata is one and a wheelturning monarch is one
And why is each of these worthy of a stupa
Because Ananda at the thought This is the stupa of a Tathagata peoples hearts are made peaceful
and then at the breakingup of me body after death they go to a good destiny and rearise in a heavenly world
of a Pacceka Buddha
of a disciple of the Tathagata
of a wheelturning monarch
That is the reason and those are the four who are worthy of a stupa
There are four persons Ananda who are worthy of a stupa
Who are those four
A Tathagata an Arahant a Fully Enlightened One is worthy of a stupa so also is a Paccekabuddha and a disciple of a Tathagata and a universal monarch
And why Ananda is a Tathagata an Arahant a Fully Enlightened One worthy of a stupa
Because Ananda at the thought This is the stupa of that Blessed One Arahant Fully Enlightened One the hearts of many people will be calmed and made happy
and so calmed and with their minds established in faith therein at the breaking up of the body after death they will be reborn in a realm of heavenly happiness
And so also at the thought This is the stupa of that Paccekabuddha
or This is the stupa of a disciple of that Tathagata Arahant Fully Enlightened One
or This is the stupa of that righteous monarch who ruled according to Dhamma  the hearts of many people are calmed and made happy
and so calmed and with their minds established in faith therein at the breaking up of the body after death they will be reborn in a realm of heavenly happiness
And it is because of this Ananda that these four persons are worthy of a stupa
There are these four who are worthy of a burial mound
Which four
A Tathāgata worthy  rightly selfawakened is worthy of a burial mound A Private Buddha a disciple of a Tathāgata a wheelturning monarch is worthy of a burial mound
And for what reason is a Tathāgata worthy  rightly selfawakened worthy of a burial mound
 This is the burial mound of a Tathāgata worthy  rightly selfawakened many people will brighten their minds
Having brightened their minds there thenon the breakup of the body after deaththey will reappear in a good destination a heavenly world
It is for this reason that a Tathāgata worthy  rightly selfawakened is worthy of a burial mound
And for what reason is a Private Buddha worthy of a burial mound
 This is the burial mound of a Private Buddha many people will brighten their minds
Having brightened their minds there thenon the breakup of the body after deaththey will reappear in a good destination a heavenly world
And for what reason is a disciple of a Tathāgata worthy of a burial mound
 This is the burial mound of a disciple of a Tathāgata many people will brighten their minds
Having brightened their minds there thenon the breakup of the body after deaththey will reappear in a good destination a heavenly world
And for what reason is a wheelturning monarch worthy of a burial mound
 This is the burial mound of a wheelturning monarch many people will brighten their minds
Having brightened their minds there thenon the breakup of the body after deaththey will reappear in a good destination a heavenly world
It is for this reason that a wheelturning monarch is worthy of a burial mound
These are the four who are worthy of a burial mound
And the Venerable Ananda went into his lodging and stood lamenting leaning on the doorpost Alas I am still a learner with much to do And the Teacher is passing away who was so compassionate to me
Then the Lord enquired of the monks where Ananda was
and they told him
So he said to a certain monk Go monk and say to Ananda from me Friend Ananda the Teacher summons you
Very good Lord said the monk and did so
Very good friend Ananda replied to that monk and he went to the Lord saluted him and sat down to one side
And the Lord said Enough Ananda do not weep and wail Have I not already told you that all things that are pleasant and delightful are changeable subject to separation and becoming other
So how could it be Ananda  since whatever is bom become compounded is subject to decay  how could it be that it should not pass away
For a long time Ananda you have been in the Tathagatas presence showing lovingkindness in act of body speech and mind beneficially blessedly wholeheartedly and unstintingly
You have achieved much merit Ananda Make the effort and in a short time you will be free of the corruptions 
Then the Lord addressed the monks Monks all those who were Arahant fullyenlightened Buddhas in the past have had just such a chief attendant as Ananda
and so too will those Blessed Lords who come in the future
Monks Ananda is wise
He knows when it is the right time for monks to come to see the Tathagata when it is the right time for nuns for male layfollowers for female layfollowers for kings for royal ministers for leaders of other schools and for their pupils
Ananda has four remarkable and wonderful qualities
What are they
If a company of monks comes to see Ananda they are pleased at the sight of him
and when Ananda talks Dhamma to them they are pleased
and when he is silent they are disappointed
And so it is too with nuns
with male
and female layfollowers
And these four qualities apply to a wheelturning monarch
if he is visited by a company of Khattiyas
of Brahmins of householders or of ascetics they are pleased at the sight of him
and when he talks to them
and when he is silent they are disappointed
And so too it is with Ananda
Then the Venerable Ananda went into the vihara and leaned against the doorpost and wept I am still but a learner and still have to strive for my own perfection But alas my Master who was so compassionate towards me is about to pass away
And the Blessed One spoke to the bhikkhus saying Where bhikkhus is Ananda 
The Venerable Ananda Lord has gone into the vihara and there stands leaning against the door post and weeping I am still but a learner and still have to strive for my own perfection But alas my Master who was so compassionate towards me is about to pass away
Then the Blessed One asked a certain bhikkhu to bring the Venerable Ananda to him saying Go bhikkhu and say to Ananda Friend Ananda the Master calls you
So be it Lord And that bhikkhu went and spoke to the Venerable Ananda as the Blessed One had asked him to
And the Venerable Ananda went to the Blessed One bowed down to him and sat down on one side
Then the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Enough Ananda Do not grieve do not lament For have I not taught from the very beginning that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change separation and severance
Of that which is born come into being compounded and subject to decay how can one say May it not come to dissolution There can be no such state of things
Now for a long time Ananda you have served the Tathagata with lovingkindness in deed word and thought graciously pleasantly with a whole heart and beyond measure
Great good have you gathered Ananda Now you should put forth energy and soon you too will be free from the taints
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Bhikkhus the Blessed Ones Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of times past also had excellent and devoted attendant bhikkhus such as I have in Ananda
And so also bhikkhus will the Blessed Ones Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of times to come
Capable and judicious is Ananda bhikkhus
for he knows the proper time for bhikkhus to have audience with the Tathagata and the time for bhikkhunis the time for laymen and for laywomen the time for kings and for ministers of state the time for teachers of other sects and for their followers
In Ananda bhikkhus are to be found four rare and superlative qualities
What are the four
If bhikkhus a company of bhikkhus should go to see Ananda they become joyful on seeing him
and if he then speaks to them of the Dhamma they are made joyful by his discourse
and when he becomes silent they are disappointed
So it is also when bhikkhunis
laymen
or laywomen go to see Ananda they become joyful on seeing him
and if he then speaks to them of the Dhamma they are made joyful by his discourse
and when he becomes silent they are disappointed
In a universal monarch bhikkhus are to be found four rare and superlative qualities
What are those four
If bhikkhus a company of nobles should go to see the universal monarch they become joyful on seeing him
and if he then speaks they are made joyful by his talk
and when he becomes silent they are disappointed
So it is also when a company of brahmans of householders or of ascetics goes to see a universal monarch
And in just the same way bhikkhus in Ananda are to be found these four rare and superlative qualities
Then Ven nanda going into a building stood leaning against the door jamb weeping Here I am still in training with work left to do and the total unbinding of my teacher is about to occurthe teacher who has had such sympathy for me
Then the Blessed One said to the monks Monks where is nanda 
Lord Ven nanda having gone into that building stands leaning against the door jamb weeping Here I am still in training with work left to do and the total unbinding of my teacher is about to occurthe teacher who has had such sympathy for me
Then the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monk In my name call nanda saying The Teacher calls you my friend 
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One the monk went to Ven nanda and on arrival said The Teacher calls you my friend 
Responding As you say my friend to the monk Ven nanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Enough nanda Dont grieve Dont lament Havent I already taught you the state of growing different with regard to all things dear  appealing the state of becoming separate the state of becoming otherwise What else is there to expect
Its impossible that one could forbid anything born existent fabricated  subject to disintegration from disintegrating
For a long time nanda you have waited on the Tathāgata with bodily acts of good willhelpful happy wholehearted without limit with verbal acts of good will with mental acts of good willhelpful happy wholehearted without limit
You are one who has made merit Commit yourself to exertion and soon you will be without effluents 
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks those Blessed Ones who in the past were worthy ones rightly selfawakened had foremost attendants just as I have had nanda
Those Blessed Ones who in the future will be worthy ones rightly selfawakened will have foremost attendants just as I have had nanda
nanda is wise
He knows This is the time to approach to see the Tathāgata This is the time for monks this the time for nuns this the time for male layfollowers this the time for female layfollowers this the time for kings  their ministers this the time for sectarians this the time for the followers of sectarians
There are these four amazing  astounding qualities in nanda
If a group of monks approaches to see nanda they are gratified at the sight of him
If he speaks Dhamma to them they are gratified with what he says
Before they are sated he falls silent
If a group of nuns approaches to see nanda
If a group of male lay followers approaches to see nanda
If a group of female lay followers approaches to see nanda they are gratified at the sight of him
If he speaks Dhamma to them they are gratified with what he says
Before they are sated he falls silent
These are the four amazing  astounding qualities in nanda
There are these four amazing  astounding qualities in a wheelturning monarch
If a group of noble warriors approaches to see him
If a group of brahmans approaches to see him If a group of householders approaches to see him If a group of contemplatives approaches to see him they are gratified at the sight of him
If he speaks to them they are gratified with what he says
Before they are sated he falls silent
In the same way monks there are these four amazing  astounding qualities in nanda
If a group of monks
a group of nuns a group of male lay followers a group of female lay followers approaches to see nanda they are gratified at the sight of him
If he speaks Dhamma to them they are gratified with what he says
Before they are sated he falls silent
These are the four amazing  astounding qualities in nanda
After this the Venerable Ananda said Lord may the Blessed Lord not pass away in this miserable little town of wattleanddaub right in the jungle in the back of beyond
Lord there are other great cities such as Campa Rajagaha Savatthi Saketa Kosambi or Varanasi
In those places there are wealthy Khattiyas Brahmins and householders who are devoted to the Tathagata
and they will provide for the Tathagatas funeral in proper style Ananda dont call it a miserable little town of wattleand daub right in the jungle in the back of beyond
Once upon a time Ananda King Mahasudassana was a wheelturning monarch a rightful and righteous king who had conquered the land in four directions and ensured the security of his realm and who possessed the seven treasures
And Ananda this King Mahasudassana had this very Kusinara under the name of Kusavati for his capital And it was twelve yojanas long from east to west and seven yojanas wide from north to south
Kusavati was rich prosperous and wellpopulated crowded with people and wellstocked with food
Just as the devacity of Alakamanda is rich prosperous and wellpopulated crowded with yakkhas and wellstocked with food so was the royal city of Kusavati
And the city of Kusavati was never free of ten sounds by day or night the sound of elephants horses carriages kettledrums sidedrums lutes singing cymbals and gongs with cries of Eat drink and be merry as tenth 
And now Ananda go to Kusinara and announce to the Mallas of Kusinara Tonight Vasetthas in the last watch the Tathagata will attain final Nibbana
Approach him Vasetthas approach him
lest later you should regret it saying The Tathagata passed away in our parish and we did not take the opportunity to see him for the last time
Very good Lord said Ananda and taking robe and bowl he went with a companion to Kusinara
When this had been said the Venerable Ananda spoke to the Blessed One saying Let it not be Lord that the Blessed One should pass away in this mean place this uncivilized township in the midst of the jungle a mere outpost of the province
There are great cities Lord such as Campa Rajagaha Savatthi Saketa Kosambi and Benares  let the Blessed One have his final passing away in one of those
For in those cities dwell many wealthy nobles and brahmans and householders who are devotees of the Tathagata
and they will render due honor to the remains of the Tathagata  Do not say that Ananda Do not say This mean place this uncivilized township in the midst of the jungle a mere outpost of the province
In times long past Ananda there was a king by the name of Maha Sudassana who was a universal monarch a king of righteousness a conqueror of the four quarters of the earth whose realm was established in security and who was endowed with the seven jewels
And that King Maha Sudassana Ananda had his royal residence here at Kusinara which was then called Kusavati and it extended twelve yojanas from east to west and seven from north to south
And mighty Ananda was Kusavati the capital prosperous and well populated much frequented by people and abundantly provided with food
Just as the royal residence of the deities Alakamanda is mighty prosperous and well populated much frequented by deities and abundantly provided with food so was the royal capital of Kusavati
Kusavati Ananda resounded unceasingly day and night with ten sounds  the trumpeting of elephants the neighing of horses the rattling of chariots the beating of drums and tabours music and song cheers the clapping of hands and cries of Eat drink and be merry
Go now Ananda to Kusinara and announce to the Mallas Today Vasetthas in the last watch of the night the Tathagatas Parinibbana will take place
Approach O Vasetthas draw near
Do not be remorseful later at the thought In our township it was that the Tathagatas Parinibbana took place but we failed to see him at the end
So be it Lord And the Venerable Ananda prepared himself and taking bowl and robe went with a companion to Kusinara
When this was said Ven nanda said to the Blessed One Lord may the Blessed One not totally unbind in this little town this dusty town this branch township
There are other great cities Campā Rājagaha Sāvatthī Sāketa Kosambī Bārāṇasī May the Blessed One totally unbind there
In those cities there are many wealthy noble warriors brahmans  householders who have high confidence in the Tathāgata
They will conduct the Tathāgatas funeral  Dont say that nanda Dont say that this little town this dusty town this branch township
 In the past nanda a king named Mahā Sudassana was a wheelturning monarch a righteous king ruling righteously who was a conqueror of the four directions a stabilizer of his country endowed with the seven treasures
This Kusinārā was his capital city named Kusāvatī twelve leagues long from east to west seven leagues wide from north to south
Kusāvatī was powerful rich  wellpopulated crowded with people  prosperous
Just as the capital city of the devas named lakamandā is powerful rich  wellpopulated crowded with yakkhas  prosperous in the same way Kusāvatī was powerful rich  wellpopulated crowded with people  prosperous
By day or by night it was never lacking in ten sounds the sound of elephants the sound of horses the sound of carts the sound of drums the sound of tabors the sound of lutes the sound of songs the sound of cymbals the sound of gongs with cries of Eat Drink Snack as the tenth
Now nanda go into Kusinārā and announce to the Kusinārā Mallans Tonight Vāsiṭṭhas in the last watch of the night the total unbinding of the Tathāgata will occur
Come out Vāsiṭṭhas Come out Vāsiṭṭhas
Dont later regret that The Tathāgatas total unbinding occurred within the borders of our very own town but we didnt get to see him in his final hour
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven nanda adjusted his lower robe andtaking his bowl  outer robewent unaccompanied into Kusinārā
Just then the Mallas of Kusinara were assembled in their meetinghall on some business
And Ananda came to them and delivered the Lords words
And when they heard Anandas words the Mallas with their sons daughtersinlaw and wives were struck with anguish and sorrow their minds were overcome with grief so that they were all weeping and tearing their hair 
Then they all went to the salgrove where the Venerable Ananda was
And Ananda thought If I allow the Mallas of Kusinara to salute the Lord individually the night will have passed before they have all paid homage
I had better let them pay homage family by family saying Lord the Malla soandso with his children his wife his servants and his friends pays homage at the Lords feet
 And so he presented them in that way and thus allowed all the Mallas of Kusinara to pay homage to the Lord in the first watch
Now at that time the Mallas had gathered in the council hall for some public business
And the Venerable Ananda approached them and announced Today Vasetthas in the last watch of the night the Tathagatas Parinibbana will take place
Approach Vasetthas draw near
Do not be remorseful later at the thought In our township it was that the Tathagatas Parinibbana took place but we failed to see him at the end
When they heard the Venerable Ananda speak these words the Mallas with their sons their wives and the wives of their sons were sorely grieved grieved at heart and afflicted and some with their hair all dishevelled with arms uplifted in despair wept flinging themselves on the ground they rolled from side to side lamenting Too soon has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana Too soon has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana Too soon will the Eye of the World vanish from sight
And thus afflicted and filled with grief the Mallas with their sons their wives and the wives of their sons went to the Sala Grove the recreation park of the Mallas to the place where the Venerable Ananda was
And the thought arose in the Venerable Ananda If I were to allow the Mallas of Kusinara to pay reverence to the Blessed One one by one the night will have given place to dawn before they are all presented to him
Therefore let me divide them up according to clan each family in a group and so present them to the Blessed One thus The Malla of such and such a name Lord with his wives and children his attendants and his friends pays homage at the feet of the Blessed One
And the Venerable Ananda divided the Mallas up according to clan each family in a group and presented them to the Blessed One
So it was that the Venerable Ananda caused the Mallas of Kusinara to be presented to the Blessed One by clans each family in a group even in the first watch of the night
Now at that time the Kusinārā Mallans had met for some business in their reception hall
Ven nanda went to the reception hall and on arrival announced to them Tonight Vāsiṭṭhas in the last watch of the night the total unbinding of the Tathāgata will occur
Come out Vāsiṭṭhas Come out Vāsiṭṭhas
Dont later regret that The Tathāgatas total unbinding occurred within the borders of our very own town but we didnt get to see him in his final hour
When they heard Ven nanda the Mallans together with their sons daughters  wives were shocked saddened their minds overflowing with sorrow Some of them wept tearing at their hair they wept uplifting their arms As if their feet were cut out from under them they fell down and rolled back  forth crying All too soon the Blessed One will totally unbind All too soon the One WellGone will totally unbind All too soon the One with Eyes will disappear from the world
Then the Mallans together with their sons daughters  wivesshocked saddened their minds overflowing with sorrowwent to Ven nanda at Upavattana the Mallans Sal Forest near Kusinārā
The thought occurred to Ven nanda If I let the Mallans pay reverence to the Blessed One one by one the night will be over before they have finished paying reverence
What if I were to have them pay reverence to the Blessed One arranging them family by family announcing Lord the Mallan named soso together with his children  wives servants  retainers bows down with his head at the Blessed Ones feet
So Ven nanda arranging the Mallans family by family had them pay reverence to the Blessed One Lord the Mallan named soso together with his children  wives servants  retainers bows down with his head at the Blessed Ones feet
In this way Ven nanda got the Mallans to pay reverence to the Blessed One within the first watch of the night
And at that time a wanderer called Subhadda was in Kusinara and he heard that the ascetic Gotama was to attain final Nibbana in the final watch of that night
He thought I have heard from venerable wanderers advanced in years teachers of teachers that a Tathagata a fullyenlightened Buddha only rarely arises in the world
And tonight in the last watch the ascetic Gotama will attain final Nibbana
Now a doubt has arisen in my mind and I feel sure that the ascetic Gotama can teach me a doctrine to dispel that doubt
So Subhadda went to the Mallas salgrove to where the Venerable Ananda was and told him what he had thought
Reverend Ananda may I be permitted to see the ascetic Gotama
 But Ananda replied Enough friend Subhadda do not disturb the Tathagata the Lord is weary
And Subhadda made his request a second and a third time
but still Ananda refused it
But the Lord overheard this conversation between Ananda and Subhadda
and he called to Ananda Enough Ananda do not hinder Subhadda let him see the Tathagata
For whatever Subhadda asks me he will ask in quest of enlightenment and not to annoy me
and what I say in reply to his questions he will quickly understand
Then Ananda said Go in friend Subhadda the Lord gives you leave
Then Subhadda approached the Lord exchanged courtesies with him and sat down to one side
saying Venerable Gotama all those ascetics and Brahmins who have orders and followings who are teachers wellknown and famous as founders of schools and popularly regarded as saints like Purana Kassapa Makkhali Gosala Ajita Kesakamball Pakudha Kac cayana Sanjaya Belatthaputta and the Nigantha Nataputta  have they all realised the truth as they all make out or have none of them realised it or have some realised it and some not
 Enough Subhadda never mind whether all or none or some of them have realised the truth
I will teach you Dhamma Subhadda Listen pay close attention and I will speak
Tes Lord said Subhadda
and the Lord said
In whatever Dhamma and discipline the Noble Eightfold Path is not found no ascetic is found of the first
the second
the third
or the fourth grade
But such ascetics can be found of the first second third and fourth grade in a Dhamma and discipline where the Noble Eightfold Path is found
Now Subhadda in this Dhamma and discipline the Noble Eightfold Path is found and in it are to be found ascetics of the first second third and fourth grade Those other schools are devoid of true ascetics
but if in this one the monks were to live the life to perfection the world would not lack for Arahants
Twentynine years of age I was When I went
forth to seek the Good
Now over fifty years have passed
Since the day that I went forth
To roam the realm of wisdoms law
Outside of which no ascetic is First
 second
third
or fourth degree
Other schools of such are bare
But if here monks live perfectly The world wont lack for Arahants 
At this the wanderer Subhadda said Excellent Lord excellent
It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down or to point out the way to one who had got lost or to bring an oil lamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways
And I Lord go for refuge to the Blessed Lord the Dhamma and the Sangha
May I receive the goingforth in the Lords presence May I receive ordination
Subhadda whoever coming from another school seeks the goingforth and ordination in this Dhamma and discipline must wait four months on probation
And at the end of four months those monks who are established in mind may let him go forth and give him ordination to the status of a monk
However there can be a distinction of persons
Lord if those coming from other schools must wait four months on probation
I will wait four years and then let them give me the goingforth and the ordination
But the Lord said to Ananda Let Subhadda go forth
Very good Lord said Ananda
And Subhadda said to the Venerable Ananda Friend Ananda it is a great gain for you all it is very profitable for you that you have obtained the consecration of discipleship in the Teachers presence
Then Subhadda received the goingforth in the Lords presence and the ordination
And from the moment of his ordination the Venerable Subhadda alone secluded unwearying zealous and resolute in a short time attained to that for which young men of good family go forth from the household life into homelessness that unexcelled culmination of the holy life having realised it here and now by his own insight
and dwelt therein Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is nothing further here
And the Venerable Subhadda became another of the Arahants
He was the last personal disciple of the Lord
End of the fifth recitationsection 
Now at that time a wandering ascetic named Subhadda was dwelling at Kusinara
And Subhadda the wandering ascetic heard it said Today in the third watch of the night the Parinibbana of the ascetic Gotama will take place
And the thought arose in him I have heard it said by old and venerable wandering ascetics teachers of teachers that the arising of Tathagatas Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones is rare in the world
Yet this very day in the last watch of the night the Parinibbana of the ascetic Gotama will take place
Now there is in me a doubt but to this extent I have faith in the ascetic Gotama that he could so teach me the Dhamma as to remove that doubt
Then the wandering ascetic Subhadda went to the Sala Grove the recreation park of the Mallas and drew near to the Venerable Ananda and told the Venerable Ananda his thought
And he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Friend Ananda it would be good if I could be allowed into the presence of the ascetic Gotama
But the Venerable Ananda answered him saying Enough friend Subhadda Do not trouble the Tathagata The Blessed One is weary
Yet a second and a third time the wandering ascetic Subhadda made his request and a second
and a third time the Venerable Ananda refused him
And the Blessed One heard the talk between them
and he called the Venerable Ananda and said Stop Ananda Do not refuse Subhadda Subhadda Ananda may be allowed into the presence of the Tathagata
For whatever he will ask me he will ask for the sake of knowledge and not as an offence
And the answer I give him that he will readily understand
Thereupon the Venerable Ananda said to the wandering ascetic Subhadda Go then friend Subhadda the Blessed One gives you leave
Then the wandering ascetic Subhadda approached the Blessed One and saluted him courteously And having exchanged with him pleasant and civil greetings the wandering ascetic Subhadda seated himself at one side
and addressed the Blessed One saying There are Venerable Gotama ascetics and brahmans who are heads of great companies of disciples who have large retinues who are leaders of schools well known and renowned and held in high esteem by the multitude such teachers as Purana Kassapa Makkhali Gosala Ajita Kesakambali Pakudha Kaccayana Sañjaya Belatthaputta Nigantha Nataputta Have all of these attained realization as each of them would have it believed or has none of them or is it that some have attained realization and others not
Enough Subhadda Let it be as it may whether all of them have attained realization as each of them would have it believed or whether none of them has or whether some have attained realization and others not
I will teach you the Dhamma Subhadda listen and heed it well and I will speak
So be it Lord
And the Blessed One spoke saying
In whatsoever Dhamma and Discipline Subhadda there is not found the Noble Eightfold Path neither is there found a true ascetic of the first
second
third
or fourth degree of saintliness
But in whatsoever Dhamma and Discipline there is found the Noble Eightfold Path there is found a true ascetic of the first second third and fourth degrees of saintliness
Now in this Dhamma and Discipline Subhadda is found the Noble Eightfold Path and in it alone are also found true ascetics of the first second third and fourth degrees of saintliness Devoid of true ascetics are the systems of other teachers
But if Subhadda the bhikkhus live righteously the world will not be destitute of arahats
In age but twentynine was I Subhadda
When I renounced the world to seek the Good
Fiftyone years have passed since then Subhadda
And in all that time a wanderer have I been
In the domain of virtue and of truth
And except therein there is no saint 
And there is none of the second degree
nor of the third degree
nor of the fourth degree of saintliness
Devoid of true ascetics are the systems of other teachers
But if Subhadda the bhikkhus live righteously the world will not be destitute of arahats
When this was said the wandering ascetic Subhadda spoke to the Blessed One saying Excellent O Lord most excellent O Lord
It is as if Lord one were to set upright what had been overthrown or to reveal what had been hidden or to show the path to one who had gone astray or to light a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes might see  even so has the Blessed One set forth the Dhamma in many ways
And so O Lord I take my refuge in the Blessed One the Dhamma and the Community of Bhikkhus
May I receive from the Blessed One admission to the Order and also the higher ordination
Whoever Subhadda having been formerly a follower of another creed wishes to receive admission and higher ordination in this Dhamma and Discipline remains on probation for a period of four months
At the end of those four months if the bhikkhus are satisfied with him they grant him admission and higher ordination as a bhikkhu
Yet in this matter I recognize differences of personalities
If O Lord whoever having been formerly a follower of another creed wishes to receive admission and higher ordination in this Dhamma and Discipline remains on probation for a period of four months and at the end of those four months if the bhikkhus are satisfied with him they grant him admission and higher ordination as a bhikkhu 
then I will remain on probation for a period of four years And at the end of those four years if the bhikkhus are satisfied with me let them grant me admission and higher ordination as a bhikkhu
But the Blessed One called the Venerable Ananda and said to him Ananda let Subhadda be given admission into the Order
And the Venerable Ananda replied So be it Lord
Then the wandering ascetic Subhadda said to the Venerable Ananda It is a gain to you friend Ananda a blessing that in the presence of the Master himself you have received the sprinkling of ordination as a disciple
So it came about that the wandering ascetic Subhadda in the presence of the Blessed One received admission and higher ordination
And from the time of his ordination the Venerable Subhadda remained alone secluded heedful ardent and resolute And before long he attained to the goal for which a worthy man goes forth rightly from home to homelessness the supreme goal of the holy life and having by himself realized it with higher knowledge he dwelt therein
He knew Destroyed is birth the higher life is fulfilled nothing more is to be done and beyond this life nothing more remains
And the Venerable Subhadda became yet another among the arahats
and he was the last disciple converted by the Blessed One himself
Now on that occasion a wanderer named Subhadda was staying near Kusinārā
He heard Tonight in the last watch of the night the total unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will take place
 Then the thought occurred to him I have heard the old elder wanderers teachers of teachers saying that only once in a long long time do Tathāgatasworthy ones rightly selfawakenedappear in the world
Tonight in the last watch of the night the total unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will occur
Now there is a doubt that has arisen in me but I have confidence in Gotama the contemplative that he can teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might abandon that doubt 
So he went to Upavattana the Mallans Sal Forest and on arrival said to Ven nanda I have heard the old elder wanderers teachers of teachers saying that only once in a long long time do Tathāgatasworthy ones rightly selfawakenedappear in the world
Tonight in the last watch of the night the total unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will occur
Now there is a doubt that has arisen in me but I have confidence in Gotama the contemplative that he can teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might abandon that doubt
It would be good Ven nanda if you would let me see him 
When this was said Ven nanda said to him Enough friend Subhadda Dont bother the Blessed One The Blessed One is tired
For a second time For a third time Subhadda the wanderer said to Ven nanda 
It would be good Ven nanda if you would let me see him
For a third time Ven nanda said to him Enough friend Subhadda Dont bother the Blessed One The Blessed One is tired 
Now the Blessed One heard the exchange between Ven nanda  Subhadda the wanderer
and so he said to Ven nanda Enough nanda Dont stand in his way Let him see the Tathāgata
Whatever he asks me will all be for the sake of knowledge and not to be bothersome
And whatever I answer when asked he will quickly understand
So Ven nanda said to Subhadda the wanderer Go ahead friend Subhadda The Blessed One gives you his leave 
Then Subhadda went to the Blessed One and exchanged courteous greetings with him After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama these contemplatives  brahmans each with his group each with his community each the teacher of his group an honored leader wellregarded by people at largei e  Pūraṇa Kassapa Makkhali Gosāla Ajita Kesakambalin Pakudha Kaccāyana Sañjaya Velaṭṭhaputta  the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta Do they all have direct knowledge as they themselves claim or do they all not have direct knowledge or do some of them have direct knowledge and some of them not
Enough Subhadda Put this question aside Do they all have direct knowledge as they themselves claim or do they all not have direct knowledge or do some of them have direct knowledge and some of them not
 I will teach you the Dhamma Subhadda Listen and pay close attention I will speak 
As you say lord Subhadda responded to the Blessed One
The Blessed One said
In any doctrine  discipline where the noble eightfold path is not ascertained no contemplative of the first
second
third
fourth order streamwinner oncereturner nonreturner or arahant is ascertained
But in any doctrine  discipline where the noble eightfold path is ascertained contemplatives of the first second third fourth order are ascertained
The noble eightfold path is ascertained in this doctrine  discipline and right here there are contemplatives of the first second third fourth order Other teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplatives
And if the monks dwell rightly this world will not be empty of arahants
At age twentynine Subhadda
I went forth seeking what might be skillful
and more than fifty years have passed
since my going forth Subhadda
of the realm of methodical Dhamma
Outside there is no contemplative
There is no contemplative of the second order
there is no contemplative of the third order
there is no contemplative of the fourth order
Other teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplatives
And if the monks dwell rightly this world will not be empty of arahants
Then Subhadda the wanderer said Magnificent lord Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to set out a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed Onethrough many lines of reasoningmade the Dhamma clear
I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of monks
Let me obtain the going forth in the Blessed Ones presence let me obtain the acceptance
Anyone Subhadda who has previously belonged to another sect and who desires the going forth  acceptance into this Dhamma  Vinaya must first undergo probation for four months
If at the end of four months the monks feel so moved they give him the going forth  accept him into the monks state
But I know distinctions among individuals in this matter 
Lord if that is so
I am willing to undergo probation for four years If at the end of four years the monks feel so moved let them give me the going forth  accept me into the monks state
Then the Blessed One said to Ven nanda Very well then nanda give Subhadda the going forth
As you say lord Ven nanda responded to the Blessed One
Then Subhadda said to Ven nanda Its a gain for you nanda a great gain that you have been anointed here facetoface with the Teacher with the pupils anointing 
Then Subhadda the wanderer obtained the going forth in the Blessed Ones presence he obtained acceptance
And not long after his acceptancedwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolutehe in no long time entered  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness directly knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now
He knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for the sake of this world
And thus Ven Subhadda became another one of the arahants
the last of the Blessed Ones directwitness disciples
 And the Lord said to Ananda Ananda it may be that you will think The Teachers instruction has ceased now we have no teacher
It should not be seen like this
Ananda for what I have taught and explained to you as Dhamma and discipline will at my passing be your teacher
And whereas the monks are in the habit of addressing one another as friend this custom is to be abrogated after my passing
Senior monks shall address more junior monks by their name their clan or as friend
whereas more junior monks are to address their seniors either as Lord or as Venerable Sir
If they wish the order may abolish the minor rules after my passing 
After my passing the monk Channa is to receive the Brahmapenalty
But Lord what is the Brahmapenalty
 Whatever the monk Channa wants or says
he is not to be spoken to admonished or instructed by the monks
Then the Lord addressed the monks saying It may be monks that some monk has doubts or uncertainty about the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha or about the path or the practice Ask monks Do not afterwards feel remorse thinking The Teacher was there before us and we failed to ask the Lord face to face
At these words the monks were silent
The Lord repeated his words a second and a third time and still the monks were silent
Then the Lord said Perhaps monks you do not ask out of respect for the Teacher
Then monks let one friend tell it to another
But still they were silent
And the Venerable Ananda said It is wonderful Lord it is marvellous I clearly perceive that in this assembly there is not one monk who has doubts or uncertainty
You Ananda speak from faith But the Tathagata knows
that in this assembly there is not one monk who has doubts or uncertainty about the Buddha the Dhamma or the Sangha or about the path or the practice
Ananda the least one of these five hundred monks is a StreamWinner incapable of falling into states of woe certain of Nibbana
Then the Lord said to the monks Now monks I declare to you all conditioned things are of a nature to decay  strive on untiringly
These were the Tathagatas last words
Now the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying It may be Ananda that to some among you the thought will come Ended is the word of the Master we have a Master no longer
But it should not Ananda be so considered
For that which I have proclaimed and made known as the Dhamma and the Discipline that shall be your Master when I am gone
And Ananda whereas now the bhikkhus address one another as friend let it not be so when I am gone
The senior bhikkhus Ananda may address the junior ones by their name their family name or as friend
but the junior bhikkhus should address the senior ones as venerable sir or your reverence
If it is desired Ananda the Sangha may when I am gone abolish the lesser and minor rules
Ananda when I am gone let the higher penalty be imposed upon the bhikkhu Channa
But what Lord is the higher penalty 
The bhikkhu Channa Ananda may say what he will
but the bhikkhus should neither converse with him nor exhort him nor admonish him
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying It may be bhikkhus that one of you is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha the Dhamma or the Sangha the path or the practice Then question bhikkhus Do not be given to remorse later on with the thought The Master was with us face to face yet face to face we failed to ask him
But when this was said the bhikkhus were silent
And yet a second and a third time the Blessed One said to them It may be bhikkhus that one of you is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha the Dhamma or the Sangha the path or the practice Then question bhikkhus Do not be given to remorse later on with the thought The Master was with us face to face yet face to face we failed to ask him
And for a second and a third time the bhikkhus were silent
Then the Blessed One said to them It may be bhikkhus out of respect for the Master that you ask no questions
Then bhikkhus let friend communicate it to friend
Yet still the bhikkhus were silent
And the Venerable Ananda spoke to the Blessed One saying Marvellous it is O Lord most wonderful it is This faith I have in the community of bhikkhus that not even one bhikkhu is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha the Dhamma or the Sangha the path or the practice
Out of faith Ananda you speak thus But here Ananda the Tathagata knows for certain
that among this community of bhikkhus there is not even one bhikkhu who is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha the Dhamma or the Sangha the path or the practice
For Ananda among these five hundred bhikkhus even the lowest is a streamenterer secure from downfall assured and bound for enlightenment
And the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Behold now bhikkhus I exhort you All compounded things are subject to vanish Strive with earnestness
This was the last word of the Tathagata
Then the Blessed One said to Ven nanda Now if the thought occurs to any of youThe teaching has lost its arbitrator we are without a Teacher
do not view it in that way
Whatever Dhamma  Vinaya I have pointed out  formulated for you that will be your Teacher after my passing
At present the monks address one another as friend but after my passing they are not to address one another that way
The more senior monks are to address the newer monks by their name or clan or as friend
 The newer monks are to address the more senior monks as venerable or sir 
After my passing the Saṅghaif it wantsmay rescind the lesser  minor training rules 
After my passing the monk Channa should be given the brahmapenalty 
What lord is the brahmapenalty
Channa may say what he wants nanda
but he is not to be spoken to instructed or admonished by the monks 
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks If even a single monk has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha Dhamma or Saṅgha the path or the practice ask Dont later regret that The Teacher was facetoface with us but we didnt bring ourselves to ask a counterquestion in his presence 
When this was said the monks were silent
A second time  A third time the Blessed One said If even one of the monks has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha Dhamma or Saṅgha the path or the practice ask Dont later regret that The Teacher was facetoface with us but we didnt bring ourselves to ask a counterquestion in his presence 
A third time the monks were silent
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks Now if its simply out of respect for the Teacher that you dont ask
let a companion inform a companion 
When this was said the monks were silent
Then Ven nanda said to the Blessed One Its amazing lord Its astounding I have confidence in this Saṅgha of monks that there is not even a single monk in this Saṅgha of monks who has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha Dhamma or Saṅgha the path or the practice 
You nanda speak out of confidence while there is knowledge in the Tathāgata
that there is not even a single monk in this Saṅgha of monks who has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha Dhamma or Saṅgha the path or the practice
Of these  monks the most backward is a streamwinner never again destined for the lower realms certain headed for selfawakening
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks Now then monks I exhort you All fabrications are subject to ending  decay Reach consummation through heedfulness
That was the Tathāgatas last statement
Then the Lord entered the first jhana And leaving that he entered the second the third the fourth jhana
Then leaving the fourth jhana he entered the Sphere of Infinite Space then the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness then the Sphere of No Thingness then the Sphere of NeitherPerceptionNorNon Perception and leaving that he attained the Cessation of Feeling and Perception 
Then the Venerable Ananda said to the Venerable Anu ruddha Venerable Anuruddha the Lord has passed away
No friend Ananda the Lord has not passed away he has attained the Cessation of Feeling and Perception
Then the Lord leaving the attainment of the Cessation of Feeling and Perception entered the Sphere of NeitherPer ceptionNorNonPerception from that he entered the Sphere of NoThingness the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness the Sphere of Infinite Space From the Sphere of Infinite Space he entered the fourth jhana from there the third the second and the first jhana Leaving the first jhana he entered the second the third the fourth jhana And leaving the fourth jhana the Lord finally passed away
And at the Blessed Lords final passing there was a great earthquake terrible and hairraising
accompanied by thunder
And Brahma Sahampati uttered this verse
All beings in the world all bodies must break up
Even the Teacher peerless in the human world
The mighty Lord and perfect Buddhas passed away
And Sakka ruler of the devas uttered this verse
Impermanent are compounded things prone to rise and fall
Having risen theyre destroyed their passing truest bliss 
And the Venerable Anuruddha uttered this verse
No breathing in and out  just with steadfast heart
The Sage whos free from lust has passed away to peace
With mind unshaken he endured all pains
By Nibbana the Illumineds mind is freed
And the Venerable Ananda uttered this verse
Terrible was the quaking mens hair stood on end
When the allaccomplished Buddha passed away
And those monks who had not yet overcome their passions wept and tore their hair raising their arms throwing themselves down and twisting and turning crying All too soon the Blessed Lord has passed away all too soon the Well Farer has passed away all too soon the Eye of the World has disappeared
But those monks who were free from craving endured mindfully and clearly aware saying All compounded things are impermanent  what is the use of this
Then the Venerable Anuruddha said Friends enough of your weeping and wailing
Has not the Lord already told you that all things that are pleasant and delightful are changeable subject to separation and to becoming other
So why all this friends
Whatever is bom become compounded is subject to decay it cannot be that it does not decay
The devas friends are grumbling
Venerable Anuruddha what kind of devas are you aware of
 Friend Ananda there are skydevas whose minds are earthbound they are weeping and tearing their hair  
And there are earthdevas whose minds are earthbound they do likewise
But those devas who are free from craving endure patiently saying All compounded things are impermanent What is the use of this 
Then the Venerable Anuruddha and the Venerable Ananda spent the rest of the night in conversation on Dhamma
And the Venerable Anuruddha said Now go friend Ananda to Kusinara and announce to the Mallas Vasetthas the Lord has passed away Now is the time to do as you think fit
Yes Lord said Ananda and having dressed in the morning and taken his robe and bowl he went with a companion to Kusinara
At that time the Mallas of Kusinara were assembled in their meetinghall on some business
And the Venerable Ananda came to them and delivered the Venerable Anuruddhas message
And when they heard the Venerable Anandas words the Mallas  were struck with anguish and sorrow their minds were overcome with grief so that they were all tearing their hair
And the Blessed One entered the first jhana Rising from the first jhana he entered the second jhana Rising from the second jhana he entered the third jhana Rising from the third jhana he entered the fourth jhana
And rising out of the fourth jhana he entered the sphere of infinite space Rising from the attainment of the sphere of infinite space he entered the sphere of infinite consciousness Rising from the attainment of the sphere of infinite consciousness he entered the sphere of nothingness Rising from the attainment of the sphere of nothingness he entered the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception And rising out of the attainment of the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception he attained to the cessation of perception and feeling
And the Venerable Ananda spoke to the Venerable Anuruddha saying Venerable Anuruddha the Blessed One has passed away
No friend Ananda the Blessed One has not passed away He has entered the state of the cessation of perception and feeling
Then the Blessed One rising from the cessation of perception and feeling entered the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception Rising from the attainment of the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception he entered the sphere of nothingness Rising from the attainment of the sphere of nothingness he entered the sphere of infinite consciousness Rising from the attainment of the sphere of infinite consciousness he entered the sphere of infinite space Rising from the attainment of the sphere of infinite space he entered the fourth jhana Rising from the fourth jhana he entered the third jhana Rising from the third jhana he entered the second jhana Rising from the second jhana he entered the first jhana Rising from the first jhana he entered the second jhana Rising from the second jhana he entered the third jhana Rising from the third jhana he entered the fourth jhana And rising from the fourth jhana the Blessed One immediately passed away
And when the Blessed One had passed away simultaneously with his Parinibbana there came a tremendous earthquake dreadful and astounding
and the thunders rolled across the heavens
And when the Blessed One had passed away simultaneously with his Parinibbana Brahma Sahampati spoke this stanza
All must depart  all beings that have life Must shed their compound forms Yea even one
A Master such as he a peerless being
Powerful in wisdom the Enlightened One has passed away
And when the Blessed One had passed away simultaneously with his Parinibbana Sakka king of the gods spoke this stanza
Transient are all compounded things Subject to arise and vanish
Having come into existence they pass away Good is the peace when they forever cease
And when the Blessed One had passed away simultaneously with his Parinibbana the Venerable Anuruddha spoke this stanza
No movement of the breath but with steadfast heart
Free from desires and tranquil  so the sage Comes to his end
By mortal pangs unshaken
His mind like a flame extinguished finds release
And when the Blessed One had passed away simultaneously with his Parinibbana the Venerable Ananda spoke this stanza
Then there was terror and the hair stood up when he
The Allaccomplished One the Buddha passed away
Then when the Blessed One had passed away some bhikkhus not yet freed from passion lifted up their arms and wept and some flinging themselves on the ground rolled from side to side and wept lamenting Too soon has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana Too soon has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana Too soon has the Eye of the World vanished from sight
But the bhikkhus who were freed from passion mindful and clearly comprehending reflected in this way Impermanent are all compounded things How could this be otherwise
And the Venerable Anuruddha addressed the bhikkhus saying Enough friends Do not grieve do not lament
For has not the Blessed One declared that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change separation and severance
Of that which is born come into being compounded and subject to decay how can one say May it not come to dissolution
The deities friends are aggrieved
But venerable sir of what deities is the Venerable Anuruddha aware 
There are deities friend Ananda in space who are earthlyminded with dishevelled hair they weep with uplifted arms they weep flinging themselves on the ground they roll from side to side lamenting Too soon has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana Too soon has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana Too soon has the Eye of the World vanished from sight
and on the earth
But those deities who are freed from passion mindful and clearly comprehending reflect in this way Impermanent are all compounded things How could this be otherwise
Now the Venerable Anuruddha and the Venerable Ananda spent the rest of the night in talking on the Dhamma
Then the Venerable Anuruddha spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Go now friend Ananda to Kusinara and announce to the Mallas The Blessed One Vasetthas has passed away Do now as seems fitting to you
So be it venerable sir And the Venerable Ananda prepared himself in the forenoon and taking bowl and robe went with a companion into Kusinara
At that time the Mallas of Kusinara had gathered in the council hall to consider that very matter
And the Venerable Ananda approached them and announced The Blessed One Vasetthas has passed away Do now as seems fitting to you
And when they heard the Venerable Ananda speak these words the Mallas with their sons their wives and the wives of their sons were sorely grieved grieved at heart and afflicted and some with their hair all dishevelled with arms upraised in despair wept flinging themselves on the ground they rolled from side to side lamenting Too soon has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana Too soon has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana Too soon has the Eye of the World vanished from sight
Then the Blessed One entered the first jhāna Emerging from that he entered the second jhāna Emerging from that he entered the third the fourth jhāna
the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception Emerging from that he entered the cessation of perception  feeling
Then Ven nanda said to Ven Anuruddha Ven Anuruddha the Blessed One is totally unbound 
No friend nanda The Blessed One isnt totally unbound He has entered the cessation of perception  feeling 
Then the Blessed One emerging from the cessation of perception  feeling entered the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception Emerging from that he entered the dimension of nothingness the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of the infinitude of space the fourth jhāna the third the second the first jhāna Emerging from the first jhāna he entered the second the third the fourth jhāna Emerging from the fourth jhāna he immediately totally unbound
When the Blessed One totally unbound simultaneously with the total unbinding there was a great earthquake awesome  hairraising
and rolls of the devadrums split 
When the Blessed One totally unbound simultaneously with the total unbinding Sahampati Brahmā uttered this verse
All beingsallin the world will cast off the bodily heap
in the world where a Teacher like this without peer in the world
the Tathāgata with strength attained the Rightly SelfAwakened One has totally unbound
When the Blessed One totally unbound simultaneously with the total unbinding Sakka the devaking uttered this verse
How inconstant are fabrications Their nature to arise  pass away
They disband as they are arising Their total stilling is bliss
When the Blessed One totally unbound simultaneously with the total unbinding Ven Anuruddha uttered this verse
He had no inout breathing the firmminded one the one who was Such
imperturbable  intent on peace the sage completing his span
With heart unbowed he endured the pain
Like a flames unbinding was the liberation of awareness
When the Blessed One totally unbound simultaneously with the total unbinding Ven nanda uttered this verse
It was aweinspiring It was hairraising
when displaying the foremost accomplishment in all things the Rightly SelfAwakened One totally unbound
When the Blessed One totally unbound simultaneously with the total unbinding some of the monks present who were not without passion wept uplifting their arms As if their feet were cut out from under them they fell down and rolled back  forth crying All too soon has the Blessed One totally unbound All too soon has the One WellGone totally unbound All too soon has the One with Eyes disappeared from the world
But those monks who were free from passion acquiesced mindful  alert Inconstant are fabrications What else is there to expect
Then Ven Anuruddha addressed the monks Enough friends Dont grieve Dont lament
Hasnt the Blessed One already taught the state of growing different with regard to all things dear  appealing the state of becoming separate the state of becoming otherwise
What else is there to expect
Its impossible that one could forbid anything born existent fabricated  subject to disintegration from disintegrating
The devatās friends are complaining 
Ven nanda But Ven Anuruddha what is the state of the devatās you are paying attention to 
Friend nanda there are devatās who perceive space to be earth Tearing at their hair they are weeping Uplifting their arms they are weeping As if their feet were cut out from under them they fall down and roll back  forth crying All too soon has the Blessed One totally unbound All too soon has the One WellGone totally unbound All too soon has the One with Eyes disappeared from the world
Then there are devatās who perceive earth to be earth Tearing at their hair they are weeping Uplifting their arms they are weeping As if their feet were cut out from under them they fall down and roll back  forth crying All too soon has the Blessed One totally unbound All too soon has the One WellGone totally unbound All too soon has the One with Eyes disappeared from the world
But those devatās who are free from passion acquiesce mindful  alert Inconstant are fabrications What else is there to expect
Then Ven Anuruddha  Ven nanda spent the remainder of the night in Dhamma talk
Then Ven Anuruddha said to Ven nanda Go friend nanda Entering Kusinārā announce to the Kusinārā Mallans The Blessed One Vāsiṭṭhas has totally unbound Now is the time for you to do as you see fit 
Responding As you say sir to Ven Anuruddha Ven nanda in the early morning adjusted his lower robe andtaking his bowl  outer robewent unaccompanied into Kusinārā
Now at that time the Kusinārā Mallans had met for some business in their reception hall
Ven nanda went to the reception hall and on arrival announced to them The Blessed One Vāsiṭṭhas has totally unbound Now is the time for you to do as you see fit 
When they heard Ven nanda the Mallans together with their sons daughters  wives were shocked saddened their minds overflowing with sorrow Some of them wept tearing at their hair they wept uplifting their arms As if their feet were cut out from under them they fell down and rolled back  forth crying All too soon has the Blessed One totally unbound All too soon has the One WellGone totally unbound All too soon has the One with Eyes disappeared from the world
Then the Mallas ordered their men to bring perfume and wreaths and gather all the musicians together
And with the perfumes and wreaths and all the musicians and with five hundred sets of garments they went to the salgrove where the Lords body was lying And there they honoured paid respects worshipped and adored the Lords body with dance and song and music with garlands and scents making awnings and circular tents in order to spend the day there
And they thought It is too late to cremate the Lords body today We shall do so tomorrow
And so paying homage in the same way they waited for a second a third a fourth a fifth a sixth day
And on the seventh day the Mallas of Kusinara thought We have paid sufficient honour with song and dance to the Lords body now we shall burn his body after carrying him out by the south gate
Then eight Malla chiefs having washed their heads and put on new clothes declared Now we will lift up the Lords body but found they were unable to do so
So they went to the Venerable Anuruddha and told him what had happened Why cant we lift up the Lords body
 Vasetthas your intention is one thing but the intention of the devas is another
Lord what is the intention of the devas
 Vasetthas your intention is having paid homage to the Lords body with dance and song to bum his body after carrying him out by the south gate But the devas intention is having paid homage to the Lords body with heavenly dance and song to carry him to the north of the city bring him in through the north gate and bear him through the middle of the city and out through the eastern gate to the Mallas shrine of Makuta Bandhana and there to bum the body
Lord if that is the devas intention so be it
At that time even the sewers and rubbishheaps of Kusinara were covered kneehigh with coraltree flowers
And the devas as well as the Mallas of Kusinara honoured the Lords body with divine and human dancing song and they carried the body to the north of the city brought it in through the north gate through the middle of the city and out through the eastern gate to the Mallas shrine of Makuta Bandhana where they set the body down
Then they asked the Venerable Ananda Lord how should we deal with the body of the Tathagata
 Vasetthas you should deal with the Tathagatas body as you would that of a wheelturning monarch
And how do they deal with that Lord
Vasetthas the remains are wrapped in a new linencloth This they wrap in teased cottonwool
then having made a funeralpyre of all manner of perfumes they cremate the kings body
and they raise a stupa at a cross roads
Then the Mallas ordered their men to bring their teased cottonwool
And they dealt with the Tathagatas body accordingly
Then the Mallas of Kusinara gave orders to their men saying Gather now all the perfumes flowergarlands and musicians even all that are in Kusinara
And the Mallas with the perfumes the flowergarlands and the musicians and with five hundred sets of clothing went to the Sala Grove the recreation park of the Mallas and approached the body of the Blessed One And having approached they paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and erecting canopies and pavilions they spent the day showing respect honor and veneration to the body of the Blessed One
And then the thought came to them Now the day is too far spent for us to cremate the body of the Blessed One Tomorrow we will do it
And for the second day and a third fourth fifth and sixth day they paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and erecting canopies and pavilions they spent the day showing respect honor and veneration to the body of the Blessed One
But on the seventh day the thought came to them We have paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and have shown respect honor and veneration let us now carry the body of the Blessed One southward to the southern part of the town and beyond and let us there cremate the body of the Blessed One south of the town
And eight Mallas of the foremost families bathed from the crown of their heads and wearing new clothes with the thought We will lift up the body of the Blessed One tried to do so but they could not
Then the Mallas spoke to the Venerable Anuruddha saying What is the cause Venerable Anuruddha what is the reason that these eight Mallas of the foremost families bathed from the crown of their heads and wearing new clothes with the thought We will lift up the body of the Blessed One try to do so but cannot 
You Vasetthas have one purpose the deities have another
Then what venerable sir is the purpose of the deities 
Your purpose Vasetthas is this We have paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and have shown respect honor and veneration let us now carry the body of the Blessed One southward to the southern part of the town and beyond and let us there cremate the body of the Blessed One south of the town But the purpose of the deities Vasetthas is this We have paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with heavenly dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and have shown respect honor and veneration let us now carry the body of the Blessed One northward to the northern part of the town and having carried it through the northern gate let us go through the center of the town and then eastward to the east of the town and having passed through the east gate let us carry it to the cetiya of the Mallas Makutabandhana and there let us cremate the body of the Blessed One
As the deities wish venerable sir so let it be
Thereupon the whole of Kusinara even to the dust heaps and rubbish heaps became covered kneedeep in mandarava flowers
And homage was paid to the body of the Blessed One by the deities as well as the Mallas of Kusinara With dance song music flowergarlands and perfume both divine and human respect honor and veneration were shown And they carried the body of the Blessed One northward to the northern part of the town and having carried it through the northern gate they went through the center of the town and then eastward to the east of the town and having passed through the east gate they carried the body of the Blessed One to the cetiya of the Mallas Makutabandhana and there laid it down
Then the Mallas of Kusinara spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying How should we act Venerable Ananda respecting the body of the Tathagata 
After the same manner Vasetthas as towards the body of a universal monarch
But how venerable Ananda do they act respecting the body of a universal monarch 
The body of a universal monarch Vasetthas is first wrapped round with new linen and then with teased cotton wool And again it is wrapped round with new linen and again with teased cotton wool and so it is done up to five hundred layers of linen and five hundred of cotton wool
When that is done the body of the universal monarch is placed in an iron oilvessel which is enclosed in another iron vessel and a funeral pyre is built of all kinds of perfumed woods and so the body of the universal monarch is burned
And at a crossroads a stupa is raised for the universal monarch
So it is done Vasetthas with the body of a universal monarch
And even Vasetthas as with the body of a universal monarch so should it be done with the body of the Tathagata
and at a crossroads also a stupa should be raised for the Tathagata
And whoever shall bring to that place garlands or incense or sandalwood paste or pay reverence and whose mind becomes calm there  it will be to his well being and happiness for a long time
Then the Mallas gave orders to their men saying Gather now all the teased cotton wool of the Mallas
And the Mallas of Kusinara wrapped the body of the Blessed One round with new linen and then with teased cotton wool
And again they wrapped it round with new linen and again with teased cotton wool and so it was done up to five hundred layers of linen and five hundred of cotton wool When that was done they placed the body of the Blessed One in an iron oilvessel which was enclosed in another iron vessel and they built a funeral pyre of all kinds of perfumed woods and upon it they laid the body of the Blessed One
Then the Kusinārā Mallans ordered their men In that case I say gather scents garlands  all the musical instruments in Kusinārā
Then taking scents garlands  all the musical instruments in Kusinārā along with  pairs of cloth the Kusinārā Mallans went to the Blessed Ones body in Upavattana the Mallans Sal Forest near Kusinārā On arrival they spent the entire day in worshipping honoring respecting  venerating the Blessed Ones body with dances songs music garlands  scents in making cloth canopies and arranging floral wreaths
Then the thought occurred to them Its too late today to cremate the Blessed Ones body Well cremate the Blessed Ones body tomorrow
 And so they spent the second day the third day the fourth day the fifth day the sixth day in worshipping honoring respecting  venerating the Blessed Ones body with dances songs music garlands  scents in making cloth canopies and arranging floral wreaths
Then on the seventh day the thought occurred to them Worshipping honoring respecting  venerating to the Blessed Ones body with dances songs music garlands  scents lets carry it to the south around the outside of the town and cremate it to the south of the town 
Then eight leading Mallans having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth thinking Well lift up the Blessed Ones body were unable to lift it
So the Kusinārā Mallans asked Ven Anuruddha What is the reason Ven Anuruddha what is the cause why these eight leading Mallans having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth thinking Well lift up the Blessed Ones body are unable to lift it 
Your intention Vāsiṭṭhas is one thing The devas intention is another
But what Ven Anuruddha is the devas intention 
Your intention Vāsiṭṭhas is Worshipping honoring respecting  venerating the Blessed Ones body with dances songs music garlands  scents lets carry it to the south around the outside of the town and cremate it to the south of the town  The devas intention is Worshipping honoring respecting  venerating the Blessed Ones body with heavenly dances songs music garlands  scents lets carry it to the north of the town enter the town through the north gate carry it through the middle of the town and out the east gate to the Mallans shrine called Makuṭabandhana to cremate it there
Then let it be venerable sir in line with the devas intention 
Now on that occasion Kusinārāeven to its rubbish heaps  cesspoolswas strewn kneedeep in coraltree flowers
So the devas  the Kusinārā Mallans worshipping honoring respecting  venerating the Blessed Ones body with heavenly  human dances songs music garlands  scents carried it to the north of the town entered the town through the north gate carried it through the middle of the town and out the east gate to the Mallans shrine called Makuṭabandhana There they set it down
Then the Kusinārā Mallans said to Ven nanda Venerable sir what course should we follow with regard to the Tathāgatas body 
The course they follow with regard to a wheelturning monarchs body Vāsiṭṭhas is the course that should be followed with regard to the Tathāgatas body 
And what venerable sir is the course they follow with regard to a wheelturning monarchs body 
Vāsiṭṭhas they wrap the wheelturning monarchs body in new linen cloth Having wrapped it in new linen cloth they wrap it in teased cottonwool Having wrapped it in teased cottonwool they wrap it in new linen cloth
Having done this five hundred times they place the body in an iron oilvat cover it with an iron lid make a pyre composed totally of perfumed substances and cremate the body
Then they build a burial mound for the wheelturning monarch at a great fourway intersection
That is the course that they follow with regard to the wheelturning monarchs body
The course they follow with regard to a Vāsiṭṭhas is the course that should be followed with regard to the Tathāgatas body
A burial mound for the Tathāgata is to be built at a great fourway intersection
And those who offer a garland a scent or a perfume powder there or bow down there or brighten their minds there that will be for their longterm welfare  happiness 
So the Kusinārā Mallans ordered their men In that case I say gather the Mallans teased cottonwool 
Then they wrapped the Blessed Ones body in new linen cloth Having wrapped it in new linen cloth they wrapped it in teased cottonwool Having wrapped it in teased cottonwool they wrapped it in new linen cloth
Having done this five hundred times they placed the body in an iron oilvat covered it with an iron lid made a pyre composed totally of perfumed substances and set the body on the pyre
Now just then the Venerable Kassapa the Great was travelling along the main road from Pava to Kusinara with a large company of about five hundred monks
And leaving the road the Venerable Kassapa the Great sat down under a tree
And a certain Ajivika chanced to be coming along the main road towards Pava and he had picked a coraltree flower in Kusinara
The Venerable Kassapa saw him coming from afar and said to him Friend do you know our Teacher
 Yes friend I do The ascetic Gotama passed away a week ago
I picked this coraltree flower there
And those monks who had not yet overcome their passions wept and tore their hair 
But those monks who were free from craving endured mindfully and clearly aware saying All compounded things are impermanent  what is the use of this
And sitting in the group was one Subhadda who had gone forth late in life and he said to those monks
Enough friends do not weep and wail We are well rid of the Great Ascetic
We were always bothered by his saying It is fitting for you to do this it is not fitting for you to do that
Now we can do what we like and not do what we dont like
But the Venerable Kassapa the Great said to the monks Friends enough of your weeping and wailing
Has not the Lord already told you that all things that are pleasant and delightful are changeable subject to separation and becoming other
So why all this friends
Whatever is bom become compounded is subject to decay it cannot be that it does not decay
Meanwhile four Malla chiefs having washed their heads and put on new clothes said We will light the Lords funeral pyre but they were unable to do so
They went to the Venerable Anuruddha and asked him why this was
Vasetthas your intention is one thing but that of the devas is another
Well Lord what is the intention of the devas
 Vasetthas the devas intention is this The Venerable Kassapa the Great is coming along the main road from Pava to Kusinara with a large company of five hundred monks
The Lords funeral pyre will not be lit until the Venerable Kassapa the Great has paid homage with his head to the Lords feet
Lord if that is the devas intention so be it
Then the Venerable Kassapa the Great went to the Mallas shrine at MakutaBandhana to the Lords funeral pyre and covering one shoulder with his robe joined his hands in salutation circumambulated the pyre three times and uncovering the Lords feet paid homage with his head to them
and the five hundred monks did likewise
And when this was done the Lords funeral pyre ignited of itself
And when the Lords body was burnt what had been skin underskin flesh sinew or jointfluid all that vanished and not even ashes or dust remained only the bones remained
Just as when butter or oil is burnt no ashes or dust remain so it was with the Lords body only the bones were left
And all the five hundred garments even the innermost and the outermost cloth were burnt up
And when the Lords body was burnt up a shower of water from the sky
and another which burst forth from the saltrees extinguished the funeral pyre
And the Mallas of Kusinara poured perfumed water over it for the same purpose
Then the Mallas honoured the relics for a week in their assembly hall having made a latticework of spears and an encircling wall of bows with dancing singing garlands and music
Now at that time the Venerable Maha Kassapa was journeying from Pava to Kusinara together with a large company of five hundred bhikkhus
And on the way the Venerable Maha Kassapa went aside from the highway and sat down at the foot of a tree
And a certain Ajivaka came by on his way to Pava and he had taken a mandarava flower from Kusinara
And the Venerable Maha Kassapa saw the Ajivaka coming from a distance and as he drew close he spoke to him saying Do you know friend anything of our Master 
Yes friend I know It is now seven days since the ascetic Gotama passed away
From there I have brought this mandarava flower
Thereupon some bhikkhus not yet freed from passion lifted up their arms and wept and some flinging themselves on the ground rolled from side to side and wept lamenting Too soon has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana Too soon has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana Too soon has the Eye of the World vanished from sight
Now at that time one Subhadda who had renounced only in his old age was seated in the assembly
And he addressed the bhikkhus saying Enough friends Do not grieve do not lament We are well rid of that great ascetic
Too long friends have we been oppressed by his saying This is fitting for you that is not fitting for you
Now we shall be able to do as we wish and what we do not wish that we shall not do
But the Venerable Maha Kassapa addressed the bhikkhus saying Enough friends Do not grieve do not lament
For has not the Blessed One declared that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change separation and severance
how can one say
Of that which is born come into being compounded and subject to decay  May it not come to dissolution
Now at that time four Mallas of the foremost families bathed from the crown of their heads and wearing new clothes with the thought We will set alight the Blessed Ones pyre tried to do so but they could not
And the Mallas spoke to the Venerable Anuruddha saying What is the cause Venerable Anuruddha what is the reason that these four Mallas of the foremost families bathed from the crown of their heads and wearing new clothes with the thought We will set alight the Blessed Ones pyre try to do so but cannot 
You Vasetthas have one purpose the deities have another
Then what venerable sir is the purpose of the deities 
The purpose of the deities Vasetthas is this The Venerable Maha Kassapa is on his way from Pava to Kusinara together with a large company of five hundred bhikkhus
Let not the Blessed Ones pyre be set alight until the Venerable Maha Kassapa has paid homage at the feet of the Blessed One
As the deities wish venerable sir so let it be
And the Venerable Maha Kassapa approached the pyre of the Blessed One at the cetiya of the Mallas Makutabandhana in Kusinara And he arranged his upper robe on one shoulder and with his clasped hands raised in salutation he walked three times round the pyre keeping his right side towards the Blessed Ones body and he paid homage at the feet of the Blessed One
And even so did the five hundred bhikkhus
And when homage had been paid by the Venerable Maha Kassapa and the five hundred bhikkhus the pyre of the Blessed One burst into flame by itself
And it came about that when the body of the Blessed One had been burned no ashes or particles were to be seen of what had been skin tissue flesh sinews and fluid only bones remained
Just as when ghee or oil is burned it leaves no particles or ashes behind even so when the body of the Blessed One had been burned no ashes or particles were to be seen of what had been skin tissue flesh sinews and fluid only bones remained
And of the five hundred linen wrappings only two were not consumed the innermost and the outermost
And when the body of the Blessed One had been burned water rained down from heaven and extinguished the pyre of the Blessed One
and from the sala trees water came forth
and the Mallas of Kusinara brought water scented with many kinds of perfumes and they too extinguished the pyre of the Blessed One
And the Mallas of Kusinara laid the relics of the Blessed One in their council hall and surrounded them with a latticework of spears and encircled them with a fence of bows and there for seven days they paid homage to the relics of the Blessed One with dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and showed respect honor and veneration to the relics of the Blessed One
Now on that occasion Ven Mahā Kassapa was traveling on the highway from Pāvā to Kusinārā with a large Saṅgha of monks approximately  monks in all
Leaving the road he sat down at the root of a tree
Meanwhile a certain jīvakan ascetic carrying a coraltree flower from Kusinārā was traveling on the highway to Pāvā
Ven Mahā Kassapa saw the jīvakan ascetic coming from afar and on seeing him said to him Do you know our teacher friend
Yes friend I know him Seven days ago Gotama the contemplative totally unbound
Thats how I got this coraltree flower
With that some of the monks present who were not without passion wept uplifting their arms As if their feet were cut out from under them they fell down and rolled back  forth crying All too soon has the Blessed One totally unbound All too soon has the One WellGone totally unbound All too soon has the One with Eyes disappeared from the world
But those monks who were free from passion acquiesced mindful  alert Inconstant are fabrications What else is there to expect 
Now at that time a monk named Subhadda who had gone forth when old was sitting among the group
He said to the monks Enough friends Dont grieve Dont lament Were well rid of the Great Contemplative
Weve been harassed by This is allowable This is not allowable
 But now we will do what we want to do and not do what we dont want to do 
Then Ven Mahā Kassapa addressed the monks Enough friends Dont grieve Dont lament
Hasnt the Blessed One already taught the state of growing different with regard to all things dear  appealing the state of becoming separate the state of becoming otherwise
What else is there to expect
Its impossible that one could forbid anything born existent fabricated  subject to disintegration from disintegrating 
Then four leading Mallans having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth thinking Well ignite the Blessed Ones pyre were unable to ignite it
So the Kusinārā Mallans asked Ven Anuruddha What is the reason Ven Anuruddha what is the cause why these four leading Mallans having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth thinking Well ignite the Blessed Ones pyre are unable to ignite it 
Your intention Vāsiṭṭhas is one thing The devas intention is another 
But what Ven Anuruddha is the devas intention 
The devas intention Vāsiṭṭhas is This Ven Mahā Kassapa is traveling on the highway from Pāvā to Kusinārā with a large Saṅgha of monks approximately  monks in all
The Blessed Ones pyre will not catch fire until Ven Mahā Kassapa has worshipped the Blessed Ones feet with his bathed head
Then let it be venerable sir in line with the devas intention 
So Ven Mahā Kassapa went to the Blessed Ones pyre at Makuṭabandhana the Mallans memorial near Kusinārā On arrival arranging his robe over one shoulder he placed his hands palmtopalm over his heart circumambulated the pyre three times uncovered the Blessed Ones feet and worshipped them with his head
And the  monks arranging their robes over one shoulder placed their hands palmtopalm over their hearts circumambulated the pyre three times and worshipped the Blessed Ones feet with their heads
As soon as it had been worshipped by Ven Mahā Kassapa and the  monks the Blessed Ones pyre caught fire of its own accord
In the burning of the Blessed Ones body no cinder or ash of the outer skin inner skin flesh tendons or oil of the joints could be discerned Only the bonerelics remained
Just as in the burning of ghee or oil no cinder or ash can be discerned in the same way in the burning of the Blessed Ones body no cinder or ash of the outer skin inner skin flesh tendons or oil of the joints could be discerned Only the bonerelics remained
And of the five hundred twinwrappings only two were burnt the innermost  the outermost
When the Blessed Ones body was consumed a cascade of water falling from the sky extinguished nibbāpesi the Blessed Ones pyre
Water shooting up from a Sal tree as well extinguished the Blessed Ones pyre
The Kusinārā Mallans with all kinds of scented water extinguished the Blessed Ones pyre
Then for seven days the Kusinārā Mallans kept the bonerelics in their reception hallsetting them round with a lattice of spears surrounded by ramparts of bowsworshipping honoring respecting  venerating them with dances songs music garlands  scents
And King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha heard that the Lord had passed away at Kusinara
And he sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara The Lord was a Khattiya and I am a Khattiya I am worthy to receive a share of the Lords remains I will make a great stupa for them
The Licchavis of Vesall heard

and the Mallas of Pava sent a message The Lord was a Khattiya we are Khattiyas
We are worthy to receive a share of the Lords remains and we will make a great stupa for them
On hearing all this the Mallas of Kusinara addressed the crowd saying The Lord passed away in our parish We will not give away any share of the Lords remains
At this the Brahmin Dona addressed the crowd in this verse
Listen lords to my proposal
Forbearance is the Buddhas teaching
It is not right that strife should come From sharing out the best of mens remains
Lets all be joined in harmony and peace
In friendship sharing out portions eight
Let stupas far and wide be put up
That all may see  and gain in faith
Well then Brahmin you divide up the remains of the Lord in the best and fairest way
Very good friends said Dona And he made a good and fair division into eight portions and then said to the assembly Gentlemen please give me the urn and I will erect a great stupa for it
So they gave Dona the urn
Now the Moriyas of Pipphalavana heard of the Lords passing
and they sent a message The Lord was a Khattiya and we are Khattiyas We are worthy to receive a portion of the Lords remains and we will make a great stupa for them
There is not a portion of the Lords remains left they have all been divided up
So you must take the embers
And so they took the embers
Then the king of Magadha Ajatasattu son of the Videhi queen came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed away
And he sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara saying The Blessed One was of the warrior caste and I am too I am worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One I will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honor
And the Licchavis of Vesali came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed away

But when they heard these words the Mallas of Kusinara addressed the assembly saying The Blessed One has passed away in our township We shall not part with any portion of the relics of the Blessed One
Then the brahman Dona spoke to the assembly saying
One word from me I beg you sirs to hear
Our Buddha taught us ever to forbear
Unseemly would it be should strife arise And war and bloodshed over the custody Of his remains who was the best of men
Let us all sirs in friendliness agree
To share eight portions 
so that far and wide Stupas may rise
and seeing them mankind Faith in the AllEnlightened One will find
So be it brahman Divide the relics into eight equal portions yourself
And the brahman Dona said to the assembly So be it sirs And he divided justly into eight equal portions the relics of the Blessed One and having done so he addressed the assembly saying Let this urn sirs be given to me Over this urn I will erect a stupa and in its honor I will hold a festival
And the urn was given to the brahman Dona

And they sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara saying The Blessed One was of the warrior caste and we are too We are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One We will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honor
There is no portion of the relics of the Blessed One remaining the relics of the Blessed One have been divided
But take from here the ashes
And they took from there the ashes
Then King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha heard The Blessed One they say has totally unbound in Kusinārā

When this was said Doṇa the brahman addressed the groups  factions
Listen good sirs to a word from me
Our Awakened One was a teacher of forbearance
Its not good that there should be combat over the sharing of the relics of the highest person
Let us masters unite in concord
on friendly terms and make eight shares
Let there be burial mounds in the various directions
many people made confident in the One with Eyes 
In that case brahman you yourself divide the Blessed Ones bonerelics into eight equal shares 
Responding As you say good sirs to the groups  factions Doṇa the brahman divided the Blessed Ones bonerelics into eight equal shares and then said to the groups  factions Good sirs give me this urn I will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for the urn

Eight portions of relics there were of him The AllSeeing One Of these seven remained In Jambudlpa with honour
The eighth In Ramagamas kept by naga kings
One tooth the Thirty Gods have kept
Kalingas kings have one the nagas too
They shed their glory oer the fruitful earth
Thus the Seers
honoured by the honoured
Gods and nagas

are best honored

of the highest the foremost of men and one in Rāmagāma honored by kings of the nāgas
One tooth the Devas of the Thirtythree worship one is honored in Gandhārapura
one in the realm of the king of Kāliṅga another is honored by kings of the nāgas
These with their splendor
their excellent gifts embellish this wealthbearing earth
Thus the relics of the One with Vision
are honored by those honored by those who are honored
He is worshiped by deva kings nāga kings human kings
and likewise is worshiped by the most excellent people
So pay homage to him with hands palmtopalm over the heart
for the Awakened are rarely encountered in the course of one hundred eons 
Altogether forty teeth and all the headhairs  bodyhairs
were taken by the devas one after another around the universe
 THUS HAVE I HEARD Once the Lord was staying at Rajagaha on the mountain called Vultures Peak
Now just then King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha wanted to attack the Vajjians
He said I will strike the Vajjians who are so powerful and strong I will cut them off and destroy them I will bring them to ruin and destruction
 And King Ajatasattu said to his chief minister the Brahmin Vassakara Brahmin go to the Blessed Lord worship him with your head to his feet in my name ask if he is free from sickness or disease if he is living at ease vigorously and comfortably
and then say Lord King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha wishes to attack the Vajjians
and says I will strike the Vajjiansbring them to ruin and destruction
And whatever the Lord declares to you report that faithfully back to me
for Tathagatas never lie
Thus have I heard Once the Blessed One dwelt at Rajagaha on the hill called Vultures Peak
At that time the king of Magadha Ajatasattu son of the Videhi queen desired to wage war against the Vajjis
He spoke in this fashion These Vajjis powerful and glorious as they are I shall annihilate them I shall make them perish I shall utterly destroy them
And Ajatasattu the king of Magadha addressed his chief minister the brahman Vassakara saying Come brahman go to the Blessed One pay homage in my name at his feet wish him good health strength ease vigour and comfort
and speak thus O Lord Ajatasattu the king of Magadha desires to wage war against the Vajjis
He has spoken in this fashion These Vajjis powerful and glorious as they are I shall annihilate them I shall make them perish I shall utterly destroy them
And whatever the Blessed One should answer you keep it well in mind and inform me
for Tathagatas do not speak falsely
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha on Vulture Peak Mountain
And on that occasion Ajātasattu Vedehiputta the king of Magadha wanted to attack the Vajjians
He said I will cut down these Vajjiansso mighty so powerful I will destroy the Vajjians I will bring these Vajjians to ruinthese Vajjians
Then he addressed Vassakāra the brahman the chief minister of Magadha Come brahman Go to the Blessed One and on arrival show reverence with your head to his feet in my name and ask whether he is free from illness  affliction is carefree strong  living in comfort Ajātasattu Vedehiputta the king of Magadha lord shows reverence with his head to the Blessed Ones feet and asks whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfort
 And then say Lord Ajātasattu Vedehiputta the king of Magadha wants to attack the Vajjians
He says I will cut down these Vajjiansso mighty so powerful I will destroy the Vajjians I will bring these Vajjians to ruinthese Vajjians
However the Blessed One answers having grasped it well report to me
For Tathāgatas do not speak untruthfully
 Thus have I heard Once the Lord was staying at Kusinara in the Mallas salgrove shortly before his final Nibbana between the twin saltrees
The Venerable Ananda came to the Lord saluted him sat down to one side
and said Lord may the Blessed Lord not pass away in this miserable little town of wattleanddaub right in the jungle in the back of beyond
Lord there are other great cities
such as Campa Rajagaha Savatthi Saketa Kosambi or Varanasi
In those places there are wealthy Khattiyas Brahmins and householders who are devoted to the Tathagata and they will provide for the Tathagatas funeral in proper style
Ananda dont call it a miserable little town of wattleanddaub right in the jungle in the back of beyond
Once upon a time Ananda King Mahasudassana was a wheel turning monarch a rightful and righteous king who had conquered the land in four directions and ensured the security of his realm
And this King Mahasudassana had this very Kusinara under the name of Kusavati for his capital
And it was twelve yojanas long from east to west and seven yojanas wide from north to south
Kusavati was rich prosperous and wellpopulated crowded with people and wellstocked with food
Just as the devacity of Alakamanda is rich  so was the royal city of Kusavati
And the city of Kusavati was never free of ten sounds by day or night the sound of elephants horses carriages kettledrums sidedrums lutes singing cymbals and gongs with cries of Eat drink and be merry as tenth
The royal city of Kusavati was surrounded by seven encircling walls
One was of gold one silver one beryl one crystal one ruby one emerald and one of all sorts of gems
And the gates of Kusavati were of four colours
one gold one silver one beryl one crystal
And before each gate were set seven pillars three or four times a mans height
One was of gold one silver one beryl one crystal one ruby one emerald and one of all sorts of gems
Kusavati was surrounded by seven rows of palmtrees
of the same materials
The gold trees had gold trunks with silver leaves and fruit
the silver trees had silver trunks with gold leaves and fruit
The beryl trees had beryl trunks with crystal leaves and fruit
the crystal trees had crystal trunks with beryl leaves and fruit
The ruby trees had ruby trunks and emerald leaves and fruit
the emerald trees had emerald trunks and ruby leaves and fruit
while the trees of all sorts of gems were the same as regards trunks leaves and fruit
The sound of the leaves stirred by the wind was lovely delightful sweet and intoxicating
just like that of the five kinds of musical instruments played in concert by welltrained and skilful players
And Ananda those who were libertines and drunkards in Kusavati had their desires assuaged by the sound of the leaves in the wind
King Mahasudassana was endowed with the seven treasures and the four properties
What are the seven
Once on a fastday of the fifteenth when the King had washed his head and gone up io the verandah on top of his palace to observe the fastday the divine WheelTreasure appeared to him thousandspoked complete with felloe hub and all appurtenances
On seeing it King Mahasudassana thought I have heard that when a duly anointed Khattiya king sees such a wheel on the fastday of the fifteenth he will become a wheelturning monarch
May I become such a monarch
Then rising from his seat covering one shoulder with his robe the King took a gold vessel in his left hand sprinkled the Wheel with his right hand and said May the noble WheelTreasure turn may the noble WheelTreasure conquer
The Wheel turned to the east and King Mahasudassana followed it with his fourfold army And in whatever country the Wheel stopped the King took up residence with his fourfold army
And those kings who faced him in the eastern region came and said Come Your Majesty welcome We are yours Your Majesty Rule us Your Majesty
And the King said Do not take life Do not take what is not given Do not commit sexual misconduct Do not tell lies Do not drink strong drink Be moderate in eating
And those who had faced him in the eastern region became his subjects
And when the Wheel had plunged into the eastern sea it emerged and turned south and King Mahasudassana followed it with his fourfold army And those Kingsbecome his subjects Having plunged into the southern sea it turned west having plunged into the western sea it turned north and King Mahasudassana followed it with his fourfold army having plunged into the western sea it turned north and King Mahasudassana followed it with his fourfold army
and those who had faced him in the northern region became his subjects

Then the WheelTreasure having conquered the lands from sea to sea returned to the royal capital of Kusavati and stopped before the Kings palace as he was trying a case as if to adorn the royal palace
And this is how the WheelTreasure appeared to King Mahasudassana
Then the ElephantTreasure appeared to King Mahasudassana pure white of sevenfold strength with the wonderful power of travelling through the air a royal tusker called Uposatha
Seeing him the King thought What a wonderful ridingelephant if only he could be brought under control
And this ElephantTreasure submitted to control just like a thoroughbred that had been trained for a long time
And once the King to try him mounted the ElephantTreasure at crack of dawn and rode him from sea to sea returning to Kusavati in time for breakfast
And that is how the ElephantTreasure appeared to King Mahasudassana
Then the HorseTreasure appeared to King Mahasudassana with a crows head darkmaned with the wondrous power of travelling through the air a royal stallion called Valahaka
And the King thought What a wonderful mount if only he could be brought under control
And this HorseTreasure submitted to control just like a thoroughbred that had been trained for a long time
And that is how the HorseTreasure appeared to King Mahasudassana
Then the JewelTreasure appeared to King Mahasudassana
It was a beryl pure excellent wellcut into eight facets clear bright unflawed perfect in every respect
The lustre of this JewelTreasure radiated for an entire yojana round about
And once the King to try it went on nightmanoeuvres on a dark night with his fourfold army with the JewelTreasure fixed to the top of his standard
And all who lived in the villages round about started their daily work thinking it was daylight
And that is how the JewelTreasure appeared to King Mahasudassana
Then the WomanTreasure appeared to King Mahasudassana lovely fair to see charming with a lotuslike complexion not too tall or too short not too thin or too fat not too dark or too fair of more than human devalike beauty
And the touch of the skin of the WomanTreasure was like cotton or silk and her limbs were cool when it was hot and warm when it was cold
Her body smelt of sandalwood and her lips of lotus
This WomanTreasure rose before the King and retired later
and was always willing to do his pleasure and she was pleasant of speech
And this WomanTreasure was not unfaithful to the King even in thought much less in deed
And that is how the WomanTreasure appeared to King Mahasudassana
Then the HouseholderTreasure appeared to King Mahasudassana
With the divine eye which as the result of kamma he possessed he saw where treasure owned and ownerless was hidden
He came to the King and said Have no fear Your Majesty I will look after your wealth properly
And once the King to try him went on board a ship and had it taken to the current in the middle of the Ganges Then he said to the HouseholderTreasure Householder I want some gold coin
Well then Sire let the ship be brought to one bank
I want the gold coins here
Then the householder touched the water with both hands and drew out a vessel full of gold coins saying Is that enough Sire Will that do Sire
and the King said That is enough householder that will do you have served me enough
And that is how the HouseholderTreasurer appeared to King Mahasudassana
Then the CounsellorTreasure appeared to King Mahasudassana He was wise experienced clever and competent to advise the King on how to proceed with what should be proceeded with and to withdraw from what should be withdrawn from and to overlook what should be overlooked
He came to the King and said Have no fear Your Majesty I shall advise you
And that is how the CounsellorTreasure appeared to King Mahasudassana
and how he was equipped with all the seven treasures
Again Ananda King Mahasudassana was endowed with the four properties
What are they
Firstly the King was handsome good to look at pleasing with a complexion like the finest lotus surpassing other men
Secondly he was longlived outliving other men
Thirdly he was free from illness free from sickness with a healthy digestion less subject to cold and heat than that of other men
Fourthly he was beloved and popular with Brahmins and householders
Just as a father is beloved by his children so he was with Brahmins and householders
And they were beloved by the King
as children are beloved by their father
Once the King set out for the pleasurepark with his fourfold army
and the Brahmins and householders came to him and said Pass slowly by Sire that we may see you as long as possible
And the King said to the charioteer Drive the chariot slowly so that I can see these Brahmins and householders as long as possible
Thus King Mahasudassana was endowed with these four properties
Then King Mahasudassana thought Suppose I were to construct lotusponds between the palmtrees a hundred bowlengths apart
And he did so
The lotusponds were lined with fourcoloured tiles gold silver beryl and crystal
each pond being approached by four staircases one gold one silver one beryl and one crystal
And the gold staircase had gold posts with silver railings and banisters
the silver had silver posts with gold railings and banisters and so on
And the lotusponds were provided with two kinds of parapet gold and silver
the gold parapets having gold posts silver railings and banisters
and the silver parapets having silver posts gold railings and banisters
Then the King thought Suppose I were to provide each pond with suitable flowers for garlands blue yellow red and white lotuses which will last through all seasons without fading
And he did so
Then he thought Suppose I were to place bathmen on the banks of these ponds to bathe those who come there
And he did so
Then he thought Suppose I were to establish charitable posts on the banks of these ponds so that those who want food can get it those who want drink can get it those who want clothes can get it those who want transport can get it those who want a sleepingplace can get it those who want a wife can get one and those who want gold coin can get it
And he did so
Then the Brahmins and householders took great wealth and went to the King saying Sire here is wealth that we have gathered together especially for Your Majesty please accept it
Thank you friends but I have enough wealth from legitimate revenues Let this be yours and take away more besides
Being thus refused by the King they withdrew to one side and considered It would not be right for us to take this wealth back home again
Suppose we were to build a dwelling for King Mahasudassana
So they went to the King and said Sire we would build you a dwelling
and the King accepted by silence
Then Sakka ruler of the gods knowing in his mind King Mahasudassanas thought said to the attendantdeva Vis sakamma Come friend Vissakamma and build a dwelling for King Mahasudassana a palace called Dhamma 
Very good Lord Vissakamma replied and as swiftly as a strong man might stretch his flexed arm or flex it again he at once vanished from the Heaven of the ThirtyThree and appeared before King Mahasudassana
and said to him Sire I shall build you a dwelling a palace called Dhamma
The King assented by silence
and Vissakamma built him the Palace of Dhamma
The Palace of Dhamma Ananda was a yojana in length from east to west
and half a yojana wide from north to south
The whole palace was faced up to three times a mans height with tiles of four colours gold silver beryl and crystal
and it contained eightyfour thousand columns of the same four colours
It had twentyfour staircases of the same four colours
and the gold staircases had gold posts with silver railings and banisters


It also had eightyfour thousand chambers of the same colours
In the gold chamber was a silver couch in the silver chamber a gold couch in the beryl chamber an ivory couch and in the crystal chamber a sandalwood couch
On the door of the gold chamber a silver palmtree was figured with silver stem gold leaves and fruit
On the door of the silver chamber a golden palmtree was figured with golden trunk leaves and fruit
on the door of the beryl chamber a crystal palmtree was figured with crystal trunk and beryl leaves and fruit
on the door of the crystal chamber a beryl palmtree was figured with crystal leaves and fruit
Then the King thought Suppose I were to make a grove of palmtrees all of gold by the door of the great gabled chamber where I sit in the daytime
and he did so
Surrounding the Dhamma Palace were two parapets one of gold one of silver
The gold one had gold posts silver railings and banisters
and the silver one had silver posts gold railings and banisters
The Dhamma Palace was surrounded by two nets of tinkling bells
One net was gold with silver bells the other silver with gold bells
And when these nets of bells were stirred by the wind their sound was lovely delightful sweet and intoxicating
just like that of the five kinds of musical instruments played in concert by welltrained and skilful players
And those who were libertines and drunkards in Kusavati had their desires assuaged by the sound of those nets of bells
And when the Dhamma Palace was finished it was hard to look at dazzling to the eyes
 just as in the last month of the Rains in autumn when there is a clear and cloudless sky the sun breaking through the mists is hard to look at so was the Dhamma Palace when it was finished
Then the King thought Suppose I were to make a lotuslake called Dhamma in front of the Dhamma Palace
so he did so
This lake was a yojana long from east to west and half a yojana wide from north to south
and lined with four kinds of tiles gold silver beryl and crystal
There were twentyfour staircases to it of four different kinds gold silver beryl and crystal
The gold staircases had gold posts with silver railings and banisters the silver had gold railings and banisters 


The Dhamma Lake was surrounded by seven kinds of palmtrees
The sound of the leaves stirred by the wind was lovely delightful sweet and intoxicating
just like that of the five kinds of musical instruments played in concert by welltrained and skilful players
And Ananda those who were libertines and drunkards in Kusavati had their desires assuaged by the sound of the leaves in the wind
When the Dhamma Palace and the Dhamma Lake were finished King Mahasudassana having satisfied every wish of those who at the time were ascetics or Brahmins or revered as such ascended into the Dhamma Palace
End of first recitationsection
Then King Mahasudassana thought Of what kamma is it the fruit of what kamma is it the result that I am now so mighty and powerful
Then he thought It is the fruit the result of three kinds of kamma of giving selfcontrol and abstinence
Then the King went to the great gabled chamber and standing at the door exclaimed May the thought of lust cease May the thought of illwill cease May the thought of cruelty cease
Thul far and no further the thought of lust of illwill of cruelty
Then the King went into the great gabled chamber sat down crosslegged on the golden couch and detached from all sensedesires detached from unwholesome mental states entered and remained in the first jhana which is with thinking and pondering born of detachment filled with delight and joy
And with the subsiding of thinking and pondering by gaining inner tranquillity and oneness of mind he entered and remained in the second jhana which is without thinking and pondering bom of concentration filled with delight and joy
And with the fading away of delight remaining imperturbable mindful and clearly aware he experienced in himself that joy of which the Noble Ones say Happy is he who dwells with equanimity and mindfulness he entered and remained in the third jhana
And having given up pleasure and pain and with the disappearance of former gladness and sadness he entered and remained in the fourth jhana which is beyond pleasure and pain and purified by equanimity and mindfulness
Then the King emerging from the great gabled chamber went to the golden gabled chamber and seated crosslegged on the silver couch stayed pervading first one quarter
then the second the third and the fourth quarter with a mind filled with lovingkindness
Thus he stayed spreading the thought of lovingkindness above below and across everywhere always with a mind filled with lovingkindness abundant magnified unbounded without hatred or illwill
And he did likewise with compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity
Of King Mahasudassanas eightyfour thousand cities his capital Kusavati was the chief of his eightyfour thousand palaces Dhamma was the chief of his eightyfour thousand gabled halls the great gabled chamber was the chief his eightyfour thousand couches were of gold silver ivory sandalwood covered with fleece wool spread with kadalideer hide with headcovers with red cushions at both ends of his eightyfour thousand elephants adorned with gold ornaments with gold banners and spread with gold nets Uposatha the royal tusker was chief of his eightyfour thousand carriages covered with lionskins tigerskins leopardskins or with orangecoloured cloth adorned with gold ornaments gold banners and spread with gold nets the chariot Vejayanta was the chief of his eightyfour thousand jewels the JewelTreasure was the chief of his eightyfour thousand wives Queen Subhadda was the chief of his eightyfour thousand householders the HouseholderTreasure was the chief of his eightyfour thousand Khattiya retainers the CounsellorTreasure was the chief his eightyfour thousand cows had tethers of fine jute and milkpails of silver his eightyfour thousand bales of clothing were of the finest linen cotton silk and wool his eightyfour thousand riceofferings were there for the taking by those in need evening and morning
And at that time King Mahasudassanas eightyfour thousand elephants waited on him everning and morning
And he thought These eightyfour thousand elephants wait on me evening and morning How if at the end of each century fortytwo thousand elephants were to wait on me turn and turn about
And he gave instructions accordingly to his CounsellorTreasure and so it was done
And Ananda after many hundred many hundred thousand years Queen Subhadda thought It is a long time since I saw King Mahasudassana
Suppose I were to go and see him
So she said to her women Come now wash your heads and put on clean clothes
It is long since we saw King Mahasudassana We shall go to see him
Yes Your Majesty they said and prepared themselves as ordered then returned to the Queen
And Queen Subhadda said to the CounsellorTreasure Friend Counsellor draw up the fourfold army It is long since we saw King Mahasudassana We shall go and see him
Very good Your Majesty said the CounsellorTreasure and having drawn up the fourfold army he reported to the Queen Now is the time to do as Your Majesty wishes
Then Queen Subhadda went with the fourfold army and her womenfolk to the Dhamma Palace and entering went to the great gabled chamber
and stood leaning against the doorpost
And King Mahasudassana thinking What is this great noise as of a crowd of people came out of the door and saw Queen Subhadda leaning against the doorpost And he said Stay there Queen Do not enter
Then King Mahasudassana said to a certain man Here fellow go to the great gabled chamber bring the gold couch out and lay it down among the gold palmtrees
Very good Sire said the man and did so
Then King Mahasudassana adopted the lionposture on his right side with one foot on the other mindful and clearly aware
Then Queen Subhadda thought King Mahasudassanas faculties are purified his complexion is clear and bright oh I hope he is not dead So she said to him
Sire of your eightyfour thousand cities Kusavati is the chief
Make a wish arouse the desire to live there
Thus reminding him of all his royal possessions she exhorted him to wish to stay alive
At this King Mahasudassana said to the Queen
For a long time Queen you spoke pleasing delightful attractive words to me but now at this last time your words have been unpleasing undelightful unattractive to me
Sire how then am I to speak to you
This is how you should speak All things that are pleasing and attractive are liable to change to vanish to become otherwise Do not Sire die filled with longing To die filled with longing is painful and blameworthy
Of your eightyfour thousand cities Kusavati is the chief
abandon desire abandon the longing to live with them
Of your eightyfour thousand palaces Dhamma is the chief
abandon desire abandon the longing to live there


 
At this Queen Subhadda cried out and burst into tears
Then wiping away her tears she said
Sire all things that are pleasing and attractive are liable to change Do not Sire die filled with longing
Soon after this King Mahasudassana died
and just as a householder or his son might feel drowsy after a good meal so he felt the sensation of passing away
and he had a favourable rebirth in the Brahmaworld
King Mahasudassana indulged in boyish sports for eightyfour thousand years
for eightyfour thousand years he exercised the viceroyalty
for eightyfour thousand years he ruled as King
and for eightyfour thousand years as a layman he lived the holy life in the Dhamma Palace
And having practised the four divine abidings at the breakingup of the body he was reborn in the Brahmaworld
Now Ananda you might think King Mahasudassana at that time was somebody else
But you should not regard it so for I was King Mahasudassana then
Those eightyfour thousand cities of which Kusavati was the chief were mine
And of those eightyfour thousand cities I dwelt in just one Kusavati

the eightyfour thousand riceofferings

were mine

of the eightyfour thousand wives I had just one looked after me and she was called Khattiyani or Velamikani 
of the eightyfour thousand bales of cloth I had just one
of the eightyfour thousand riceofferings there was just one measure of choice curry that I ate
See Ananda how all those conditioned states of the past have vanished and changed
Thus Ananda conditioned states are impermanent they are unstable they can bring us no comfort
and such being the case Ananda we should not rejoice in conditioned states we should cease to take an interest in them and be liberated from them
Six times Ananda I recall discarding the body in this place and at the seventh time I discarded it as a wheelturning monarch a righteous king who had conquered the four quarters and established a firm rule and who possessed the seven treasures
But Ananda I do not see any place in this world with its devas and maras and Brahmas or in this generation with its ascetics and Brahmins princes and people where the Tathagata will for an eighth time discard the body
So the Lord spoke The WellFarer having said this the Teacher said
Impermanent are compounded things prone to rise and fall
Having risen theyre destroyed their passing truest bliss
THUS have I heard Once the Lord was staying at Nadika at the Brick House
And at that time the Lord was explaining the rebirths of various devotees up and down the country who had died and passed away Kasis and Kosalans Vajjians and Mallas Cetis and Vamsas Kurus and Pancalas Macchas and Surasenas saying This one was reborn there and that one there
More than fifty Nadikan devotees having abandoned the five lower fetters were reborn spontaneously and would attain Nibbana without returning to this world
over ninety of them having abandoned three fetters and weakened greed hatred and delusion were OnceRetumers who would return to this world once more and then make an end of suffering
and more than five hundred having abandoned three fetters were StreamWinners incapable of falling into states of woe certain of Nibbana
This news reached the ears of the devotees in Nadika
and they were pleased delighted and filled with joy to hear the Lords replies
And the Venerable Ananda heard of the Lords report and the Nadikans delight
And he thought There were also Magadhan disciples of long standing who have died and passed away
One would think Anga and Magadha contained no Magadhan disciples who had died
Yet they too were devoted to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and they observed the discipline perfectly
The Lord has not stated their destiny It would be good to have a declaration about this it would make the multitude have faith and so attain a good rebirth
Now King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha was a righteous and lawful king a friend of Brahmins householders town and countrydwellers
so that his fame is spread abroad That righteous king of ours is dead who gave us so much happiness Life was easy for us who dwelt under his righteous rule
And he was devoted to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and observed the discipline perfectly
Thus people say King Bimbisara who praised the Lord to his dying day is dead
The Lord has not declared his destiny
and it would be good to have a declaration
Besides it was in Magadha that the Lord gained his enlightenment
Since the Lord gained his enlightenment in Magadha why does he not declare the destinies of those who have died there
For the Lord not to make such a declaration would cause unhappiness to the Magadhans Such being the case why does not the Lord make such a declaration 
And after thus reflecting in solitude on behalf of the Magadhan devotees the Venerable Ananda rose at the crack of dawn went to the Lord and saluted him
Then sitting down to one side he said Lord I have heard what has been declared concerning the inhabitants of Nadika as verse 
These were all devoted to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and they observed the discipline perfectly The Lord has not stated their destiny 
Why does not the Lord make such a declaration
Then having thus spoken to the Lord on behalf of the Magadhan devotees he rose from his seat saluted the Lord passed him by to the right and departed
As soon as Ananda had gone the Lord took his robe and bowl and went into Nadika for alms
Later on his return after his meal he went to the Brick House and having washed his feet he went in and having thought over considered and given his whole mind to the question of the Magadhan devotees he sat down on the prepared seat saying I shall know their destiny and future lot whatever it is 
And then he perceived the destiny and fate of each one of them
And in the evening emerging from meditative seclusion the Lord came out of the Brick House and sat down on the prepared seat in the shade of his lodging
Then the Venerable Ananda ame to the Lord saluted him sat down to one side
and said Lord the Lords countenance looks bright and shining showing that the Lords mind is at ease
Has the Lord been satisfied with todays lodging
Ananda after you spoke to me about the devotees of Magadha I took my robe and bowl and went into Nadika for alms Later on went to the Brick House and considered the question of the Magadhan devotees
And I perceived the destiny and fate of each one of them
Then the voice of a yakkha who had passed over cried out I am Janavasabha Lord I am Janavasabha WellFarer
Well Ananda do you know anyone who formerly bore the name of Janavasabha
I must admit Lord that I have never heard such a name and yet on hearing the name Janavasabha my hairs stood on end
and I thought He whose name is Janavasabha will not be such a lowranking yakkha
Ananda immediately after I heard this voice the yakkha appeared before me as a noble vision
and uttered a second cry I am Bimbisara Lord I am Bimbisara WellFarer
I have now for the seventh time been reborn into the entourage of the Lord Vessavana Thus having passed away as a king of humans I have now become among the devas a king of nonhuman beings
Seven states here and seven there fourteen births
Thats the tally of lives I can recall
For a long time Lord I have known myself to be exempt from states of woe and now the desire arises in me to become a OnceRetumer
I said It is amazing it is astonishing that the reverend yakkha Janavasabha should say this
 On what grounds can he know of such an august specific attainment 
Not otherwise Lord not otherwise WellFarer than through your teaching From the time when I became fully committed and gained complete faith from then on Lord for a long time I have known myself to be exempt from states of woe and the desire has arisen in me to become a Once Retumer
And here Lord having been sent by King Vessavana on some business to King Virulhaka I saw the Lord entering the Brick House and sitting down and considering the question of the Magadhan devotees
And since I had only just heard King Vessavana announce to his assembly what those folks fates were
it is no wonder that I thought I will go and see the Lord and report this to him
And these Lord are the two reasons why I came to see the Lord
 Lord in earlier days long ago on the fastday of the fifteenth at the beginning of the Rains in the fullmoon night all the ThirtyThree Gods were seated in the Sudhamma Hall
 a great congregation of divine beings and the Four Great Kings from the four quarters were there
There was the Great King Dhatarattha from the east at the head of his followers facing west the Great King Virulhaka from the south facing north the Great King Virupakkha from the west facing east and the Great King Vessavana from the north facing south 
On such occasions that is the order in which they are seated and after that came our seats
And those devas who having lived the holy life under the Lord had recently appeared in the Heaven of the ThirtyThree outshone the other devas in brightness and glory
And for that reason the Thirty Three Gods were pleased happy filled with delight and joy saying The devas hosts are growing the asuras hosts are declining
Then Lord Sakka ruler of the gods seeing the satisfaction of the ThirtyThree uttered these verses of rejoicing
The gods of ThirtyThree rejoice their leader too
Praising the Tathagata and Dhammas truth
Seeing newcome devas fair and glorious
Whove lived the holy life now well reborn
Outshining all the rest in fame and splendour
The mighty Sages pupils singled out
Seeing this the ThirtyThree rejoice their leader too
Praising the Tathagata and Dhammas truth
At this the ThirtyThree Gods rejoiced still more saying The devas hosts are growing the asuras hosts are declining
 And then they consulted and deliberated together about the matter concerning which they had assembled in the Sudhamma Hall and the Four Great Kings were advised and admonished on this matter
as they stood by their seats unmoving
The Kings instructed marked the words they spoke
Standing calm serene beside their seats
And then Lord a glorious radiance shone forth from the north and a splendour was seen greater than the sheen of the devas
And Sakka said to the ThirtyThree Gods Gentlemen when such signs are seen such light is seen and such radiance shines forth Brahma will appear
The appearance of such radiance is the first sign of Brahmas approaching manifestation 
When they see these signs Brahma will soon appear
This is Brahmas sign radiance vast and great
Then the ThirtyThree Gods sat down each in his proper place saying Let us find out what comes of this radiance and having found the truth of it we will go towards it
The Four Great Kings sitting down in their places said the same
Thus they were all agreed
Lord whenever Brahma Sanankumara appears to the ThirtyThree Gods he appears having assumed a grosser form
because his natural appearance is not such as to be perceptible to their eyes
When he appears to the Thirty Three Gods he outshines other devas in radiance and glory
just as a figure made of gold outshines the human figure
And Lord when Brahma Sanankumara appears to the Thirty Three Gods not one of them salutes him or rises or offers him a seat
They all sit silently with palms together cross legged thinking he will sit down on the couch of that god from whom he wants something
And the one on whose couch he sits down is as thrilled and delighted
as a duly anointed Khattiya king on assuming his royal office
Then Lord Brahma Sanankumara having assumed a grosser form appeared to the ThirtyThree Gods in the shape of the youth Pancasikha
Rising up in the air he appeared floating crosslegged
just as a strong man might sit down on a properlyspread couch or on the ground And seeing the delight of the ThirtyThree Gods he uttered these verses of rejoicing
The gods of ThirtyThree rejoice their leader too
Praising the Tathagata and Dhammas truth
Seeing newcome devas fair and glorious
Whove lived the holy life now well reborn
Outshining all the rest in fame and splendour
The mighty Sages pupils singled out
Seeing this the ThirtyThree rejoice their leader too
Praising the Tathagata and Dhammas truth
Now to the matter of Brahma Sanankumaras speech and as for the manner of his speech his voice had eight qualities it was distinct intelligible pleasant attractive compact concise deep and resonant
And when he spoke in that voice to the assembly its sound did not carry outside
Whoever has such a voice as that is said to have the voice of Brahma
And Brahma Sanankumara multiplying his shape by thirtythree sat down crosslegged on each individual couch of the ThirtyThree and said What do my lords the ThirtyThree think Since the Lord out of compassion for the world and for the benefit and happiness of the many has acted to the advantage of devas and mankind
those whoever they may be who have taken refuge in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and have observed the moral precepts have at death and the breakingup of the body arisen in the company of the ParinimmitaVasavatti devas or the Nimmanaratti devas or the Tusita devas or the Yama devas or in the retinue of the ThirtyThree Gods or of the Four Great Kings 
or at the very least in the company of the gandhabbas
 This was the burden of Brahma Sanankumaras speech And every one of the gods he spoke to thought He is sitting on my couch he is speaking to me alone 
All the forms assumed with one voice speak
And having spoken all at once are silent
And so the ThirtyThree their leader too
Each thinks He speaks to me alone 
 Then Brahma Sanankumara assumed a single form then he sat down on the couch of Sakka and said
What do my lords the ThirtyThree think This Lord the Arahant supreme Buddha has known and seen the four roads to power and how to develop perfect and practise them
What four
Here a monk develops concentration of intention accompanied by effort of will
concentration of energy
concentration of consciousness
and concentration of investigation accompanied by effort of will
These are the four roads to power
And whatever ascetics or Brahmins have in the past realised such powers in different ways they have all developed and strongly practised these four ways
and the same applies to all who may in the future
or who do now realise such powers
Do my lords the ThirtyThree observe such powers in me
Yes Brahma
Well I too have developed and strongly practised these four ways 
 This was the burden of Brahma Sanankumaras speech
He went on
What do my lords of the ThirtyThree think There are three gateways to the bliss proclaimed by the Lord who knows and sees
What are they
In the first place someone dwells in association with sensedesires with unwholesome conditions
At some time he hears the Ariyan Dhamma he pays close attention and practises in conformity with it
By so doing he comes to live dissociated from such sensedesires and unwholesome conditions
As a result of this dissociation pleasant feeling arises and what is more gladness
Just as pleasure might give birth to rejoicing so from pleasant feeling he experiences gladness
In the second place there is someone in whom the gross tendencies of body speech and thought are not allayed
At some time he hears the Ariyan Dhamma
and his gross tendencies of body speech and thought are allayed
As a result of this allaying pleasant feeling arises and what is more gladness
In the third place there is someone who really does not know what is right and what is wrong
what is blameworthy and what is not what is to be practised and what is not what is base and what is noble and what is foul fair or mixed in quality
At some time he hears the Ariyan Dhamma he pays close attention and practises in conformity with it
As a result he comes to know in reality what is right and wrong
what is blameworthy and what is not what is to be practised and what is not what is base and what is noble and what is foul fair or mixed in quality
In him who knows and sees thus ignorance is dispelled and knowledge arises
With the waning of ignorance and the arising of knowledge pleasant feeling arises and what is more gladness
Just as pleasure might give birth to rejoicing so from pleasant feeling he experiences gladness
These are the three gateways to the bliss proclaimed by the Lord who knows and sees
This was the burden of Brahma Sanankumaras speechHe went on
What do my lords of the ThirtyThree think How well has the Lord Buddha who knows and sees pointed out the four foundations of mindfulness for the attainment of that which is good
What are they
Here a monk abides contemplating the body as body earnestly clearly aware mindful and having put away all hankering and fretting for the world
As he thus dwells contemplating his own body as body he becomes perfectly concentrated and perfectly serene
Being thus calm and serene he gains knowledge and vision externally of the bodies of others
He abides contemplating his own feelings as feelings
he abides contemplating his own mind as mind
he abides contemplating his own mindobjects as mindobjects earnestly clearly aware mindful and having put away all hankering and fretting for the world
As he thus dwells contemplating his own mindobjects as mindobjects he becomes perfectly concentrated and perfectly serene
Being thus calm and serene he gains knowledge and vision externally of the mindobjects of others
These are the four foundations of mindfulness well pointed out by the Lord Buddha who knows and sees for the attainment of that which is good 
This was the burden of Brahma Sanankumaras speech
He went on
What do my lords of the ThirtyThree think How well has the Lord Buddha who knows and sees pointed out the seven requisites of concentration for the development of perfect concentration and the perfection of concentration
What are they
They are right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness
That onepointedness of mind that is produced by these seven factors is called the Ariyan right concentration with its bases and requisites
From right view arises right thought from right thought arises right speech from right speech arises right action
from right action arises right livelihood from right livelihood arises right effort from right effort arises right mindfulness from right mindfulness arises right concentration from right concentration arises right knowledge from right knowledge arises right liberation
If anyone truthfully declaring Wellproclaimed by the Lord is the Dhamma visible here and now timeless inviting inspection leading onward to be comprehended by the wise each one for himself were to say Open are the doors of the Deathless he would be speaking in accordance with the highest truth
For indeed my lords the Dhamma is wellproclaimed by the Lord visible here and now timeless inviting inspection leading onward to be comprehended by the wise each one for him or herself and too the doors to the Deathless are open
Those who have unshakeable faith in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and are endowed with the virtues pleasing to the Noble Ones those beings who have arisen here on account of their Dhammatraining amounting to more than twentyfour hundred Magadhan followers who have passed over have by the destruction of three fetters become StreamWinners incapable of falling into states of woe and certain of enlightenment
and indeed there are Once Retumers here too
But of that other race indeed Of greater merit still my mind
Can make no reckoning at all For fear that I should speak untruth
This was the burden of Brahma Sanankumaras speech And in connection with this the Great King Vessavana reflected in his mind It is marvellous it is wonderful that such a glorious Teacher should arise that there should be such a glorious proclamation of Dhamma and that such glorious paths to the sublime should be made known
Then Brahma Sanankumara reading King Vessavanas mind said to him What do you think King Vessavana There has been such a glorious Teacher in the past and such a proclamation and such paths made known
and there will be again in the future 
Such was the burden of what Brahma Sanankumara proclaimed to the ThirtyThree Gods And the Great King Vessavana having heard and received it in person related it to his followers
And the yakkha Janavasabha having heard it himself related it to the Lord
And the Lord having heard it himself and also come to know it by his own superknowledge related it to the Venerable Ananda who in turn related it to the monks and nuns the male and female lay followers
And so the holy life waxed mighty and prospered and spread widely as it was proclaimed among mankind
THUS have I heard Once the Lord was staying at Rajagaha on Vultures Peak
And when the night was nearly over Pancasikha of the gandhabbas lighting up the entire Vultures Peak with a splendid radiance approached the Lord saluted him stood to one side
and said Lord I wish to report to you what I have personally seen and observed when I was in the presence of the ThirtyThree Gods
Tell me then Pancasikha said the Lord
 Lord in earlier days long ago on the fastday of the fifteenth at the end of the Rains the ThirtyThree Gods assembled and rejoiced that the devas hosts were growing the asuras hosts declining 
Then Sakka uttered the verse
The gods of ThirtyThree rejoice their leader too
Praising the Tathagata and Dhammas truth
Seeing newcome devas fair and glorious
Whove lived the holy life now well reborn
Outshining all the rest in fame and splendour
The mighty Sages pupils singled out
Seeing this the ThirtyThree rejoice their leader too
Praising the Tathagata and Dhammas truth
At this Lord the ThirtyThree Gods rejoiced still more saying The devas hosts are growing the asuras hosts are declining
Pancasikha continued Then Sakka seeing their satisfaction said to the ThirtyThree Gods Would you like gentlemen to hear eight truthful statements in praise of the Lord
and on receiving their assent he declared
What do you think my lords of the ThirtyThree
As regards the way in which the Lord has striven for the welfare of the many for the happiness of the many out of compassion for the world for the welfare and happiness of devas and humans 
we can find no teacher endowed with such qualities whether we consider the past or the present other than the Lord
Wellproclaimed truly is this Lords Teaching visible here and now timeless inviting inspection leading onward to be realised by the wise each one for himself 
and we can find no proclaimer of such an onwardleading doctrine either in the past or in the present other than the Lord
The Lord has well explained what is right and what is wrong
what is blameworthy and what is blameless what is to be followed and what is not to be followed what is base and what is noble what is foul fair and mixed in quality
And we can find none who is a proclaimer of such thingsother than the Lord
Again the Lord has well explained to his disciples the path leading to Nibbana
and they coalesce Nibbana and the path just as the waters of the Ganges and the Yamuna coalesce and flow on together
And we can find no proclaimer of the path leading to Nibbana  other than the Lord
The gifts given to the Lord are wellbestowed his fame is well established so much so that I think the Khatti yas will continue to be attached to him yet the Lord takes his foodoffering without conceit
And we can find no teacher who does this other than the Lord
And the Lord has gained companions both learners and those who having lived the life have abolished the corruptions
and the Lord dwells together with them all rejoicing in the one thing
And we can find no such teacher   other than the Lord
And the Lord acts as he speaks and speaks as he acts
And we can find no teacher who does likewise in every detail of doctrineother than the Lord
The Lord has transcended doubt passed beyond all how and why he has accomplished his aim in regard to his goal and the supreme holy life
And we can find no teacher who has done the like whether we consider the past or the present other than the Lord 
And when Sakka had thus proclaimed these eight truthful statements in praise of the Lord
the ThirtyThree Gods were even more pleased overjoyed and filled with delight and happiness at what they had heard in the Lords praise
Then certain gods exclaimed Oh if only four fully enlightened Buddhas were to arise in the world and teach Dhamma just like the Blessed Lord
That would be for the benefit and happiness of the many out of compassion for the world for the benefit and happiness of devas and humans
And some said Never mind four fullyenlightened Buddhas  three would suffice
and others said Never mind three  two would suffice
At this Sakka said It is impossible gentlemen it cannot happen that two fullyenlightened Buddhas should arise simultaneously in a single worldsystem That cannot be
May this Blessed Lord continue to live long for many years to come free from sickness and disease
That would be for the benefit and happiness of the many out of compassion for the world it would be for the benefit and happiness of devas and humans
Then the ThirtyThree Gods consulted and deliberated together about the matter concerning which they had assembled in the Sudhamma Hall
and the Four Great Kings were advised and admonished on this matter as they stood by their seats unmoving
The Kings instructed marked the words they spoke
Standing calm serene beside their seats
A great radiance was seen heralding the approach of Brahma
All took their proper seats  each hoping Brahma would sit on his couch
Then Brahma Sanankumara having descended from his heaven and seeing their pleasure uttered these verses
The gods of ThirtyThree rejoice their leader too    
Brahma Sanankumaras voice had eight qualities 
Then the ThirtyThree Gods said to Brahma Sanankumara It is well Brahma We rejoice at what we have heard Sakka lord of the devas has also declared eight truthful statements to us about the Lord at which we also rejoice
Then Brahma said to Sakka It is well Lord of the devas And we too would like to hear those eight truthful statements about the Lord
Very well Great Brahma said Sakka and he repeated those eight statements
 What do you think Lord Brahma   
And Brahma Sanankumara was pleased overjoyed and filled with delight and happiness at what he had heard in the Lords praise
Brahma Sanankumara assumed a grosser form and appeared in the shape of Pancasikha 
 And sitting thus crosslegged he said to the ThirtyThree Gods
For how long has the Blessed Lord been one of mighty wisdom
 Once upon a time there was a king called Disampatl
His chaplain was a Brahmin called the Steward
The Kings son was a youth called Renu
and the Stewards son was called Jotipala
Prince Renu and Jotipala together with six other Khattiyas formed a band of eight friends
In the course of time the Steward died
and King Disampati mourned him saying Alas at the very moment when we had entrusted all our responsibilities to the Steward and were abandoning ourselves to the pleasures of the five senses the Steward has passed away
Hearing this Prince Renu said Sire do not mourn the Stewards death overmuch
His son Jotipala is cleverer than his father was and has a better eye for what is advantageous You should let Jotipala manage all the business you entrusted to his father
Is that so my boy
Yes Sire 
 Then the King called a man and said Come here my good man go to the youth Jotipala and say May the Reverend Jotipala be well King Disampati sends for you he would like to see you
Very good Your Majesty said the man and delivered the message
On receiving the message Jotipala said Very good sir and went to see the King On entering the royal presence he exchanged courtesies with the King then sat down to one side
The King said We wish the Reverend Jotipala to manage our affairs Do not refuse
I will install you in your fathers place and consecrate you as Steward
Very good Lord replied Jotipala
So King Disampati appointed Jotipala as steward in his fathers place
And once installed Jotipala carried out the business his father had carried out not doing any business his father had not done He accomplished all the tasks his father had accomplished and no others
And people said This Brahmin is truly a steward Indeed he is a great steward
And that is how the young Brahmin Jotipala came to be known as the Great Steward
And one day the Great Steward went to the group of six nobles and said King Disampati is aged decrepit stricken with age His life is near its end and he cannot last much longer Who can tell how long people will live
When King Disampati dies the kingmakers are bound to anoint Prince Renu as King
You should go gentlemen to Prince Renu and say We are the beloved dear and favoured friends of the Lord Renu sharing his joys and his sorrows
Our Lord King Disampati is aged  
When he dies the kingmakers are bound to anoint the Lord Renu as King
If the Lord Renu should gain the kingship let him share it with us 
Very good sir said the six nobles and they went to Prince Renu and spoke to him as the Great Steward had proposed
Well gentlemen who apart from myself ought to prosper but you
If gentlemen I gain the kingship I will share it with you 
 In due course King Disampati died
and the kingmakers anointed Prince Renu King in his place
And having been made King Renu abandoned himself to the pleasures of the five senses
Then the Great Steward went to the six nobles and said Gentlemen now King Disampati is dead
the Lord Renu who has been anointed in his place has abandoned himself to the pleasures of the five senses
Who knows what will come of this The sensepleasures are intoxicating
You should go to him and say King Disampati is dead and the Lord Renu has been anointed King Do you remember your word Lord 
They did so
and the King said Gentlemen I remember my word
Who is there who can divide this mighty realm of earth so broad in the north and so narrow like the front of a earth in the south into seven equal parts
Who indeed Lord if not the Great Steward 
So King Renu sent a man to the Great Steward to say My lord the King sends for you
The man went
and the Great Steward came to the King
exchanged courtesies with him and sat down to one side
Then the King said My Lord Steward go and divide this mighty realm of earth so broad in the north and so narrow like the front of a cart in the south into seven equal parts
Very good Sire said the Great Steward and he did so
And King Renus country was in the centre
Dantapura to the Kalingas Potaka to the Assakas
Mahissati to the Avantis Roruka to the Soviras
Mithila to the Videhas Campa to the Angas goes
Benares to the Kasi thus did the Steward dispose
The six nobles were delighted with their respective gains and at the success of the plan What we wanted desired aimed at and strove for we have got
Sattabhu Brahmadatta Vessabhu and Bharata
Renu and two Dhataratthas these are the seven Bharat kings  
End of first recitationsection
Then the six nobles came to the Great Steward and said Reverend Steward just as you were a beloved dear and faithful friend to King Renu
so you have been to us Please manage our affairs for us We trust you will not refuse
So he administered the realms of seven anointed kings and he also taught the mantras to seven distinguished Brahmins and seven hundred advanced pupils 
 In course of time good reports were spread about concerning the Great Steward The Great Steward can see Brahma with his own eyes talks with him face to face and consults with him
And he thought Now this good report is being spread about concerning me that I can see Brahma with my own eyes 
but it is not true
However I have heard it said by aged and respectable Brahmins the teachers of teachers that anyone who withdraws into meditation for the four months of the Rains developing the absorption on compassion can see Brahma with his own eyes talk with him face to face and consult with him
Suppose I were to do this
So the Great Steward went to King Renu and told him of the report
and of his wish to go into retreat and develop the absorption on compassionAnd nobody is to come near me except to bring me food
Reverend Steward do as you think fit 
 The six nobles likewise replied Reverend Steward do as you think fit 
He went to the seven Brahmins and the seven hundred pupils and told them of his intentions
adding So gentlemen you carry on with reciting the mantras you have heard and learnt and teach them to each other
Reverend Steward do as you think fit they replied
Then he went to his forty equalranking wives
and they said Reverend Steward do as you think fit 
So the Great Steward erected a new lodging to the east of the city and withdrew there for the four months of the Rains developing the absorption on compassion and nobody came near him except to bring him food
But at the end of four months he felt nothing but dissatisfaction and weariness as he thought I heard it said   that anyone who withdraws into meditation for the four months of the Rains developing the absorption on compassion can see Brahma with his own eyes 
But I cannot see Brahma with my own eyes and cannot talk discuss or consult with him
Now Brahma Sanankumara read his thoughts and as swiftly as a strong man might stretch out his flexed arm or flex it again he disappeared from the Brahma world and appeared before the Great Steward
And the Great Steward felt fear and trembling and his hair stood on end at such a sight as he had never seen before
And thus fearful trembling with hair standing on end he addressed Brahma Sanankumara in these verses
O splendid vision glorious and divine Who are you Lord
I fain would know your name 
In highest heaven I am known by all
Brahma Sanankumara  know me thus 
A seat and water for the feet and cakes Are fitting for a Brahma
Let the Lord Decide what hospitality he would 
We accept the gift thats offered now declare What it is you wish from us 
Of profit in this very life or in the next
a boon Say Lord Steward what it is youd have 
Then the Great Steward thought Brahma Sanankumara offers me a boon
What shall I choose  benefits in this life or in that to come
Then he thought I am an expert in matters of advantage in this life and others consult me about this
Suppose I were to ask Brahma Sanankumara for something of benefit in the life to come
And he addressed Brahma in these verses
I ask Brahma Sanankumara this
Doubting him who has no doubts I ask
 By doing what
Can mortals reach the deathless Brahma world 
That man who spurns all possessive thoughts
Alone intent compassionfilled
Aloof from stench free from lust 
Established thus and training thus
Can mortals reach the deathless Brahma world 
I understand Spuming possessive thoughts
This means that one renounces ones possessions small or great leaves ones relatives few or many and shaving off hair and beard goes forth from the household life into homelessness This is how I understand Spuming possessive thoughts
I understand Alone intent
That means that one goes off on ones own and chooses a lodging in the forest at the foot of a tree in a mountain glen in a rocky cave a charnelground in the jungle or on a heap of grass in the open 
I understand Compassionfilled
That means that one dwells suffusing one quarter with a mind filled with compassion then a second then a third and a fourth quarter
Thus one abides suffusing the whole world up down and across everywhere all around with a mind filled with compassion expanded immeasurable free from hatred and illwill
That is how I understand Compassionfilled
But the Lords words about Aloof from stench I do not understand
What do you mean Brahma by stench among men
Pray lighten my ignorance  wise one on this
What hindrance causes man to stink and fester
Anger lying fraud and cheating
Avarice pride and jealousy
Coveting doubt and harming others
Greed and hate stupor and delusion
The loathsome stench that these give off
Heads man for hell from Brahmarealm cut off 
As I understand the Lords words about the stench
these things are not easy to overcome if one lives the household life
I will therefore go forth from the household life into the homeless state
Reverend Steward do as you think fit 
Heading for hell from Brahmarealm cut off 
So the Great Steward went to King Renu and said My Lord please appoint another minister to manage your affairs
I wish to go forth from the household life into homelessness
After what Brahma has told me about the stench of the world which cannot easily be overcome by one living the household life
I am going forth into homelessness
King Renu lord of this realm I declare
You yourself must rule Ill counsel you no more
If anything you lack Ill make it good
If any hurt you my royal arms shall guard you
You my father I your son Steward stay
I lack nothing none there is who harms me
No human voice I heard  at home I cannot stay 
Nonhuman  whats he like who calls that you
At once abandon home and all of us 
Before I went on this retreat I thought of sacrifice
Lighting the sacred fire strewing kusagrass
But now  eternal Brahma from Brahmarealms appeared
I asked he answered I now can stay no more 
Reverend Steward in your words I trust
Such words Once heard you had no other course
We will follow Steward be our Master
Like a berylgem clear of finest water
So purified well follow in your wake
If the Reverend Steward goes forth from the household life into homelessness I will do the same
Wherever you go we will follow 
Then the Great Steward went to the six nobles and said to them My lords please appoint another minister to manage your affairs
I wish to go forth from the household life into homelessness 
 And the six nobles went aside and consulted together These Brahmins are greedy for money Perhaps we can win the Great Steward round with money
 So they came back to him and said Sir there is plenty of wealth in these seven kingdoms Take as much as you like
 Enough gentlemen I have received plenty of wealth from my lords already
That is the very thing that I am renouncing in order to go forth from the household life into homelessness
as I have explained 
Then the six nobles went aside again and consulted together These Brahmins are greedy for women Perhaps we can win the Great Steward round with women
 So they came to him and said Sir there are plenty of women in these seven kingdoms Take your pick
Enough gentlemen I already have forty equal wives
and I am leaving them in order to go forth from the household life into homelessness
as I have explained 
If the Reverend Steward goes forth from the household life into homelessness we will do likewise Wherever you go we will follow
If you renounce those lusts that bind most men
Exert yourselves be strong and patiently endure
This is the path thats straight the peerless path
The path of truth guarded by the good to Brahmas realm 
And so Lord Steward just wait seven years
and then we too will go forth into homelessness Wherever you go we will follow 
Gentlemen seven years is far too long I cannot wait for seven years
Who can tell how long people will live
We have to go on into the next world we must learn by means of wisdom we must do what is right and live the holy life for nothing that is born is immortal
Now I am going forth as I have explained 
 Well Reverend Steward just wait six years  five years  four years  three years  two years  one year and then we too will go forth into homelessness Wherever you go we will follow 
Gentlemen one year is far too long  
Then wait seven months  
Gentlemen seven months is far too long  
Then wait six months   five months   four months   three months  two months  one month  half a month
 Gentlemen half a month is far too long 
Then Reverend Steward just wait seven days while we make over our kingdoms to our sons and brothers At the end of seven days we will go forth into homelessness Wherever you go we will follow
Seven days is not long gentlemen I agree my lords to seven days 
Then the Great Steward went to the seven Brahmins and their seven hundred advanced pupils and said to them Now Your Reverences you must seek another teacher to teach you the mantras
I mean to go forth from the household life into homelessness
After what Brahma has told me about the stench of the world
which cannot be easily overcome by one living the household life I am going forth into homelessness
 Reverend Steward do not do so
There is little power and profit in the homeless life and much power and profit in the life of a Brahmin
Do not say such things gentlemen
Besides who has greater power and profit than I have
I have been like a king to kings like Brahma to the Brahmins like a deity to householders
and I am giving all this up in order to go forth from the household life into homelessness
as I have explained
 If the Reverend Steward goes forth from the household life into homelessness we will do likewise Wherever you go we will follow 
Then the Great Steward went to his forty equal wives and said Whichever of you ladies wishes to may go back to her own family and seek another husband
I mean to go forth into homelessness 
You alone are the kinsman we could wish for the only husband we want
If the Reverend Steward goes forth into homelessness we will do likewise Wherever you go we will follow 
And so the Great Steward at the end of the seven days shaved off his hair and beard donned yellow robes and went forth from the household life into homelessness
And with him went the seven anointed Khattiya kings the seven wealthy and distinguished Brahmins with their seven hundred advanced pupils his forty equal wives several thousand Khatti yas several thousand Brahmins several thousand householders even some haremwomen
And so followed by this company the Great Steward wandered through villages towns and royal cities
And whenever he came to a village or town he was like a king to kings like Brahma to the Brahmins like a deity to householders
And in those days whenever anyone sneezed or stumbled they used to say Praise be to the Great Steward Praise be to the Minister of Seven
And the Great Steward dwelt suffusing one quarter with a mind filled with lovingkindness then a second then a third and a fourth quarter
He dwelt suffusing the whole world up down and across everywhere all around with a mind filled with compassion  with a mind filled with sympathetic joy   with a mind filled with equanimity  free from hatred and illwill And thus he taught his disciples the way to union with the Brahmaworld
And all those who had at that time been the Great Stewards pupils and had fully mastered his teaching
were after death at the breakingup of the body reborn in a happy sphere in the Brahmaworld
And those who had not fully mastered his teaching were reborn either among the ParanimmitaVasavatti devas among the Nimmanarati devas among the Tusita devas among the Yama devas among the devas of the ThirtyThree Gods or among the devas of the Four Great Kings And the very lowest realm that any of them attained was that of the gandhabbas
Thus the goingforth of all those people was not fruitless or barren but productive of fruit and profit 
Do you remember this Lord
 I do Pancasikha
At that time I was the Brahmin the Great Steward
and I taught those disciples the path to union with the Brahmaworld
However Pancasikha that holy life does not lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to peace to superknowledge to enlightenment to Nibbana but only to birth in the Brahmaworld
whereas my holy life leads unfailingly to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to peace to superknowledge to enlightenment to Nibbana
That is the Noble Eightfold Path
namely Right View Right Thought Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness Right Concentration
And Pancasikha those of my disciples who have fully mastered my teaching have by their own superknowledge realised by the destruction of the corruptions in this very life the uncorrupted freedom of heart and mind And of those who have not fully mastered it some by the destruction of the five lower fetters will be reborn spontaneously attaining thence to Nibbana without returning to this world
some by the destruction of three fetters and the reduction of greed hatred and delusion will become OnceRetumers who will return once more to this world before making an end of suffering
and some by the destruction of three fetters will become StreamWinners incapable of falling into states of woe assured of enlightenment
Thus the goingforth of all these people was not fruitless or barren but productive of fruit and profit 
Thus the Lord spoke
and Pancasikha of the gandhabbas was delighted and rejoiced at the Lords words And having saluted him he passed him by on the right and vanished from the spot
and would come to have even more faith in the Lord
Thus have I heard Once the Venerable Kumara Kassapa was touring round Kosala with a large company of about five hundred monks and he came to stay at a town called Setavya
He stayed to the north of Setavya in the Simsapa Forest
And at that time Prince Payasi was living at Setavya a populous place full of grass timber water and corn which had been given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift and with royal powers
And Prince Payasi developed the following evil opinion There is no other world there are no spontaneously bom beings there is no fruit or result of good or evil deeds
Meanwhile the Brahmins and householders of Setavya heard the news The ascetic KumaraKassapa a disciple of the ascetic Gotama is touring round Kosala with a large company of about five hundred monks he has arrived at Setavya and is staying to the north of Setavya in the Simsapa Forest
and concerning the Reverend Kassapa a good report has been spread about He is learned experienced wise wellinformed a fine speaker able to give good replies venerable an Arahant
And it is good to see such Arahants
And so the Brahmins and householders of Setavya leaving Setavya by the north gate in large numbers made for the Simsapa Forest
And just then Prince Payasi had gone up to the verandah for his midday rest
Seeing all the Brahmins and householders making for the Simsapa Forest he asked his steward why
The steward said Sir it is the ascetic Kumara Kassapa a disciple of the ascetic Gotama
and concerning him a good report has been spread about 
That is why they are going to see him
Well then steward you go to the Brahmins and householders of Setavya and say Gentlemen Prince Payasi says Please wait the Prince will come to see the ascetic KumaraKassapa
Already this ascetic KumaraKassapa has been teaching these foolish and inexperienced Brahmins and householders of Setavya that there is another world that there are spontaneously bom beings and that there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds
But no such things exist
Very good sir said the steward and delivered the message
Then Prince Payasi accompanied by the Brahmins and householders of Setavya went to the Simsapa Forest where the Venerable KumaraKassapa was Having exchanged courtesies with the Venerable Kumara Kassapa he sat down to one side
And some of the Brahmins and householders saluted the Venerable KumaraKassapa and then sat down to one side while some first exchanged courtesies with him
some saluted him with joined palms
some announced their name and clan
and some silently sat down to one side
Then Price Payasi said to the Venerable KumaraKassapa Reverend Kassapa I hold to this tenet and this view There is no other world there are no spontaneously bom beings there is no fruit or result of good or evil deeds
Well Prince I have never seen or heard of such a tenet or view as you declare
And so Prince I will question you about it and you shall reply as you think fit
What do you think Prince Are the sun and the moon in this world or another are they gods or humans
 Reverend Kassapa they are in another world and they are gods not humans
In the same way Prince you should consider There is another world there are spontaneously bom beings there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds
  Whatever you may say about that Reverend Kassapa I still think there is no other world
Have you any reasons for this assertion Prince
 I have Reverend Kassapa
How is that Prince
 Reverend Kassapa I have friends colleagues and blood relations who take life take what is not given commit sexual offences tell lies use abusive harsh and frivolous speech who are greedy full of hatred and hold wrong views
Even tually they become ill suffering diseased
And when I am sure they will not recover I go to them and say There are certain ascetics and Brahmins who declare and believe that those who take life hold wrong views will after death at the breakingup of the body be born in a state of woe an evil place a place of punishment in hell
Now you have done these things
and if what these ascetics and Brahmins say is true that is where you will go
Now if after death you go to a state of woe come to me and declare that there is another world there are spontaneously born beings there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds
You gentlemen are trustworthy and dependable and what you have seen shall be as if I had seen it myself so it will be
But although they agreed they neither came to tell me nor did they send a messenger
That Reverend Kassapa is my reason for maintaining There is no other world there are no spontaneously born beings there is no fruit or result of good or evil deeds
As to that Prince I will question you about it
and you shall reply as you think fit
What do you think Prince Suppose they were to bring a thief before you caught in the act and say This man Lord is a thief caught in the act Sentence him to any punishment you wish
And you might say Bind this mans arms tightly behind him with a strong rope shave his head closely and lead him to the rough sound of a drum through the streets and squares and out through the southern gate and there cut off his head
And they saying Very good in assent mightlead him out through the southern gate and there cut off his head
Now if that thief were to say to the executioners Good executioners in this town or village I have friends colleagues and bloodrelations please wait till I have visited them would he get his wish Or would they just cut off that talkative thiefs head
 He would not get his wish Reverend Kassapa
They would just cut off his head
So Prince this thief could not get even his human executioners to wait while he visited his friends and relations
So how can your friends colleagues and bloodrelations who have committed all these misdeeds having died and gone to a place of woe prevail upon the warders of hell saying Good warders of hell please wait while we report to Prince Payasi that there is another world there are spontaneously born beings and there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds
Therefore Prince admit that there is another world
Whatever you may say about that Reverend Kassapa I still think there is no other world
Have you any reason for this assertion Prince
 I have Reverend Kassapa
What is that Prince 
Reverend Kassapa I have friends who abstain from taking life from taking what is not given from committing sexual offences from telling lies or using abusive harsh and frivolous speech who are not greedy or full of hatred and who have right views
Eventually they become ill
and when I am sure they will not recover I go to them and say There are certain ascetics and Brahmins who declare and believe that those who abstain from taking life and have right views will after death at the breakingup of the body be born in a happy state a heavenly world
Now you have refrained from doing these things
and if what these ascetics and Brahmins say is true that is where you will go
Now if after death you go to a happy state a heavenly world come to me and declare that there is another world  
You gentlemen are trustworthy and dependable and what you have seen shall be as if I had seen it myself so it will be
But although they agreed they neither came to me nor did they send a messenger
That Reverend Kassapa is my reason for maintaining There is no other world
Well then Prince I will give you a parable
because some wise people understand what is said by means of parables
Suppose a man had fallen head first into a cesspit
and you were to say to your men Pull that man out of the cesspit
and they would say Very good and do so
Then you would tell them to clean his body thoroughly of the filth with bamboo scrapers
and then to give him a triple shampoo with yellow loam
Then you would tell them to anoint his body with oil and then to clean him three times with fine soap powder
Then you would tell them to dress his hair and beard
and to adorn him with fine garlands ointments and clothes
Finally you would tell them to lead him up to your palace and let him indulge in the pleasures of the five senses
and they would do so
What do you think Prince Would that man having been well washed with his hair and beard dressed adorned and garlanded clothed in white and having been conveyed up to the palace enjoying and revelling in the pleasures of the five senses want to be plunged once more into that cesspit
 No Reverend Kassapa
Why not
 Because that cesspit is unclean and considered so evilsmelling horrible revolting and generally considered to be so
In just the same way Prince human beings are unclean evilsmelling horrible revolting and generally considered to be so by the devas
So why should your friends who have not committed any of the offences  and who have after death been bom in a happy state a heavenly world come back and say There is another world   there is fruit of good and evil deeds
Therefore Prince admit that there is another world
Whatever you may say about that Reverend Kassapa I still think there is no other world
Have you any reason for this assertion Prince I have Reverend Kassapa What is that Prince 
Reverend Kassapa I have friends who abstain   from telling lies from strong drink and slothinducing drugs Eventually they become ill
There are certain ascetics and Brahmins who declare and believe that those who abstain from taking life   and slothproducing drugs will   be bom in a happy state in a heavenly world as companions of the ThirtyThree Gods  
But although they agreed they neither came to tell me nor did they send a messenger
That Reverend Kassapa is my reason for maintaining There is no other world
As to that Prince I will question you about it and you shall answer as you think fit
That which is for human beings Prince a hundred years is for the ThirtyThree Gods one day and night Thirty of such nights make a month twelve such months a year and a thousand such years are the lifespan of the ThirtyThree Gods
Now suppose they were to think After we have indulged in the pleasures of the five senses for two or three days we will go to Payasi and tell him there is another world there are spontaneously bom beings there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds
would they have done so
 No Reverend Kassapa
because we should be long since dead
But Reverend Kassapa who has told you that the ThirtyThree Gods exist and that they are so longlived
I dont believe the ThirtyThree Gods exist or are so long lived
Prince imagine a man who was blind from birth and could not see dark or light objects or blue yellow red or crimson ones could not see the smooth and the rough could not see the stars and the moon
He might say There are no dark and light objects and nobody who can see them
there is no sun or moon and nobody who can see them
I am not aware of this thing and therefore it does not exist
Would he be speaking rightly Prince
 No Reverend Kassapa
There are dark and light objects
 there is a sun and a moon
and anyone who said I am not aware of this thing I cannot see it and therefore it does not exist
would not be speaking rightly
Well Prince it appears that your reply is like that of the blind man when you ask how I know about the ThirtyThree Gods and their longevity
Prince the other world cannot be seen the Way you think with the physical eye
Prince those ascetics and Brahmins who seek in the junglethickets and the recesses of the forest for a restingplace that is quiet with little noise  they stay there unwearied ardent restrained purifying the divine eye
and with that purified divine eye that exceeds the powers of human sight they see both this world and the next and spontaneously bom beings
That Prince is how the other world can be seen and not the way you think with the physical eye
Therefore Prince admit that there is another world that there are spontaneously bom beings and that there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds
Whatever you may say about that Reverend Kassapa I still think there is no other world
Have you any reason for this assertion Prince I have Reverend Kassapa What is that Prince 
Well Reverend Kassapa I see here some ascetics and Brahmins who observe morality and are wellconducted who want to live do not want to die who desire comfort and hate suffering
And it seems to me that if these good ascetics and Brahmins who are so moral and wellconducted know that after death they will be better off
then these good people would now take poison take a knife and kill themselves hang themselves or jump off a cliff
But though they have such knowledge they still want to live do not want to die they desire comfort and hate suffering
And that Reverend Kassapa is my reason for maintaining There is no other world tt 
Well then Prince I will give you a parable
because some wise people understand what is said by means of parables
Once upon a time Prince a certain Brahmin had two wives
One had a son ten or twelve years old while the other was pregnant and nearing her time
when the Brahmin died
Then this youth said to his mothers cowife Lady whatever wealth and possessions silver or gold there may be is all mine
My father made me his heir
At this the Brahmin lady said to the youth Wait young man until I give birth
If the child is a boy one portion will be his and if it is a girl she will become your servant
The youth repeated his words a second time and received the same reply
When he repeated them a third time
the lady took a knife and going into an inner room cut open her belly thinking If only I could find out whether it is a boy or a girl
And thus she destroyed herself and the living embryo and the wealth as well
just as fools do who seek their inheritance unwisely heedless of hidden danger In the same way you Prince will foolishly enter on hidden dangers by unwisely seeking for another world just as that Brahmin lady did in seeking her inheritance
But Prince those ascetics and Brahmins who observe morality and are wellconducted do not seek to hasten the ripening of that which is not yet ripe but rather they wisely await its ripening
Their life is profitable to those ascetics and Brahmins
for the longer such moral and wellconducted ascetics and Brahmins remain alive the greater the merit that they create they practise for the welfare of the many for the happiness of the many out of compassion for the world for the profit and benefit of devas and humans
Therefore Prince admit that there is another world
Whatever you may say about that Reverend Kassapa I still think there is no other world
Have you any reason for this assertion Prince I have Reverend Kassapa What is that Prince 
Reverend Kassapa take the case that they bring a thief before me caught in the act and say Here Lord is a thief caught in the act sentence him to whatever punishment you wish
And I say Take this man and put him alive in a jar Seal the mouth and close it with a damp skin give it a thick covering of damp clay put it in an oven and light the fire
And they do so
When we are sure the man is dead we remove the jar break the clay uncover the mouth and watch carefully Maybe we can see his soul escaping
But we do not see any soul escaping
and that is why Reverend Kassapa I believe there is no other world
As to that Prince I will question you about it and you shall reply as you think fit
Do you admit that when you have gone for your midday rest you have seen pleasant visions of parks forests delightful country and lotusponds
 I do Reverend Kassapa
And at that time are you not watched over by hunchbacks dwarfs young girls and maidens
 I am Reverend Kassapa
And do they observe your soul entering or leaving your body
 No Reverend Kassapa
So they do not see your soul entering or leaving your body even when you are alive
Therefore how could you see the soul of a dead man entering or leaving his body
Therefore Prince admit that there is another world
Whatever you may say about that Reverend Kassapa I still think there is no other world
Have you any reason for this assertion Prince  have Reverend Kassapa What is that Prince 
Reverend Kassapa take the case that they bring a thief before me
and I say Weigh this man on the scales alive then strangle him and weigh him again
And they do so
As long as he was alive he was lighter softer and more flexible
but when he was dead he was heavier stiffer and more inflexible
And that Reverend Kassapa is my reason for maintaining that there is no other world
Well then Prince I will give you a parable
Suppose a man weighed an iron ball that had been heated all day blazing burning fiercely glowing
And suppose that after a time when it had grown cold and gone out he weighed it again
At which time would it be lighter softer and more flexible when it was hot burning and glowing or when it was cold and extinguished
 Reverend Kassapa when that ball of iron is hot burning and glowing with the elements of fire and air then it is lighter softer and more flexible
When without those elements it has grown cold and gone out it is heavier stiffer and more inflexible
Well then Prince it is just the same with the body When it has life heat and consciousness it is lighter softer and more flexible
But when it is deprived of life heat and consciousness it is heavier stiffer and more inflexible
In the same way Prince you should consider There is another world
Whatever you may say about that Reverend Kassapa I still think there is no other world
Have you any reason for this assertion Prince  have Reverend Kassapa What is that Prince 
Reverend Kassapa take the case of a thief that they bring before me
and I say Kill this man without wounding his cuticle skin flesh sinews bones or marrow
and they do so
When he is halfdead I say Now lay this man on his back and perhaps we shall be able to see his soul emerging
They do so
but we cannot see his soul emerging
Then I say Turn him face downwards on his side on the other side stand him up stand him on his head thump him with your fists stone him hit him with sticks strike him with swords shake him this way and that and perhaps we shall be able to see his soul emerging
And they do all these things
but although he has eyes he does not perceive objects or their spheres
although he has ears he does not hear sounds 
although he has a nose he does not smell smells
although he has a tongue he does not taste tastes
although he has a body he does not feel tangibles or their spheres
And that is why Reverend Kassapa I believe there is no other world
Well then Prince I will give you a parable
Once there was a trumpeter who took his trumpet and went into the border country
On coming to a village he stood in the village centre blew his trumpet three times and then putting it down on the ground sat down to one side
Then Prince those border folk thought Where does that sound come from that is so delightful so sweet so intoxicating so compelling so captivating
 They addressed the trumpeter and asked him about this
Friends this trumpet is where those delightful sounds come from
So then they laid the trumpet on its back crying Speak mister trumpet speak
But the trumpet never uttered a sound
Then they turned it face downwards on its side on its other side stood it up stood it on its head   thumped it with their fists   stoned it  beat it with sticks struck it with swords shook it this way and that crying Speak mister trumpet speak
But the trumpet never uttered a sound
The trumpeter thought What fools these border folk are How stupidly they search for the sound of the trumpet
And as they watched him he took the trumpet blew it three times and went away
And those border folk thought It seems that when the trumpet is accompanied by a man by effort and by the wind then it makes a sound But when it is not accompanied by a man by effort and by the wind then it makes no sound
In the same way Prince when this body has life heat and consciousness then it goes and comes back stands and sits and lies down sees things with its eyes hears with its ears smells with its nose tastes with its tongue feels with its body and knows mental objects with its mind
But when it has no life heat or consciousness it does none of these things
In the same way Prince you should consider There is another world
Whatever you may say about that Reverend Kassapa I still think there is no other world
Have you any reason for this assertion Prince I have Reverend Kassapa What is that Prince 
Reverend Kassapa take the case of a thief they bring before me
and I say Strip away this mans outer skin and perhaps we shall be able to see his soul emerging
Then I tell them to strip away his inner skin his flesh sinews bones bonemarrow  
but still we cannot see any soul emerging
And that is why Reverend Kassapa I believe there is no other world
Well then Prince I will give you a parable
Once there was a mattedhaired fireworshipper who dwelt in the forest in a leafhut
And a certain tribe was on the move
and its leader stayed for one night near the fireworshippers dwelling and then left
So the fireworshipper thought he would go to the site to see if he could find anything he could make use of
He got up early and went to the site and there he saw a tiny delicate baby boy lying abandoned on his back
At the sight he thought It would not be right for me to look on and let a human being die I had better take this child to my hermitage take care of him feed him and bring him up
So he did so
When the boy was ten or twelve the hermit had some business to do in the neighbourhood
So he said to the boy I want to go to the neighbourhood my son You look after the fire
and dont let it go out
If it should go out here is an axe here are some sticks here are the firesticks so you can relight the fire and look after it
Having thus instructed the boy the hermit went into the neighbourhood
But the boy being absorbed in his games let the fire go out
Then he thought Father said 
 
here is an axe   so you can relight the fire and look after it
Now Id better do so
So he chopped up the firesticks with the axe thinking I expect Ill get a fire this way
But he got no fire
He cut the firesticks into two into three into four into five ten a hundred pieces he splintered them he pounded them in a mortar he winnowed them in a great wind thinking I expect Ill get a fire this way
But he got no fire
and when the hermit came back having finished his business he said Son why have you let the fire go out
and the boy told him what had happened
The hermit thought How stupid this boy is how senseless What a thoughtless way to try to get a fire
So while the boy looked on he took the firesticks and rekindled the fire saying Son thats the way to rekindle a fire
not the stupid senseless thoughtless way you tried to do it
In just the same way Prince you are looking foolishly senselessly and unreasonably for another world
Prince give up this evil viewpoint give it up Do not let it cause you misfortune and suffering for a long time
Even though you say this Reverend Kassapa still I cannot bear to give up this evil opinion
King Pasenadi of Kosala knows my opinions and so do kings abroad
If I give it up they will say What a fool Prince Payasi is how stupidly he grasps at wrong views
I will stick to this view out of anger contempt and spite
Well then Prince I will give you a parable
Once Prince a great caravan of a thousand carts was travelling from east to west
And wherever they went they rapidly consumed all the grass wood and greenstuff
Now this caravan had two leaders each in charge of five hundred carts
And they thought This is a great caravan of a thousand carts Wherever we go we use up all the supplies
Perhaps we should divide the caravan into two groups of five hundred  carts each
and they did so
Then one of the leaders collected plenty of grass wood and water and set off
After two or three days journey he saw a dark redeyed man coming towards him wearing a quiver and a wreath of white waterlilies with his clothes and hair all wet driving a donkeychariot whose wheels were splashed with mud On seeing this man the leader said Where do you come from sir
 From suchandsuch
And where are you going
 To soandso
Has there been much rainfall in the jungle ahead
 Oh yes sir there has been a great deal of rain inf the jungle ahead of you the roads are well watered and there is plenty of grass wood and water
Throw away the grass wood and water you have already got sir You will make rapid progress with lightlyladen carts so do not tire your draughtoxen
The caravanleader told the carters what the man had said
Throw away the grass wood and water
and they did so
But at the first campingplace they did not find any grass wood or water
nor at the second the third fourth fifth sixth or seventh
and thus they all came to ruin and destruction
And whatever there was of them men and cattle they were all gobbled up by that yakkha spirit
and only their bones remained
And when the leader of the second caravan was sure the first caravan had gone forward far enough he stocked up with plenty of grass wood and water
Aftr two or three days journey this leader saw a dark redeyed man coming towards him
who advised him to throw away his stocks of grass wood and water
Then the leader said to the carters 
This man told us that we should throw away the grass wood and water we already have
But he is not one of our friends and relatives so why should we trust him
So do not throw away the grass wood and water we have let the caravan continue on its way with the goods we have brought
and do not throw any of them away
The carters agreed and did as he said
And at the first campingplace they did not find any grass wood or water
nor at the second the third fourth fifth sixth or seventh
but there they saw the other caravan that had come to ruin and destruction
and they saw the bones of those men and cattle that had been gobbled up by the yakkhaspirit
Then the caravan leader said to the carters That caravan came to ruin and destruction through the folly of its leader
So now let us leave behind such of our goods as are of little value and take whatever is of greater value from the other caravan
And they did so And with that wise leader they passed safely through the jungle
In the same way you Prince will come to ruin and destruction if you foolishly and unwisely seek the other world in the wrong way
Those who think they can trust anything they hear are heading for ruin and destruction just like those carters
Prince give up this evil viewpoint give it up
Do not let it cause you misfortune and suffering for a long time
Even though you say this Reverend Kassapa still I cannot bear to give up this evil opinion
If I give it up they will say What a fool Prince Payasi is
Well then Prince I will give you a parable
 
Once there was a swineherd who was going from his own village to another
There he saw a heap of dry dung that had been thrown away
and he thought Theres a lot of dry dung somebodys thrown away that would be food for my pigs I ought to carry it away
And he spread out his cloak gathered up the dung in it made it into a bundle and put it on his head and went on
But on his way back there was a heavy shower of unseasonable rain
and he went on his way bespattered with oozing dripping dung to his fingertips and still carrying his load of dung
Those who saw him said You must be mad You must be crazy Why do you go along carrying that load of dung thats oozing and dripping all over you down to your fingertips
 Youre the ones that are mad Youre the ones that are crazy This stuff is food for my pigs
Prince you speak just like the dungcarrier in my parable
Prince give up this evil viewpoint
give it up
Do not let it cause you misfortune and suffering for a long time
Even though you say this Reverend Kassapa still I cannot bear to give up this evil opinion
If I give it up they will say What a fool Prince Payasi is
Well then Prince I will give you a parable
Once there were two gamblers using nuts as dice
One of them whenever he got the unlucky dice swallowed it
The other noticed what he was doing and said Well my friend youre the winner all right Give me the dice and I will make an offering of them
All right said the first and gave them to him
Then that one filled the dice with poison and then said Come on lets have a game
The other agreed
they played again
and once again the one player whenever he got the unlucky dice swallowed it
The second watched him do so and then uttered this verse
The dice is smeared with burning stuff Though the swallower doesnt know
Swallow cheat and swallow well  Bitter it will be like hell
Prince you speak just like the gambler in my parable
Prince give up this evil viewpoint give it up
Do not let it cause you misfortune and suffering for a long time
Even though you say this Reverend Kassapa still I cannot bear to give up this evil opinion
If I give it up they will say What a fool Prince Payasi is
Well then Prince I will give you a parable
Once the inhabitants of a certain neighbourhood migrated
And one man said to his friend Come along lets go to that neighbourhood we might find something valuable
His friend agreed
so they went to that district and came to a village street And there they saw a pile of hemp that had been thrown away and one said Heres some hemp You make a bundle Ill make a bundle and well both carry it off
The other agreed and they did so Then coming to another village street
they found some hempthread and one said This pile of hempthread is just what we wanted the hemp for
Lets each throw away our bundle of hemp and well go on with a load of hempthread each
Ive brought this bundle of hemp a long way and its well tied up That will do for me  you do as you like
So his companion threw away the hemp and took the hempthread
Coming to another village street
they found some hemp cloth and one said This pile of hempcloth is just what we wanted the hemp or hempthread for
You throw away your load of hemp and Ill throw away my load of hempthread and well go on with a load of hempcloth each
But the other replied as before
so the one companion threw away the hempthread and took the hempcloth
In another village they saw a pile of flax in another linenthread in another linencloth in another cotton in another cotton thread in another cottonclothin another iron in another copper in another tin in another lead in another silver in another gold Then one said This pile of gold is just what we wanted the hemp hempthread hemp cloth flax linenthread linencloth cotton cottonthread cottoncloth iron copper tin lead silver for
You throw away your load of hemp and Ill throw away my load of silver and well both go on with a load of gold each
Ive brought this load of hemp a long way and its well tied up That will do for me  you do as you like
And this companion threw away the load of silver and took the load of gold
Then they came back to their own village
And there the one who brought a load of hemp gave no pleasure to his parents nor to his wife and children nor to his friends and colleagues and he did not even get any joy or happiness from it himself
But the one who came back with a load of gold pleased his parents his wife and children his friends and colleagues and he derived joy and happiness from it himself as well
Prince you speak just like the hempbearer in my parable
Prince give up this evil view give it up
Do not let it cause you misfortune and suffering for a long time
I was pleased and delighted with the Reverend Kas sapas first parable
and I wanted to hear his quickwitted replies to questions because I thought he was a worthy opponent
Excellent Reverend Kassapa excellent
It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down or to point out the way to one who had got lost or to bring an oillamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there Just so has the Reverend Kassapa expounded the Dhamma in various ways
And I Reverend Kassapa go for refuge to the Blessed Lord to the Dhamma and to the Sangha
May the Reverend Kassapa accept me from this day forth as a lay follower as long as life shall last
And Reverend Kassapa I want to make a great sacrifice Instruct me Reverend Kassapa how this may be to my lasting benefit and happiness
Prince when a sacrifice is made at which oxen are slain or goats fowl or pigs or various creatures are slaughtered and the participants have wrong view wrong thought wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness and wrong concentration then that sacrifice is of no great fruit or profit it is not very brilliant and has no great radiance
Suppose Prince a farmer went into the forest with plough and seed
and there in an untilled place with poor soil from which the stumps had not been uprooted were to sow seeds that were broken rotting ruined by wind and heat stale and not properly embedded in the soil
and the raingod did not send proper showers at the right time 
would those seeds germinate develop and increase and would the farmer get an abundant crop
 No Reverend Kassapa
Well then Prince it is the same with a sacrifice at which oxen are slain where the participants have wrong view  wrong concentration
But when none of these creatures are put to death and the participants have right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration then that sacrifice is of great fruit and profit it is brilliant and of great radiance
Suppose Prince a farmer went into the forest with plough and seed
and there in a welltilled place with good soil from which the stumps had been uprooted were to sow seeds that were not broken rotting ruined by wind and heat or stale and were firmly embedded in the soil
and the raingod were to send proper showers at the right time 
would those seeds germinate develop and increase and would the farmer get an abundant crop
 He would Reverend Kassapa
In the same way Prince at a sacrifice at which no oxen are slain where the participants have right view right concentration then that sacrifice is of great fruit and profit it is brilliant and of great radiance
Then Prince Payasi established a charity for ascetics and Brahmins wayfarers beggars and the needy
And there such food was given out as broken rice with sour gruel and also rough clothing with ballfringes
And a young Brahmin called Uttara was put in charge of the distribution
Referring to it he said Through this charity I have been associated with Prince Payasi in this world but not in the next
And Prince Payasi heard of his words
so he sent for him and asked him if he had said that
Yes Lord
But why did you say such a thing
Friend Uttara dont we who wish to gain merit expect a reward for our charity 
But Lord the food you give  broken rice with sour gruel  you would not care to touch it with your foot much less eat it And the rough clothes with ballfringes  you would not care to set foot on them much less wear them
Lord you are kind and gentle to us so how can we reconcile such kindness and gentleness with unkindness and roughness
 Well then Uttara you arrange to supply food as I eat
and clothes such as I wear
Very good Lord said Uttara and he did so
And Prince Payasi because he had established his charity grudgingly not with his own hands and without proper concern like something casually tossed aside was reborn after his death at the breakingup of the body in the company of the Four Great Kings in the empty Serisaka mansion
But Uttara
who had given the charity ungrudgingly with his own hands and with proper concern not as something tossed aside was reborn after death at the breakingup of the body in a good place a heavenly realm in the company of the ThirtyThree Gods
Now at that time the Venerable Gavampati was accustomed to go to the empty Serisaka mansion for his midday rest
And Payasi of the devas went to the Venerable Gavampati saluted him and stood to one side
And the venerable Gavampati said to him as he stood there Who are you friend
 Lord I am Prince Payasi
Friend are you not the one who used to say There is no other world there are no spontaneously bom beings there is no fruit or result of good or evil deeds
 Yes Lord I am the one who used to say that
but I was converted from that evil view by the Noble Kumara Kassapa
And where has the young Brahmin Uttara who was in charge of the distribution of your charity been reborn 
Lord he who gave the charity ungrudgingly   was reborn in the company of the ThirtyThree Gods
but I who gave grudgingly have been reborn here in the empty Serisaka mansion
Lord please when you return to earth tell people to give ungrudgingly
and inform them of the way in which Prince Payasi
and the young Brahmin Uttara have been re bom
And so the Venerable Gavampati on his return to earth declared You should give ungrudgingly with your own hands with proper concern not carelessly
Prince Payasi did not do this and after death at the breakingup of the body he was reborn in the company of the Four Great Kings in the empty Serisaka mansion
whereas the administrator of his charity the young Brahmin Uttara who gave ungrudgingly with his own hands with proper concern and not carelessly was reborn in the company of the ThirtyThree Gods
 Thus have l heard Once the Lord was staying among the Mallas Anupiya is the name of a Malla town
and the Lord having dressed in the early morning and taken his robe and bowl went to Anupiya for alms
Then he thought It is too early for me to go into Anupiya for alms
Suppose I were to visit the hermitage of the wanderer Bhaggavagotta
And he did so
 And the wanderer Bhaggavagotta said Come Blessed Lord
welcome Blessed Lord
At last the Blessed Lord has gone out of his way to come here
Be seated Lord a seat is prepared
The Lord sat down on the prepared seat
and Bhaggava took a low stool and sat down to one side
Then he said Lord a few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me and said Bhaggava I have left the Blessed Lord
l am no longer under his rule
ls that really so Lord
lt is true Bhaggava
 A few days ago Sunakkhatta came to me saluted me sat down to one side
and said Lord I am leaving the Blessed Lord
I am no longer under the Lords rule
So l said to him Well Sunakkhatta did l ever say to you Come Sunakkhatta be under my rule
No Lord
Or did you ever say to me Lord I will be under your rule
No Lord
So Sunakkhatta if I did not say that to you
and you did not say that to me 
you foolish man who are you and what are you giving up
Consider foolish man how far the fault is yours 
 Well Lord you have not performed any miracles
And did l ever say to you Come under my rule Sunakkhatta and I will perform miracles for you
No Lord
Or did you ever say to me Lord I will be under your rule if you will perform miracles for me
No Lord
Then it appears Sunakkhatta that I made no such promises and you made no such conditions
Such being the case you foolish man who are you and what are you giving up
What do you think Sunakkhatta Whether miracles are performed or not  is it the purpose of my teaching Dhamma to lead whoever practises it to the total destruction of suffering
lt is Lord
 So Sunakkhatta whether mirlacles are performed or not the purpose of my teaching Dhamma is to lead whoever practises it to the total destruction of suffering
Then what purpose would the performance of miracles serve
Consider you foolish man how far the fault is yours 
 Well Lord you do not teach the beginning of things
 And did I ever say to you Come under my rule Sunakkhatta and I will teach you the beginning of things
 No Lord
 Such being the case you foolish man who are you and what are you giving up
 Sunakkhatta you have in many ways spoken in praise of me among the Vajjians saying This Blessed Lord is an Arahant a fullyenlightened Buddha endowed with wisdom and conduct the WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans the Buddha the Blessed Lord
In these ways you have spoken in praise of me among the Vajjians
 You have in many ways spoken in praise of the Dhamma saying Wellproclaimed by the Blessed Lord is the Dhamma visible here and now timeless inviting inspection leading onward to be realised by the wise each one for himself
In these ways you have spoken in praise of the Dhamma among the Vajjians
 You have in many ways spoken in praise of the order of monks saying Welltrained is the order of the Lords disciples trained in uprightness methodicallytrained excellentlytrained is the order of the Lords disciples that is the four pairs of men the eight classes of individuals This is the order of the Lords disciples worthy of respect worthy of homage worthy of gifts worthy of salutation an unsurpassed field in the world for merit
In these ways you have spoken in praise of the order among the Vajjians
And I say to you l declare to you Sunakkhatta
there will be those who will say Sunakkhatta the Licchavi was unable to maintain the holy life under the ascetic Gotama and being thus unable he abandoned the training and reverted to a base life
 That Sunakkhatta is what they will say
 And Bhaggava at my words Sunakkhatta left this Dhamma and discipline like one condemned to hell
 Once Bhaggava I was staying among the Khulus at a place called Uttaraka a town of theirs
In the early morning l went with robe and bowl into Uttaraka for alms with Sunakkhatta as my attendant
And at that time the naked ascetic Korakkhattiya the dogman was going round on all fours sprawling on the ground and chewing and eating his food with his mouth alone
Seeing him
Sunakkhatta thought Now that is a real Arahant ascetic who goes round on all fours sprawling on the ground and chewing and eating his food with his mouth alone
 And I knowing his thought in my own mind said to him You foolish man do you claim to be a follower of the Sakyan
 Lord what do you mean by this question
 Sunakkhatta did you not on seeing that naked ascetic going around on all fours think Now that is a real Arahant ascetic who goes round on all fours sprawling on the ground and chewing and eating his food with his mouth alone
 I did Lord
Does the Blessed Lord begrudge others their Arahantship
 l do not begrudge others their Arahantship you foolish man
lt is only in you that this evil view has arisen
Cast it aside lest it should be to your harm and sorrow for a long time
This naked ascetic Korakkhattiya whom you regard as a true Arahant
will die in seven days from indigestion
and when he is dead he will reappear among the Kalakanja asuras who are the very lowest grade of asuras
And when he is dead he will be cast aside on a heap of biranagrass in the chamelground
If you want to Sunakkhatta you can go to him and ask him if he knows his fate
And it may be that he will tell you Friend Sunakkhatta I know my fate I have been reborn among the Kalakanja asuras the very lowest grade of asuras
 Then Sunakkhatta went to Korakkhattiya and told him what I had prophesied
adding Therefore friend Korakkhattiya be very careful what you eat and drink
so that the ascetic Gotamas words may be proved wrong
And Sunakkhatta was so sure that the Tathagatas words would be proved wrong that he counted up the seven days one by one
But on the seventh day Korakkhattiya died of indigestion
and when he was dead he reappeared among the Kalakanja asuras
and his body was cast aside on a heap of biranagrass in the charnelground
 And Sunakkhatta heard of this
so he went to the heap of biranagrass in the charnelground where Korakkhattiya was lying struck the body three times with his hand and said Friend Korakkhattiya do you know your fate
 And Korakkhattiya sat up and rubbed his back with his hand and said
Friend Sunakkhatta I know my fate
I have been reborn among the Kalakanja asuras the very lowest grade of asuras And with that he fell back again
Then Sunakkhatta came to me saluted me and sat down to one side
And I said to him Well Sunakkhatta what do you think Has what I told you about the dogman Korakkhattiya come true or not
 It has come about the way you said Lord and not otherwise
 Well what do you think Sunakkhatta Has a miracle been performed or not
 Certainly Lord this being so a miracle has been performed and not otherwise
 Well then you foolish man do you still say to me after I have performed such a miracle Well Lord you have not performed any miracles
Consider you foolish man how far the fault is yours
 And at my words Sunakkhatta left this Dhamma and discipline like one condemned to hell
Once Bhaggava I was staying at Vesali at the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest
And at that time there was a naked ascetic living in Vesali called Kalaramutthaka who enjoyed great gains and fame in the Vajjian capital
He had undertaken seven rules of practice As long as I live l will be a naked ascetic and will not put on any clothes as long as I live I will remain chaste and abstain from sexual intercourse as long as I live I will subsist on strong drink and meat abstaining from boiled rice and sour milk
as long as I live l will never go beyond the Udena shrine to the east of Vesali the Gotamaka shrine to the south the Sattamba shrine to the west nor the Bahuputta shrine to the north
 And it was through having undertaken these seven rules that he enjoyed the greatest gains and fame of all in the Vajjian capital
Now Sunakkhatta went to see Kalaramutthaka and asked him a question
which he could not answer
and because he could not answer it he showed signs of anger rage and petulance
But Sunakkhatta thought I might cause this real Arahant ascetic offence
I dont want anything to happen that would be to my lasting harm and misfortune
Then Sunakkhatta came to me saluted me and sat down to one side
I said to him You foolish man do you claim to be a follower of the Sakyan 
Lord what do you mean by this question
 Sunakkhatta did you not go to see Kalaramutthaka
and ask him a question he could not answer
and did he not thereupon show signs of anger rage and petulance
And did you not think I might cause this real Arahant ascetic offence
I dont want anything to happen that would be to my lasting harm and misfortune
 l did Lord
Does the Blessed Lord begrudge others their Arahantship
 l do not begrudge others their Arahantship you foolish man It is only in you that this evil view has arisen Cast it aside
lest it should be to your hann and sorrow for a long time
This naked ascetic Kalaramutthaka whom you regard as a true Arahant will before long be living clothed and married subsisting on boiled rice and sour milk He will go beyond all the shrines of Vesali and will die having entirely lost his reputation
 And indeed all this came about
Then Sunakkhatta having heard what had happened came to me
 
And I said Well Sunakkhatta what do you think Has what I told you about Kalaramutthaka come about or not
 
Has a miracle been performed or not 
And at my words Sunakkhatta left this Dhamma and discipline like one condemned to hell
Once Bhaggava I was staying at Vesali in the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest
And at that time there was a naked ascetic living in Vesali called Patikaputta who enjoyed great gains and fame in the Vajjian capital
And he made this declaration in the assembly of Vesali The ascetic Gotama claims to be a man of wisdom and I make the same claim
It is right that a man of wisdom should show it by performing miracles
If the ascetic Gotama will come halfway to meet me l will do likewise
Then we could both work miracles
and if the ascetic Gotama performs one miracle l will perform two
If he performs two I will perform four
And if he performs four I will perform eight
However many miracles the ascetic Gotama performs l will perform twice as many
Then Sunakkhatta came to me saluted me sat down to one side and told me what Patikaputta had said
I said Sunakkhatta that naked ascetic Patikaputta is not capable of meeting me face to face unless he takes back his words abandons that thought and gives up that view
And if he thinks otherwise his head will split in pieces
Lord let the Blessed Lord have a care what he says let the WellFarer have a care what he says
What do you mean by saying that to me 
Lord the Blessed Lord might make an absolute statement about Patikaputtas coming
But he might come in some altered shape and thus falsify the Blessed Lords words
 But Sunakkhatta would the Tathagata make any statement that was ambiguous
 Lord does the Blessed Lord know by his own mind what would happen to Patikaputta
Or has some deva told the Tathagata
 Sunakkhatta I know it by my own mind
and I have also been told by a deva
For Ajita the general of the Licchavis died the other day and has been reborn in the company of the ThirtyThree Gods
He came to see me and told me Lord Patikaputta the naked ascetic is an impudent liar
He declared in the Vajjian capital Ajita the general of the Licchavis has been reborn in the great hell
But I have not been reborn in the great hell but in the company of the ThirtyThree Gods
He is an impudent liar

 Thus Sunakkhatta I know what I have said by my own mind but I have also been told by a deva
And now Sunakkhatta I will go into Vesali for alms On my return after I have eaten I will go for my midday rest to Patikaputtas park
You may tell him whatever you wish
Then having dressed I took my robe and bowl and went into Vesali for alms
On my return I went to Patikaputtas park for my midday rest
Meanwhile Sunakkhatta rushed into Vesali and declared to all the prominent Licchavis Friends the Blessed Lord has gone into Vesali for alms and after that he has gone for his midday rest to Patikaputtas park
Come along friends come along the two great ascetics are going to work miracles
And all the prominent Licchavis thought The two great ascetics are going to work miracles Let us go along
And he went to the distinguished and wealthy Brahmins and householders and to the ascetics and Brahmins of various schools
and told them the same thing and they too thought Let us go along
And so all these people came along to Patikaputtas park hundreds and thousands of them
And Patikaputta heard that all these people had come to his park
and that the ascetic Gotama had gone there for his midday rest
And at the news he was overcome with fear and trembling and his hair stood on end
And thus terrified and trembling his hair standing on end he made for the Tinduka lodging of the wanderers
When the assembled company heard that he had gone to the Tinduka lodging
they instructed a man to go there to Patikaputta and say to him
Friend Patikaputta come along All these people have come to your park and the ascetic Gotama has gone there for his midday rest Because you declared to the assembly at Vesali The ascetic Gotama claims to be a man of wisdom and I make the same claim
However many miracles he performs I will perform twice as many
So now come halfway the ascetic Gotama has already come halfway to meet you and is sitting for his midday rest in Your Reverences park
The man went and delivered the message and
on hearing it Patikaputta said Im coming friend coming but wriggle as he might he could not get up from his seat
Then the man said Whats the matter with you friend Patikaputta Is your bottom stuck to the seat or is the seat stuck to your bottom
You keep saying Im coming friend Im coming but you only wriggle and cant get up from your seat
 And even at these words Patikaputta still wriggled about but could not rise
And when that man realised that Patikaputta could not help himself he went back to the assembly and reported the situation
And then I said to them Patikaputta the naked ascetic is not capable of meeting me face to face unless he takes back his words abandons that thought and gives up that view
And if he thinks otherwise his head will split in pieces 
End of first recitationsection
 Then Bhaggava one of the ministers of the Licchavis rose from his seat and said Well gentlemen just wait a little till I have been
to see whether I can bring Patikaputta to the assembly
 So he went to the Tinduka lodging and said to Patikaputta
Come along Patikaputta it is best for you to come All these people have come to your park
and the ascetic Gotama has gone there for his midday rest
If you come we will make you the winner and let the ascetic Gotama be defeated
 And Patikaputta said Im coming friend Im coming but wriggle as he might he could not get up from his seat
 
 So the minister returned to the assembly and reported on the situation
Then I said Patikaputta is not capalble of meeting me
 
Even if the good Licchavis were to think Let us bind him with thongs and try to drag him with yoked oxen he would burst the thongs
He is not capable of meeting me face to face

  Then Jaliya a pupil of the woodenbowl ascetic rose from his seat
went to the Tinduka lodging and said to Patikaputta Come along Patikaputta
if you come we will make you the winner and let the ascetic Gotama be defeated
 And Patikaputta said lm coming friend lm coming but wriggle as he might he could not get up from his seat
 Then when Jaliya realised the situation he said
Patikaputta once long ago the lion king of beasts thought Suppose I were to make my lair near a certain jungle
Then I could emerge in the evening yawn survey the four quarters roar my lions roar three times and then make for the cattlepasture
I could then pick out the very best of the herd for my kill and having had a good feast of tender meat return to my lair
 And he did accordingly
 Now there was an old jackal who had grown fat on the lions leavings and he was proud and strong
And he thought What difference is there between me and the lion king of beasts
Suppose I were to make my lair near the jungle
 
 So he chose a lair accordingly
and emerging in the evening he surveyed the four quarters and then thought Now I will roar a lions roar three times  and he gave out the howl of his kind a jackal howl For what has the wretched howl of a jackal in common with a lions roar
In just the same way Patikaputta you live off the achievements of the WellFarer and feed on the WellFarers leavings imagining you can set yourself up beside the Tathagatas Arahants and fullyenlightened Buddhas
But what have wretched Patikaputtas in common with them
  Then being unable even with the aid of this parable to get Patikaputta to rise from his seat Jaliya
uttered this verse
Thinking himself a lion the jackal says
Im the king of beasts and tries to roar
A lions roar but only howls instead
Lion is lion and jackal jackal still
In just the same way Patikaputta you are living off the achievements of the WellFarer
 And being unable even with the aid of this parable to get Patikaputta to rise from his seat Jaliya
uttered this verse
Following anothers tracks and fed On scraps his jackalnature
he forgets Thinking Im a tiger tries to roar
A mighty roar but only howls instead
Lion is lion and jackals jackal still
In just the same way Patikaputta you are living off the achievements of the WellFarer
And being unable even with this parable to get Patikaputta to rise from his seat
Jaliya uttered this verse
Gorged on frogs and mice from threshingfloors
And corpses cast aside in charnelgrounds
In lonely forests wild the jackal thinks
Im the king of beasts and tries to roar
A lions roar but only howls instead
Lion is lion and jackals jackal still
In just the same way Patikaputta you are living off the achievements of the WellFarer feeding on the WellFarers leavings imagine you can set yourself up beside the Tathagatas Arahants and fullenlightened Buddhas
But what have wretched Patikaputtas in common with them
  Then being unable even with this parable to get Patikaputta to rise from his seat
Jaliya returned to the assembly and reported on the situation
Then I said Paticaputta is not capable of meeting me face to face unless he takes back his words abandons that thought and gives up that view
 
Even if the good Licchavis were to think Let us bind him with thongs and try to drag him here with yoked oxen
he would burst the thongs
He is not capable of meeting me face to face
If he thinks otherwise his head will split in pieces
Then Bhaggava I instructed inspired fired and delighted that assembly with a talk on Dhamma And having thereby delivered that company from the great bondage thus rescuing eightyfour thousand beings from the great path of peril I entered into the fireelement and rose into the air to the height of seven palmtrees and projecting a beam for the height of another seven so that it blazed and shed fragrance I then reappeared in the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest
And there Sunakkhatta came to me saluted me and sat down to one side
I said What do you think Sunakkhatta Has what I told you about Patikaputta come about or not
 It has Lord
 And has a miracle been performed or not
 It has Lord
 Well then you foolish man do you still say to me after I have performed such a miracle Well Lord you have not performed any miracles
Consider you foolish man how far the fault is yours
 And Bhaggava at my words Sunakkhatta left this Dhamma and discipline like one condemned to hell
Bhaggava I know the first beginning of things
and l know not only that but what surpasses it in value And I am not under the sway of what I know and not being under its sway I have come to know for myself that quenching by the realisation of which the Tathagata cannot fall into perilous paths
There are Bhaggava some ascetics and Brahmins who declare as their doctrine that all things began with the creation by a god or Brahma
I have gone to them and said Reverend sirs is it true that you declare that all things began with the creation by a god or Brahma
 Yes they replied
Then I asked In that case how do the reverend teachers declare that this came about
 But they could not give an answer and so they asked me in return
And I replied
  There comes a time friends sooner or later after a long period when this world contracts
Beings are born in the Abhassara Brahma world
and stay there a long time
When this world expands one being falls from there
and arises in an empty Brahma palace
He longs for company other beings appear
and he and they believe he created them 
That Reverend Sirs is how it comes about that you teach that all things began with the creation by a god or Brahma
 And they said We have heard this Reverend Gotama as you have explained
 But I know the first beginning of things
and not being under the sway of what I know I have come to know that quenching by the realisation
of which the Tathagata cannot fall into perilous ways
There are some ascetics and Brahmins who declare that the beginning of things was due to corruption by pleasure
I went to them and asked them if this was their view
Yes they replied
I asked them how this came about
and when they could not explain I said
There are friends certain devas called Corrupted by Pleasure
They spend an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment
their mindfulness lapses and they fall away 
That Reverend Sirs is how it comes about that you teach that the beginning of things was due to corruption by pleasure
 And they said We have heard this Reverend Gotama as you have explained

There are some ascetics and Brahmins who declare that the beginning of things was due to corruption of mind
I went to them and asked them if this was their view
Yes they replied
I asked them how this came about
and when they could not explain
I said
There are friends certain devas called Corrupted in Mind
They spend an excessive amount of time regarding each other with envy
their minds become corrupted and they fall away 
That Reverend Sits is how it comes about that you teach that the beginning of things was due to corruption of mind
 And they said We have heard this Reverend Gotama as you have explained
There are Bhaggava some ascetics and Brahmins who declare that the beginning of things was due to chance
I went to them and asked them if this was their view
Yes they replied
I asked them how this came about
and when they could not explain
I said
There are friends certain devas called Unconscious
As soon as a perception arises in them those devas fall from that realm
remembering nothing 
they think Now from nonbeing I have been brought to being 
That Reverend Sirs is how it comes about that you teach that the beginning of things was due to chance
 And they said We have heard this Reverend Gotama as you have explained
 But I know the first beginning of things and I know not only that but what surpasses it in value And I am not under the sway of what I know and not being under its sway I have come to know for myself that quenching
by the realisation of which the Tathagata cannot fall into perilous paths
And I Bhaggava who teach this and declare this am wrongly vainly lyingly and falsely accused by some ascetics and Brahmins who say The ascetic Gotama is on the wrong track and so are his monks
He has declared that whoever has attained to the stage of deliverance called the Beautiful finds everything repulsive
 But I do not say this
What l say is that whenever anyone has attained to the stage of deliverance called the Beautiful he knows that it is beautiful
Indeed Lord they are on the wrong track themselves who accuse the Lord and his monks of error
I am so delighted with the Lord
that I think the Lord is able to teach me to attain and remain in the deliverance called the Beautiful
It is hard for you Bhaggava holding different views being of different inclinations and subject to different influences following a different discipline and having had a different teacher to attain and remain in the deliverance called the Beautiful
You must strive hard putting your trust in me Bhaggava
 Lord even if it is hard for me to attain and remain in the deliverance called the Beautiful
still l will place my trust in the Lord
Thus the Lord spoke
and Bhaggava the wanderer was delighted and rejoiced at the Lords words
Thus have I heard  Once the Lord was staying among the Magadhans at Matula
Then he said Monks
Lord they replied
and the Lord said Monks be islands unto yourselves be a refuge unto yourselves with no other refuge Let the Dhamma be your island let the Dhamma be your refuge with no other refuge
And how does a monk dwell as an island unto himself as a refuge unto himself with no other refuge with the Dhamma as his island with the Dhamma as his refuge with no other refuge
Here a monk abides contemplating body as body ardent clearly aware and mindful having put aside hankering and fretting for the world
he abides contemplating feelings as feelings he abides contemplating mind as mind he abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects ardent clearly aware and mindful having put aside hankering and fretting for the world
Keep to your own preserves monks to your ancestral haunts
If you do so then Mara will find no lodgement no foothold
It is just by the buildingup of wholesome states that this merit increases
Once monks there was a wheelturning monarch named Dalhanemi a righteous monarch of the law conqueror of the four quarters who had established the security of his realm and was possessed of the seven treasures
These are the Wheel Treasure the Elephant Treasure the Horse Treasure the Jewel Treasure the Woman Treasure the Householder Treasurer and as seventh the Counsellor Treasure
He has more than a thousand sons who are heroes of heroic stature conquerors of the hostile army
He dwells having conquered this seagirt land without stick or sword by the law 
  And after many hundreds and thousands of years King Dalhanemi said to a certain man My good man whenever you see that the sacred WheelTreasure has slipped from its position report it to me
Yes sire the man replied
And after many hundreds and thousands of years the man saw that the sacred WheelTreasure had slipped from its position Seeing this he reported the fact to the King
Then King Dalhanemi sent for his eldest son the crown prince and said My son the sacred WheelTreasure has slipped from its position
And I have heard say that when this happens to a wheel turning monarch he has not much longer to live
I have had my fill of human pleasures now is the time to seek heavenly pleasures
You my son take over control of this oceanbounded land
I will shave off my hair and beard don yellow robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness
And having installed his eldest son in due fprm as king King Dalhanemi shaved off his hair and beard donned yellow robes and went forth from the household life into homelessness
And seven days after the royal sage had gone forth the sacred WheelTreasure vanished
Then a certain man came to the anointed Khattiya King and said Sire you should know that the sacred WheelTreasure has disappeared
At this the King was grieved and felt sad
He went to the royal sage and told him the news
And the royal sage said to him My son you should not grieve or feel sad at the disappearance of the WheelTreasure The WheelTreasure is not an heirloom from your fathers
But now my son you must turn yourself into an Ariyan wheel tumer
And then it may come about that if you perform the duties of an Ariyan wheelturning monarch on the fast day of the fifteenth when you have washed your head and gone up to the verandah on top of your palace for the fast day the sacred WheelTreasure will appear to you thousand spoked complete with felloe hub and all appurtenances
But what sire is the duty of an Ariyan wheelturning monarch
 It is this my son Yourself depending on the Dhamma honouring it revering it cherishing it doing homage to it and venerating it having the Dhamma as your badge and banner acknowledging the Dhamma as your master you should establish guard ward and protection according to Dhamma for your own household your troops your nobles and vassals for Brahmins and householders town and country folk ascetics and Brahmins for beasts and birds
Let no crime prevail in your kingdom
and to those who are in need give property
And whatever ascetics and Brahmins in your kingdom have renounced the life of sensual infatuation and are devoted to forbearance and gentleness each one taming himself each one calming himself and each one striving for the end of craving if from time to time they should come to you and consult you as to what is wholesome and what is unwholesome what is blameworthy and what is blameless what is to be followed and what is not to be followed and what action will in the long run lead to harm and sorrow and what to welfare and happiness
you should listen and tell them to avoid evil and do what is good
That my son is the duty of an Ariyan wheelturning monarch
Yes sire said the King and he performed the duties of an Ariyan wheelturning monarch
And as he did so on the fastday of the fifteenth when he had washed his head and gone up to the verandah on top of his palace for the fastday the sacred WheelTreasure appeared to him thousandspoked complete with felloe hub and all appurtenances
Then the King thought I have heard that when a duly anointed Khattiya king sees such a wheel on the fastday of the fifteenth he will become a wheelturning monarch
May I become such a monarch
Then rising from his seat covering one shoulder with his robe the King took a gold vessel in his left hand sprinkled the Wheel with his right hand and said May the noble WheelTreasure turn may the noble WheelTreasure conquer
The Wheel turned to the east and the King followed it with his fourfold army
And in whatever country the Wheel stopped the King took up residence with his fourfold army
And those who opposed him in the eastern region came and said Come Your Majesty welcome We are yours Your Majesty Rule us Your Majesty
And the King said Do not take life Do not take what is not given Do not commit sexual misconduct Do not tell lies Do not drink strong drink Be moderate in eating
And those who had opposed him in the eastern region became his subjects
Then the Wheel turned south west and north 
Then the WheelTreasure having conquered the lands from sea to sea returned to the royal dapital and stopped before the Kings palace as he was trying a case as if to adorn the royal palace
And a second wheelturning monarch did likewise and a third a fourth a fifth a sixth and a seventh king also told a man to see if the Wheel had slipped from its position 
And seven days after the royal sage had gone forth the Wheel disappeared
Then a man came to the King and said Sire you should know that the sacred WheelTreasure has disappeared
At this the King was grieved and felt sad
But he did not go to the royal sage and ask him about the duties of a wheel turning monarch
Instead he ruled the people according to his own ideas
and being so ruled the people did not prosper so well as they had done under the previous kings who had performed the duties of a wheelturning monarch
Then the ministers counsellors treasury officials guards and doorkeepers and the chanters of mantras came to the King and said Sire as long as you rule the people according to your own ideas and differently from the way they were ruled before under previous wheelturning monarchs the people do not prosper so well
Sire there are ministers in your realm including ourselves who have preserved the knowledge of how a wheelturning monarch should rule
Ask us Your Majesty
and we will tell you
Then the King ordered all the ministers and others to come together and he consulted them
And they explained to him the duties of a wheelturning monarch
And having listened to them the King established guard and protection but he did not give property to the needy
and as a result poverty became rife
With the spread of poverty a man took what was not given thus committing what was called theft
They arrested him
and brought him before the King saying Your Majesty this man took what was not given which we call theft
The King said to him Is it true that you took what was not given  which is called theft
 It is Your Majesty
Why
 Your Majesty I have nothing to live on
Then the King gave the man some property saying With this my good man you can keep yourself support your mother and father keep a wife and children carry on a business and make gifts to ascetics and Brahmins which will promote your spiritual welfare and lead to a happy rebirth with pleasant result in the heavenly sphere
Very good Your Majesty replied the man
And exactly the same thing happened with another man
Then people heard that the King was giving away property to those who took what was not given
and they thought Suppose we were to do likewise
And then another man took what was not given
and they brought him before the King
The King asked him why he had done this
and he replied Your Majesty I have nothing to live on
Then the King thought If I give property to everybody who takes what is not given this theft will increase more and more
I had better make an end of him finish him off once for all and cut his head off
So he commanded his men Bind this mans arms tightly behind him with a strong rope shave his head closely and lead him to the rough sound of a drum through the streets and squares and out through the southern gate and there finish by inflicting the capital penalty and cutting off his head
And they did so
Hearing about this people thought Now let us get sharp swords made for us and then we can take from anybody what is not given which is called theft we will make an end of them finish them off once for all and cut off their heads
So having procured some sharp swords they launched murderous assaults on villages towns and cities and went in for highwayrobbery
killing their victims by cutting off their heads
Thus from the not giving of property to the needy poverty became rife from the growth of poverty the taking of what was not given increased from the increase of theft the use of weapons increased from the increased use of weapons the taking of life increased  and from the increase in the taking of life peoples lifespan decreased their beauty decreased
and as a result of this decrease of lifespan and beauty the children of those whose lifespan had been eighty thousand years lived for only forty thousand
And a man of the generation that lived for forty thousand years took what was not given
He was brought before the King
who asked him Is it true that you took what was not given  what is called theft
 No Your Majesty he replied thus telling a deliberate lie
Thus from the not giving of property to the needy
the taking of life increased and from the taking of life lying increased from the increase in lying peoples lifespan decreased their beauty decreased
and as a result the children of those whose lifespan had been forty thousand years lived for only twenty thousand
And a man of the generation that lived for twenty thousand years took what was not given
Another man denounced him to the King saying Sire suchandsuch a man has taken what was not given thus speaking evil of another
Thus from the not giving of property to the needy
the speaking evil of others increased and in consequence peoples lifespan decreased their beauty decreased
and as a result the children of those whose lifespan had been twenty thousand years lived only for ten thousand
And of the generation that lived for ten thousand years some were beautiful and some were ugly
And those who were ugly being envious of those who were beautiful committed adultery with others wives
Thus from the not giving of property to the needy
 sexual misconduct increased and in consequence peoples lifespan decreased their beauty decreased
and as a result the children of those whose lifespan had been ten thousand years lived for only five thousand
And among the generation whose lifespan was five thousand years two things increased harsh speech and idle chatter
in consequence of which peoples lifespan decreased their beauty decreased
and as a result the children of those whose lifespan had been five thousand years lived some for twoandahalf thousand years and some for only two thousand
And among the generation whose lifespan was twoanda half thousand years covetousness and hatred increased
and in consequence peoples lifespan decreased their beauty decreased
and as a result the children of those whose lifespan had been twoandahalf thousand years lived for only a thousand
Among the generation whose lifespan was a thousand years false opinions increased
and as a result the children of those whose lifespan had been a thousand years lived for only five hundred
And among the generation whose lifespan was five hundred years three things increased
incest excessive greed and deviant practices
 and as a result the children of those whose lifespan had been five hundred years lived some for two hundred and fifty years some for only two hundred
And among those whose lifespan was two hundred and fifty years these things increased
lack of respect for mother and father for ascetics and Brahmins and for the head of the clan
Thus from the not giving of property to the needy
lack of respect for mother and father for ascetics and Brahmins and for the head of the clan increased
and in consequence peoples lifespan and beauty decreased
and the children of those whose lifespan had been twoandahalf centuries lived for only a hundred years
Monks a time will come when the children of these people will have a lifespan of ten years
And with them girls will be marriageable at five years old
And with them these flavours will disappear ghee butter sesameoil molasses and salt
Among them kudrusagrainb will be the chief food
just as rice and curry are today
And with them the ten courses of moral conduct will completely disappear and the ten courses of evil will prevail exceedingly
for those of a tenyear lifespan there will be no word for moral so how can there be anyone who acts in a moral way
Those people who have no respect for mother or father for ascetics and Brahmins for the head of the clan will be the ones who enjoy honour and prestige
Just as it is now the people whoshow respect for mother and father for ascetics and Brahmins for the head of the clan who are praised and honoured so it will be with those who do the opposite
Among those of a tenyear lifespan no account will be taken of mother or aunt of mothers sisterinlaw of teachers wife or of ones fathers wives and so on 
all will be promiscuous in the world like goats and sheep fowl and pigs dogs and jackals
Among them fierce enmity will prevail one for another fierce hatred fierce anger and thoughts of killing
mother against child and child against mother father against child and child against father brother against brother brother against sister
just as the hunter feels hatred for the beast he stalks
And for those of a tenyear lifespan there will come to be a swordinterval of seven days
during which they will mistake one another for wild beasts
Sharp swords will appear in their hands
and thinking There is a wild beast they will take each others lives with those swords
But there will be some beings who will think Let us not kill or be killed by anyone Let us make for some grassy thickets or junglerecesses or clumps of trees for rivers hard to ford or inaccessible mountains and live on roots and fruits of the forest
And this they will do for seven days
Then at the end of the sever days they will emerge from their hidingplaces and rejoice together of one accord saying Good beings I see that you are alive
And then the thought will occur to those beings It is only because we became addicted to evil ways that we suffered this loss of our kindred
so let us now do good
What good things can we do
Let us abstain from the taking of life that will be a good practice
And so they will abstain from the taking of life and having undertaken this good thing will practise it
And through having undertaken such wholesome things they will increase in lifespan and beauty
And the children of those whose lifespan was ten years will live for twenty years
Then it will occur to those beings It is through having taken to wholesome practices that we have increased in lifespan and beauty
so let us perform still more wholesome practices
Let us refrain from taking what is not given from sexual misconduct from lying speech from slander from harsh speech from idle chatter from covetousness from illwill from wrong views let us abstain from three things incest excessive greed and deviant practices let us respect our mothers and fathers ascetics and Brahmins and the head of the clan and let us persevere in these wholesome actions
And so they will do these things
and on account of this they will increase in lifespan and in beauty
The children of those whose lifespan is twenty years will live to be forty their children will live to be eighty their children to be a hundred and sixty their children to be three hundred and twenty their children to be six hundred and forty
the children of those whose lifespan is six hundred and forty years will live for two thousand years their children for four thousand their children for eight thousand and their children for twenty thousandThe children of those whose lifespan is twenty thousand years will live to be forty thousand and their children will attain to eighty thousand years  Among the people with an eighty thousandyear lifespan girls will become marriageable at five hundred
And such people will know only three kinds of disease greed fasting and old age
And in the time of those people this continent of Jambudipa will be powerful and prosperous and villages towns and cities will be but a cocks flight one from the next
This Jambudipa like Avici will be as thick with people as the jungle is thick with reeds and rushes
At that time the Varanasi of today will be a royal city called Ketumati powerful and prosperous crowded with people and wellsupplied
In Jambudipa there will be eightyfour thousand cities headed by Ketumati as the royal capital
And in the time of the people with an eighty thousand year lifespan there will arise in the capital city of Ketumati a king called Sankha a wheelturning monarch a righteous monarch of the law conqueror of the four quarters
And in that time of the people with an eighty thousand year lifespan there will arise in the world a Blessed Lord an Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha named Metteyya endowed with wisdom and conduct a WellFarer Knower of the worlds incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed Teacher of gods and humans enlightened and blessed
just as I am now
He will thoroughly know by his own superknowledge and prodaim this universe with its devas and maras and Brahmas its ascetics and Brahmins and this generation with its princes and people just as I do now
He will teach the Dhamma lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle lovely in its ending in the spirit and in the letter and proclaim just as I do now the holy life in its fullness and purity
He will be attended by a company of thousands of monks just as I am attended by a company of hundreds
Then King Sankha will reerect the palace once built by King MahaPanada
and having lived in it will give it up and present it to the ascetics and Brahmins the beggars the wayfarers the destitute Then shaving off hair and beard he will don yellow robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness under the supreme Buddha Metteyya
Having gone forth he will remain alone in seclusion ardent eager and resolute and before long he will have attained in this very life by his own superknowledge and resolution that unequalled goal of the holy life for the sake of which young men of good family go forth from the household life into homelessness and will abide therein
Monks be islands unto yourselves be a refuge unto yourselves with no other refuge Let the Dhamma be your island let the Dhamma be your refuge with no other refuge
And how does a monk dwell as an island unto himself 
Here a monk abides contemplating body as body ardent clearly aware and mindful having put aside hankering and fretting for the world
he abides contemplating feelings as feelings he abides contemplating mind as mind he abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects ardent clearly aware and mindful having put aside hankering and fretting for the world
Keep to your own preserves monks to your ancestral haunts
If you do so your lifespan will increase your beauty will increase your happiness will increase your wealth will increase your power will increase
And what is length of life for a monk
Here a monk develops the road to power which is concentration of intention accompanied by effort of will the road to power which is concentration of energy the road to power which is concentration of consciousness the road to power which is concentration of investigation accompanied by effort of will
By frequently practising these four roads to power he can if he wishes live for a full century or the remaining part of a century
That is what I call length of life for a monk
And what is beauty for a monk
Here a monk practises right conduct is restrained according to the discipline is perfect in behaviour and habits sees danger in the slightest fault and trains in the rules of training he has undertaken
That is beauty for a monk
And what is happiness for a monk
Here a monk detached from sensedesires enters the first jhana
the second third fourth jhana purified by equanimity and mindfulness
That is happiness for a monk
And what is wealth for a monk
Here a monk with his heart filled with lovingkindness dwells suffusing one quarter the second
the third
the fourth
Thus he dwells suffusing the whole world upwards downwards across  everywhere always with a mind filled with lovingkindness abundant unbounded without hate or illwill
Then with his heart filled with compassion with his heart filled with sympathetic joy with his heart filled with equanimity
he dwells suffusing the whole world upwards downwards across everywhere always with a mind filled with equanimity abundant unbounded without hate or illwill
That is wealth for a monk
And what is power for a monk
Here a monk by the destruction of the corruptions enters into and abides in that cor ruptionless liberation of heart and liberation by wisdom which he has attained in this very life by his own superknowledge and realisation
That is power for a monk
Monks I do not consider any power so hard to conquer as the power of Mara
It is just by this buildingup of wholesome states that this merit increases 
Thus the Lord spoke
and the monks were delighted and rejoiced at his words
THUS HAVE I HEARD Once the Lord was staying at Savatthi at the mansion of Migaras mother in the East Park
And at that time Vasettha and Bharadvaja were living among the monks hoping to become monks themselves
And in the evening the Lord rose from his secluded meditation and came out of the mansion and started walking up and down in its shade
Vasettha noticed this
and he said to Bharadvaja Friend Bharadvaja the Lord has come out and is walking up and down
Let us approach him We might be fortunate enough to hear a talk on Dhamma from the Lord himself
 Yes indeed said Bharadvaja
so they went up to the Lord saluted him and fell into step with him
Then the Lord said to Vasettha Vasettha you two are Brahmins bom and bred and you have gone forth from the household life into homelessness from Brahmin families Do not the Brahmins revile and abuse you
Indeed Lord the Brahmins do revile and abuse us They dont hold back with their usual flood of reproaches
 Well Vasettha what kind of reproaches do they fling at you
 Lord what the Brahmins say is this The Brahmin caste is the highest caste other castes are base
the Brahmin caste is fair other castes are dark
Brahmins are purified nonBrahmins are not
the Brahmins are the true children of Brahma born from his mouth bom of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of Brahma
And you you have deserted the highest class and gone over to the base class of shaveling petty ascetics servants dark fellows bom of Brahmas foot
Its not right its not proper for you to mix with such people
That is the way the Brahmins abuse us Lord
Then Vasettha the Brahmins have forgotten their ancient tradition when they say that
Because we can see Brahmin women the wives of Brahmins who menstruate and become pregnant have babies and give suck
And yet these wombbom Brahmins talk about being born from Brahmas mouth  
These Brahmins misrepresent Brahma tell lies and earn much demerit
There are Vasettha these four castes the Khattiyas the Brahmins the merchants and the artisans
And sometimes a Khattiya takes life takes what is not given commits sexual misconduct tells lies indulges in slander harsh speech or idle chatter is grasping malicious or of wrong views
Thus such things as are immoral and considered so blameworthy and considered so to be avoided and considered so ways unbefitting an Ariyan and considered so black with black result and blamed by the wise are sometimes to be found among the Khattiyas and the same applies to Brahmins merchants and artisans
Sometimes too a Khattiya refrains from taking life is not grasping malicious or of wrong views
Thus such things as are moral and considered so blameless and considered so to be followed and considered so ways befitting an Ariyan and considered so bright with bright results and praised by the wise are sometimes to be found among the Khattiyas and likewise among Brahmins merchants and artisans
Now since both dark and bright qualities which are blamed and praised by the wise are scattered indiscriminately among the four castes
the wise do not recognise the claim about the Brahmin caste being the highest
Why is that
Because Vasettha anyone from the four castes who becomes a monk an Arahant who has destroyed the corruptions who has lived the life done what had to be done laid down the burden reached the highest goal destroyed the fetter of becoming and become emancipated through superknowledge  he is proclaimed supreme by virtue of Dhamma and not of nonDhamma
Dhammas the best thing for people In this life and the next as well
This illustration will make clear to you how Dhamma is best in this world and in the next
King Pasenadi of Kosala knows The ascetic Gotama has gone forth from the neighbouring clan of the Sakyans
Now the Sakyans are vassals of the King of Kosala
They offer him humble service and salute him rise and do him homage and pay him fitting service
And just as the Sakyans offer the King humble service   so likewise does the King offer humble service to the Tathagata thinking If the ascetic Gotama is wellborn I am ill born
if the ascetic Gotama is strong I am weak
if the ascetic Gotama is pleasant to look at I am illfavoured
if the ascetic Gotama is influential I am of little influence
Now it is because of honouring the Dhamma making much of the Dhamma esteeming the Dhamma doing reverent honciage to the Dhamma that King Pasenadi does humble service to the Tathagata and pays him fitting service
Dhammas the best thing for people In this life and the next as well
Vasettha all of you though of different birth name clan and family who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness
if you are asked who you are should reply We are ascetics followers of the Sakyan
He whose faith in the Tathagata is settled rooted established solid unshake able by any ascetic or Brahmin any deva or mara or Brahma or anyone in the world can truly say I am a true son of Blessed Lord born of his mouth born of Dhamma created by Dhamma an heir of Dhamma
Why is that
Because Vasettha this designates the Tathagata The Body of Dhamma that is The Body of Brahma or Become Dhamma that is Become Brahma
There comes a time Vasettha when sooner or later after a long period this world contracts
At a time of contraction beings are mostly born in the Abhassara Brahma world
And there they dwell mindmade feeding on delight selfluminous moving through the air glorious  and they stay like that for a very long time
But sooner or later after a very long period this world begins to expand again
At a time of expansion the beings from the Abhassara Brahma world having passed away from there are mostly reborn in this world
Here they dwell mindmade feeding on delight self luminous moving through the air glorious  and they stay like that for a very long time
At that period Vasettha there was just one mass of water and all was darkness blinding darkness
Neither moon nor sun appeared no constellations or stars appeared night and day were not distinguished nor months and fortnights no years or seasons and no male and female beings being reckoned just as beings
And sooner or later after a very long period of time savoury earth spread itself over the waters where those beings were It looked just like the skin that forms itself over hot milk as it cools
It was endowed with colour smell and taste It was the colour of fine ghee or butter
and it was very sweet like pure wild honey
Then some being of a greedy nature said I say what can this be  and tasted the savoury earth on its finger
In so doing it became taken with the flavour and craving arose in it
Then other beings taking their cue from that one also tasted the stuff with their fingers
They too were taken with the flavour and craving arose in them
So they set to with their hands breaking off pieces of the stuff in order to eat it
And the result of this
was that their selfluminance disappeared
And as a result of the disappearance of their selfluminance the moon and the sun appeared
night and day were distinguished
months and fortnights appeared
and the year and its seasons
To that extent the world reevolved
And those beings continued for a very long time feasting on this savoury earth feeding on it and being nourished by it
And as they did so their bodies became coarser and a difference in looks developed among them
Some beings became goodlooking others ugly
And the goodlooking ones despised the others saying We are betterlooking than they are
 And because they became arrogant and conceited about their looks the savoury earth disappeared
At this they came together and lamented
crying Oh that flavour Oh that flavour
And so nowadays when people say Oh that flavour when they get something nice
they are repeating an ancient saying without realising it
And then when the savoury earth had disappeared a fungus cropped up
in the manner of a mushroom
It was of a good colour smell and taste It was the colour of fine ghee or butter
and it was very sweet like pure wild honey
And those beings set to and ate the fungus
And this lasted for a very long time
And as they continued to feed on the fungus so their bodies became coarser still and the difference in their looks increased still more
And the goodlooking ones despised the others
And because they became arrogant and conceited about their looks the sweet fungus disappeared
Next creepers appeared shooting up like bamboo
 and they too were very sweet like pure wild honey
And those beings set to and fed on those creepers
And as they did so their bodies became even coarser and the difference in their looks increased still more
And they became still more arrogant and so the creepers disappeared too
At this they came together
and lamented crying Alas our creepers gone What have we lost
And so now today when people on being asked why they are upset say Oh what have we lost
they are repeating an ancient saying without realising it
And then after the creepers had disappeared rice appeared in open spaces free from powder and from husks fragrant and cleangrained
And what they had taken in the evening for supper had grown again and was ripe in the morning
and what they had taken in the morning for breakfast was ripe again by evening with no sign of reaping
And these beings set to and fed on this rice and this lasted for a very long time
And as they did so their bodies became coarser still and the difference in their looks became even greater And the females developed female sexorgans and the males developed male organs
And the women became excessively preoccupied with men and the men with women
Owing to this excessive preoccupation with each other passion was aroused and their bodies burnt with lust
And later because of this burning they indulged in sexual activity
But those who saw them indulging threw dust ashes or cowdung at them crying Die you filthy beast
How can one being do such things to another
Just as today in some districts when a daughterinlaw is led out some people throw dirt at her some ashes and some cowdung
without realising that they are repeating an ancient observance
What was considered bad form in those days is now considered good form
And those beings who in those days indulged in sex were not allowed into a village or town for one or two months
Accordingly those who indulged for an excessively long period in such immoral practices
began to build themselves dwellings so as to indulge under cover
Now it occurred to one of those beings who was inclined to laziness Well now why should I be bothered to gather rice in the evening for supper and in the morning for breakfast
Why shouldnt I gather it all at once for both meals
And he did so
Then another one came to him and said Come on lets go ricegathering
No need my friend Ive gathered enough for both meals
 Then the other following his example gathered enough rice for two days at a time saying
That should be about enough
 Then another being came and said to that second one Come on lets go ricegathering
 No need my friend Ive gathered enough for two days
 
However when those beings made a store of rice and lived on that
huskpowder and husk began to envelop the grain and where it was reaped it did not grow again and the cut place showed and the rice grew in separate clusters
And then those beings came together lamenting Wicked ways have become rife among us
at first we were mindmade feeding on delight
and the rice grows in separate clusters
So now let us divide up the rice into fields with boundaries 
So they did so
Then Vasettha one greedynatured being while watching over his own plot took another plot that was not given to him and enjoyed the fruits of it
So they seized hold of him and said Youve done a wicked thing taking anothers plot like that
Dont ever do such a thing again
I wont he said
but he did the same thing a second and a third time
Again he was seized and rebuked and some hit him with their fists some with stones and some with sticks
And in this way Vasettha taking what was not given and censuring and lying and punishment took their origin
Then those beings came together and lamented the arising of these evil things among them taking what was not given censuring lying and punishment
And they thought Suppose we were to appoint a certain being who would show anger where anger was due censure those who deserved it and banish those who deserved banishment
And in return we would grant him a share of the rice
 So they went to the one among them who was the handsomest the bestlooking the most pleasant and capable and asked him to do this for them in return for a share of the rice and he agreed
The Peoples Choice is the meaning of MahaSammata which is the first regular title to be introduced
Lord Of The Fields is the meaning of Khattiya the second such title
And He Gladdens Others With Dhamma is the meaning of Raja the third title to be introduced
This then Vasettha is the origin of the class of Khattiyas in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them They originated among these very same beings
like ourselves no different
and in accordance with Dhamma not otherwise
Dhammas the best thing for people In this life and the next as well
Then some of these beings thought Evil things have appeared among beings such as taking what is not given censuring lying punishment and banishment
We ought to put aside evil and unwholesome things
 And they did so
They Put Aside Evil And Uwholesome Things is the meaning of Brahmin which is the first regular title to be introduced for such people
They made leafhuts in forest places and meditated in them With the smoking fire gone out with pestle cast aside gathering alms for their evening and morning meals they went away to a village town or royal city to seek their food
and then they returned to their leaf huts to meditate
People saw this and noted how they meditated
They Meditate is the meaning of Jhayaka which is the second regular title to be introduced
However some of those beings not being able to meditate in leafhuts settled around towns and villages and compiled books
People saw them doing this and not meditating
Now These Do Not Meditate is the meaning of Ajjhayaka which is the third regular title to be introduced
At that time it was regarded as a low designation but now it is the higher
This then Vasettha is the origin of the class of Brahmins in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them Their origin was from among these very same beings like themselves no different and in accordance with Dhamma not otherwise
Dhammas the best thing for people In this life and the next as well
And then Vasettha some of those beings having paired off adopted various trades and this Various is the meaning of Vessa which came to be the regular title for such people
This then is the origin of the class of Vessas in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them
Their origin was from among these very same beings
And then Vasettha those beings that remained went in for hunting
They Are Base Who Live By The Chase and that is the meaning of Sudda which came to be the regular title for such people
This then is the origin of the class of Suddas in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them Their origin was from among these very same beings
And then Vasettha it came about that some Khattiya dissatisfied with his own Dhamma went forth from the household life into homelessness thinking I will become an ascetic
 And a Brahmin did likewise a Vessa did likewise and so did a Sudda
And from these four classes the class of ascetics came into existence Their origin was from among these very same beings like themselves no different and in accordance with Dhamma not otherwise
Dhammas the best thing for people In this life and the next as well
And Vasettha a Khattiya who has led a bad life in body speech and thought and who has wrong view will in consequence of such wrong views and deeds at the breaking up of the body after death be reborn in a state of loss an ill fate the downfall the hellstate
So too will a Brahmin a Vessa or a Sudda
Likewise a Khattiya who has led a good life in body speech and thought and who has right view will in consequence of such right view and deeds at the breakingup of the body after death be reborn in a good destiny in a heaven state
So too will a Brahmin a Vessa or a Sudda
And a Khattiya who has performed deeds of both kinds in body speech and thought and whose view is mixed will in consequence of such mixed views and deeds at the breakingup of the body after death experience both pleasure and pain
So too will a Brahmin a Vessa or a Sudda
And a Khattiya who is restrained in body speech and thought and who has developed the seven requisites of enlightenment will attain to Parinibbana in this very life
So too will a Brahmin a Vessa or a Sudda
And Vasettha whoever of these four castes as a monk becomes an Arahant who has destroyed the corruptions done what had to be done laid down the burden attained to the highest goal completely destroyed the fetter of becoming and become liberated by the highest insight he is declared to be chief among them in accordance with Dhamma
and not otherwise
Dhammas the best thing for people In this life and the next as well
Vasettha it was Brahma Sanankumara who spoke this verse
The Khattiyas best among those who value clan
He with knowledge and conduct is best of gods and men 
This verse was rightly sung not wrongly
rightly spoken not wrongly
connected with profit not unconnected
I too say Vasettha
The Khattiyas best among those who value clan
He with knowledge and conduct is best of gods and men
Thus the Lord spoke
and Vasettha and Bharadvaja were delighted and rejoiced at his words
Thus have I heard Once the Lord was staying at Rajagaha at the Squirrels Feeding Place in the Bamboo Grove
And at that time Sigalaka the householders son having got up early and gone out of Rajagaha was paying homage with wet clothes and hair and with joined palms to the different directions to the east the south the west the north the nadir and the zenith
And the Lord having risen early and dressed took his robe and bowl and went to Rajagaha for alms
And seeing Sigalaka paying homage to the different directions
he said Householders son why have you got up early to pay homage to the different directions
Lord my father when he was dying told me to do so
And so Lord out of respect for my fathers words which I revere honour and hold sacred I have got up thus early to pay homage in this way to the six directions
This is what I heard  On one occasion the Buddha was living near the town of Rajagaha at a spot in the Bamboo Grove called the Squirrels Feeding Place
At that time a young householder named Sigalaka arose early and set out from Rajagaha with freshly washed clothes and hair With palms together held up in reverence he was paying respect towards the six directions that is east south west north lower and upper
Meanwhile the Buddha dressed himself in the early morning took his bowl and robe and went in to Rajagaha on alms round
On the way he saw Sigalaka worshipping the six directions
Seeing this the Buddha said to him Young man why have you risen in the early morning and set out from Rajagaha to worship in such a way 
Dear sir my father on his deathbed urged me My son you must worship the directions
So dear sir realizing honoring respecting and holding sacred my fathers request I have risen in the early morning and set out from Rajagaha to worship in this way
But householders son that is not the right way to pay homage to the six directions according to the Ariyan discipline
Well Lord how should one pay homage to the six directions according to the Ariyan discipline
It would be good if the Blessed Lord were to teach me the proper way to pay homage to the six directions according to the Ariyan discipline
Then listen carefully pay attention and I will speak
Yes Lord said Sigalaka
and the Lord said
Young householder it is by abandoning the four defilements of action by not doing evil from the four causes by not following the six ways of wasting ones substance  through avoiding these fourteen evil ways  that the Ariyan disciple covers the six directions and by such practice becomes a conqueror of both worlds
so that all will go well with him in this world and the next
and at the breakingup of the body after death he will go to a good destiny a heavenly world
But young man that is not how the six directions should be worshipped according to the discipline of the noble ones
Then how dear sir should the six directions be worshipped according to the discipline of the noble ones
I would appreciate it if you would teach me the proper way this should be done
Very well young man listen and pay careful attention while I tell you
Yes dear sir agreed Sigalaka
The Buddha said this
Young man by abandoning the four impure actions a noble disciple refrains from harmful deeds rooted in four causes and avoids the six ways of squandering wealth So these fourteen harmful things are removed The noble disciple now with the six directions protected has entered upon a path for conquering both worlds
firmly grounded in this world and the next
At the dissolution of the body after death a good rebirth occurs in a heavenly world
What are the four defilements of action that are abandoned
Taking life is one taking what is not given is one sexual misconduct is one lying speech is one
These are the four defilements of action that he abandons
Thus the Lord spoke  And the WellFarer having spoken the Teacher added
Taking life and stealing lying
Adultery the wise reprove
What four impure actions are abandoned
The harming of living beings is an impure action taking what is not given is an impure action sexual misconduct is an impure action and false speech is an impure action
These four are abandoned
That is what the Buddha said  Summing up in verse the sublime teacher said
Harming living beings taking what is not given False speech
and pursuing the loved one of another These the wise surely do not praise
What are the four causes of evil from which he refrains
Evil action springs from attachment it springs from illwill it springs from folly it springs from fear
If the Ariyan disciple does not act out of attachment illwill folly or fear he will not do evil from any one of the four causes
Thus the Lord spoke  And the WellFarer having spoken the Teacher added
Desire and hatred fear and folly He who breaks the law through these
Loses all his fair repute Like the moon at waningtime
Desire and hatred fear and folly He who never yields to these
Grows in goodness and repute Like the moon at waxingtime
What are the four causes of harmful deeds
Going astray through desire hatred delusion or fear the noble disciple does harmful deeds
But young man not going astray through desire hatred delusion or fear the noble disciple does not perform harmful deeds
That is what the Buddha said  Summing up in verse the sublime teacher said
Desire hatred delusion or fear Whoever transgresses the Dhamma by these
Has a reputation that comes to ruin Like the moon in the waning fortnight
Desire hatred delusion or fear Whoever transgresses not the Dhamma by these
Has a reputation that comes to fullness Like the moon in the waxing fortnight
And which are the six ways of wasting ones substance that he does not follow
Addiction to strong drink and sloth producing drugs is one way of wasting ones substance haunting the streets at unfitting times is one attending fairs is one being addicted to gambling is one keeping bad company is one habitual idleness is one
And what six ways of squandering wealth are to be avoided
Young man heedlessness caused by intoxication roaming the streets at inappropriate times habitual partying compulsive gambling bad companionship and laziness are the six ways of squandering wealth
There are these six dangers attached to addiction to strong drink and slothproducing drugs
present waste of money increased quarrelling liability to sickness loss of good name indecent exposure of ones person and weakening of the intellect
These are the six dangers inherent in heedlessness caused by intoxication
loss of immediate wealth increased quarreling susceptibility to illness disrepute indecent exposure and weakened insight
There are these six dangers attached to haunting the streets at unfitting times
one is defenceless and without protection and so are ones wife and children and so is ones property one is suspected of crimes and false reports are pinned on one and one encounters all sorts of unpleasantness
These are the six dangers inherent in roaming the streets at inappropriate times
oneself ones family and ones property are all left unguarded and unprotected one is suspected of crimes then rumors spread and one is subjected to many miseries
There are these six dangers attached to frequenting fairs
One is always thinking Where is there dancing Where is there singing Where are they playing music Where are they reciting Where is there handclapping  Where are the drums
These are the six dangers inherent in habitual partying
You constantly seek Wheres the dancing Wheres the singing Wheres the music Where are the stories Wheres the applause Wheres the drumming
There are these six dangers attached to gambling
the winner makes enemies the loser bewails his loss one wastes ones present wealth ones word is not trusted in the assembly one is despised by ones friends and companions one is not in demand for marriage because a gambler cannot afford to maintain a wife
These are the six dangers inherent in compulsive gambling
winning breeds resentment the loser mourns lost property savings are lost ones word carries no weight in a public forum friends and colleagues display their contempt and one is not sought after for marriage since a gambler cannot adequately support a family
There are these six dangers attached to keeping bad company
any gambler any glutton any drunkard any cheat any trickster any bully
is his friend his companion
These are the six dangers inherent in bad companionship
any rogue drunkard addict cheat swindler or thug
becomes a friend and colleague
There are these six dangers attached to idleness
Thinking Its too cold one does not work thinking Its too hot one does not work thinking Its too early one does not work thinking Its too late one does not work thinking Im too hungry one does not work thinking Im too full one does not work
Thus the Lord spoke  And the WellFarer having spoken the Teacher added
Some are drinkingmates and some
Profess their friendship to your face
But those who are your friends in need
They alone are friends indeed
Sleeping late adultery
Picking quarrels doing harm
Evil friends and stinginess
These six things destroy a man
He who goes with wicked friends
And spends his time in wicked deeds
In this world and the next as well
That man will come to suffer woe
Dicing wenching drinking too Dancing singing
daylight sleep Untimely prowling
evil friends And stinginess
destroy a man
He plays with dice and drinks strong drink
And goes with others wellloved wives
He takes the lower baser course
And fades away like waning moon
The drunkard broke and destitute
Ever thirsting as he drinks
Like stone in water sinks in debt
Soon bereft of all his kin
He who spends his days in sleep And makes the night his wakingtime
Ever drunk and lecherous Cannot keep a decent home
Too cold Too hot Too late they cry
Thus pushing all their work aside Till every chance they might have had Of doing good has slipped away
But he who reckons cold and heat As less than straws
and like a man Undertakes the task in hand His joy will never grow the less
These are the six dangers inherent in laziness
saying Its too cold one does not work saying Its too hot one does not work saying Its too late one does not work saying Its too early one does not work saying Im too hungry one does not work saying Im too full one does not work
With an abundance of excuses for not working new wealth does not accrue and existing wealth goes to waste
That is what the Buddha said  Summing up in verse the sublime teacher said
Some are drinking buddies
Some say Dear friend Dear friend
But whoever in hardship stands close by
That one truly is a friend
Sleeping late adultery
Hostility meaninglessness
Harmful friends utter stinginess
These six things destroy a person
Bad friends bad companions
Bad practices spending time in evil ways
In this world and the next
By these one brings oneself to ruin
Seduction gambling drinking singing dancing
Sleeping by day wandering all around untimely
Harmful friends utter stinginess
These things destroy a person
They play with dice they drink spirits
They consort with lovers dear to others
Associating with lowlife and not the esteemed
They come to ruin like the waning moon
Whoever is a drunkard broke and destitute
Dragged by thirst from bar to bar
Sinking into debt like a stone in water
Into bewilderment quickly plunges
When sleeping late becomes a habit And night is seen as time to rise
For one perpetually intoxicated A home life cannot be maintained
Too cold Too hot Too late they say
Having wasted work time this way The young miss out on opportunities
For one regarding cold and hot As not more than blades of grass
Doing whatever should be done Happiness will not be a stranger
Householders son there are these four types who can be seen as foes in friendly guise
the man who is all take is one the great talker is one the flatterer is one and the fellow spendthrift is one
The man who is all take can be seen to be a false friend for four reasons
he takes everything he wants a lot for very little
what he must do he does out of fear and he seeks his own ends
The great talker can be seen to be a false friend for four reasons
he talks of favours in the past and in the future he mouths empty phrases of goodwill and when something needs to be done in the present he pleads inability owing to some disaster
The flatterer can be seen to be a false friend for four reasons
he assents to bad actions he dissents from good actions he praises you to your face and he disparages you behind your back
The fellowspendthrift can be seen to be a false friend for four reasons
he is a companion when you indulge in strong drink when you haunt the streets at unfitting times when you frequent fairs and when you indulge in gambling
Thus the Lord spoke  And the WellFarer having spoken the Teacher added
The friend who seeks what he can get The friend who talks but empty words
The friend who merely flatters you The friend who is a fellowwastrel
These four are really foes not friends The wise man recognising this
Should hold himself aloof  from them As from some path of panic fear
Young man be aware of these four enemies disguised as friends
the taker the talker the flatterer and the reckless companion
The taker can be identified by four things
by only taking asking for a lot while giving little
performing duty out of fear and offering service in order to gain something
The talker can be identified by four things
by reminding of past generosity promising future generosity mouthing empty words of kindness and protesting personal misfortune when called on to help
The flatterer can be identified by four things
by supporting both bad and good behavior indiscriminately praising you to your face and putting you down behind your back
The reckless companion can be identified by four things
by accompanying you in drinking roaming around at night partying and gambling
That is what the Buddha said  Summing up in verse the sublime teacher said
The friend who is all take The friend of empty words
The friend full of flattery And the reckless friend
These four are not friends but enemies The wise understand this
And keep them at a distance As they would a dangerous path
Householders son there are these four types who can be seen to be loyal friends
the friend who is a helper is one the friend who is the same in happy and unhappy times is one the friend who points out what is good for you is one and the friend who is sympathetic is one
The helpful friend can be seen to be a loyal friend in four ways
he looks after you when you are inattentive he looks after your possessions when you are inattentive he is a refuge when you are afraid and when some business is to be done he lets you have twice what you ask for
The friend who is the same in happy and unhappy times can be seen to be a loyal friend in four ways
he tells you his secrets he guards your secrets he does not let you down in misfortune he would even sacrifice his life for you
The friend who points out what is good for you can be seen to be a loyal friend in four ways
he keeps you from wrongdoing he supports you in doing good he informs you of what you did not know and he points out the path to heaven
The sympathetic friend can be seen to be a loyal friend in four ways
he does not rejoice at your misfortune he rejoices at your good fortune he stops others who speak against you and he commends others who speak in praise of you
Thus the Lord spoke  And the WellFarer having spoken thus the Teacher added
The friend who is a helper and The friend in times both good and bad
The friend who shows the way thats right The friend whos full of sympathy
These four kinds of friends the wise Should know at their true worth
and he Should cherish them with care just like A mother with her dearest child
The wise man trained and disciplined Shines out like a beaconfire
He gathers wealth just as the bee Gathers honey
and it grows Like an anthill higher yet
With wealth so gained the layman can Devote it to his peoples good
He should divide his wealth in four 
One part he may enjoy at will Two parts he should put to work
The fourth part he should set aside As reserve in times of need
Young man be aware of these four goodhearted friends
the helper the friend who endures in good times and bad the mentor and the compassionate friend
The helper can be identified by four things
by protecting you when you are vulnerable and likewise your wealth being a refuge when you are afraid and in various tasks providing double what is requested
The enduring friend can be identified by four things
by telling you secrets guarding your own secrets closely not abandoning you in misfortune and even dying for you
The mentor can be identified by four things
by restraining you from wrongdoing guiding you towards good actions telling you what you ought to know and showing you the path to heaven
The compassionate friend can be identified by four things
by not rejoicing in your misfortune delighting in your good fortune preventing others from speaking ill of you and encouraging others who praise your good qualities
That is what the Buddha said  Summing up in verse the sublime teacher said
The friend who is a helper The friend through thick and thin
The friend who gives good counsel And the compassionate friend
These four are friends indeed The wise understand this
And attend on them carefully Like a mother her own child
The wise endowed with virtue Shine forth like a burning fire
Gathering wealth as bees do honey
And heaping it up like an ant hill
Once wealth is accumulated Family and household life may follow
By dividing wealth into four parts True friendships are bound
One part should be enjoyed Two parts invested in business
And the fourth set aside Against future misfortunes
Thus I have heard at one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Rājagaha on the Vultures Peak Mountain
Then the Four Great Kings with a great army of yakkhas with a great army of gandhabbas with a great army of kumbhaṇḍas with a great army of nāgas having set up a protection over the four quarters having set serried troops at the four directions having set up a barricade at the four directions at the end of the night having lit up the whole of Vultures Peak with their surpassing beauty approached the Gracious One and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One they sat down on one side
Then of those yakkhas some after worshipping the Gracious One sat down on one side Some exchanged greetings with the Gracious One and after exchanging polite and courteous greetings sat down on one side Some after raising their hands in respectful salutation to the Gracious One sat down on one side Some after announcing their name and family sat down on one side Some while keeping silent sat down on one side
Then while sitting on one side the Great King Vessavaṇa said this to the Gracious One There are reverend Sir some high ranking yakkhas who are not pleased with the Gracious One
there are reverend Sir some high ranking yakkhas who are pleased with the Gracious One
there are reverend Sir some middle ranking yakkhas who are not pleased with the Gracious One
there are reverend Sir some middle ranking yakkhas who are pleased with the Gracious One
there are reverend Sir some low ranking yakkhas who are not pleased with the Gracious One
there are reverend Sir some low ranking yakkhas who are pleased with the Gracious One
But reverend Sir almost all of the yakkhas are not pleased with the Gracious One
What is the reason for that
Because reverend Sir the Gracious One preaches the Dhamma of refraining from killing living creatures preaches the Dhamma of refraining from taking what has not been given preaches the Dhamma of refraining from sexual misconduct preaches the Dhamma of refraining from false speech preaches the Dhamma of refraining from liquor wines or intoxicants which cause heedlessness
But reverend Sir almost all of the yakkhas do not refrain from killing living creatures do not refrain from taking what has not been given do not refrain from sexual misconduct do not refrain from false speech do not refrain from liquors wines or intoxicants which cause heedlessness
To them that is neither dear nor appealing
There are reverend Sir disciples of the Gracious One in the wilderness who are practising in remote jungle dwelling places where there is little sound little noise which have a lonely atmosphere lying hidden away from men which are suitable for seclusion
And there are high ranking yakkhas settled there who are not pleased with the word of the Gracious One
To please them reverend Sir may the Gracious One learn this ṭānāṭiya protection for the monks nuns laymens and laywomens guard protection freedom from harm and comfortable living
The Gracious One by keeping silent gave consent
Then the Great King Vessavaṇa having understood the Gracious Ones consent on that occasion recited this ṭānāṭiya protection

And now dear Sir we shall go as we have many duties and there is much which ought to be done
Now is the time for whatever you Great Kings are thinking
Then the Four Great Kings rose from their seats and after worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One vanished right there
Then some yakkhas rose from their seats and after worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One vanished right there
Some exchanged greetings with the Gracious One and after exchanging polite and courteous greetings vanished right there
Some after raising their hands in respectful salutation to the Gracious One vanished right there
Some after announcing their name and family vanished right there
And some while keeping silent vanished right there
The first recital is finished
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was living on the Vultures Peak near Rajagaha 
Then four great kings having placed a guard over the four quarters with a large army of Yakkhas of Gandhabbas of Kumbhandas of Nagas having placed troops having placed a barricade of soldiers on four sides came to the presence of the Blessed One when the night was far advanced illuminating the entire Vultures Peak with their surpassing radiance saluted the Blessed One and sat on one side
From among the Yakkhas some saluted the Blessed One and sat on one side some exchanged greetings with the Blessed One conversing in a friendly and courteous manner and sat on one side some saluted him with clasped hands and sat on one side some announced their name and lineage and sat on one side some sat on one side in silence
Then the great King Vessavana  who was seated on one side said to the Blessed One Venerable Sir  there are eminent Yakkhas who are not pleased with the Blessed One
there are also eminent Yakkhas pleased with the Blessed One
There are Yakkhas of middle rank who are not pleased with the Blessed One
and there are those who are pleased with the Blessed One
There are Yakkhas of inferior rank who are not pleased with the Blessed One
and there are those who are pleased with the Blessed One
The Yakkhas bhante as a rule are not pleased with the Blessed One
What is the reason for this
Well the Blessed One teaches the Dhamma to establish abstention from killing from stealing from sexual misconduct from false speech and from liquor that causes intoxication and negligence
   
To them such teaching is unpleasant and unpalatable
Surely bhante there are disciples of the Blessed One They frequent the remote recesses of forest and woodland wilderness where there is no sound no tumult where breezes are void of human contact and suitable for mans seclusion and quiet contemplation
There are eminent Yakkhas who haunt these forests who have no faith in the word of the Blessed One
Bhante may the Blessed One learn the Atanata protection so that the displeased Yakkhas may be pleased so that the monks and nuns laymen and laywomen may be at ease guarded protected and unharmed
The Blessed One gave consent by his silence
Then the great King Vessavana knowing that the Blessed One had consented recited the Atanatiya protection

the ṭānāṭiya protection monks is for your welfare and benefit for the monks nuns laymens and laywomens guard protection freedom from harm and comfortable living
The Gracious One said this
and those monks were uplifted and greatly rejoiced in what was said by the Gracious One
The ṭānāṭiyasutta is finished
Then the Gracious One when that night had passed addressed the monks saying This night monks the Four Great Kings with a great army of yakkhas with a great army of gandhabbas with a great army of kumbhaṇḍas with a great army of nāgas having set up a protection over the four quarters having set serried troops at the four directions having set up a barricade at the four directions at the end of the night having lit up the whole of Vultures Peak with their surpassing beauty approached me and after approaching and worshipping me they sat down on one side
Then of those yakkhas monks some after worshipping me sat down on one side
Some exchanged greetings with me and after exchanging polite and courteous greetings sat down on one side
Some after raising their hands in respectful salutation to me sat down on one side
Some after announcing their name and family sat down on one side
Some while keeping silent sat down on one side
Then while sitting on one side monks the Great King Vessavaṇa said this to me
There are reverend Sir some high ranking yakkhas who are not pleased with the Gracious One
What is the reason for that
Because reverend Sir the Gracious One preaches the Dhamma of refraining from killing living creatures preaches the Dhamma of refraining from taking what has not been given preaches the Dhamma of refraining from sexual misconduct preaches the Dhamma of refraining from false speech preaches the Dhamma of refraining from liquor wines or intoxicants which cause heedlessness
But reverend Sir almost all of the yakkhas do not refrain from killing living creatures do not refrain from taking what has not been given do not refrain from sexual misconduct do not refrain from false speech do not refrain from liquors wines or intoxicants which cause heedlessness
To them that is neither dear nor appealing
There are reverend Sir disciples of the Gracious One in the wilderness who are practising in remote jungle dwelling places where there is little sound little noise which have a lonely atmosphere lying hidden away from men which are suitable for seclusion
nd there are high ranking yakkhas settled there who are not pleased with the word of the Gracious One To please then reverend Sir may the Gracious One learn this ṭānāṭiya protection for the monks nuns laymens and laywomens guard protection freedom from harm and comfortable living
And I monks by keeping silent gave consent
Then the Great King Vessavaṇa monks having understood my consent on that occasion recited this ṭānāṭiya protection
Thus have I heard  Once the Lord was staying among the Kurus There is a markettown of theirs called Kammasadhamma
And there the Lord addressed the monks Monks
Lord they replied
and the Lord said
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Kurus Now there is a town of the Kurus called Kammāsadhamma
There the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks 
Lord the monks responded to him
The Blessed One said
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Kuru country at a town of the Kurus named Kammasadhamma
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
 Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this
There is monks this one way to the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow and distress for the disappearance of pain and sadness for the gaining of the right path for the realisation of Nibbana  that is to say the four foundations of mindfulness
What are the four
Here monks a monk abides contemplating body as body ardent clearly aware and mindful having put aside hankering and fretting for the world he abides contemplating feelings as feelings  he abides contemplating mind as mind  he abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects ardent clearly aware and mindful having put aside hankering and fretting for the world
This is the direct path for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow  lamentation for the disappearance of pain  distress for the attainment of the right method  for the realization of unbindingin other words the four establishings of mindfulness
Which four
There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itselfardent alert  mindfulsubduing greed  distress with reference to the world He remains focused on feelings mind mental qualities in  of themselvesardent alert  mindfulsubduing greed  distress with reference to the world
Bhikkhus this is the direct path  for the purification of beings  for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation for the disappearance of pain and grief for the attainment of the true way for the realisation of Nibbana  namely the four foundations of mindfulness
 What are the four
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu  abides contemplating the body as a body ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world  He abides contemplating feelings as feelings ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world He abides contemplating mind as mind ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world He abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world
And how monks does a monk abide contemplating the body as body
Here a monk having gone into the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty place sits down cross legged holding his body erect having established mindfulness before him
Mindfully he breathes in mindfully he breathes out
Breathing in a long breath he knows that he breathes in a long breath and breathing out a long breath he knows that he breathes out a long breath
Breathing in a short breath he knows that he breathes in a short breath and breathing out a short breath he knows that he breathes out a short breath
He trains himself thinking I will breathe in conscious of the whole body  He trains himself thinking I will breathe out conscious of the whole body
 He trains himself thinking I will breathe in calming the whole bodily process  He trains himself thinking I will breathe out calming the whole bodily process
 Just as a skilled turner or his assistant in making a long turn knows that he is making a long turn or in making a short turn knows that he is making a short turn so too a monk in breathing in a long breath knows that he breathes in a long breath
and so trains himself thinking I will breathe out calming the whole bodily process
 So he abides contemplating body as body internally contemplating body as body externally contemplating body as body both internally and externally
He abides contemplating arising phenomena in the body he abides contemplating vanishing phenomena in the body he abides contemplating both arising and vanishing phenomena in the body
Or else mindfulness that there is body is present to him just to the extent necessary for knowledge and awareness And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
And that monks is how a monk abides contemplating body as body
And how does a monk remain focused on the body in  of itself
There is the case where a monkhaving gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty buildingsits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and establishing mindfulness to the fore
Always mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
Breathing in long he discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long 
Or breathing in short he discerns I am breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns I am breathing out short
 He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body he trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body
 He trains himself I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication he trains himself I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication
 Just as a dexterous turner or his apprentice when making a long turn discerns I am making a long turn or when making a short turn discerns I am making a short turn in the same way the monk when breathing in long discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long
  He trains himself I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication he trains himself I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication 
In this way he remains focused internally on the body in  of itself or externally on the body in  of itself or both internally  externally on the body in  of itself
Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to the body
Or his mindfulness that There is a body is maintained to the extent of knowledge  remembrance And he remains independent unsustained by not clinging to anything in the world
This is how a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself
And how bhikkhus does a bhikkhu abide contemplating the body as a body
Here a bhikkhu gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut sits down having folded his legs crosswise set his body erect and established mindfulness in front of him
ever mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
Breathing in long he understands I breathe in long or breathing out long he understands I breathe out long
Breathing in short he understands I breathe in short or breathing out short he understands I breathe out short
He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body of breath he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body of breath
He trains thus I shall breathe in tranquillizing the bodily formation he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquillizing the bodily formation
Just as a skilled turner or his apprentice when making a long turn understands I make a long turn or when making a short turn understands I make a short turn so too breathing in long a bhikkhu understands I breathe in long
he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquillizing the bodily formation
In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally or he abides contemplating the body as a body externally or he abides contemplating the body as a body both internally and externally
Or else he abides contemplating in the body its arising factors or he abides contemplating in the body its vanishing factors or he abides contemplating in the body both its arising and vanishing factors
Or else mindfulness that there is a body is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and mindfulness And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body
Again a monk when walking knows that he is walking when standing knows that he is standing when sitting knows that he is sitting when lying down knows that he is lying down In whatever way his body is disposed he knows that that is how it is
So he abides contemplating body as body internally externally and both internally and externally
And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
And that monks is how a monk abides contemplating body as body
And further when walking the monk discerns I am walking When standing he discerns I am standing  When sitting he discerns I am sitting  When lying down he discerns I am lying down  Or however his body is disposed that is how he discerns it
In this way he remains focused internally on the body in  of itself or externally on the body in  of itself or both internally  externally on the body in  of itself
Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to the body
Or his mindfulness that There is a body is maintained to the extent of knowledge  remembrance And he remains independent unsustained by not clinging to anything in the world
This is how a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself
Again bhikkhus when walking a bhikkhu understands I am walking when standing he understands I am standing when sitting he understands I am sitting when lying down he understands I am lying down or he understands accordingly however his body is disposed
In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally externally and both internally and externally
And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body
Again a monk when going forward or back is clearly aware of what he is doing in looking forward or back he is clearly aware of what he is doing in bending and stretching he is clearly aware of what he is doing in carrying his inner and outer robe and his bowl he is clearly aware of what he is doing in eating drinking chewing and savouring he is clearly aware of what he is doing in passing excrement or urine he is clearly aware of what he is doing in walking standing sitting falling asleep and waking up in speaking or in staying silent he is clearly aware of what he is doing
So he abides contemplating body as body internally externally and both internally and externally   And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world And that monks is how a monk abides contemplating body as body
And further when going forward  returning he makes himself fully alert when looking toward  looking away when flexing  extending his limbs when carrying his outer cloak his upper robe  his bowl when eating drinking chewing  savoring when urinating  defecating when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking  remaining silent he makes himself fully alert
In this way he remains focused internally on the body in  of itself or externally on the body in  of itself or both internally  externally on the body in  of itself Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to the body Or his mindfulness that There is a body is maintained to the extent of knowledge  remembrance And he remains independent unsustained by not clinging to anything in the world This is how a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself
Again bhikkhus a bhikkhu is one who acts in full awareness when going forward and returning  who acts in full aware ness when looking ahead and looking away who acts in full awareness when flexing and extending his limbs who acts in full awareness when wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl who acts in full awareness when eating drink ing consuming food and tasting who acts in full awareness when defecating and urinating who acts in full awareness when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking and keeping silent
In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally externally and both internally and externally   And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body
Again a monk reviews this very body from the soles of the feet upwards and from the scalp downwards enclosed by the skin and full of manifold impurities In this body there are headhairs bodyhairs nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones bonemarrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs mesentery bowels stomach excrement bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears tallow saliva snot synovic fluid urine
Just as if there were a bag open at both ends full of various kinds of grain such as hillrice paddy green gram kidneybeans sesame husked rice
and a man with good eyesight were to open the bag and examine them saying This is hillrice this is paddy this is green gram these are kidneybeans this is sesame this is husked rice
so too a monk reviews this very body In this body there are head hairs  urine 
So he abides contemplating body as body internally externally and both internally and externally   And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world And that monks is how a monk abides contemplating body as body
And further
just as if a sack with openings at both ends were full of various kinds of grainwheat rice mung beans kidney beans sesame seeds husked rice
and a man with good eyesight pouring it out were to reflect This is wheat This is rice These are mung beans These are kidney beans These are sesame seeds This is husked rice
in the same way the monk reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet on up from the crown of the head on down surrounded by skin and full of various kinds of unclean things In this body there are head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs large intestines small intestines gorge feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears skinoil saliva mucus fluid in the joints urine
In this way he remains focused internally on the body in  of itself or externally on the body in  of itself or both internally  externally on the body in  of itself Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to the body Or his mindfulness that There is a body is maintained to the extent of knowledge  remembrance And he remains independent unsustained by not clinging to anything in the world This is how a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself
Again bhikkhus a bhikkhu reviews this same body up from the soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair bounded by skin as full of many kinds of impurity thus Tn this body there are headhairs bodyhairs nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones bonemarrow kidneys heart liver diaphragm spleen lungs large intestines small intestines contents of the stomach feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease spittle snot oil of the joints and urine
Just as though there were a bag with an opening at both ends full of many sorts of grain such as hill rice red rice beans peas millet and white rice
and a man with good eyes were to open it and review it thus This is hill rice this is red rice these are beans these are peas this is millet this is white rice
so too a bhikkhu reviews this same bodyas full of many kinds of impurity thus Tn this body there are headhairsand urine
In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally externally and both internally and externally  And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body
Again a monk reviews this body however it may be placed or disposed in terms of the elements There are in this body the earthelement the waterelement the fireele ment the airelement
 Just as if a skilled butcher or his assistant having slaughtered a cow were to sit at a crossroads with the carcass divided into portions so a monk reviews this very body   in terms of the elements There are in this body the earthelement the waterelement the fire element the airelement 
So he abides contemplating body as body internally  And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world And that monks is how a monk abides contemplating body as body
And further
just as a dexterous butcher or his apprentice having killed a cow would sit at a crossroads cutting it up into pieces the monk reflects on this very bodyhowever it stands however it is disposedin terms of properties In this body there is the earth property the liquid property the fire property  the wind property
In this way he remains focused internally on the body in  of itself or externally on the body in  of itself or both internally  externally on the body in  of itself Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to the body Or his mindfulness that There is a body is maintained to the extent of knowledge  remembrance And he remains independent unsustained by not clinging to anything in the world This is how a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself
Again bhikkhus a bhikkhu reviews this same body how ever it is placed however disposed as consisting of elements thus In this body there are the earth element the water element the fire element and the air element
Just as though a skilled butcher or his apprentice had killed a cow and was seated at the crossroads with it cut up into pieces so too a bhikkhu reviews this same bodyas consisting of elements thus In this body there are the earth element the water element the fire element and the air element
In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally externally and both internally and externally   And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body
Again a monk as if he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnelground one two or three days dead bloated discoloured festering
compares this body with that thinking This body is of the same nature it will become like that it is not exempt from that fate
So he abides contemplating body as body internally externally and both internally and externally And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world And that monks is how a monk abides contemplating body as body
Again a monk as if he were to see a corpse in a charnel ground thrown aside eaten by crows hawks or vultures by dogs or jackals or various other creatures
compares this body with that thinking This body is of the same nature it will become like that it is not exempt from that fate 
Again a monk as if he were to see a corpse in a charnel ground thrown aside a skeleton with flesh and blood connected by sinews a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood connected by sinews  a skeleton detached from the flesh and blood connected by sinews  randomly connected bones scattered in all directions a handbone here a foot bone there a shinbone here a thighbone there a hipbone here a spine here a skull there
compares this body with that
Again a monk as if he were to see a corpse in a charnelground thrown aside the bones whitened looking like shells  the bones piled up a year old  the bones rotted away to a powder
compares this body with that thinking This body is of the same nature will become like that is not exempt from that fate 
 So he abides contemplating body as body internally contemplating body as body externally abides contemplating body as body both internally and externally
He abides contemplating arising phenomena in the body contemplating vanishing phenomena in the body he abides contemplating both arising and vanishing phenomena in the body
Or else mindfulness that there is body is present to him just to the extent necessary for knowledge and awareness And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
And that monks is how a monk abides contemplating body as body
And further as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel groundone day two days three days deadbloated livid  festering
he applies it to this very body This body too Such is its nature such is its future such its unavoidable fate 
In this way he remains focused internally on the body in  of itself or externally on the body in  of itself or both internally  externally on the body in  of itself Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to the body Or his mindfulness that There is a body is maintained to the extent of knowledge  remembrance And he remains independent unsustained by not clinging to anything in the world This is how a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself
Or again as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground being chewed by crows being chewed by vultures being chewed by hawks being chewed by dogs being chewed by hyenas being chewed by various other creatures
a skeleton smeared with flesh  blood connected with tendons a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood connected with tendons a skeleton without flesh or blood connected with tendons bones detached from their tendons scattered in all directionshere a hand bone there a foot bone here a shin bone there a thigh bone here a hip bone there a back bone here a rib there a chest bone here a shoulder bone there a neck bone here a jaw bone there a tooth here a skull
the bones whitened somewhat like the color of shells the bones piled up more than a year old the bones decomposed into a powder
He applies it to this very body This body too Such is its nature such is its future such its unavoidable fate
In this way he remains focused internally on the body in  of itself or externally on the body in  of itself or both internally  externally on the body in  of itself
Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to the body
Or his mindfulness that There is a body is maintained to the extent of knowledge  remembrance And he remains independent unsustained by not clinging to anything in the world
This is how a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself
Again bhikkhus as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground one two or three days dead bloated livid and oozing matter
a bhikkhu compares this same body with it thus This body too is of the same nature it will be like that it is not exempt from that fate
In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally externally and both internally and externally  And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body
Again as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground being devoured by crows hawks vultures dogs jackals or various kinds of worms
a bhikkhu compares this same body with it thus This body too is of the same nature it will be like that it is not exempt from that fate
That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body
Again as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground a skeleton with flesh and blood held together with sinewsa fleshless skeleton smeared with blood held together with sinewsa skeleton without flesh and blood held together with sinewsdisconnected bones scattered in all directions  here a handbone there a footbone here a shinbone there a thighbone here a hipbone there a backbone here a ribbone there a breastbone here an armbone there a shoulderbone here a neckbone there a jawbone here a tooth there the skull 
a bhikkhu compares this same body with it thus This body too is of the same nature it will be like that it is not exempt from that fate
That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body
Again as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground bones bleached white the colour of shells bones heaped up more than a year oldbones rotted and crumbled to dust 
a bhikkhu compares this same body with it thus This body too is of the same nature it will be like that it is not exempt from that fate
In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally or he abides contemplating the body as a body externally or he abides contemplating the body as a body both internally and externally
Or else he abides contemplating in the body its arising factors or he abides contemplating in the body its vanishing factors or he abides contemplating in the body both its arising and vanishing factors
Or else mindfulness that there is a body is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and mindfulness And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body
ii And how monks does a monk abide contemplating feelings as feelings

feeling a painful feeling he knows that he feels a painful feeling
feeling a feeling that is neitherpainfulnorpleasant he knows that he feels a feeling that is neitherpainfulnorpleasant
feeling a pleasant sensual feeling he knows that he feels a pleasant sensual feeling feeling a pleasant nonsensual feeling he knows that he feels a pleasant nonsensual feeling
feeling a painful sensual feeling feeling a painful nonsensual feeling
 feeling a sensual feeling that is neitherpainfulnor pleasant  feeling a nonsensual feeling that is neitherpain fulnorpleasant he knows that he feels a nonsensual feeling that is neither painfulnorpleasant 
 So he abides contemplating feelings as feelings internally He abides contemplating feelings as feelings externally
He abides contemplating arising phenomena in the feelings vanishing phenomena and both arising and vanishing phenomena in the feelings
Or else mindfulness that there is feeling is present to him just to the extent necessary for knowledge and awareness And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
And that monks is how a monk abides contemplating feelings as feelings
And how does a monk remain focused on feelings in  of themselves
There is the case where a monk when feeling a painful feeling discerns I am feeling a painful feeling
 When feeling a pleasant feeling he discerns I am feeling a pleasant feeling
 When feeling a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling he discerns I am feeling a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling 
When feeling a painful feeling of the flesh he discerns I am feeling a painful feeling of the flesh  When feeling a painful feeling not of the flesh he discerns I am feeling a painful feeling not of the flesh

 When feeling a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling of the flesh he discerns I am feeling a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling of the flesh  When feeling a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling not of the flesh he discerns I am feeling a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling not of the flesh 
In this way he remains focused internally on feelings in  of themselves or externally on feelings in  of themselves or both internally  externally on feelings in  of themselves
Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to feelings on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to feelings or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to feelings
Or his mindfulness that There are feelings is maintained to the extent of knowledge  remembrance And he remains independent unsustained by not clinging to anything in the world
This is how a monk remains focused on feelings in  of themselves
And how bhikkhus does a bhikkhu abide contemplating feelings as feelings
Here when feeling a pleasant feeling a bhikkhu understands I feel a pleasant feeling
when feeling a painful feeling he understands I feel a painful feeling
when feeling a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling he understands I feel a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling
When feeling a worldly pleasant feeling he understands I feel a worldly pleasant feeling when feeling an unworldly pleasant feeling he understands I feel an unworldly pleasant feeling
when feeling a worldly painful feeling he understands I feel a worldly painful feeling when feeling an unworldly painful feeling he understands I feel an unworldly painful feeling
when feeling a worldly neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling he understands I feel a worldly neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling when feeling an unworldly neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling he understands I feel an unworldly neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling
In this way he abides contemplating feelings as feelings inter nally or he abides contemplating feelings as feelings externally or he abides contemplating feelings as feelings both internally and externally
Or else he abides contemplating in feelings their arising factors or he abides contemplating in feelings their van ishing factors or he abides contemplating in feelings both their arising and vanishing factors
Or else mindfulness that there is feeling is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and mindfulness And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating feelings as feelings
And how monks does a monk abide contemplating mind as mind 
Here a monk knows a lustful mind as lustful a mind free from lust as free from lust
a hating mind as hating a mind free from hate as free from hate
a deluded mind as deluded an undeluded mind as undeluded 
a contracted mind as contracted a distracted mind as distracted
a developed mind as developed an undeveloped mind as undeveloped
a surpassed mind as surpassed an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed
a concentrated mind as concentrated an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated
a liberated mind as liberated
an unliberated mind as unliberated
So he abides contemplating mind as mind internally He abides contemplating mind as mind externally
He abides contemplating arising phenomena in the mind Or else mindfulness that there is mind is present just to the extent necessary for knowledge and awareness And he abides detached not grasping at anything in the world
And that monks is how a monk abides contemplating mind as mind
And how does a monk remain focused on the mind in  of itself
There is the case where a monk when the mind has passion discerns The mind has passion  When the mind is without passion he discerns The mind is without passion
 When the mind has aversion he discerns The mind has aversion  When the mind is without aversion he discerns The mind is without aversion
 When the mind has delusion he discerns The mind has delusion  When the mind is without delusion he discerns The mind is without delusion

And how bhikkhus does a bhikkhu abide contemplating mind as mind
Here a bhikkhu understands mind affected by lust as mind affected by lust and mind unaffected by lust as mind unaffected by lust
He understands mind affected by hate as mind affected by hate and mind unaffected by hate as mind unaffected by hate
He understands mind affected by delusion as mind affected by delusion and mind unaffected by delusion as mind unaffected by delusion

He understands liberated mind as liberated mind
and unliberated mind as unliberated mind
In this way he abides contemplating mind as mind internally or he abides contemplating mind as mind externally or he abides contemplating mind as mind both internally and exter nally
Or else he abides contemplating in mind its arising factors or he abides contemplating in mind its vanishing factors or he abides contemplating in mind both its arising and vanishing factors  Or else mindfulness that there is mind is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and mindfulness And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating mind as mind
And how monks does a monk abide contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects 
 Here a monk abides contemplating mindobjects as mind objects in respect of the five hindrances
How does he do so
Here monks if sensual desire is present in himself a monk knows that it is present If sensual desire is absent in himself a monk knows that it is absent And he knows how unarisen sensual desire comes to arise and he knows how the abandonment of arisen sensual desire comes about and he knows how the nonarising of the abandoned sensual desire in the future will come about 
If illwill is present in himself a monk knows that it is present   And he knows how the nonarising of the abandoned illwill in the future will come about
If slothandtorpor is present in himself a monk knows that it is present  And he knows how the nonarising of the abandoned slothandtorpor in the future will come about
If worryandflurry is present in himself a monk knows that it is present   And he knows how the nonarising of the abandoned worryandflurry in the future will come about
If doubt is present in himself a monk knows that it is present If doubt is absent in himself he knows that it is absent And he knows how unarisen doubt comes to arise and he knows how the abandonment of arisen doubt comes about and he knows how the nonarising of the abandoned doubt in the future will come about
 So he abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects internally   He abides contemplating arising phenomena in mindobjects Or else mindfulness that there are mind objects is present just to the extent necessary for knowledge and awareness And he abides detached not grasping at anything in the world
And that monks is how a monk abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects in respect of the five hindrances
And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves
There is the case where a monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five hindrances
And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five hindrances
There is the case where there being sensual desire present within a monk discerns There is sensual desire present within me  Or there being no sensual desire present within he discerns There is no sensual desire present within me  He discerns how there is the arising of unarisen sensual desire And he discerns how there is the abandoning of sensual desire once it has arisen  And he discerns how there is no further appearance in the future of sensual desire that has been abandoned
The same formula is repeated for the remaining hindrances ill will
sloth  drowsiness
restlessness  anxiety
and uncertainty
In this way he remains focused internally on mental qualities in  of themselves or externally on mental qualities in  of themselves or both internally  externally on mental qualities in  of themselves Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to mental qualities on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to mental qualities or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to mental qualities Or his mindfulness that There are mental qualities is maintained to the extent of knowledge  remembrance And he remains independent unsustained by not clinging to anything in the world
This is how a monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five hindrances
And how bhikkhus does a bhikkhu abide contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects
Here a bhikkhu abides con templating mindobjects as mindobjects in terms of the five hindrances
And how does a bhikkhu abide contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects in terms of the five hindrances
Here there being sensual desire in him a bhikkhu understands There is sensual desire in me or there being no sensual desire in him he understands There is no sensual desire in me and he also understands how there comes to be the arising of unarisen sensual desire and how there comes to be the abandoning of arisen sensual desire and how there comes to be the future nonarising of abandoned sensual desire
There being ill will in him
There being sloth and torpor in him 
There being restlessness and remorse in him  
There being doubt in him a bhikkhu understands There is doubt in me or there being no doubt in him he understands There is no doubt in me and he understands how there comes to be the arising of unarisen doubt and how there comes to be the abandoning of arisen doubt and how there comes to be the future nonarising of abandoned doubt
In this way he abides contemplating mindobjects as mind objects internally or he abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects externally or he abides contemplating mind objects as mindobjects both internally and externally Or else he abides contemplating in mindobjects their arising factors or he abides contemplating in mindobjects their vanishing factors or he abides contemplating in mindobjects both their arising and vanishing factors Or else mindfulness that there are mind objects is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and mindfulness And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects in terms of the five hindrances
Again monks a monk abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects in respect of the five aggregates of grasping
How does he do so
Here a monk thinks Such is form such the arising of form such the disappearance of form such is feeling such the arising of feeling such the disappearance of feeling such is perception such the arising of perception such the disappearance of perception such are the mental formations such the arising of the mental formations such the disappearance of the mental formations such is consciousness such the arising of consciousness such the disappearance of consciousness So he abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects internally  
And he abides detached not grasping at anything in the world
And that monks is how a monk abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects in respect of the five aggregates of grasping
And further the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five clingingaggregates

Again monks a monk abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects in respect of the six internal and external sensebases
How does he do so
Here a monk knows the eye knows sightobjects and he knows whatever fetter arises dependent on the two  And he knows how an unarisen fetter comes to arise and he knows how the abandonment of an arisen fetter comes about and he knows how the nonarising of the abandoned fetter in the future will come about

 So he abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects internally
And he abides detached not grasping at anything in the world
And that monks is how a monk abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects in respect of the six internal and external sensebases
And further the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the sixfold internal  external sense media
And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the sixfold internal  external sense media
There is the case where he discerns the eye he discerns forms he discerns the fetter that arises dependent on both  He discerns how there is the arising of an unarisen fetter And he discerns how there is the abandoning of a fetter once it has arisen And he discerns how there is no further appearance in the future of a fetter that has been abandoned
The same formula is repeated for the remaining sense media ear
nose

If anyone would develop these four establishings of mindfulness in this way for seven days one of two fruits can be expected for him either gnosis right here  now orif there be any remnant of clingingsustenancenonreturn
This is the direct path for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow  lamentation for the disappearance of pain  distress for the attainment of the right method  for the realization of unbindingin other words the four establishings of mindfulness
 Thus was it said and in reference to this was it said 
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones words
In this way he abides contemplating mindobjects as mind objects internally or he abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects externally or he abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects both internally and externally
Or else he abides contemplating in mindobjects their arising factors or he abides contemplating in mindobjects their vanishing factors or he abides contemplating in mindobjects both their arising and vanishing factors
Or else mindfulness that there are mindobjects is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and mindfulness And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects in terms of the Four Noble Truths
Bhikkhus if anyone should develop these four foundations of mindfulness in such a way for seven years one of two fruits could be expected for him either final knowledge here and now or if there is a trace of clinging left nonreturn 
Let alone seven years bhikkhus
If anyone should develop these four foundations of mindfulness in such a way for six yearsfor five yearsfor four yearsfor three yearsfor two years for one year one of two fruits could be expected for him either final knowledge here and now or if there is a trace of clinging left nonreturn Let alone one year bhikkhus
If anyone should develop these four foundations of mindfulness in such a way for seven months
for six monthsfor five monthsfor four monthsfor three monthsfor two monthsfor one monthfor half a month one of two fruits could be expected for him either final knowledge here and now or if there is a trace of clinging left nonreturn Let alone half a month bhikkhus
If anyone should develop these four foundations of mindfulness in such a way for seven days one of two fruits could be expected for him either final knowledge here and now or if there is a trace of clinging left nonreturn 
Bhikkhus this is the direct path for the purification of beings for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation for the disappearance of pain and grief for the attainment of the true way for the realisation of Nibbana  namely the four foundations of mindfulness
 So it was with reference to this that it was said
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
At Savatthi
Then King Pasenadi Kosala approached the Blessed One in the middle of the day and on arrival having bowed down sat to one side As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Well now great king where are you coming from in the middle of the day 
Just now lord I was engaged in the sort of royal affairs typical of headanointed noblewarrior kings intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures who have attained stable control in their country and who rule having conquered a great sphere of territory on earth
What do you think great king Suppose a man trustworthy and reliable were to come to you from the east
and on arrival would say If it please your majesty you should know that I come from the east
There I saw a great mountain as high as the clouds coming this way crushing all living beings in its path
Do whatever you think should be done
Then a second man were to come to you from the west Then a third man were to come to you from the north Then a fourth man were to come to you from the south
and on arrival would say If it please your majesty you should know that I come from the south
There I saw a great mountain as high as the clouds coming this way crushing all living beings
Do whatever you think should be done
If great king such a great peril should arise such a terrible destruction of human life  the human state being so hard to obtain  what should be done
If lord such a great peril should arise such a terrible destruction of human life  the human state being so hard to obtain  what else should be done but Dhammaconduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deeds 
I inform you great king I announce to you great king aging and death are rolling in on you
When aging and death are rolling in on you great king what should be done 
As aging and death are rolling in on me lord what else should be done but Dhammaconduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deeds
There are lord elephant battles fought by headanointed noblewarrior kings intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures who have attained stable control in their country and who rule having conquered a great sphere of territory on earth but there is no use for those elephant battles no scope for them when aging and death are rolling in
There are cavalry battles chariot battles infantry battles but there is no use for those infantry battles no scope for them when aging and death are rolling in
In this royal court there are counselors who when the enemies arrive are capable of dividing them by their wits
but there is no use for those battles of wits no scope for them when aging and death are rolling in
In this royal court there is abundant bullion and gold stored in vaults and depositories and with such wealth we are capable of buying off enemies when they come
but there is no use for those battles of wealth no scope for them when aging and death are rolling in
As aging and death are rolling in on me lord what else should be done but Dhammaconduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deeds
So it is great king So it is great king
As aging and death are rolling in on you what else should be done but Dhammaconduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deeds 
That is what the Blessed One said Having said that the One WellGone the Teacher further said this
Like massive boulders mountains pressing against the sky
moving in from all sides crushing the four directions
so aging and death come rolling over living beings
noble warriors brahmans merchants workers outcastes  scavengers
They spare nothing They trample everything
Here elephant troops can hold no ground nor can chariots or infantry
nor can a battle of wits or wealth win out
So a wise person seeing his own good
steadfast secures confidence in the Buddha Dhamma  Sangha
One who practices the Dhamma in thought word  deed
receives praise here on earth and after death rejoices in heaven
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monastery
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks responded to him
The Blessed One said
Monks once the devas  asuras were arrayed for battle
Then Sakka the chief of the devas addressed the devas of the Thirtythree
If dear sirs when the devas have gone into battle there should arise fear terror or horripilation then on that occasion you should catch sight of the top of my standard
For when you have caught sight of the top of my standard whatever fear terror or horripilation there is will be abandoned
If you cant catch sight of the top of my standard then you should catch sight of the top of the devaking Pajapatis standard
For when you have caught sight of the top of the devaking Pajapatis standard whatever fear terror or horripilation there is will be abandoned
If you cant catch sight of the top of the devaking Pajapatis standard then you should catch sight of the top of the devaking Varunas standard
For when For when you have caught sight of the top of the devaking Varunas standard whatever fear terror or horripilation there is will be abandoned
If you cant catch sight of the top of the devaking Varunas standard then you should catch sight of the top of the devaking Isanas standard
For when you have caught sight of the top of the devaking Isanas standard whatever fear terror or horripilation there is will be abandoned 
But monks when the top of the devachief Sakkas standard is caught sight of or when the top of the devaking Pajapatis standard is caught sight of or when the top of the devaking Varunas standard is caught sight of or when the top of the devaking Isanas standard is caught sight of whatever fear terror or horripilation there is may be abandoned or may not be abandoned
Why is that
Because Sakka the chief of the devas is not devoid of passion not devoid of aversion not devoid of delusion He feels fear feels terror feels dread He runs away
But I tell you this If  when you have gone into the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building  there should arise fear terror or horripilation then on that occasion you should recollect me Indeed the Blessed One is worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessed
 For when you have recollected me whatever fear terror or horripilation there is will be abandoned
If you cant recollect me then you should recollect the Dhamma The Dhamma is wellexpounded by the Blessed One to be seen here  now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselves
For when you have recollected the Dhamma whatever fear terror or horripilation there is will be abandoned
If you cant recollect the Dhamma then you should recollect the Sangha The Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples who have practiced well  who have practiced straightforwardly  who have practiced methodically  who have practiced masterfully  in other words the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs the eight when taken as individual types  they are the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect the unexcelled field of merit for the world
For when you have recollected the Sangha whatever fear terror or horripilation where is will be abandoned
Why is that
Because the Tathagata  worthy  rightly selfawakened  is devoid of passion devoid of aversion devoid of delusion He feels no fear feels no terror feels no dread He doesnt run away 
That is what the Blessed One said
Having said that the Onewellgone the Teacher further said this
In the wilderness in the shade of a tree in an empty building
monks recollect the Buddha Your fear wont exist
If you cant recall the Buddha  best in the world the bull of men 
then you should recall the Dhamma leading outward welltaught
If you cant recall the Dhamma  leading outward welltaught 
then you should recall the Sangha the field of merit unexcelled
When thus recalling the Buddha Dhamma  Sangha monks
therell be no horripilation terror or fear
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at the monastery of Anathapindika
Then he addressed the monks saying O monks
 Venerable Sir said the monks by way of reply to the Blessed One
Thereupon he spoke as follows
Monks I shall relate a former incident There arose a battle between the Devas and Asuras
Then Sakka the Lord of the devas addressed the devas of the Tavatimsa heaven thus
Happy ones if the devas who have gone to the battle should experience fear or terror or suffer from hair standing on end let them behold the crest of my own banner
If you do so any fear terror or hair standing on end arising in you will pass away
If you fail to look up to the crest of my banner look at the crest of the banner of Pajapati King of gods
If you do so any fear terror or hair standing on end arising in you will pass away
If you fail to look up to the crest of Pajapati King of the gods look at the crest of the banner of Varuna King of the gods
If you do so any fear terror or hair standing on end arising in you will pass away 
Monks any fear terror or hair standing on end arising in them who look at the crest of the banner of Sakka  The Lord of the gods of Pajapati  of Varuna  of Isana the King of the gods any fear terror or hair standing on end may pass away or may not pass away
What is the reason for this
Sakka the Lord of gods O monks is not free from lust not free from hate not free from delusion and is therefore liable to fear terror fright and flight
I also say unto you O monks  if any fear terror or hair standing on end should arise in you when you have gone to the forest or to the foot of a tree or to an empty house  then think only of me thus Such Indeed is the Blessed One arahant  supremely enlightened endowed with knowledge and virtue welcome being knower of worlds the peerless trainer of persons teacher of gods and men the Buddha the Blessed One
 Monks if you think of me any fear terror or standing of hair on end that may arise in you will pass away
If you fail to think of me then think of the Dhamma thus Well expounded is the Dhamma by the Blessed One a Dhamma to be realized by oneself and gives immediate results a Dhamma which invites investigation and leads up to Nibbana a Dhamma to be understood by the wise each for himself
Monks if you think of the Dhamma any fear terror or hair standing on end that may arise in you will pass away
If you fail to think of the Dhamma then think of the Sangha thus Of good conduct is the Order of Disciples of the Blessed One of upright conduct is the Order of Disciples of the Blessed One of wise conduct is the Order of Disciples of the Blessed One of dutiful conduct is the Order of Disciples of the Blessed One This Order of Disciples of the Blessed One  namely those four pairs of persons the eight kinds of individuals  is worthy of offerings is worthy of hospitality is worthy of gifts is worthy of reverential salutations is an incomparable field of merit for the world
 Monks if you think of the Sangha any fear terror or hair standing on end that may arise in you will pass away
What is the reason for this
The Tathagata O monks who is arahant supremely enlightened is free from lust free from hate is free from delusion and is not liable to fear terror fright or flight 
So said the Blessed One
Having thus spoken the teacher the Welcome Being  further said
i Whether in forest or at foot of tree Or in some secluded spot O monks
Do call to mind that Buddha Supreme Then will there be no fear to you at all
ii If you think not of the Buddha O monks That Lord of the world and Chief of men
Then do think O monks of that Dhamma So well preached and leading to Nibbana
iii If you think not of the Dhamma O monks Well preached and leading to Nibbana
Then do think O monks of that Sangha That wonderful field of merit to all
iv To those recalling the Buddha supreme To those recalling the Dhamma sublime And to those recalling the Sangha
No fear no terror will make them quiver
At Savatthi
There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
Venerable sir those bhikkhus replied
The Blessed One said this
Bhikkhus once in the past the devas and the asuras were arrayed for battle
Then Sakka lord of the devas addressed the Tavatimsa devas thus
Dear sirs when the devas are engaged in battle if fear or trepidation or terror should arise on that occasion you should look up at the crest of my standard
For when you look up at the crest of my standard whatever fear or trepidation or terror you may have will be abandoned
If you cannot look up at the crest of my standard then you should look up at the crest of the devaking Pajapatis standard
For when you look up at the crest of his standard whatever fear or trepidation or terror you may have will be abandoned
If you cannot look up at the crest of the devaking Pajapatis standard then you should look up at the crest of the devaking Varunas standard 

 If you cannot look up at the crest of the devaking Varunas standard then you should look up at the crest of the devaking Isanas standard 
For when you look up at the crest of his standard whatever fear or trepidation or terror you may have will be abandoned
 Bhikkhus for those who look up at the crest of the standard of Sakka lord of the devas or of Pajapati the devaking or of Varuna the devaking or of Isana the devaking whatever fear or trepidation or terror they may have may or may not be abandoned
For what reason
Because Sakka lord of the devas is not devoid of lust not devoid of hatred not devoid of delusion he can be timid petrified frightened quick to flee
But bhikkhus I say this If you have gone to a forest or to the foot of a tree or to an empty hut and fear or trepidation or terror should arise in you on that occasion you should recollect me thus The Blessed One is an arahant perfectly enlightened accomplished in true knowledge and conduct fortunate knower of the world unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed teacher of devas and humans the Enlightened One the Blessed One
 For when you recollect me bhikkhus whatever fear or trepidation or terror you may have will be abandoned
If you cannot recollect me then you should recollect the Dhamma thus The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One directly visible immediate inviting one to come and see applicable to be personally experienced by the wise
 For when you recollect the Dhamma bhikkhus whatever fear or trepidation or terror you may have will be abandoned
If you cannot recollect the Dhamma then you should recollect the Sangha thus The Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is practising the good way practising the straight way practising the true way practising the proper way that is the four pairs of persons the eight types of individualsthis Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of reverential salutation the unsurpassed field of merit for the world
 For when you recollect the Sangha bhikkhus whatever fear or trepidation or terror you may have will be abandoned
For what reason
Because bhikkhus the Tathagata the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One is devoid of lust devoid of hatred devoid of delusion he is brave courageous bold ready to stand his place
This is what the Blessed One said
Having said this the Fortunate One the Teacher further said this
In a forest at the foot of a tree Or in an empty hut o bhikkhus
You should recollect the Buddha No fear will then arise in you
But if you cannot recall the Buddha Best in the world the bull of men
Then you should recall the Dhamma Emancipating well expounded
But if you cannot recall the Dhamma Emancipating well expounded
Then you should recall the Sarigha The unsurpassed field of merit
For those who thus recall the Buddha The Dhamma and the Sangha bhikkhus
No fear or trepidation will arise Nor any grisly terror

these being filled fill up the pools

these being filled fill up the rivers
and the rivers being filled fill up the great ocean

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Gays at Gayas Head together with a thousand bhikkhus
There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus all is burning
And what bhikkhus is the all that is burning
The eye is burning forms are buming eyeconsciousness is burning eyecontact is burning
and whatever feeling arises with eyecontact as conditionwhether pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasantthat too is burning
Burning with what
Burning with the fire of lust with the fire of hatred with the fire of delusion burning with birth aging and death with sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair I say
Burning with what
Burning with the fire of lust with the fire of hatred with the fire of delusion buming with birth aging and death with sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and despair I say
Seeing thus bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards the eye towards forms towards eyeconsciousness towards eyecontact towards whatever feeling arises with eyecontact as conditionwhether pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant
Experiencing revulsion he becomes dispassionate Through dispassion his mind is  liberated When it is liberated there comes the knowledge Its liberated
He understands Destroyed is birth the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more for this state of being 
This is what the Blessed One said
Elated those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed Ones statement
And while this discourse was being spoken the minds of the thousand bhikkhus were liberated from the taints by nonclinging
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Gaya at Gaya Head with  monks
There he addressed the monks Monks the All is aflame
What All is aflame
The eye is aflame Forms are aflame Consciousness at the eye is aflame Contact at the eye is aflame
And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye  experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain  that too is aflame
Aflame with what
Aflame with the fire of passion the fire of aversion the fire of delusion Aflame I tell you with birth aging  death with sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs
Aflame with what
Aflame with the fire of passion the fire of aversion the fire of delusion Aflame I say with birth aging  death with sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs
Seeing thus the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with the eye disenchanted with forms disenchanted with consciousness at the eye disenchanted with contact at the eye And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain With that too he grows disenchanted
Disenchanted he becomes dispassionate Through dispassion he is fully released With full release there is the knowledge Fully released
He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for this world 
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted at his words
And while this explanation was being given the hearts of the  monks through no clinging  were fully released from fermentationeffluents
The mind is burning  
and whatever feeling arises with mindcontact as condition whether pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant that too is burning
The intellect is aflame Ideas are aflame Consciousness at the intellect is aflame Contact at the intellect is aflame
And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the intellect  experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain  that too is aflame
At Savatthi
Bhikkhus I will teach you the Noble Eightfold Path and I will analyse it for you
And what bhikkhus is the Noble Eightfold Path
Right view  right concentration
And what bhikkhus is right view
Knowledge of suffering knowledge of the origin of suffering knowledge of the cessation of suffering knowledge of the way leading to the cessation of suffering this is called right view
And what bhikkhus is right intention
Intention of renunciation intention of nonill will intention of harmlessness this is called right intention

Abstinence from false speech abstinence from divisive speech abstinence from harsh speech abstinence from idle chatter this is called right speech
And what bhikkhus is right action
Abstinence from the destruction of life abstinence from taking what is not given abstinence from sexual misconduct this is called right action
And what bhikkhus is right livelihood
Here a noble disciple having abandoned a wrong mode of livelihood earns his living by a right livelihood this is called right livelihood 
And what bhikkhus is right effort
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu generates desire for the nonarising of unarisen evil unwholesome states
And what bhikkhus is right mindfulness
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body ardent clearly comprehending mindful having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world He dwells contemplating feelings in feelings ardent clearly comprehending mindful having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world He dwells contemplating mind in mind ardent clearly comprehending mindful having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world He dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena ardent clearly comprehending mindful having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world This is called right mindfulness
And what bhikkhus is right concentration
Here bhikkhus secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhana which is accompanied by thought and examination with rapture and happiness born of seclusion
With the subsiding of thought and examination he enters and dwells in the second jhana which has internal confidence and unification of mind is without thought and examination and has rapture and happiness born of concentration
With the fading away as well of rapture he dwells equanimous and mindful and clearly comprehending he experiences happiness with the body he enters and dwells in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare He is equanimous mindful one who dwells happily
With the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous passing away of joy and displeasure he enters and dwells in the fourth jhana which is neither painful nor pleasant and includes the purification of mindfulness by equanimity This is called right concentration
On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrel Sanctuary
Now on that occasion the Venerable Mahakassapa was dwelling in the Pipphali Cave sick afflicted gravely ill
Then in the evening the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and approached the Venerable Mahakassapa He sat down in the appointed seat
and said to the Venerable Mahakassapa
I hope you are bearing up Kassapa I hope you are getting better
I hope that your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing and that their subsiding not their increase is to be discerned
Venerable sir I am not bearing up I am not getting better
Strong painful feelings are increasing in me not subsiding and their increase not their subsiding is to be discerned
These seven factors of enlightenment Kassapa have been rightly expounded by me when developed and cultivated they lead to direct knowledge to enlightenment to Nibbana
What seven
The enlightenment factor of mindfulness has been rightly expounded by me when developed and cultivated it leads to direct knowledge to enlightenment to Nibbana 
This is what the Blessed One said
Elated the Venerable Mahakassapa delighted in the Blessed Ones statement
And the Venerable Mahakassapa recovered from that illness
In such a way the Venerable Mahakassapa was cured of his illness
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary
And on that occasion Ven Maha Kassapa was staying in the Pepper Tree Cave diseased in pain severely ill
Then the Blessed One in the late afternoon left his seclusion and went to where Ven Maha Kassapa was staying On arrival he sat down on a prepared seat
and said to Ven Maha Kassapa
I hope you are getting better Kassapa I hope you are comfortable
I hope that your pains are lessening and not increasing I hope that there are signs of their lessening and not of their increasing 
I am not getting better lord I am not comfortable
My extreme pains are increasing not lessening There are signs of their increasing and not of their lessening 
Kassapa these seven factors for Awakening rightly taught by me when developed and pursued lead to direct knowledge to selfAwakening to Unbinding
Which seven
Mindfulness as a factor for Awakening rightly taught by me when developed and pursued leads to direct knowledge to selfAwakening to Unbinding
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Ven Maha Kassapa delighted in the Blessed Ones words
And Ven Maha Kassapa recovered from his disease
That was how Ven Maha Kassapas disease was abandoned

Then in the morning a number of bhikkhus dressed and taking their bowls and robes entered Savatthi for alms
Then it occurred to them It is still too early to walk for alms in Savatthi
Let us go to the park of the wanderers of other sects
Then those bhikkhus went to the park of the wanderers of other sects
They exchanged greetings with those wanderers and when they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk sat down to one side
The wanderers then said to them
Friends the ascetic Gotama teaches the Dhamma to his disciples thus Come bhikkhus abandon the five hindrances the corruptions of the mind that weaken wisdom and develop correctly the seven factors of enlightenment
We too teach the Dhamma to our disciples thus Come friends abandon the five hindrances the corruptions of the mind that weaken wisdom and develop correctly the seven factors of enlightenment
So friends what here is the distinction the disparity the difference between the ascetic Gotama and us that is regarding the one Dhamma teaching and the other regarding the one manner of instruction and the other 
Then those bhikkhus neither delighted in nor rejected the statement of those wanderers Without delighting in it without rejecting it they rose from their seats and left thinking We shall learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of the Blessed One
Then when those bhikkhus had walked for alms in Savatthi and had returned from the alms round after their meal they approached the Blessed One Having paid homage to him they sat down to one side
and reported to him the entire discussion between those wanderers and themselves
The Blessed One said Bhikkhus when wanderers of other sects speak thus they should be asked Friends is there a method of exposition by means of which the five hindrances become ten and the seven factors of enlightenment become fourteen
Being asked thus those wanderers would not be able to reply and further they would meet with vexation
For what reason
Because that would not be within their domain
I do not see anyone bhikkhus in this world with its devas Mara and Brahma in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins its devas and humans who could satisfy the mind with an answer to these questions except the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata or one who has heard it from them
And what bhikkhus is the method of exposition by means of which the five hindrances become ten
Whatever sensual desire there is for the internal is a hindrance whatever sensual desire there is for the external is also a hindrance
Thus what is spoken of concisely as the hindrance of sensual desire
becomes by this method of exposition twofold
Whatever ill will there is towards the internal is a hindrance whatever ill will there is towards the external is also a hindrance
Thus what is spoken of concisely as the hindrance of ill will
becomes by this method of exposition twofold
Whatever sloth there is is a hindrance whatever torpor there is is also a hindrance
Thus what is spoken of concisely as the hindrance of sloth and torpor
becomes by this method of exposition twofold
Whatever restlessness there is is a hindrance whatever remorse there is is also a hindrance
Thus what is spoken of concisely as the hindrance of restlessness and remorse
becomes by ths method of exposition twofold
Whatever doubt there is about the internal is a hindrance whatever doubt there is about the external is also a hindrance
Thus what is spoken of concisely as the hindrance of doubt
becomes by this method of exposition twofold
And what bhikkhus is the method of exposition by means of which the seven factors of enlightenment become fourteen
Whatever mindfulness there is of things internal is the enlightenment factor of mindfulness whatever mindfulness there is of things external is also the enlightenment factor of mindfulness
Thus what is spoken of concisely as the enlightenment factor of mindfulness
becomes by this method of exposition twofold
Whenever one discriminates things internally with wisdom examines them makes an investigation of them that is the enlightenment factor of discrimination of states whenever one discriminates things externally with wisdom examines them makes an investigation of them that is also the enlightenment factor of discrimination of states
Thus what is spoken of concisely as the enlightenment factor of discrimination of states
becomes by this method of exposition twofold
Whatever bodily energy there is is the enlightenment factor of energy whatever mental energy there is is also the enlightenment factor of energy
Thus what is spoken of concisely as the enlightenment factor of energy
becomes by this method of exposition twofold
Whatever rapture there is accompanied by thought and examination is the enlightenment factor of rapture whatever rapture there is without thought and examination is also the enlightenment factor of rapture
Thus what is spoken of concisely as the enlightenment factor of rapture
becomes by this method of exposition twofold
Whatever tranquillity of body there is is the enlightenment factor of tranquillity whatever tranquillity of mind there is is also the enlightenment factor of tranquillity
Thus what is spoken of concisely as the enlightenment factor of tranquillity
becomes by this method of exposition twofold
Whatever concentration there is accompanied by thought and examination is the enlightenment factor of concentration whatever concentration there is without thought and examination is also the enlightenment factor of concentration
Thus what is spoken of concisely as the enlightenment factor of concentration
becomes by this method of exposition twofold
Whatever equanimity there is regarding things internal is the enlightenment factor of equanimity whatever equanimity there is regarding things external is also the enlightenment factor of equanimity
Thus what is spoken of concisely as the enlightenment factor of equanimity
becomes by this method of exposition twofold
This bhikkhus is the method of exposition by means of which the seven factors of enlightenment become fourteen
Thus have I heard At one time the Blessed One was dwelling at Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana
There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus of the group of five thus Bhikkhus these two extremes should not be followed by one gone forth  What two
That which is this pursuit of sensual happiness in sense pleasures which is low vulgar the way of the ordinary person ignoble not connected to the goal and that which is this pursuit of selfmortification which is painful ignoble not connected to the goal
Bhikkhus without veering towards either of these two extremes the One Attuned to Reality has awakened to the middle way which gives rise to vision which gives rise to knowledge which leads to peace to higher knowledge to full awakening to Nibbāna
And what bhikkhus is that middle way awakened to by the One Attuned to Reality which gives rise to vision which gives rise to knowledge which leads to peace to higher knowledge to full awakening to Nibbāna
It is just this Noble Eightfactored Path that is to say right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right mental unification
This bhikkhus is that middle way awakened to by the One Attuned to Reality which gives rise to vision which gives rise to knowledge which leads to peace to higher knowledge to full awakening to Nibbāna
Now this bhikkhus for the spiritually ennobled ones is the true reality which is pain birth is painful aging is painful illness is painful death is painful sorrow lamentation physical pain unhappiness and distress are painful union with what is disliked is painful separation from what is liked is painful not to get what one wants is painful in brief the five bundles of graspingfuel are painful
Now this bhikkhus for the spiritually ennobled ones is the painoriginating true reality It is this craving which leads to renewed existence accompanied by delight and attachment seeking delight now here now there that is craving for sensepleasures craving for existence craving for extermination 
Now this bhikkhus for the spiritually ennobled ones is the painceasing true reality It is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving the giving up and relinquishing of it freedom from it nonreliance on it
Now this bhikkhus for the spiritually ennobled ones is the true reality which is the way leading to the cessation of pain It is this Noble Eightfactored Path that is to say right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right mental unification
This for the spiritually ennobled ones is the true reality of pain in me bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before there arose vision knowledge wisdom true knowledge and light
Now on this This  for the spiritually ennobled ones the true reality of pain  is to be fully understood in me bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before there arose vision knowledge wisdom true knowledge and light
Now on this This  for the spiritually ennobled ones the true reality of pain  has been fully understood in me bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before there arose vision knowledge wisdom true knowledge and light
 in me bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before there arose vision knowledge wisdom true knowledge and light with respect to This for the spiritually ennobled ones is the painoriginating true reality
This  for the spiritually ennobled ones the painoriginating true reality  is to be abandoned
and This  for the spiritually ennobled ones the painoriginating true reality  has been abandoned
 in me bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before there arose vision knowledge wisdom true knowledge and light with respect to This for the spiritually ennobled ones is the painceasing true reality
This  for the spiritually ennobled ones the painceasing true reality  is to be personally experienced and
This  for the spiritually ennobled ones the painceasing true reality  has been personally experienced
 in me bhikkhus in regard to things unheard before there arose vision knowledge wisdom true knowledge and light with respect to This for the spiritually ennobled ones is the true reality which is the way leading to the cessation of pain
This  for the spiritually ennobled ones the true reality which is the way leading to the cessation of pain  is to be developed and
This  for the spiritually ennobled ones the true reality which is way leading to the cessation of pain  has been developed
So long bhikkhus as my knowledge and seeing of these four true realities for the spiritually ennobled ones as they really are in their three phases and twelve modes was not thoroughly purified in this way then so long in the world with its devas māras and brahmās in this population with its renunciants and brahmans its devas and humans I did not claim to be fully awakened to the unsurpassed perfect awakening
But when bhikkhus my knowledge and vision of these four true realities for the spiritually ennobled ones as they really are in their three phases and twelve modes was thoroughly purified in this way then in the world with its devas māras and brahmās in this population with its renunciants and brahmans its devas and humans I claimed to be fully awakened to the unsurpassed perfect awakening
Indeed knowledge and seeing arose in me Unshakeable is the liberation of my mind this is my last birth now there is no more renewed existence 
This is what the Blessed One said
Elated the bhikkhus of the group of five delighted in the Blessed Ones statement
And while this explanation was being spoken there arose in the venerable Koṇḍañña the dustfree stainless vision of the Basic Pattern whatever is patterned with an origination all that is patterned with a cessation
And when the Wheel of the Basic Pattern had been set in motion by the Blessed One the earthdwelling devas raised a cry At Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana the unsurpassed Wheel of the Basic Pattern has been set in motion by the Blessed One which cannot be stopped by any renunciant or brahman or māra or brahmā or by anyone in the world
 Having heard the cry of the earthdwelling devas the devas of the Four Great Kings raised the same cry
Having heard it the Thirtythree devas took it up then the Yāma devas then the Contented devas then the devas Who Delight in Creating then the devas With Mastery in the Creations of Others and then the devas of the brahmā group
Thus at that moment at that instant at that second the cry spread as far as the brahmā world
and this ten thousandfold world system shook quaked and trembled and an immeasurable glorious radiance appeared in the world surpassing the divine majesty of the devas
Then the Blessed One uttered this inspiring utterance the honorable Koṇḍañña has indeed understood The honorable Koṇḍañña has indeed understood
In this way the venerable Koṇḍañña acquired the name Koṇḍañña Who Has Understood
At Kapilavatthu
Now on that occasion Sarakani the Sakyan had died
and the Blessed One had declared him to be a streamenterer no longer bound to the nether world fixed in destiny with enlightenment as his destination
Thereupon a number of Sakyans having met and assembled deplored this grumbled and complained about it saying It is wonderful indeed sir It is amazing indeed sir
Now who here wont be a streamenterer
the Blessed One has declared to be a streamenterer  with enlightenment as his destination
Sarakani the Sakyan was one who had failed to fulfil the training 
Then Mahanama the Sakyan approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to one side
and reported this matter to him
The Blessed One said Mahanama when over a long time a lay follower has gone for refuge to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha how could he go to the nether world
For if one speaking rightly were to say of anyone He was a lay follower who had gone for refuge over a long time to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha it is of Sarakani the Sakyan that one could rightly say this
Mahanama over a long time Sarakani the Sakyan had gone for refuge to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha SO how could he go to the nether world
Here Mahanama some person is completely dedicated to the Buddha and has full confidence in him thus The Blessed one is   teacher of devas and humans the Enlightened the Blessed One
And so in regard to the Dhamma and the Sangha He is one of joyous wisdom of swift wisdom and he attained liberation
By the destruction of the taints in very life he enters and dwells in the taintless liberation of mind liberation by wisdom realizing it for himself with direct howledge
This person Mahanama is freed from hell the animal realm and the domain of ghosts freed from the plane of misery the bad destinations the nether world
Here Mahansma some person is completely dedicated to the Buddha and has full confidence in him
 And so in regard to the Dhamma and the Sangha He is one of joyous wisdom of swift wisdom yet he has not attained liberation
With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he has become one who attains final knowledge early in this very life or one who attains final knowledge at the time of death or an attainer of Nibbana in the interval or an attainer of Nibbana upon landing or an attain er of Nibbana without exertion or an attainer of Nibbana with exertion or one bound upstream heading towards the Akanittha realm
This person too Mahanama is freed from hell the animal realm and the domain of ghosts freed from the plane of misery the bad destinations the nether world
Here Mahanama some person is completely dedicated to the Buddha and has full confidence in him
 And so in regard to the Dhamma and the Sangha He is not one of joyous wisdom nor of swift wisdom and he has not attained liberation
With the utter destruction of three fetters and with the diminishing of greed hatred and delusion he is a oncereturner who after coming back to this world only one more time will make an end to suffering
This person too Mahanama is freed from hell the animal realm and the domain of ghosts freed from the plane of misery the bad destinations the nether world
Here Mahanama some person is completely dedicated to the Buddha and has full confidence in him
   And so in regard to the Dhamma and the Sangha He is not one of joyous wisdom nor of swift wisdom and he has not attained liberation
With the utter destruction of three fetters he is a streamenterer no longer bound to the nether world fixed in destiny with enlightenment as his destination
This person too Mahanama is freed from hell the animal realm and the domain of ghosts freed from the plane of misery the bad destinations the nether world
Here Mahanama some person is not completely dedicated to the Buddha and does not have full confidence in him thus The Blessed One is    teacher of devas and humans the Enlightened One the Blessed One And so in regard to the Dhamma and the Sangha He is not one of joyous wisdom nor of swift wisdom and he has not attained liberation However he has these five things the faculty of faith  the faculty of wisdom
And the after teachings proclaimed by the Tathagata are accepted by being pondered to a sufficient degree with wisdom
This person too Mahanama is one who does not go to hell the animal realm or the domain of ghosts to the plane of misery the bad destinations the nether world
Here Mahanama some person is not completely dedicated to the Buddha and does not have full confidence in him  And so in regard to the Dhamma and the Sangha He is not one of joyous wisdom nor of swift wisdom and he has not attained liberation However he has these five things the faculty of faith   the faculty of wisdom
And he has sufficient faith in the Tathagata sufficient devotion to him
This person too Mahanama is one who does not go to hell the animal realm or the domain of ghosts to the plane of misery the bad destinations the nether world
Suppose Mahanama there is a bad field a bad piece of ground with stumps not cleared and the seeds sown there would be broken spoilt damaged by wind and sun unfertile not planted securely and the sky would not send down a proper rainfall
Would those seeds come to growth increase and expansion
 No venerable sir
So too Mahanama here a Dhamma is badly expounded badly proclaimed unemancipating not conducive to peace by one who is not perfectly enlightened This I say is like the bad field
And the disciple dwells in that Dhamma practising in accordance with it practising it properly conducting himself accordingly This I say is like the bad seed
Suppose Mahandma there is a good field a good piece of ground well cleared of stumps and the seeds sown there would be unbroken unspoilt undamaged by wind and sun fertile planted securely and the sky would send down a proper rainfall
Would those seeds come to growth increase and expansion
Yes venerable sir
So too Mahansma here a Dhamma is well expounded well proclaimed emancipating conducive to peace proclaimed by one who is perfectly enlightened This I say is like the good field
And the disciple dwells in that Dhamma practising in accordance with it practising it properly conducting himself accordingly This I say is like the good seed
How much more then Sarakani the Sakyan
Mahanama Sarakani the Sakyan was one who fulfilled the training at the time of death
Sarakani the Sakyan after he died
Ruler of the Gods I declare that there are two kinds of I happiness the kind to be pursued and the kind to be I avoided
The same applies to unhappiness
and equanimity
Why have I declared this in regard to happiness
This is how I understood happiness When I observed that in the pursuit of such happiness unwholesome factors increased and wholesome factors decreased then that happines was to be avoided
And whe I abserved that in the pursuit of such happiness unwholesome factors decreased and wholesome ones increased then that happines was to be sought after
Now of such happiness as is accompanied by thinking and pondering and of that which is not so accompanied the latter is the more excellent
The same applies to unhappiness
And this Ruler of the Gods is the practice that monk has undertaken who has reached the right way leading to the cessation of the tendency to proliferation
And Sakka expressed his delight at the Lords answer
and to equanimity
And that man might say Sir there is something called the Gandhara charm
It is by means of this that that monk becomes many
What do you think Kevaddha would not a sceptic say that to a believer
He would Lord
And that man might say Sir there is something called the Manika charm It is by means of this that that monk can read the minds of others 
And that is why seeing the danger of such miracles I despise them
And I Kevaddha have experienced these three miracles by my own superknowledge
but they replied We dont know
but the ThirtyThree Gods
may know
who said We dont know
but Sakka lord of the gods
may know
Vasavatti said
The devas of Brahmas retinue
may know
Thus have I heard At Savatthi
There the Blessed One said this Bhikkhus form is impermanent feeling is impermanent perception is impermanent volitional formations are impermanent consciousness is impermanent
Seeing thus bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards form revulsion towards feeling revulsion towards perception revulsion towards volitional formations revulsion towards consciousness
Experiencing revulsion he becomes dispassionate Through dispassion his mind is liberated
When it is liberated there comes the knowledge Its liberated
He understands Destroyed is birth the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more for this state of being 
 asked you where the four great elements cease without remainder
I asked where the four great elements  earth water fire air  cease without remainder
and the householder Kevaddha delighted rejoiced at his words
this is called the path leading to the unconditioned
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Pava in Cunda the silversmiths mango grove
Then Cunda the silversmith went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Cunda of whose rites of purification do you approve 
The brahmans of the Western lands lord  those who carry water pots wear garlands of water plants worship fire  purify with water they have declared purification rites of which I approve 
And what kind of purification rites have they declared those brahmans of the Western lands who carry water pots wear garlands of water plants worship fire  purify with water 
There is the case where the brahmans of the Western lands 
get their disciples to undertake their practice thus Come now my good man Get up at the proper time from your bed and touch the earth If you dont touch the earth touch wet cow dung If you dont touch wet cow dung touch green grass If you dont touch green grass worship a fire If you dont worship a fire pay homage to the sun with clasped hands If you dont pay homage to the sun with clasped hands go down into the water three times by nightfall
These are the purification rites declared by the brahmans of the Western lands  of which I approve 
Cunda the purification rites declared by the brahmans of the Western lands  are one thing the purification in the discipline of the noble ones is something else entirely 
But how is there purification in the discipline of the noble ones lord
It would be good if the Blessed One would teach me how there is purification in the discipline of the noble ones 
Then in that case Cunda listen  pay close attention I will speak 
As you say lord Cunda the silversmith responded
The Blessed One said
There are three ways in which one is made impure by bodily action four ways in which one is made impure by verbal action and three ways in which one is made impure by mental action
And how is one made impure in three ways by bodily action
There is the case where a certain person takes life is a hunter bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beings
He takes what is not given
He takes in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by them
He engages in sensual misconduct
He gets sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their Dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another man
This is how one is made impure in three ways by bodily action
And how is one made impure in four ways by verbal action
There is the case where a certain person engages in false speech
When he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty ie a royal court proceeding if he is asked as a witness Come  tell good man what you know If he doesnt know he says I know  If he does know he says I dont know  If he hasnt seen he says I have seen  If he has seen he says I havent seen
Thus he consciously tells lies for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of a certain reward
He engages in divisive speech
What he has heard here he tells there to break those people apart from these people here What he has heard there he tells here to break these people apart from those people there
Thus breaking apart those who are united and stirring up strife between those who have broken apart he loves factionalism delights in factionalism enjoys factionalism speaks things that create factionalism
He engages in abusive speech
He speaks words that are harsh cutting bitter to others abusive of others provoking anger and destroying concentration
He engages in idle chatter He speaks out of season speaks what isnt factual what isnt in accordance with the goal the Dhamma  the Vinaya words that are not worth treasuring
This is how one is made impure in four ways by verbal action
And how is one made impure in three ways by mental action
There is the case where a certain person is covetous
He covets the belongings of others thinking O that what belongs to others would be mine
He bears ill will corrupt in the resolves of his heart May these beings be killed or cut apart or crushed or destroyed or may they not exist at all
He has wrong view is warped in the way he sees things There is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions There is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no brahmans or contemplatives who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves
This is how one is made impure in three ways by mental action
These Cunda are the ten courses of unskillful action
When a person is endowed with these ten courses of unskillful action then even if he gets up at the proper time from his bed and touches the earth he is still impure If he doesnt touch the earth he is still impure
If he touches wet cow dung he is still impure If he doesnt touch wet cow dung he is still impure
If he touches green grass  If he doesnt touch green grass 
If he worships a fire  If he doesnt worship a fire 
If he pays homage to the sun with clasped hands  If he doesnt pay homage to the sun with clasped hands 
If he goes down into the water three times by nightfall  If he doesnt go down into the water three times by nightfall he is still impure
Why is that
Because these ten courses of unskillful action are impure and cause impurity
Furthermore as a result of being endowed with these ten courses of unskillful action rebirth in hell is declared rebirth in an animal womb is declared rebirth in the realm of hungry shades is declared  that or any other bad destination
Now Cunda there are three ways in which one is made pure by bodily action four ways in which one is made pure by verbal action and three ways in which one is made pure by mental action
And how is one made pure in three ways by bodily action
There is the case where a certain person abandoning the taking of life abstains from the taking of life He dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beings
Abandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not given
He does not take in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by them
Abandoning sensual misconduct he abstains from sensual misconduct He does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their Dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another man
This is how one is made pure in three ways by bodily action
And how is one made pure in four ways by verbal action
There is the case where a certain person abandoning false speech abstains from false speech
When he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty if he is asked as a witness Come  tell good man what you know If he doesnt know he says I dont know  If he does know he says I know  If he hasnt seen he says I havent seen  If he has seen he says I have seen
Thus he doesnt consciously tell a lie for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of any reward
Abandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speech What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people here What he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people there
Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concord
Abandoning abusive speech he abstains from abusive speech
He speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing  pleasing to people at large
Abandoning idle chatter he abstains from idle chatter He speaks in season speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the Dhamma  the Vinaya He speaks words worth treasuring seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goal
This is how one is made pure in four ways by verbal action
And how is one made pure in three ways by mental action
There is the case where a certain person is not covetous
He does not covet the belongings of others thinking O that what belongs to others would be mine
He bears no ill will and is not corrupt in the resolves of his heart He thinks May these beings be free from animosity free from oppression free from trouble and may they look after themselves with ease
He has right view and is not warped in the way he sees things There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificed There are fruits  results of good  bad actions There is this world  the next world There is mother  father There are spontaneously reborn beings there are brahmans  contemplatives who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves
This is how one is made pure in three ways by mental action
These Cunda are the ten courses of skillful action
When a person is endowed with these ten courses of skillful action then even if he gets up at the proper time from his bed and touches the earth he is still pure If he doesnt touch the earth he is still pure
If he touches wet cow dung he is still pure If he doesnt touch wet cow dung he is still pure
If he touches green grass  If he doesnt touch green grass 
If he worships a fire  If he doesnt worship a fire 
If he pays homage to the sun with clasped hands  If he doesnt pay homage to the sun with clasped hands 
If he goes down into the water three times by nightfall  If he doesnt go down into the water three times by nightfall he is still pure
Why is that
Because these ten courses of skillful action are pure and cause purity
Furthermore as a result of being endowed with these ten courses of skillful action rebirth among the devas is declared rebirth among human beings is declared  that or any other good destination 
When this was said Cunda the silversmith said to the Blessed One Magnificent lord Magnificent Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the community of monks May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life
Bhikkhus there are these four strivings
What four
Striving by restraint striving by abandonment striving by development and striving by protection
And what bhikkhus is striving by restraint
Here having seen a form with the eye a bhikkhu does not grasp its marks and features
Since if he left the eye faculty unrestrained bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him he practices restraint over it he guards the eye faculty he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty
Having heard a sound with the ear  Having smelled an odor with the nose   Having tasted a taste with the tongue   Having felt a tactile object with the body   Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind a bhikkhu does not grasp its marks and features Since if he left the mind faculty unrestrained bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him he practices restraint over it he guards the mind faculty he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty
This is called striving by restraint
And what is striving by abandonment
Here a bhikkhu does not tolerate an arisen sensual thought he abandons it dispels it terminates it and obliterates it He does not tolerate an arisen thought of ill will  an arisen thought of harming   bad unwholesome states whenever they arise he abandons them dispels them  terminates them and obliterates them 
This is called striving by abandonment
And what is striving by development
Here a bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness which is based upon seclusion dispassion and cessation maturing in release He develops the enlightenment factor of discrimination of phenomena   the enlightenment factor of energy  the enlightenment factor of rapture  the enlightenment factor of tranquility  the enlightenment factor of concentration  the enlightenment factor of equanimity which is based upon seclusion dispassion and cessation maturing in release
This is called striving by development
 And what is striving by protection
Here a bhikkhu protects an arisen excellent object of concentration the perception of a skeleton the perception of a worminfested corpse the perception of a livid corpse the perception of a festering corpse the perception of a fissured corpse the perception of a bloated corpse
This is called striving by protection
These bhikkhus are the four kinds of striving
Restraint and abandonment development and protection
these four strivings were taught by the Kinsman of the Sun
By these means an ardent bhikkhu here can attain the destruction of suffering

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Park
Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Blessed One paid homage to him and sat down to one side
The Blessed One then said to him Householder there are these five utilizations of wealth
What five
Here householder with wealth acquired by energetic striving amassed by the strength of his arms earned by the sweat of his brow righteous wealth righteously gained the noble disciple makes himself happy and pleased and properly maintains himself in happiness he makes his parents happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiness he makes his wife and children his slaves workers and servants happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiness
This is the first utilization of wealth
Again with wealth acquired by energetic striving  righteously gained the noble disciple makes his friends and companions happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiness
This is the second utilization of wealth
Again with wealth acquired by energetic striving  righteously gained the noble disciple makes provisions with his wealth against the losses that might arise because of fire or floods kings or bandits or unloved heirs he makes himself secure against them
This is the third utilization of wealth
Again with wealth acquired by energetic striving  righteously gained the noble disciple makes the five oblations
to relatives guests ancestors the king and the deities This is the fourth utilization of wealth
Again with wealth acquired by energetic striving   righteously gained the noble disciple establishes an uplifting offering of almsan offering that is heavenly resulting in happiness conducive to heavento those ascetics and brahmins who refrain from intoxication and heedlessness who are settled in patience and mildness who tame themselves calm themselves and train themselves for nibbāna
This is the fifth utilization of wealth
These householder are the five utilizations of wealth
Householder if a noble disciples wealth is exhausted when he has utilized it in these five ways he thinks I have utilized wealth in these five ways and my wealth is exhausted
Thus he has no regret
But if a noble disciples wealth increases when he has utilized it in these five ways he thinks I have utilized wealth in these five ways and my wealth has increased
Thus either way he has no regret 
Ive enjoyed wealth supported my dependents and overcome adversities
I have given an uplifting offering and performed the five oblations
I have served the virtuous monks the selfcontrolled celibate ones
whatever purpose a wise person dwelling at home might have in desiring wealth
I have achieved what I have done brings me no regret

Now Ananda if you go to the monk Girimananda and tell him these ten perceptions its possible that when he hears these ten perceptions his disease may be allayed 
Then Ven Ananda having learned these ten perceptions in the Blessed Ones presence went to Ven Girimananda and told them to him
As Ven Girimananda heard these ten perceptions his disease was allayed
And Ven Girimananda recovered from his disease
That was how Ven Girimanandas disease was abandoned
Thus I heard At one time the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jetas grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Park
But on that occasion the Venerable Girimānanda was afflicted suffering and gravely ill
Then the Venerable nanda went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him sat down at one side
When he had done so the Venerable nanda said to the Blessed One
Venerable Sir the Venerable Girimānanda is afflicted suffering and gravely ill
It would be good Venerable Sir if the Blessed One were to go to the Venerable Girimānanda out of compassion

If nanda you go to the bhikkhu Girimānanda and tell him these ten contemplations it is possible that the bhikkhu Girimānandas affliction may be immediately cured on hearing them 
Then when the Venerable nanda had learnt these ten contemplations from the Blessed One he went to the Venerable Girimānanda and told them to him
Then when the Venerable Girimānanda had heard these ten contemplations his affliction was immediately cured
The Venerable Girimānanda rose from that affliction
and that is how his affliction was cured
Thus have I heard At one time the Exalted One was staying near Savatthi at the Eastern monastery in the mansion Migaras mother
Then Visakha Migaras mother approached the Exalted One having approached and bowed down she sat down in a suitable place
When she was seated the Exalted One spoke thus to Visakha Migaras Mother Visakha when the Uposatha undertaken with its eight component practices is entered on it is of great fruit of great advantage of great splendor of great range
And how Visakha is the Uposatha undertaken with its eight component practices entered on is of great fruit great advantage great splendor and great range
Here Visakha a noble disciple considers thus For all their lives the Arahants dwell having abandoned killing living beings refrain from killing living beings they have laid down their staffs laid down their weapons they are conscientious sympathetic compassionate for the good of all living beings
So today I dwell for this night and day having abandoned killing living beings refraining from killing living beings I am one who has laid down my staff laid down my weapon I am conscientious sympathetic compassionate for the good of all living beings
By this practice following after the Arahants the Uposatha will be entered on by me
It is undertaken by this first practice  For all their lives the Arahants dwell having abandoned taking what is not given refrain from taking what is not given they are takers of what is given those who expect only what is given themselves become clean without thieving So today I dwell for this night and day having abandoned taking what is not given refraining from taking what is not given I am a taker of what is given one who expects only what is given by myself become clean without thieving By this practice following after the Arahants the Uposatha will be entered on by me It is undertaken by this second practice  For all their lives the Arahants dwell having abandoned unchaste conduct they are of chaste conduct living aloof refrain from sex which is the way of common society So today I dwell for this night and day having abandoned unchaste conduct I am of chaste conduct living aloof refraining from sex which is the common way of society By this practice following after the Arahants the Uposatha will be entered on by me It is undertaken by this third practice  For all their lives the Arahants dwell having abandoned false speech refrain from false speech they are speakers of truth joiners of truth firmintruth groundedontruth not speakers of lies to the world So today I dwell for this night and day having abandoned false speech refraining from false speech a speaker of truth a joiner of truth firmintruth groundedontruth not a speaker of lies to the world By this practice following after the Arahants the Uposatha will be entered on by me It is undertaken by this fourth practice  For all their lives the Arahants dwell having abandoned distilled and fermented intoxicants which are the occasion for carelessness and refrain from them So today I dwell for this night and day having abandoned distilled and fermented intoxicants which are the occasion for carelessness refraining from them By this practice following after the Arahants the Uposatha will be entered on by me It is undertaken by this fifth practice  For all their lives the Arahants are onemealers refrain from eating outside the time desisting at night So today I am a onemealer refraining from eating outside the time desisting at night By this practice following after the Arahants the Uposatha will be entered on by me It is undertaken by this sixth practice  For all their lives the Arahants refrain from dancing singing music going to see entertainments wearing garments smartening with perfumes and beautifying with cosmetics So today I refrain from dancing singing music going to see entertainments wearing ornaments smartening with perfumes and beautifying with cosmetics By this practice following after the Arahants the Uposatha will be entered on by me It is undertaken by this seventh practice
 For all their lives the Arahants having abandoned high beds and large beds refraining from high beds and large beds they make use of a low sleeping place a bed or a strewing of grass
So today I have abandoned high beds and large beds refraining from high beds and large beds I make use of a low sleeping place a bed or a strewing of grass
By this practice following after the Arahants the Uposatha will be entered on by me
It is undertaken by this eighth practice
Thus indeed Visakha is the Uposatha entered on and undertaken with its eight component practices of great fruit of great advantage of great splendor of great range
How great a fruit How great an advantage How great a splendor How great a range
Just as though Visakha one might have power dominion and kingship over sixteen great countries abounding in the seven treasures  that is to say Anga Magadha Kasi Kosala Vajji Malla Ceti Vansa Kure Pañcala Maccha Surasena Assaka Avanti Gandhara and Kamboja yet it is not worth a sixteenth part of the Uposatha undertaken with its eight practices
For what reason
Miserable is kingship over men compared with heavenly bliss
That which among men is fifty years Visakha is one night and day of the devas of the Four Great Kings
Their month has thirty of those days
Their year twelve of those months
The lifespan of the devas of the Four Great Kings is five hundred of those heavenly years
Now here a certain woman or man having entered on the Uposatha undertaken with its eight practices at the break up of the body after death may arise to fellowship with the devas of the Four Great Kings  such a thing indeed is known Visakha
It was in connection with this that I have said Miserable is kingship over men compared with heavenly bliss
That which among men is a hundred years Visakha is one night and day of the devas of the Thirtythree
Their month has thirty of those days
Their year twelve of those months
The lifespan of the devas of the Thirtythree is one thousand of those heavenly years
Now here a certain woman or man having entered on the Uposatha undertaken with the eight practices at the break up of the body after death may arise to fellowship with the devas of the Thirtythree  such a thing indeed is known Visakha
It was in connection with this that I have said Miserable is kingship over men compared with heavenly bliss
That which among men is two hundred years Visakha is one night and day of the Yama devas Their month has thirty of those days Their year twelve of those months The lifespan of the Yama devas is two thousand of those heavenly years Now here a certain woman or man having entered on the Uposatha undertaken with the eight practices at the breakup of the body after death may arise to fellowship with the Yama devas  such a thing indeed is known Visakha It was in connection with this that I have said Miserable is kingship over men compared with heavenly bliss That which among men is four hundred years Visakha is one night and day of the Tusita devas Their month has thirty of those days Their year twelve of those months The lifespan of the Tusita devas is four thousand of those heavenly years Now here a certain woman or man having entered on the Uposatha undertaken with the eight practices at the break up of the body after death may arise to fellowship with the Tusita devas  such a thing indeed is known Visakha It was in connection with this that I have said Miserable is kingship over men compared with heavenly bliss That which among men is eight hundred years Visakha is one night and day of the Nimmanarati devas Their month has thirty of those days Their year twelve of those months The lifespan of the Nimmanarati devas is eight thousand of those heavenly years Now here a certain woman or man having entered on the Uposatha undertaken with the eight practices at the break up of the body after death may arise to fellowship with the Nimmanarati devas  such a thing indeed is known Visakha It was in connection with this that I have said Miserable is kingship over men compared with heavenly bliss That which among men is sixteen hundred years Visakha is one night and day of the Paranimmitavasavatti devas
Their month has thirty of those days
Their year twelve of those months
The lifespan of the Paranimmitavasavatti devas is sixteen thousand of those heavenly years
Now here a certain woman or man having entered on the Uposatha undertaken with the eight practices at the break up of the body after death may arise to fellowship with the Paranimmitavasavatti devas  such a thing indeed is known Visakha
It was in connection with this that I have said Miserable is kingship over men compared with heavenly bliss
Kill no life nor take what is not given
speak no lie nor be an alcoholic
refrain from sex and unchaste conduct
at night do not eat outoftime food
neither bear garlands nor indulge with perfume
and make your bed a mat upon the ground
this indeed is called the eightpart uposatha
taught by the Buddha gone to dukkhas end
The radiance of the sun and moon
both beautiful to see follow on from each other dispelling the darkness
as they go through the heavens
illumining the sky and brightening the quarters
and the treasure found between them
pearls and crystals and auspicious turquoises
gold nuggets and the gold called ore
monetary gold with gold dust carried down 
compared with the eightpart uposatha though they are enjoyed
are not a sixteenth part 
as the shining of the moon in all the groups of stars
Hence indeed the woman and the man who are virtuous
enter on uposatha having eight parts
and having made merits bringing forth happiness
blameless they obtain heavenly abodes
They stand beyond the walls and at the junctions and crossroads
they stand at the doorposts having come to their former homes
But when abundant food and drink both staple and nonstaple is prepared
no one remembers these beings because of their past unwholesome deeds
Thus those who are compassionate give to their departed relatives
at the right time pure excellent suitable drink and food
Thinking May this go to our relatives may our relatives be happy
Those who have gathered the departed relatives who have assembled
around the food and drink respectfully offer their thanks
saying  May our relatives live long Those to whom we owe this gain
for we have been honoured those who give are not without reward
For in that place there is no ploughing and cattlerearing is not found there
similarly there is no trading or buying and selling of gold
The departed in that place who have died have to subsist on gifts
Just as water that rains on the highlands flows down to the lowlands
so too what has been given here is of benefit to the departed
Just as rivers that are full flow and fill up the ocean
so too what has been given here is of benefit to the departed
Thinking He gave to me he worked for me he was my relative my friend my companion
he should give gifts for the departed remembering what they have done before
For no tears or grief or any other lamentations
are of any use to the departed as long as their relatives continue grieving in this way
But that gift that has been given and well placed in the Sangha
is of benefit to them for a long time immediately it is of benefit
This then is the definition of a relatives duties and by this great honour has been done to the departed
strength has also been given to the monks and no little merit has been produced by you
Without the walls they stand and wait And at the junctions and roadforks
Returning to their erstwhile homes They wait beside the jambs of gates
But when a rich feast is set out With food and drink of every kind
The fact that no man does recall These creatures stems from their past acts
So they who are compassionate At heart do give for relatives
Such drink and food as may be pure And good and fitting at these times
 Then let this be for relatives May relatives have happiness
These ghosts of the departed kin Foregathered and assembled there
Will eagerly their blessing give For plentiful rich food and drink
 So may our relatives live long Owing to whom we have this gain
For honour to us has been done No giver ever lacked the fruit
Now there is never ploughing there Nor any cattleherding found
Nor merchandizing just the same Nor bartering for coin of gold
The ghosts of the departed kin Live there on giving given here
As water showered on the hill Flows down to reach the hollow vale
So giving given here can serve The ghosts of the departed kin
As riverbeds when full can bear The water down to fill the sea
So giving given here can serve The ghosts of the departed kin
 He gave to me he worked for me He was my kin friend intimate
Give gifts then for departed onesRecalling what they used to do
No weeping nor yet sorrowing Nor any kind of mourning
aids Departed Ones whose kin remain Unhelpful to them acting thus
But when this offering is given Well placed in the Community For them
then it can serve them long In future and at once as well
The True Idea for relatives has thus been shown And how high honour to departed ones is done
And how the bhikkhus can be given strength as well And how great merit can be stored away by you
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was living among the Magadhans at Dakkhinagiri in the brahman village of Ekanala
Now at that time approximately  of the brahman Kasi Bharadvajas plows were yoked at the sowing time
Then in the early morning putting on his lower robe and taking his bowl  robes the Blessed One went to where Kasi Bharadvaja was working
Now at that time Kasi Bharadvajas fooddistribution was underway
So the Blessed One went to Kasi Bharadvajas fooddistribution and on arrival stood to one side
Kasi Bharadvaja saw the Blessed One standing for alms
and on seeing him said to him I contemplative plow  sow Having plowed  sown I eat
You too contemplative should plow  sow Having plowed  sown you eat 
I too brahman plow  sow Having plowed  sown I eat 
But contemplative I dont see the Master Gotamas yoke or plow plowshare goad or oxen
and yet the Master Gotama says this I too brahman plow  sow Having plowed  sown I eat 
Then the Kasi Bharadvaja addressed the Blessed One with a verse
You claim to be a plowman but I dont see your plowing
Being asked tell us about your plowing so that we may know your plowing
The Buddha Conviction is my seed austerity my rain discernment my yoke  plow conscience my pole
mind my yoketie mindfulness my plowshare  goad
Guarded in body guarded in speech restrained in terms of belly  food
I make truth a weedinghook and composure my unyoking
Persistence my beast of burden bearing me toward rest from the yoke
takes me without turning back to where having gone one doesnt grieve
Thats how my plowing is plowed It has as its fruit the deathless
Having plowed this plowing one is unyoked from all suffering  stress
Then Kasi Bharadvaja having heaped up milkrice in a large bronze serving bowl offered it to the Blessed One saying May Master Gotama eat this milkrice
The master is a plowman for the Master Gotama plows the plowing that has as its fruit the deathless 
Whats been chanted over with verses shouldnt be eaten by me Thats not the nature brahman of one whos seen rightly
Whats been chanted over with verses Awakened Ones reject That being their nature brahman this is their way of life
a fullyperfected great seer his fermentations ended his anxiety stilled with other
food  drink serve for that is the field for one looking for merit
Then to whom Master Gotama should I give this milkrice 
Brahman I dont see that person in this world  with its devas Maras  Brahmas in this generation with its royalty  common people  by whom this milkrice having been eaten would be rightly digested aside from a Tathagata or a Tathagatas disciple
In that case brahman throw the milkrice away in a place without vegetation or dump it in water with no living beings 
So Kasi Bharadvaja dumped the milkrice in water with no living beings
And the milkrice when dropped in the water hissed  sizzled seethed  steamed
Just as an iron ball heated all day when tossed in the water hisses  sizzles seethes  steams in the same way the milkrice when dropped in the water hissed  sizzled seethed  steamed
Then Kasi Bharadvaja  in awe his hair standing on end  went to the Blessed One and on arrival throwing himself down with his head at the Blessed Ones feet said to him Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Community of monks Let me obtain the going forth in Master Gotamas presence let me obtain admission 
Then the brahman Kasi Bharadvaja obtained the going forth in the Blessed Ones presence he obtained admission
And not long after his admission  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute  he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the celibate life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now
He knew Birth is ended the celibate life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for the sake of this world
And so Ven Bharadvaja became another one of the arahants
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Magadhans at Dakkhinagiri near the brahmin village of Ekanala
Now on that occasion the brahmin Kasi Bharadvaja Bharadvaja the Ploughman had five hundred ploughs fastened to their yokes at the time of sowing
Then in the morning the Blessed One dressed and taking bowl and robe went to the place where the brahmin Kasi Bharadvaja was at work
Now on that occasion the brahmin Kasi Bharadvajas food distribution was taking place
Then the Blessed One approached the place of the food distribution and stood to one side
The brahmin Kasi Bharadvaja saw the Blessed One standing for alms
and said to him Recluse I plough and sow and when I ploughed and sown I eat
You too ascetic ought to plough and sow then when you have ploughed and sown you will eat
I too brahmin plough and sow and when I have ploughed and sown I eat
But we do not see Master Gotamas yoke or plough or ploughshare or goad or oxen
yet Master Gotama says I too brahmin plough and sow and when I have ploughed and sown I eat
Then the brahmin Kasi Bharadviija addressed the Blessed One in verse
You claim to be a man who works the plough But I do not see your ploughing
If youre a ploughman answer me How should we understand your ploughing
The Blessed One Faith is the seed austerity the rain Wisdom my yoke and plough Shame is the pole
mind the yoketie Mindfulness my ploughshare and goad
Guarded in body guarded in speech Controlled in my appetite for food
I use truth as my weedinghook And gentleness as my unyoking
Energy is my beast of burden Carrying me to security from bondage
It goes ahead without stopping To where having gone one does not sorrow
In such a way this ploughing is done Which has the Deathless as its fruit
Having finished this work of ploughing One is released from all suffering
 Let Master Gotama eat
The worthy is a ploughman since Master Gotama does ploughing that has even the Deathless as its fruit
 Food over which verses have been sung Is not fit to be eaten by me This brahmin is not the principle Observed by those who see
The Enlightened Ones reject such food Over which verses have been sung As such a principle exists O brahmin This is their rule of conduct
The consummate one the great seer With taints destroyed and remorse stilled with other
food and drink Serve For he is the field for one seeking merit
Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master Gotama
The Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by Master Gotama as though he were turning upright what had been turned upside down revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms
I go for refuge to Master Gotama and to the Dhamma and to the Bhikkhu Sangha
Thus I have heard Once the Blessed One was staying among the Magadhans at Dakkhinagiri in the brahman village Ekanala
At that time the brahman Kasibharadvajas five hundred ploughs were fastened to the yokes at the sowingtime
Then in the morning having dressed himself and taken bowl and robe the Blessed One went to where the brahman Kasibharadvaja was at work
At that time the brahman Kasibharadvajas fooddistribution was taking place
Then the Blessed One went to where the fooddistribution was taking place and stood on one side
The brahman Kasibharadvaja saw the Blessed One standing there for alms
and said this I ascetic plough and sow and when I have ploughed and sown I eat
You too ascetic should plough and sow and eat when you have ploughed and sown
 I too brahman do plough and sow and when I have ploughed and sown I eat
 But we do not see the venerable Gotamas yoke or plough or ploughshare or goad or oxen
but nevertheless the venerable Gotama speaks thus I too Brahman do plough and sow and when I have ploughed and sown I eat
Then the Brahman Kasibharadvaja addressed the Blessed One with a verse
You say you are a ploughman but we do not see your ploughing
Being asked tell us about your ploughing so that we may know your ploughing
  Faith is the seed penance is the rain wisdom is my yoke and plough modesty is the pole
mind is the tie mindfulness is my ploughshare and goad
I am guarded in body and guarded in speech restrained in my belly in respect of food
I make truth my weedinghook and meekness my unyoking
Energy is my beast of burden bearing me to restfromexertion
it goes without turning back to where having gone one does not grieve
Thus is this ploughing of mine ploughed It has the deathfree as its fruit
Having ploughed this ploughing one is freed from all misery
 Then the brahman Kasibharadvaja having heaped up ricegruel in a large bronze dish offered it to the Blessed One saying Let the venerable Gotama eat ricegruel 
the venerable one is truly a ploughman since the venerable Gotama ploughs the ploughing which has the deathfree as its fruit
It is not right for me to eat what has been sung over with verses This brahman is not the doctrine of those who see rightly
Buddhas reject what has been sung over with verses As long as the doctrine exists this is their way of life
But a fullyaccomplished great seer whose asavas are destroyed whose remorse is calmed with other
food and drink serve for this is the field for one who is looking for merit
 Shall I then venerable Gotama give this ricegruel to anyone
I do not see brahman in the world including the devas Mara and Brahma among beings including ascetics and brahmans devas and men that man by whom this ricegruel if eaten could be digested properly except the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata
Therefore brahman either throw that ricegruel away in a place where there is little grass or immerse it in water devoid of living things
The brahman Kasibharadvaja immersed that ricegruel in water devoid of living beings
Then that ricegruel immersed in the water hissed and seethed and steamed and smoked
Just as a ploughshare which has been heated all day hisses and seethes and steams and smokes when thrown into water in the same way that ricegruel when thrown into the water hissed and seethed and steamed and smoked
Then the brahman Kasibharadvaja trembling with his hair standing on end went up to the Blessed One and fell with his head at his feet and said this to the Blessed One Wonderful venerable Gotama wonderful venerable Gotama
Just as venerable Gotama one might set upright what has been overturned or uncover that which has been covered or point out the way to one who had gone astray or bring an oillamp into the darkness so that those with eyes might see shapes in the same way the doctrine has been declared by the venerable Gotama in manifold ways
I go to the venerable Gotama as a refuge and to the Doctrine and to the Order of Bhikkhus May I gain admission to the Order in the presence of the venerable Gotama may I obtain ordination
The Brahman Kasibharadvaja obtained admission in the presence of the Blessed One and he obtained ordination
Then when the venerable Bharadvaja had not long been ordained and was dwelling alone secluded vigilant ardent resolute after a short time he himself learned realised and attained in this world of phenomena that unsurpassed goal of the holy life for the sake of which men of good family rightly go forth from the house to the houseless state
He understood Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived that which was to be done has been done there is nothing more for this state
Then the venerable Bharadvaja became one of the arahats
Thus have I heard Once the Exalted One was dwelling at Anathapindikas monastery in the Jeta Grove near Savatthi
Now when the night was far spent a certain deity whose surpassing splendor illuminated the entire Jeta Grove came to the presence of the Exalted One and drawing near respectfully saluted Him and stood at one side
Standing thus he addressed the Exalted One in verse
The Deity we ask thee O Gotama about mans decline
Having come here with our questions to the Exalted One Pray tell us the cause of downfall
The Buddha Easily known is the progressive one easily known he who declines
He who loves Dhamma progresses he who is averse to it declines
The Deity Thus much do we see this is the first cause of ones downfall
Pray tell us the second cause
The Buddha The wicked are dear to him with the virtuous he finds no delight
he prefers the creed of the wicked  this is a cause of ones downfall

and the wives of others  this is a cause of ones downfall
Being past ones youth to take a young wife
and to be unable to sleep for jealousy of her  this is a cause of ones downfall
a woman given to drink and squandering or a man of a like behavior
To place in authority  this is a cause of ones downfall
To be of noble birth with vast ambition and of slender means
and to crave for rulership  this is a cause of ones downfall
Knowing well these causes of downfall in the world
the noble sage endowed with insight shares a happy realm
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindikas monastery
Now when the night was far advanced a certain deity whose surpassing radiance illuminated the whole of Jetavana came to the presence of the Blessed One respectfully saluted him and stood beside him
Standing thus he addressed the Blessed One in verse
The Deity  About the declining man we question thee Gotama

He who having but little possessions but great ambition  is of warrior birth
and aspires selfishly to sovereignty  this is the cause of his downfall
Fully realizing these causes of downfall in the world
the sage endowed with ariyan insight shares a realm of security 
Thus have I heard Once the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in the Jetavana in Anathapindikas park
Then as night was passing away a deity of surpassing radiance illuminating the whole Jetavana came up to the Blessed One and stood on one side after saluting him
Standing there that deity addressed the Blessed One with a verse
we ask Gotama about the unsuccessful man
Having come to ask the Blessed One What is the cause of the unsuccessful man

One with little wealth but great craving is born in a khattiya family

Seeing these failures in the world a wise man
a noble one endowed with insight resorts to the blissful world
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindikas monastery
Then in the forenoon the Blessed One having dressed himself took bowl and robe and entered the city of Savatthi for alms
Now at that time a fire was burning and an offering was being prepared in the house of the brahman Aggikabharadvaja
Then the Blessed One while on his alms round came to the brahmans residence
The brahman seeing the Blessed One some way off
said this Stay there you shaveling stay there you wretched monk stay there you outcast
When he spoke thus the Blessed One said to the brahman Do you know brahman who an outcast is and what the conditions are that make an outcast
No indeed Venerable Gotama I do not know who an outcast is nor the conditions that make an outcast It is good if Venerable Gotama were to explain the Dhamma to me so that I may know who an outcast is and what the conditions are that make an outcast 
Listen then brahman and pay attention I will speak 
Yes Venerable Sir replied the brahman
Whosoever is angry harbors hatred and is reluctant to speak well of others 
perverted in views deceitful  know him as an outcast
Whosoever in this world kills living beings once born or twice born
in whom there is no sympathy for living beings  know him as an outcast
Whosoever destroys and besieges villages and hamlets
and becomes notorious as an oppressor  know him as an outcast
Be it in the village or in the forest
whosoever steals what belongs to others what is not given to him  know him as an outcast
Whosoever having actually incurred a debt runs away when he is pressed to pay
saying I owe no debt to you  know him as an outcast
Whosoever coveting anything kills a person going along the road
and grabs whatever that person has  know him as an outcast
He who for his own sake or for the sake of others or for the sake of wealth
utters lies when questioned as a witness  know him as an outcast
Whosoever associates with the wives of relatives or friends
by force or with consent  know him as an outcast
Whosoever supports not his mother and father who have grown old
being wealthy  know him as an outcast
Whosoever mother father brother sister or motherinlaw or fatherinlaw
strikes and annoys by speech  know him as an outcast
Whosoever when questioned about what is good says what is detrimental
and talks in an evasive manner know him as an outcast
Whosoever having committed an evil deed wishes that it may not be known to others
and commits evil in secret  know him as an outcast
Whosoever having gone to anothers house and partaken of choice food
does not honor that host by offering food when he repays the visit  know him as an outcast
Whosoever a brahman or an ascetic or any other mendicant
deceives by uttering lies  know him as an outcast
Whosoever when a brahman or ascetic appears during mealtime
angers him by harsh speech and does not offer him  know him as an outcast
Whosoever in this world shrouded in ignorance speaks harsh words 
or falsehood expecting to gain something  know him as an outcast

Whosoever is given to anger is miserly has base desires and is selfish deceitful
shameless and fearless  know him as an outcast
Whosoever reviles the Enlightened One  or a disciple of the Buddha
recluse or a householder  know him as an outcast
Whosoever not being an arahant a Consummate One pretends to be so
is a thief in the whole universe  he is the lowest of outcasts
Not by birth is one an outcast not by birth is one a brahman
By deed one becomes an outcast by deed one becomes a brahman
Know ye by the example I now cite 
There was an outcasts son Sopaka who became known as Matanga
This Matanga attained the highest fame so difficult to gain
Many were the warriors and brahmans who went to attend on him
Mounting the celestial chariot along the passionfree high road 
reached the Brahma realm having given up sense desires
His birth did not prevent him from being reborn in the Brahma realm
There are brahmans born in the family of preceptors kinsmen of hymns
They are often seen committing evil deeds
In this life itself they are despised in the next they are born in an evil state of existence
High birth does not prevent them from falling into a woeful state or from censure
Not by birth is one an outcast not by birth is one a brahman
By deed one becomes an outcast by deed one becomes an brahman
When the Buddha had thus spoken the Brahman Aggikabharadvaja said to the Blessed One Excellent O Venerable Gotama excellent
Thus have I heard Once the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in the Jetavana in Anathapindikas park
Then in the morning having dressed himself and taken bowl and robe the Blessed One entered Savatthi to beg
At that time the sacrificial fire was burning in the house of the brahman Aggikabharadvaja and the offering was held aloft
Then the Blessed One going on an uninterrupted begging round in Savatthi came to the house of the brahman Aggikabharadvaja
The brahman Aggikabharadvaja saw the Blessed One coming from afar off
and said this to him Stop there shaveling stop there wretched ascetic stop there outcaste
When this was said the Blessed One said this to the brahman Aggikabharadvaja Do you know brahman what an outcaste is or the things that make an outcaste
I do not know Gotama an outcaste is or the things that make an outcaste It would be a good thing for me for the venerable Gotama so to teach me the doctrine that I may know what an outcaste is and the things that make an outcaste
Then listen brahman pay careful attention I shall tell you
Yes venerable one replied the brahman Aggikabharadvaja to the Blessed One
Whatever man is angry rancorous evil and hypocritical
has wrong views and is deceitful him one should know to be an outcaste
Whoever in this world harms living creatures whether onceborn or twiceborn
whoever has no compassion for a living creature him one should know to be an outcaste
Whoever destroys or besieges villages and towns
and is notorious as an oppressor him one should know to be an outcaste
Whoever in a village or a forest
takes by theft what has not been given to him and is cherished by others him one should know to be an outcaste
Whoever indeed having contracted a debt when urged to repay it absconds
saying I have no debt to you him one should know to be an outcaste
Whoever indeed because of desire for some trifle strikes a person going along the road
and takes the trifle him one should know to be an outcaste
Whatever man for his own sake or for anothers sake or for wealth
speaks falsely when asked in person him one should know to be an outcaste
Whoever is seen misbehaving among the wives of relatives or friends
by force or with their consent him one should know to be an outcaste
Whoever does not support his mother or father when they are old and past their youth
although being able him one should know to be an outcaste
Whoever his mother or father or brother or sister or motherinlaw
strikes or angers with his words him one should know to be an outcaste
Whoever being asked for what is profitable teaches what is profitless
and gives advice in an obscure manner him one should know to be and outcaste
Whoever having done an evil action wants no one to know that he is responsible
whoever has concealed his actions him one should know to be an outcaste
Whoever indeed having gone to anothers house and having eaten pure food
does not honour the other in return when he comes to his house him one should know to be an outcaste
Whoever a brahman or ascetic or even another mendicant
by speaking falsely deceives him one should know to be an outcaste
Whoever when mealtime has arrived with his words a brahman or ascetic
angers and does not give food him one should know to be an outcaste
Whoever wrapped up in delusion relates here what has never happened
and desiring some trifle in payment him one should know to be an outcaste
Whoever both extols himself and disparages another
inferior because of his own pride him one should know to be an outcaste
He makes others angry and is mean desires evil is avaricious crafty
immodest shows no remorse him one should know to be an outcaste
Whoever reviles the Buddha or a disciple of his
a wanderer or a householder him one should know to be an outcaste
Whoever indeed while not being an arahat professes to be an arahat
a thief in the world including Brahma he indeed is the lowest of the outcastes
These indeed are called outcastes whom I have declared to you
Not by birth does one become an ortcaste not by birth does one become a brahman
By ones action one becomes an outcaste by ones action one becomes a brahman
Know it by this also as I give this example
there was a lowcaste Candala well known as Matanga
That Matanga gained the highest fame which is very hard to obtain
Many khattiyas and brahmans came to serve him
He set out on the unpolluted great way which leads to the devas
and having discarded passion and sensual pleasures he reached the world of Brahma
Birth did not keep him from being born in the world of Brahma
Although brahmans are born into a family of scholars and have the vedas as their kinsmen
nevertheless they too are again and again discovered in the midst of evil deeds
They are blameworthy in this world of phenomena and a bad transition is destined in their future state
Birth does not keep them from a bad transition or from blame
Not by birth does one become an outcaste not by birth does one become a brahman
By ones action one becomes an outcaste by ones action one becomes a brahman
When this was said the brahman Aggikabharadvaja said this to the Blessed One Wonderful venerable Gotama wonderful venerable Gotama
What should be done by one with skill in good The State of Peace to have attained is this
He would be able right upright And meek and gentle and not proud
Contented easy to support Unbusy frugal
and serene In faculties prudent modest Not fawning upon families
He would no slight thing do at all That other wise men might deplore
Then he would think  Joyful and safe Let every creatures heart rejoice
Whatever breathing beings there are No matter whether frail or firm With none excepted
 long or big Or middlesized or short or small Or thick
or those seen or unseen Or whether dwelling far or near
That are or that yet seek to be Let every creatures heart rejoice
Let none another one undo Or slight him at all anywhere
Let them not wish each other ill With provocation or resistive thought
Thus as a mother with her life Might guard her son her only child
Would he maintain unboundedly His thought for every living being
His thought of love for all the world He would maintain unboundedly
Above below and all around Unchecked no malice with or foe
Standing or walking seated too Or lying down the while undrowsing
He would pursue this mindfulness This is Divine Abiding here they say
But he that traffics not with views Is virtuous with perfected seeing
Till purged of greed for sensedesires He will surely come no more to any womb
What should be done by one skilled in goodness who has comprehended the state of peace
he ought to be able straight and upright easy to speak to meek without conceit
satisfied  easy to support free from duties and light in living
with faculties at peace prudent not forward and greedless among the families
he should not do the slightest thing whereby others who are wise might find fault 
 be happy and secure may all beings in their hearts be happy
Whatsoever breathing beings there are trembling firm or any other 
whether they be long or great of middle  short tiny or of compact 
those who are seen and those who are unseen those who live far away those who are near
those who are born and those who still seek birth may all beings in their hearts be happy
No one should cheat another nor should he despise anyone wherever he is
he should not long for suffering for another because of anger or resentment
In the same way as a mother would protect her child her only child with her life
so too towards all beings one should develop the measureless thought 
Towards the entire world he should develop the measureless thought of friendliness
above below and across  without barriers hate or enmity
Standing walking sitting lying for as long as he is without torpor
he should be resolved on this mindfulness for this they say here is the spiritual life
Without going near a view virtuous and endowed with insight
having removed greed towards sense pleasures he does not come to lie in a womb again
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Alavi in the haunt of the Alavaka yakkha
Then the Alavaka yakkha went to the Blessed One and on arrival said to him Get out contemplative
Saying All right my friend the Blessed One went out
Come in contemplative
Saying All right my friend the Blessed One went in
A second time
Then a fourth time the Alavaka yakkha said to the Blessed One Get out contemplative
I wont go out my friend
Do what you have to do 
I will ask you a question contemplative
If you cant answer me I will possess your mind or rip open your heart or grabbing you by the feet hurl you across the Ganges 
My friend I see no one in the cosmos with its devas Maras  Brahmas its contemplatives  brahmans its royalty  commonfolk who could possess my mind or rip open my heart or grabbing me by the feet hurl me across the Ganges
But nevertheless ask me what you wish 
What is a persons highest wealth What when wellpracticed brings bliss
What is the highest of savors Living in what way is ones life called the best
Conviction is a persons highest wealth Dhamma when wellpracticed brings bliss
Truth is the highest of savors Living with discernment ones life is called best
How does one cross over the flood How cross over the sea
How does one overcome suffering  stress How is a person purified
Through conviction one crosses over the flood Through heedfulness the sea
Through persistence one overcomes suffering  stress Through discernment a person is purified
How does one gain discernment How does one find wealth
How does one attain honor How bind friends to oneself
Passing from this world to the next world how does one not grieve
Convinced of the arahants Dhamma for attaining Unbinding
 heedful observant  one listening well gains discernment
Doing whats fitting enduring burdens one with initiative finds wealth
Through truth one attains honor Giving binds friends to oneself
a householder of conviction Endowed with these four qualities
 truth selfcontrol stamina relinquishment  on passing away doesnt grieve
Now go ask others common brahmans  contemplatives
if anything better than truth selfcontrol endurance  relinquishment here can be found
How could I go ask common brahmans  contemplatives
 now that today I understand what benefits the next life
It was truly for my wellbeing that the Awakened One came to stay in Alavi
Today I understand where what is given bears great fruit
I will wander from village to village town to town
paying homage to the Selfawakened One  the true rightness of the Dhamma
Thus have I heard Once the Blessed One was staying at Alavi in the haunt of the yakkha Alavaka
Then the yakkha Alavaka went up to the Blessed One and said to him Go out ascetic
Yes sir said the Blessed One and went out
Go in ascetic said the yakkha
yes Sir said the Blessed One and went in
A second time the yakkha Alavaka said this to the Blessed One Go out ascetic
A fourth time the yakkha Alavaka said this to the Blessed One Go out ascetic
Then I shall not go out sir
do whatever you must
I shall ask you a question ascetic
If you do not answer me I shall either strike down your mind or split your heart or seize you by the feet and throw you over the Ganges
I do not see anyone sir in the world including the devas Mara and Brahma among beings including ascetics and brahmans devas and men who could strike down my mind or split my heart or seize me by the feet and throw me over the Ganges
Nevertheless ask what you wish
 Then the yakkha Alaveka addressed the Blessed One with a verse
What in this world is the best wealth for a man What when well practised brings happiness
What indeed is the sweetest of flavours Living in what way do they say ones life is best 
Faith is the best wealth for a man in this world Righteousness when well practised brings happiness
Truth is the sweetest of flavours They say the life of one living by wisdom is best
