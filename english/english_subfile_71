The one with all knowledge and strength at the great Lake AnotattaIn this way truly the Fortunate One spoke about the former connection with his previous livesin what is known as the Dhamma Instruction in the Traditions about the BuddhaIn the fourth enquiry called slander we hear about especially great abuse and censuringIn the past it seems the Buddhatobe was reborn in a Brahminical familyand was very learned much respected and worshippedHaving gone forth in the recluses goingforthwhile living on forest roots and fruits in the Himālayahe spent his time teaching the mantrasOne reclusecame to stay near to himHaving seen him being jealous by nature he slandered that innocent seer sayingThis seer is a deceitful sensualistand his pupils also said This seer is surely immoralThey therefore abused and censured himThrough that unwholesome deed and its resultafter undergoing suffering in Niraya hell for many thousands of yearsand becoming a Buddha in this his last state and attaining the highest gains and famehe became famous and was like the full moon in the skyRight there and then through slander the dissatisfied sectariansafter making Sundarī slander him againsummoning and bribing some drunken scoundrelsgave the order saying After murdering Sundarīthrow her by the rubbish tip near the entrance to Jetas WoodAnd that they didAfterwards the sectarians informed the King saying We cannot findThe King said Search for herAfter retrieving her from the place where she was thrownbringing the bier and showing the King they saidLook dear Sir at what the ascetic Gotamas disciples have doneThen about the Fortunate One and his Community of monksthey went round shouting out dispraise in the whole townand placed Sundarī on a platform in the charnel groundThe King gave the order saying Seek for Sundarīs murdererThen after the scoundrels had drunk liquorthey made a commotion accusing each other saying You murdered Sundarī you murdered herThe Kings men after arresting the scoundrels broughtThe King said Look here did you murder SundarīYes your majestyThe order was given by whomBy the sectarians your majestyThe King after having the sectarians brought and boundsaid Look here go and shout it out saying In order to bring the Buddha into disreputewe ourselves had Sundarī murderedthe Fortunate One and his disciples didnt do itAnd that they didAll the towndwellers regained confidenceThe King after executing the sectarians and the scoundrels had their bodies thrown asideThen the Fortunate Ones gains and respect grew enormouslyTherefore it is saidAs the brahmin Sutavā I was greatly respected and worshippedI taught the mantras to my five hundred students in the Great WoodThe seer Bhīma who had five knowledges and great power came thereAnd having seen him coming I slandered that innocent seerThereupon I said to my pupils This seer is a sensualistAnd all of the students rejoiced in that unwholesome speech of mineThence all the students as they begged for alms from family to familySaid to the great body of people This seer is a sensualistThrough that deed and through its result these monks numbering five hundredAll received abundant slander at the hands of SundarikāIn the ninth enquiry called a headache we hear about how he had a pain in the head painful feeling in the headIn the past it seems the Buddhatobe was reborn as a fisherman in a fishermans villageOne day together with the fishermenafter going to the place where they murder fishand seeing fish being murdered happiness arose right thereand also right there and then happiness arose for those he was withThrough that unwholesome deedafter undergoing suffering in the four lower realmsin this his last state of existence together with those menafter being born in the Royal Sakya family and by and by attaining to Buddhahoodhe himself suffered from pain in the headAnd about the Sakyan Royalty and their fate it is recorded in the discussion in the commentary to the Dhammapadain the battle with Viḍūḍabha they all came to destructionTherefore it is saidBefore I was a fishermans son in a fishermans villageHaving seen fish being killed it produced a little happinessThrough that deed and through its result I had a great pain in my headAnd all the Sakyans were killed when Viḍūḍabha slay themAfter the Fortunate One completely awakened to Perfect Awakeningturned the auspicious Dhamma Wheel instructed Yasa the son of a good familyarrived at Uruvelā and there instructed the thousand yogisand together with the former yogis who were now pollutantfree monks went to Rājagaha he preached Dhamma to King Bimbisāra and the assembly of twelve myriadswho had come in order to see the Awakened OneFrom that twelve myriads who came together with the Kingone myriad announced they were devoteesand eleven myriads were established in the fruit of Stream Entry along with King BimbisāraThis devotee Visākha was one amongst themand at the first meeting he was established with them in the fruit of Stream Entryand again afterwards on another day after hearing the Dhamma he was established in the fruit of a NonReturnerAfter becoming a NonReturner unlike when returning to the home on other dayswhen he came looking round here and there laughing and smilinghe didnt come in this way but he came with calmed faculties and calmed mindHis wife Dhammadinnā got up from the couchand looking down the road saw the way he was comingand thought Why is he like this and making her way out to meet himstood at the top of the stairs and stretched out her hand in order to support himThe devotee waved her away with his handShe thought I will see during the morning mealFormerly the devotee ate together with herBut that day without even looking roundhe ate on his own like a meditating monkShe thought I will see during the evening timeThat day the devotee didnt enter the bedroombut set another to watch over the chamber prepared a suitable bed and lay downThe female devotee thinking I wonder if he has desire for someone elseor something was said by a slandereror whatever can my fault beand she became depressedthinking I am able to live like this for one or two days onlyhaving gone to wait on him she worshipped him and stood thereThe devotee asked Has Dhammadinnā come at this timeYes Noble Sir I have come you are not like beforeis there desire for someone elseThere is not DhammadinnāIs there some kind of slanderNot thatThat being so then whatever can my fault beYou have no fault Then why do you not makeconversation with me as normalHe thought I should not broadcast this supermundane attainment which is a weighty and serious matterbut if I dont speakher heart might break right now and she might dieso having sympathy for her he saidDhammadinnā having heard the Teacher teach the DhammaI attained what is known as the supermundane stateand with that attainment such mundane actions are no longer suitableIf you wish with your fourhundred millions and my fourhundred millionsthere are eighty millionstake control of this and be in the position of a Mother or Sister to me and live on thatI can carry on with as little as a ball of rice given by youIf such will not do then take the wealth and return to your family homeOr if there is no one else you desireI will place you in the position of a Sister or a Daughter and look after youShe thought It is no ordinary person who is speaking thusSurely the supermundane state has been penetrated by himBut can this state only be penetrated by menor is it possible for a woman to penetrate itShe said this to VisākhaCan this state only be attained by menor can a woman also attain itWhat did you say Dhammadinnā for those who are practiced theirs is the inheritancefor whoever there is a basis for him there is the attainmentIf that is so please allow my going forthVery well Bhaddānot knowing your mind previously I did not speakThen he went to King Bimbisāra worshipped him and stood thereThe King asked Why have you come at this time householderDhammadinnā says Great King I would go forthBut what is suitable to provide for herIt is suitable to provide nothing other than a golden palanquin GodKingand the cleaning of the cityThe King gave the golden palanquin and had the city cleanedVisākha had Dhammadinnā washed with scented waterdecorated with all her decorations sat her down in the golden palanquingathered their relations around her and while worshipping with scented flowers and so onas though he was perfuming the city he took her to the nunneryand said Noble Ladies you must give Dhammadinnā the going forthThe nuns said Householder it is suitable to bear with one or two faultsThere are no faults at all Noble Ladies she goes forth out of faithThen one learned Elder nun informed her about the fivefold meditation subject beginning with skinshaved her hair and gave her the going forthVisākha said Rejoice in the welltaught Dhamma Noble Lady then worshipped her and departedFrom the day she went forth many gains and much honour arose to herBecause of that there were obstacles and no chance to develop the ascetic practicesThen taking the Elder nuns who were her Teacher and Preceptor she went to the countrysidemade them explain the thirtyeight meditation objects that delight the mindand she began to develop the ascetic practicesand being endowed with resolution she did not tire easilyA hundred thousand aeons in the past from nowthe Teacher Padumuttara arose in the worldAt that time she had become a servant to one family then having sold her hairshe gave a gift to the Buddhas Chief Disciple the Elder Sujāta and made an aspirationThrough her being endowed with that aspiration and resolution she did not tire easilyand in a very few days having attained Liberation she thoughtI ordained in this Dispensation for a purpose the summit has been attainedhow will my relatives make merit with me in the countrysideAlso the Community of nuns should not be tired out with the lack of requisites I am going to Rājagahaand taking the Community of nuns she went to RājagahaVisākha having heard Dhammadinnā has come it seemsthought Not long after her going forth she went to the countryand not long after going she returns againwhat can be up I will go and seeand he came to the nunnery with a second personAnd he thought this it seemsDo you take delight or do you not take delight Noble LadyBut this sort of questioning is not for a wise manso having brought up the five constituents of mind and body that provide fuel for attachment I will question her with a questionby her answer to the question I will know whether she has delight or no delightAt one time the Fortunate One was living near Rājagahaat the Squirrels Feeding Place in

spiritual sons of the Jina assembledIn this assembly Thera Kassapa was chief be who resembled the Teacher a great leader on earth there is not his equalKassapa after having selected five hundred amongst the Arahats taking always the most worthy ones composed the collection of the DhammaOut of compassion for created beings in order to establish the Faith for a long time he made after the lapse of three months when the fourth month and the second beginning of the Vassa  had arrived the collection of the DhammaAt the entrance of the Sattapaṇṇa cave in the Magadha town Giribbaja Rājagaha this first council was finished after seven monthsAt this council many Bhikkhus were present the original depositaries of the Faith and who had all reached perfection in the doctrine of the protector of the worldKassapa was the chief propounder of the Dhutavāda precepts according to the doctrine of the Jina nanda was the first of those learned in the Suttas the Thera called Upāli was chief in the Vinaya Anuruddha in the supernatural visions Vaṅgīsa in promptly comprehending Puṇṇa among the preachers of the Dhamma Kumārakassapa among the students of various tales Kaccāna in establishing distinctions Koṭṭhita in analytical knowledge There were besides many other  great Theras who were original depositaries of the FaithBy these and other saintly Theras who had fulfilled their duties to the number of five hundred was the collection of the Dhamma and of the Vinaya made because it was collected by the Theras it is called the doctrine of the Theras theravādaThey composed the collection of the Dhamma and of the whole Vinaya by consulting Upāli about the Vinaya and learned nanda about the DhammaBoth these Thera Upāli and nanda who had obtained perfection in the true Doctrine had learned the Dhamma and Vinaya from the Jina and clever in the Suttas they proclaimed what had been taught in long expositions and also without exposition the natural meaning as well as the recondite meaningHaving received the perfect word of Buddha the first among doctrines from the first among teachers these Theras and original depositaries of the Faith made the first collection Hence this doctrine of the Theras is also called the first or primitive doctrineThe most excellent Theravāda remained pure and faultless for a long time for ten times ten yearsWhen the first hundred years had been completed and the second century had begun a great schism happened a most violent one in the doctrine of the TherasTwelve thousand Vajjiputtas of Vesālī assembled and proclaimed at Vesālī best of towns the ten indulgences in the doctrine of Buddha viz the indulgence of keeping salt in a horn of the two inches of the village and the monastery of residences of obtaining consent of example of milkwhey of toddy of silver of seats without fringesThey proclaimed a doctrine which was against the Faith against the discipline and repugnant to the doctrine of the Teacher splitting the true meaning and the Faith they proclaimed what was contrary to itIn order to subdue them many pupils of Buddha twelve hundred thousand spiritual sons of the Jina assembledIn this congregation the eight chief Bhikkhus resembling the Master great leaders difficult  to conquer great teachers were Sabbakāmī and Sāḷha Revata Khujjasobhita Vāsabhagāmi and Sumana Sambhūta who resided at Sāṇa Yasa the son of Kākaṇḍaka a sage praised by the Jina In order to subdue those wicked men the Vajjiputtas they came to VesālīVāsabhagāmi and Sumana were pupils of Anuruddha the other Theras pupils of nanda they had all formerly seen TathāgataAt that time Asoka the son of Susunāga was king that prince ruled in the town of PāṭaliputtaThe eight Theras of great supernatural power gained one party for themselves and destroying the doctrine of the ten indulgences they annihilated those wicked onesAfter having annihilated the wicked Bhikkhus and after having crushed the sinful doctrine those eight Theras of great supernatural power those Bhikkhus selected seven hundred Arahats choosing the best ones in order to purify their own doctrine and held a councilThis second council was finished in eight months at Vesālī best of towns in the hall called KūṭāgāraThe wicked Bhikkhus the Vajjiputtakas who had been excommunicated by the Theras gained another party and many people holding the wrong doctrine ten thousand assembled and also held a council Therefore this Dhamma council is called the Great Council mahāsaṅgītiThe Bhikkhus of the Great Council settled a doctrine contrary to the true Faith Altering the original redaction they made another redactionThey transposed Suttas which belonged to one place of the collection to another place they destroyed the true meaning and the Faith in the Vinaya and in the five Collections of SuttasThose Bhikkhus who understood neither what had been taught in long expositions nor without exposition neither the natural meaning nor the recondite meaning settled a false meaning in connection with spurious speeches of Buddha these Bhikkhus destroyed a great deal of true meaning under the colour  of the letterRejecting single passages of the Suttas and of the profound Vinaya they composed other Suttas and another Vinaya which had only the appearance of the genuine onesRejecting the following texts viz the Parivāra which is an abstract of the contents of the Vinaya the six sections of the Abhidhamma the Paṭisambhidā the Niddesa and some portions of the Jātaka they composed new onesForsaking the original rules regarding nouns genders composition and the embellishments of style they changed all thatThose who held the Great Council were the first schismatics in imitation of them many heretics aroseAfterwards a schism occurred in that new school the Gokulika and Ekabyohāra Bhikkhus formed two divisionsAfterwards two schisms took place amongst the Gokulikas the Bahussutaka and the Paññatti Bhikkhus formed two divisionsAnd opposing these were the Cetiyas another division of the Mahāsaṅgītikas All these five sects originating from the Mahāsaṅgītikas split the true meaning and the Doctrine and some portions of the Collection setting aside some portions of difficult passages they altered themForsaking the original rules regarding nouns genders composition and the embellishments of style they changed all thatIn the orthodox school of the Theras again a schism occurred the Mahisāsaka and Vajjiputtaka Bhikkhus formed two sectionsIn the school of the Vajjiputtakas four sections arose viz the Dhammuttarikas Bhaddayānikas Channagārikas and SammitisIn later times two divisions arose among the Mahisāsakas the Sabbatthivāda and Dhammagutta Bhikkhus formed two divisionsThe Sabbatthivādas and Kassapikas the Kassapikas and Saṅkantikas and subsequently another section the Suttavādas separated themselves in their turnThese eleven schools which separated themselves from the Theravāda split the true meaning and the Doctrine and some portions of the Collection setting aside some portions of difficult passages they altered themForsaking  the original rules regarding nouns genders composition and the embellishments of style they changed all thatSeventeen are the heretical sects and there is one orthodox sect together with the orthodox sect they are eighteen at allThe most excellent Theravāda which resembles a large banyan tree is the complete doctrine of the Jina free from omissions or additions The other schools arose as thorns grow on the treeIn the first century there were no schisms in the second century arose the seventeen heretical schools in the religion of the JinaThe Hemavatikas Rājagirikas Siddhatthas Pubba and Aparaselikas and sixthly the AparaRājagirikas arose one after the otherIn the future time after

remaining silentHaving understood his consent the royal retinue and the people of the kingdom paying great honour and respect to the Buddha then returned to the townThe king thus reflected This fraternity of Bhikkhus is numerous the crowd of the people is great there is no place prepared for its reception in this narrow town in my capitalI possess a great pleasure garden the delightful garden of Mahātittha which is not too narrow nor too distant which will be convenient for the ascetics and will be suitable for a retired existence and for the Tathāgata There I will bestow presents on the Buddha and on the Bhikkhu fraternityMay all people obtain the sight of the Buddha and of the Fraternity Omniscient Kakusandha followed by forty thousand Bhikkhus arrived at the Mahātittha garden When the highest among men had entered the Mahātittha garden the creepers and trees were covered with flowers out of season The king took a golden waterpot and dedicated the garden for the sake of the welfare of Laṅkā by pouring water over the hand of the Buddha saying I give o Lord this garden to the Saṅgha and to the Buddha its chief It was a delightful restingplace an appropriate residence for the FraternityKakusandha the ruler of the world accepted the garden At that moment the earth quaked this was the first restingplace of the Saṅgha in LaṅkāThe highest leader of the world stood there causing the immovable earth to quake He then formed the following wish Oh that Rucānandā might take the Bo branch and come hitherThe Bhikkhunī who possessed the high magical powers understanding the thought of holy Kakusandha went to the great Sirīsa Bodhi and standing at its foot she thoughtThe Buddha desires that the Bodhi tree shall grow in Ojadīpa Thither she went in order

any other greater act of liberality My faith is most firm I am therefore a relation  of the FaithAfter having heard the word spoken by king Asokadhamma learned Moggaliputta who was well versed in the Scriptures a clever decider of cases answered the question of Asokadhamma in order to secure a comfortable existence to the Fraternity for the sake of the propagation of the Doctrine and because he the wise one had learnt the future destiny of the Faith The donor of the requisites for the Bhikkhus remains a stranger to the Faith but that man who gives up his son or daughter the issue of his body and causes them to receive the Pabbajjā ordination becomes really a relation of the FaithKing  Asokadhamma the ruler of the earth having heard this speech addressed both prince Mahinda his son and his daughter Saṅghamittā I presently shall be a relation of the Faith Both children hearing what their father had said agreed saying Well Sire we agree we will do what you have said make us quickly

who acted compassionately towards Mahinda in those three waysMoggaliputta his Upajjhāya taught Mahinda the enlightener of the Island all the Piṭakas their whole meaning and the DoctrineTen years after Asokas coronation Mahinda had completed four years after his Upasampadā and had become a teacher of the whole scripture as handed down and he had many pupilsMahinda studied and retained in his mind the well propounded well divided Sutta collection as it had been settled at the two convocations the doctrine of the TherasMoggaliputta instructed Mahinda the son of Asoka in the three sciences the doctrine regarding the six supernatural faculties the four analytical doctrinesAnd Tissa Moggaliputta continuously taught Mahinda his pupil the whole Piṭaka of the gamas  ie the SuttaPiṭakaWhen Asoka

Theravāda and held the third CouncilHaving destroyed the different heretical doctrines and subdued many shameless people and restored splendour to the true faith he proclaimed the treatise called KathāvatthuFrom that Moggaliputta Mahinda who was the pupil of that teacher learnt the true religionMoggaliputta taught him the five Nikāyas and the seven sections of the Abhidhamma he the hero the clever one learnt from his teacher the two Vibhaṅgas of the Vinaya the Parivāra and the KhandhakaWhen the second century and thirtysix years more had elapsed since the Buddhas death again a most dreadful schism arose in the TheravādaIn the city of Pāṭaliputta ruled prince Dhammāsoka a great king who was a believer in the faith of BuddhaHe bestowed great gifts on the Saṅgha the best and most

satisfied the desire of the kingHaving received the Doctrine from the Thera the king destroyed the Bhikkhu emblems of those who had furtively attached themselves to the SaṅghaThe reckless infidels performing the Pabbajjā rite according to their own doctrine injured the faith of the Buddha just as men mix pure gold with baser metalsThey all were sectarian opposed to the Theravāda and in order to annihilate them and to make his own doctrine resplendent the Thera set forth the treatise belonging to the Abhidhamma which is called Kathāvatthu A similar punishment a similar destruction of an opposite doctrine never occurredAfter having promulgated the treatise called Kathāvatthu which belongs to the Abhidhamma the presiding Thera in order to purify his own doctrine and to establish the

elapsed just at that time Mahinda the son of Asoka was bornWhen Mahinda was ten years old his father put his brothers to death then he passed four years reigning over JambudīpaHaving killed his hundred brothers alone continuing his race Asoka was anointed king in Mahindas fourteenth yearAsokadhamma after his coronation obtained the abovementioned miraculous faculties exceedingly splendid and rich in meritorious works he was universal monarch of JambudīpaThey crowned Piyadassi after full twenty years  he passed three years doing honour to Pāsaṇḍa infidelsThere were adherents of the sixtytwo false doctrines ninetysix kinds of Pāsaṇḍas who proceeded from the Sassata and Uccheda doctrines all of them established on these two principles Nigaṇṭhas and Acelakas and other ascetics and other Brahmans and sectariansSearching where truth and where falsehood was he invited the infatuated infidel Nigaṇṭhas  and sectarians of the Sassata and Uccheda doctrines and Pāsaṇḍa and Titthiya infidels of different creeds outside the Faith sectarian peopleAfter having invited the numbers of Titthiyas and having introduced them into his palace and having bestowed on them great gifts he asked them an exceedingly difficult questionBeing asked this question they could not answer it by their own power the ignorant people answered like a man who being asked about the mango tree replies concerning the Lakucha treeThey all were content with low seats  in the royal hall   After having annihilated all the Pāsaṇḍas and defeated the sectarians the king thought Which other men may we find who are Arahats in this world or see the path towards ArahatshipSurely they are to be found in the world this world cannot be void of them  How may I obtain the sight of such worthy men If I hear his i e such a mans well spoken words I will give up to him my paternal realm and my conquestsThe king thinking thus found nobody worthy of his presents unceasingly the king searched after virtuous clever menWalking about in his palace and looking at many people he saw the Samaṇa Nigrodha who went along the road for almsWhen he saw Nigrodha whose walking turning back and looking was graceful who turned his eyes to the ground who was adorned by decent deportment an Arahat whose mind was peaceful who had reached perfect selfcontrol who had subdued himself and protected and well defended himself against human passions who did not mix with noble people who was stainless like the moon amidst clouds fearless like a lion brilliant like a firebrand venerable unconquerable firm of a peaceful disposition steadfast who had destroyed his passions had cleansed himself of all sins who was the most excellent of men who led a wandering life the most excellent Samaṇa who was endowed with all virtues the thought occurred to him that he had been his companion during a former life   Seeing that ascetic who led a life worthy of a Muni who was happy in consequence of his meritorious deeds in former existences who had reached the fruition which is obtained by the path of Arahats walking along the road in search of alms that wise man thought full of longingIndeed this Thera is one of the venerable ones like Buddha the holy One in this world and like his disciples he has reached the fruition which is obtained by the transcendent path and has reached liberation and salvationAsoka obtained the enjoyment of the fivefold delight high bliss delighted he who was comparable to Sakka rejoiced like a poor man who has found a treasure like one who has gained the desire of his heart He spoke to one of his ministers Well quickly conduct hither that Bhikkhu that handsome young man of tranquil appearance who walks along the road like an elephant fearless and endowed with the ornament of tranquillityThe king felt great content highly delighted he thought in his mind Without doubt this excellent person whom I have never seen before has reached the highest perfectionThinking thus he again spoke thus Well prepared seats are spread sit down on the seat which is worthy of an ascetic I grant thee whichsoever thou desirestAfter hearing the speech of the king he took the kings right hand  and mounted the throne Fearlessly he sat down on the most excellent seat just as Sakka king of the gods seats himself on the PaṇḍukambalaThe king thought This most excellent boy is certainly immovable and fearless him The king recognizing that excellent tender boy who observed the customs of the Saints to be well instructed and expert in Dhamma and Vinaya again spoke thus full of delightTeach me the Faith which thou hast learnt thou alone shalt be my teacher I will obey the words which thou teachest me o great Sage Instruct me I listen to thy preachingHaving heard this exceedingly acute speech of the king be who was well versed in the analytical distinctions of the ninefold doctrine thought over the precious Tipiṭaka and found the excellent sermon on Earnestness Earnestness is the way to immortality indifference is the way to death the earnest do not die the indifferent are like the deadWhen wise Nigrodha had pronounced this gladdening sentence the king understood that highest motive  viz earnestness This is the foundation of all doctrines whatsoever that have been preached by the omniscient BuddhaToday I choose as my refuge thee and Buddha with the Dhamma and the Saṅgha together with my children and wives with the number of my relatives I announce to thee my having become a laydiscipleAbiding together with children and wives in the refuge of the Faith in consequence of the arrival of Nigrodha my spiritual guide I offer four lacs of silver and eight daily portions of rice to the TheraThe king having asked whether there are many ascetics like Nigrodha he replied There are many disciples of Buddha versed in the threefold science possessed of magical power well acquainted with the exposition of the qualities of mind who have subdued their passions and reached ArahatshipThe king again spoke to the Thera I desire to meet with that precious Assembly I will pay my respect to all Bhikkhus who come to the Assembly I will listen to the DhammaSixty thousand ascetics assembled and the messengers announced to the king A large congregation which is full of great joy has assembled go thou to see the congregation as thou desiredst to

them raising  his joined hands and received greetings in returnHe spoke to the Bhikkhu congregation May the Saṅgha have compassion on meTaking the almsbowl of the Thera the Saṅghas spiritual father and paying reverence to him by offering various flowers he entered the cityInviting them to enter his residence and to be seated he offered to them with outstretched hands ricemilk and various highly

robesHe distributed slippers  collyrium oil parasols and also shoes all the requisites of an ascetic molasses and honeyIntroducing all the Bhikkhus as many as had assembled into his interior apartments Asokadhamma the ruler of the earth sat down Sitting down the king invited the congregation of Bhikkhus to accept their gifts sayingI give as much as the Bhikkhus desire whatever they chooseAfter having gratified them with a present of priestly requisites and offered to them what was required for their use he asked them about the very profound well propounded divisions of the DhammaAre there venerable Sirs sections taught by the kinsman of the Sun by the indication of a certain number of divisions of the Dhamma according to nouns gender and inflections and also according to sections and to the composition It has been taught o king and has been numbered by the kinsman of the Sun it is well divided well promulgated well explained well taught accompanied by reasons and replete with sense well spoken without a fault fixed attention right exertion the magical powers the five organs of spiritual life the ten powers the requisites for attaining supreme knowledge and those leading to the supreme path all of these are well divided and well taught these are the seven divisions of the most excellent elements of supreme knowledgeThe doctrine preached by the Teacher the highest among men  the supreme transcendent Truth which has been expanded and well divided consists of nine AṅgasFull eightyfour thousand sections of the Doctrine have been taught by the kinsman of the Sun out of compassion for created beingsHe has preached the highest Truth the most excellent ambrosia which frees from transmigration which is the path leading to the extinction of all suffering and an ambrosialike medicineAfter hearing the speech pronounced by the Congregation of the Bhikkhus the king the chief of men filled with joy and mirth wisdom having arisen in his mind pronounced these words to his royal courtFull and complete eightyfour thousand most precious sections of the Truth have been taught by the most excellent Buddha I will build eightyfour thousand monasteries honouring each single section of the Truth by one monasteryThe prince expending ninetysix koṭis of treasure he the king gave immediately on that same day the order for the erection of the buildingsAt that time there were in Jambudīpa eightyfour thousand towns near each town he built one monasteryAnd having completed the monasteries in three years time the construction of the rāmas being finished the prince held during seven days a festival of offeringsAgain the holy glorious Sambuddha once dwelt near the most excellent capital of Kosala in the garden of Sudatta AnāthapiṇḍikaIn this Jetavana garden Buddha the lightgiving king of the Truth looking all over the world saw beautiful TambapaṇṇiWhen five years had elapsed after he had attained Buddhahood he went to the country of Tambapaṇṇi By dispelling the Avaruddhaka demons he once himself had made the island emptyBut now the mountain serpents and the sea serpents fought a battle in the island having arranged their arrays on both sides an awful struggleAll those Nāgas possessed great magical powers all were frightfully venomous all were wicked and violent furious and filled with desireThe Serpents were quick and excessively powerful corrupt cruel and harsh hasty given to anger longing for destruction Powerful Mahodara and resplendent Cūḷodara both were valiant both had an exceedingly brilliant appearanceNo one saw a way how peaceably to compose that struggle  Mahodara whose fierceness was furiously excited by pride was destroying the island with its mountains and its forests I will kill all hostile serpentsCūḷodara filled with pride roared May thousand koṭis of Nāgas approach I will slay all them who dare to enter the battle I will change the island all its hundred yojanas into one desertThe Serpents whose venomous fury could not be restrained who possessed high magical powers raged and sent forth flames sent forth smoke and flames the Serpent kings infatuated with anger incited them to destroy the foes who opposed them in the battleBuddha the blessed wanderer through the world when he perceived the anger of the Serpent kings and saw that the island was being destroyed thought in order to prevent this many kind thoughts for the sake of the highest bliss of men and godsHe thus reflected If I do not go to Laṅkā the Serpents will not  become happy the island will be destroyed and there will be no welfare in future timeOut of compassion for the Nāgas for the sake of happiness of men I shall go there may the happiness of the island prosper I perceive the excellent qualities of Laṅkādīpa the Serpents shall not destroy the island from which I formerly have driven out the Yakkhas and to which I have done goodSpeaking thus the Sambuddha rose from his seat he who possessed the gift of supernatural vision left the Gandhakuṭī and stood in the door of the Jetavana gardenAll the gods who resided in the trees of the Jetavana garden offered their services to him Let us go with thee o Sage who art possessed of supernatural visionBuddha replied Nay remain ye all Samiddhi alone may go with me Samiddhi went taking up the tree where his residence was and holding it from behind over Buddhas headSamiddhi when he heard what Buddha had said was delighted he took up the tree roots and all and followed the TathāgataThe highly powerful king of gods gave shade to the Sambuddha the highest among men and held the tree from behind over the most excellent BuddhaThe highest of men went to the place where the Nāgas fought their battle the merciful Teacher there stood in the middle of both noble NāgasGoing through the air over the heads of both Nāgas the Sambuddha the chief of the world produced a deep terrifying darknessThere arose a thick darkness caused by the great magical power of the lion among men he was covered and veiled  by the darkness and the tree too The frightened terrified Nāgas did not see each other nor did they see the Jina  or to what side they should direct their attacksThey all forsook the battle threw down their weapons and stood all with clasped hands paying reverence to the SambuddhaWhen Buddha perceived that they were struck with horror when he saw that the Nāgas were terrified he sent forth his thoughts of kindness towards  them and emitted a warm ray of lightA great sight it was astonishing and terrifying they all saw the Sambuddha like the bright moon in the skyStanding there resplendent with all the six colours shining in the air illuminating the ten regions of the world he thus addressed the NāgasFrom what cause o great king did this contention among the Nāgas arise Out of compassion towards yourself I have come speedily hitherThey replied This Nāga Cūḷodara and that Nāga Mahodara the maternal uncle and the nephew are quarrelling with each other desirous of treasureThe Sambuddha addressed a speech full of compassion to the savage Nāgas Anger which arises in the mind of the fool begins small and grows greatFor what reason do you undergo all these many Nāgas great suffering Destroy that small throne but do not destroy each other Destroying one the other you are going to cause an unheard of destruction of lifeThen he who possessed the gift of supernatural vision agitated the Nāgas by the description of the sufferings in hell he unfolded to them the laws of birth in the worlds of men and devas and the nature of NibbānaAs the Sambuddha the highest of men thus preached the true doctrine all the Nāgas casting themselves down propitiated the TathāgataAll the Nāgas then came together the Serpents reconciled themselves to each other and all took their refuge in Buddha eighty koṭis of living beingsThe two Nāga kings for the sake of restoring peace took that most excellent throne and thus spoke to Buddha Accept this throne out of compassion o Sage who art gifted with supernatural visionThe Sambuddha who possessed the gift of supernatural vision accepted it by remaining silent When they understood that he had accepted it the two great Serpents were delightedThey thus addressed Buddha May the blessed One sit down on this splendid noble Veḷuriya throne which the Nāgas were longing forThe  Nāgas placed that throne in the midst of the two islands There on that throne the lightgiving king of the Truth sat downWhen those eighty koṭis of Nāgas had propitiated the Sambuddha the Nāgas there served to him a meal food and drinkWhen he had removed his hands from the bowl the eighty koṭis of Nāgas surrounding him sat down near the supreme BuddhaAt the mouth of the Kalyāṇī river there lived a Naga together with his children and with a great retinue of Nāgas his name was MaṇiakkhikaHe was full of faith and had taken his refuge in Buddha a true and righteous believer When he came to that assembly of Nāgas his faith still increasedWhen this Nāga perceived the Buddhas power his compassion and the fear of the Serpents  he bowed to him sat down and thus entreated the TathāgataOut of compassion to this island thou hast first dispelled the Yakkhas this kindness towards the Nāgas is thy second act of compassion towards the IslandMay the holy great Sage show his compassion still another time I shall attend and do service to theeHaving heard what the Nāga said Buddha full of compassion for created beings the blessed One accepted his invitation for showing kindness to LaṅkādīpaHaving sat on the throne the lightgiver arose the Sage then rested during the midday time in the interior of the islandIn the interior of the island the supreme light spent the day he who possessed the gift of supernatural vision entered upon the Brahmavihāra meditationAt evening time the Jina thus spoke to the Nāgas Let the throne remain here may the Khīrapāla tree  station itself here Worship o Nāgas all of you this tree and the throneHaving spoken thus and preached to the Serpents and given them that sacred object used by himself the Sambuddha returned to the JetavanaAgain in the eighth year after Buddha had reached Sambodhi the Nāga king Maṇiakkhika invited the great hero together with five hundred BhikkhusThese Bhikkhus whose senses were subdued who possessed the high magical powers surrounded the Sambuddha the Sage rose up into the air in the Jetavana and proceeding through the air he came to Laṅkā to the mouth of the Kalyāṇī riverAll the Serpents constructed a pavilion of precious stones on the ground and covered it with garments of different colours with divine clothesThere were ornaments of various precious stones various blossoms of many descriptions many flags of various colours the pavilion was adorned in many waysThey spread cloth over the entire floor and prepared seats then they introduced the Fraternity with Buddha at its head and invited them to sit downSitting down together with five hundred Bhikkhus the Sambuddha entered upon ecstatic meditations he diffused the rays of his kindness to all quarters of the horizonSeven times Buddha together with his pupils attained mystical trance at that place subsequently the Mahāthūpa was built the most excellent CetiyaThe Nāga king Maṇiakkhika distributed a great donation to the Bhikkhus Having accepted the donation of that Nāga having taken food and gladdened the Nāgas by preaching to them the Sambuddha together with his pupils rose up into the airAt the place of the Dīghavāpi Cetiya Buddha he who was full of compassion to the world descended from the air and again entered upon mystical meditationHaving arisen from the trance at that place the lightgiving king of the Truth together with his pupils wandering through the air then proceeded to the place where the Bo tree was to be stationed in the Mahāmeghavana gardenThe Bo trees of three former Buddhas there also had been established on the ground to that place he went and there he entered upon meditationHe thus prophesied Three Bo trees have stood at this place at the time of the teaching of  three Buddhas my Bo tree also will stand on this very spot in future timeThe highest being the chief of men having arisen from that meditation together with his pupils went to the delightful Meghavana gardenThere also he plunged himself in meditation together with his pupils Having arisen from that meditation the lightgiver proclaimedThis place first Kakusandha the chief of the world has accepted sitting down on this spot where a throne

beautiful climate fertile a mine of treasures which had been visited by former Buddhas and had been inhabited by multitudes of SaintsPerceiving the most excellent island of Laṅkā a fertile region a dwellingplace  fit for Saints the compassionate One who well understood the right and wrong time thus thoughtIn the present time Yakkhas Bhūtas and Rakkhasas inhabit Laṅkādīpa who are all too low for adopting the doctrine of the Buddhas their power I can outrootHaving driven out the hosts of Yakkhas the Pisācas and Avaruddhakas I will establish peace in the island and cause it to be inhabited by menLet those wicked beings fully live out their span of life afterwards there in the most excellent Laṅkādīpa an opportunity will arise for the propagation of the FaithHaving removed those beings having comforted many people and taught them the way the road the path of Saints I shall reach complete Parinibbāna like the setting sun Four months after my Parinibbāna the first convocation will be

monarch known as DhammāsokaThis king Asoka will have a son a clever man Mahinda the learned converter of LaṅkādīpaHaving foreseen these circumstances which were full of importance and understanding the right and wrong time the blessed Buddha placed a divine guard over this islandThe Jina having performed his various duties during the seventimes seven days at the following places that is the throne the Animisa Cetiya the cloister the jewelhouse the Ajapāla and Mucalinda trees and seventhly near the Khirapāla grove the hero went to Bārāṇasī in order to establish the kingdom of the TruthWhen he established the kingdom of the Truth and preached the most excellent Truth the conversion of eighteen koṭis of beings took placeKondañña Bhaddiya Vappa Mahānāma and Assaji these five great Theras attained emancipation when  he had preached the Anattalakkhaṇa discourseResiding in Bārāṇasī in Isipatana the Jina released the four friends of Yasa and besides the fifty youthsHaving spent the rainy season in Bārāṇasī the Tathāgata released in the Kappāsika grove the thirty BhaddavaggiyasWandering thence from place to place he came to Uruvelā there the stainless Teacher saw Uruvelakassapa an ascetic of the Jaṭila sectIn the room where Kassapa kept his sacred fire the highest of men conquered a serpent Witnessing this miracle they all invited the TathāgataReside here o Gotama during the four winter months we will daily provide you with riceThe Tathāgata the chief of men residing during the winter in Uruvelā devoted himself to the conversion of the Jaṭilas together with their followersOnce during that period both Aṅgas and Magadhas prepared a great sacrifice Kassapa seeing that great gains could be obtained at this sacrifice conceived the following ignoble thoughtThe great Samaṇa possesses high magical powers and great faculties if he shall perform miracles or preach in the great assembly the fee will escape me and go to Gotama Well the great Samaṇa should not appear in the assemblyThe Tathāgata understands action and resolution intention and desire the sixteen constituent parts of thoughtHaving understood the thought of the Jaṭila the Sage who looks through the minds of other men went by his high magical power to Uttara Kurudīpa collecting almsNear the Anotatta lake Buddha took his meal there he gave himself up to meditation jhāna and compassionate thoughtsWith his Buddhaeye the highest in the world looked over the universe the stainless Teacher then saw the most excellent LaṅkādīpaAt that time the ground of Laṅkā was covered with great forests and full of horrors frightful cruel bloodthirsty Yakkhas of various kinds and savage furious pernicious Pisācas of various shapes and full of various wicked thoughts all had assembled togetherI shall go there in their midst  I shall dispel the Rakkhasas and put away the Pisācas men shall be masters of the islandHaving considered this matter full of compassion the great hero rose into the air and came hither from JambudīpaIn the midst of the assembly of Yakkhas above their heads he was seen standing in the air holding his seat in his handsThe assembled hosts of Yakkhas saw the Sambuddha standing there but they did not think that he was the Buddha they supposed him to be another YakkhaOn the bank of the river near Mahiya Pokkhala on the site of the Subhaṅgana Thūpa there the highest of men stood and entered upon the highest ecstatic meditationThe Sage the awakener of quick attention speedily entered upon that meditation by revolving in a moment by one thought the whole system of qualities Suddenly he thence rose he who had reached all perfections by his virtuous resolutions  finished his meditationThere the hero stood performing miracles by his magical power like a Yakkha of high magical power and great supernatural faculties gathering  thick clouds containing thousands of rain drops he sent rain cold winds and darknessHe then spoke to the Yakkhas I will send you heat give unto me a place where I may sit down I possess such power over the fire as will dispel these dangersThe Yakkhas replied If thou art able to dispel them sit down wherever thou likest we all consent show thy power over the fireBuddha replied You all ask me for warmth I shall quickly produce the great heat which you are desiring a fierce burning fireAs the sun shines in summer at noon so fearful heat penetrated the assembly of YakkhasLike the heat spread by the four suns at the end of a Kappa such and greater still was the glow sent forth by the seat of the TeacherAs the rising sun cannot be restrained in the sky thus Buddhas carpet  of skin cannot be restrained in the airThe carpet diffused great heat like the fire at the end of the Kappa as the sun scorches the earth  or like a great flame of fireDiffusing heat like a heap of burning coals the carpet appeared similar to a cloud or to a glowing iron mountainIt spread insupportable heat over the islands The Yakkhas quickly fled in all ten directions to the east the west the south the north above and beneathWhither shall we go for safety and refuge How shall we be released from this fearful beingIf this powerful Yakkha assumes the form of the fiery element and burns us all of us Yakkhas will perish like a handful of chaff like dust blown away by the windAnd Buddha the chief among Sages the bringer of happiness the compassionate merciful great Sage when he saw the afflicted frightened Yakkhas thought how to administer joy to the minds of these nonhuman beingsHe then thought of another island similar to this with low ground and high ground with many various aspects beautifully adorned by rivers mountains and lakes the island of Giri most similar to the country of LaṅkāIt was free from danger well protected surrounded by the ocean full of excellent food and rich grain with a well tempered climate a green grassy land the beautiful island of Giri superior to this islandIt was charming and delightful green and cool adorned by gardens and forests exquisite there were trees full of blossoms and fruits it was empty and solitary subject to no masterIt was situated in the great sea in the midst of the ocean and of the deep waters where the waves incessantly break around it there was a chain of mountains towering difficult to pass to enter it against the wish of the inhabitants was difficultFull of desire and anger towards other beings backbiting pitiless given to injuring other beings cruel and furious violent merciless Buddha thus spoke Ye Rakkhasas and ye wicked hosts of Yakkhas I give unto you this island which is not far from Laṅkā the whole old island of Giri may they all inhabit it and multiply undisturbedThis country of Laṅkā is a residence inhabited by men since remote Kappas  may many men dwell in the country of Laṅkā as they did in former times in the Oja Vara and Maṇḍa islandAdorned with these and other good qualities a residence fit for men auspicious in many ways it will shine among the islands when the Doctrine will have been brought there like the full moon in the sky at the time of UposathaWeighing the prosperity and the high happiness of the two the Sage who knew all worlds interchanged the two islands and the two kinds of beings men and Rakkhasas as a peasant easily interchanges his pairs of bullocksGotama by his magical power drew the island towards himself like the headstalls of bullocks which are drawn towards the driver with a strong rope The Sage drew together one island towards the other like two ships which are surrounded by stout ropesHaving joined the beautiful island to the other the Tathāgata transported  the Rakkhasas saying May all Rakkhasas dwell in Giridīpa   The eager Yakkhas ran to Giridīpa like thirsty people in summer to a river they all entered it never to return the Sage then restored the island to its former placeThe highly satisfied Yakkhas and the highly pleased Rakkhasas having received this excellent island which they desired all began to laugh with great joy and all went to celebrate the festival called NakkhattamahaWhen Buddha saw that joy had been restored to these nonhuman beings he the Jina having exerted his benevolence towards them pronounced the spell of protection Having walked three times round the island for the sake of its everlasting protection and the expulsion of the Yakkha hosts having comforted the Pisācas and other nonhuman beings having established a guard and restored a lasting peace having put down all distress in the island the Tathāgata returned to Uruvelā The king Duṭṭhagāmani built an exceedingly costly quadrangular palace the Lohapāsāda of nine stories in height at an expense of thirty koṭisHe also erected the Mahāthūpa at the foundation of which the following materials were

the air from Jambudīpa as the king of swans flies in the  air Having thus risen the Theras alighted on the best of mountains MissakaTo the east of the most excellent town Anurādhapura on the cloudlike

place enclosed by hillsThere the Yakkha disappeared near the Thera seeing the Thera sitting there the king was frightenedThe Thera reflected As the king is alone he shall see also me alone lest he should be frightened when his troops have come up then he may see the Bhikkhus alsoThera Mahinda saw the prince the protector of the earth who appeared like a wicked person going to hunt he called him by the name of that prince Come hither Tissa thus he then addressed himThe king thought thus Who is that solitary baldheaded man without companion wearing a yellow garment and wrapped in a mantle who addresses  me in the language of nonhuman beingsMahinda replied I whom you ask o prince o protector of the earth am a Samaṇa belonging to the world of men We are Samaṇas great king pupils of the king of Truth out of compassion towards thee we have repaired hither from JambudīpaThe king laid aside his weapons and seated himself by the side of Mahinda having seated himself the king exchanged

and the troops also arrived fourty thousand men in number they surrounded the king and the TherasWhen the troops had come up the king perceived the other seated Theras and asked Are there many other Bhikkhus pupils of the universal BuddhaThere are many disciples of Buddha versed in the threefold science possessed of the magical powers well acquainted with the exposition of the qualities of mind who have subdued their passions and reached ArahatshipAfter having ascertained by means of the Amba parable that this victorious king was a clever person Mahinda preached to him the most excellent Hatthipada SuttaWhen they had heard that most excellent portion of the Doctrine these forty thousand men took their refuge with Buddha like a wise man in whose mind faith has arisenThen the king glad highly delighted and joyful addressed the fraternity of Bhikkhus Let us proceed to the town my capitalQuickly Mahinda converted the pious learned and wise king called Devānampiya together with his armyHearing what the king said Mahinda replied Go you great king we shall stay hereWhen he had sent away the king Mahinda the enlightener of the island addressed the fraternity of Bhikkhus Let us confer the Pabbajjā ordination on BhaṇḍukaHaving heard what the Thera said they all quickly turning their thoughts towards  that object examined the village boundary and conferred the Pabbajjā ordination on Bhaṇḍuka At the same time he received the Upasampadā ordination and attained ArahatshipThe Thera standing on the top of the mountain said to the charioteer  Nay a chariot is not suitable to us the Tathāgata has rejected its useHaving sent away the charioteer the Theras who had subdued their senses and possessed the great magical powers started through the air as the king of swans rises to the sky Descending from the sky they alighted on the groundWhen the charioteer saw them who put on their under garments and dressed themselves in their robes he joyfully went to tell the kingWhen the king had first despatched the charioteer he had thus addressed his ministers Erect a pavilion in the town within the precincts of the palaceThe princes and princesses the queens and the women of the harem who desire to meet them may see the Theras who have arrivedThe highborn ministers after having heard the speech of the king constructed in the middle of the precincts of the palace a pavilion canopied with clothA canopy was spread a clean white and spotless cloth it was decorated with flags and shells and adorned with white strips of cottonWhite sand was scattered well mixed with white flowers such was the white decorated hall similar to the snowy regions of the skiesHaving decorated the hall with entirely white cloth and having made the floor level they spoke to the kingThe well constructed beautiful hall great king is completed choose now Sire seats which are suitable for asceticsAt that moment the charioteer arrived announcing to the king A chariot Sire is not

arrived before meA high seat and a great seat are not suitable for the Bhikkhus order a carpet for them the Theras approachThe king delighted at hearing the speech of the charioteer went forth to meet the Theras and having saluted he exchanged greetings with themTaking the almsbowls of the Theras and honouring them with perfumed garlands the prince together with the Theras arrived at the gate of the royal palaceThe Thera having entered the hall in the interior apartments of the king saw the floor strewn as above described and the seat covered with clothThey sat down on the seats prepared for them which were covered with cloth When they had seated themselves the king gave them water ricegruel and food and served to them with his own hands a most excellent meal When the Thera had finished

extinguishedNow at that time the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son was residing in Sāvatthī on some businessThen he addressed a certain studentHere student go to the ascetic nanda and in my name bow with your head to his feet Ask him if he is healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortablyAnd then saySir please visit the student Subha Todeyyas son at his home out of compassionYes sir replied the student and did as he was askedWhen he had spoken Venerable nanda said to himIts not the right time studentIve drunk sufficient refreshments for todayBut hopefully tomorrow Ill get a chance to visit himYes sir replied the student He went back to Subha and told him what had happened addingThis much sir I managed to do At least Master nanda will take the opportunity to visit tomorrowThen when the night had passed nanda robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went with Venerable Cetaka as his second monk to Subhas home where he sat on the seat spread outThen Subha went up to nanda and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to nandaMaster nanda you were Master Gotamas attendant You were close to him living in his presenceYou ought to know what things Master Gotama praised and in which he encouraged settled and grounded all these peopleWhat were those thingsStudent the Buddha praised three sets of things and thats what he encouraged settled and grounded all these people inWhat threeThe entire spectrum of noble ethics immersion and wisdomThese are the three sets of things that the Buddha praisedThe Entire Spectrum of EthicsBut what was that noble spectrum of ethics that the Buddha praisedStudent its when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedHe has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to othersHe teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pureA householder hears that teaching or a householders child or someone reborn in some clanThey gain faith in the Realized Oneand reflectLiving in a house is cramped and dirty but the life of one gone forth is wide openIts not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shellWhy dont I shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessnessAfter some time they give up a large or small fortune and a large or small family circle They shave off hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessnessOnce theyve gone forth they live restrained in the monastic code conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places Seeing danger in the slightest fault they keep the rules theyve undertaken They act skillfully by body and speech Theyre purified in livelihood and accomplished in ethical conduct They guard the sense doors have mindfulness and situational awareness and are contentAnd how is a mendicant accomplished in ethicsIts when a mendicant gives up killing living creatures They renounce the rod and the sword Theyre scrupulous and kind living full of compassion for all living beings This pertains to their ethicsThere are some ascetics and brahmins who while enjoying food given in faith still earn a living by unworthy branches of knowledge by wrong livelihoodThis includes rites for propitiation for granting wishes for ghosts for the earth for rain for property settlement and for preparing and consecrating house sites and rites involving rinsing and bathing and oblations It also includes administering emetics purgatives expectorants and phlegmagogues administering earoils eye restoratives nasal medicine ointments and counterointments surgery with needle and scalpel treating children prescribing root medicines and binding on herbsThey refrain from such unworthy branches of knowledge such wrong livelihood This pertains to their ethicsA mendicant thus accomplished in ethics sees no danger in any quarter in regards to their ethical restraintIts like a king who has defeated his enemies He sees no danger from his foes in any quarterA mendicant thus accomplished in ethics sees no danger in any quarter in regards to their ethical restraintWhen they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics they experience a blameless happiness inside themselvesThats how a mendicant is accomplished in ethicsThis is that noble spectrum of ethics that the Buddha praisedBut there is still more to be doneIts incredible Master nanda its amazingThis noble spectrum of ethics is complete not lacking anythingSuch a complete spectrum of ethics cannot be seen among the other ascetics and brahminsWere other ascetics and brahmins to see such a complete spectrum of noble ethics in themselves theyd be delighted with just that muchAt this point its enough at this point our work is done Weve reached the goal of our ascetic life There is nothing more to be doneAnd yet you sayBut there is still more to be doneThe Spectrum of ImmersionBut what Master nanda was that noble spectrum of immersion that the Buddha praisedAnd how student does a mendicant guard the sense doorsWhen a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes they dont get caught up in the features and detailsIf the faculty of sight were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the faculty of sight and achieving its restraintWhen they hear a sound with their ears When they smell an odor with their nose When they taste a flavor with their tongue When they feel a touch with their body When they know a thought with their mind they dont get caught up in the features and detailsIf the faculty of mind were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the faculty of mind and achieving its restraintWhen they have this noble sense restraint they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselvesThats how a mendicant guards the sense doorsAnd how does a mendicant have mindfulness and situational awarenessIts when a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back when looking ahead and aside when bending and extending the limbs when bearing the outer robe bowl and robes when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting sleeping waking speaking and keeping silentThats how a mendicant has mindfulness and situational awarenessAnd how is a mendicant contentIts when a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the bellyWherever they go they set out taking only these thingsTheyre like a bird wherever it flies wings are its only burdenIn the same way a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the bellyWherever they go they set out taking only these thingsThats how a mendicant is contentWhen they have this noble spectrum of ethics this noble sense restraint this noble mindfulness and situational awareness and this noble contentmentthey frequent a secluded lodginga wilderness the root of a tree a hill a ravine a mountain cave a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of strawAfter the meal they return from almsround sit down crosslegged with their body straight and establish mindfulness right thereGiving up desire for the world they meditate with a heart rid of desire cleansing the mind of desireGiving up ill will and malevolence they meditate with a mind rid of ill will full of compassion for all living beings cleansing the mind of ill willGiving up dullness and drowsiness they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness perceiving light mindful and aware cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsinessGiving up restlessness and remorse they meditate without restlessness their mind peaceful inside cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorseGiving up doubt they meditate having gone beyond doubt not undecided about skillful qualities cleansing the mind of doubtSuppose a man who has gotten into debt were to apply himself to workand his efforts proved successfulHe would pay off the original loan and have enough left over to support his partnerThinking about thished be filled with joy and happinessSuppose there was a person who was sick suffering gravely ill Theyd lose their appetite and get physically weakBut after some time theyd recover from that illness and regain their appetite and their strengthThinking about thistheyd be filled with joy and happinessSuppose a person was imprisoned in a jailBut after some time they were released from jail safe and sound with no loss of wealthThinking about thistheyd be filled with joy and happinessSuppose a person was a bondservant They belonged to someone else and were unable to go where they wishBut after some time theyd be freed from servitude and become their own master an emancipated individual able to go where they wishThinking about thistheyd be filled with joy and happinessSuppose there was a person with wealth and property who was traveling along a desert road which was perilous with nothing to eatBut after some time they crossed over the desert safely reaching the neighborhood of a village a sanctuary free of perilThinking about thistheyd be filled with joy and happinessIn the same way as long as these five hindrances are not given up inside themselves a mendicant regards them as a debt a disease a prison slavery and a desert crossingBut when these five hindrances are given up inside themselves a mendicant regards this as freedom from debt good health release from prison emancipation and sanctuarySeeing that the hindrances have been given up in them joy springs up Being joyful rapture springs up When the mind is full of rapture the body becomes tranquil When the body is tranquil they feel bliss And when blissful the mind becomes immersedQuite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedThey drench steep fill and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusionIts like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish sprinkling it little by little with waterThey knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture spread through inside and out yet no moisture oozes outIn the same way a mendicant drenches steeps fills and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusionThis pertains to their immersionFurthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connectedThey drench steep fill and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersionIts like a deep lake fed by spring waterTheres no inlet to the east west north or south and no rainfall to replenish it from time to timeBut the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches steeps fills and spreads throughout the lake Theres no part of the lake thats not spread through with cool waterIn the same way a mendicant drenches steeps fills and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersionThis pertains to their immersionFurthermore with the fading away of rapture a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in blissThey drench steep fill and spread their body with bliss free of rapture Theres no part of the body thats not spread with bliss free of raptureIts like a pool with blue water lilies or pink or white lotuses Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it thriving underwater From the tip to the root theyre drenched steeped filled and soaked with cool water Theres no part of them thats not soaked with cool waterIn the same way a mendicant drenches steeps fills and spreads their body with bliss free of rapture Theres no part of the body thats not spread with bliss free of raptureThis pertains to their immersionFurthermore giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessThey sit spreading their body through with pure bright mindTheres no part of the body thats not spread with pure bright mindIts like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth Theres no part of the body thats not spread over with white clothIn the same way a mendicant sits spreading their body through with pure bright mind Theres no part of their body thats not spread with pure bright mindThis pertains to their immersionThis is that noble spectrum of immersion that the Buddha praisedBut there is still more to be doneIts incredible Master nanda its amazingThis noble spectrum of immersion is complete not lacking anythingSuch a complete spectrum of immersion cannot be seen among the other ascetics and brahminsWere other ascetics and brahmins to see such a complete spectrum of noble immersion in themselves theyd be delighted with just that muchAt this point its enough at this point our work is done Weve reached the goal of our ascetic life There is nothing more to be doneAnd yet you sayBut there is still more to be doneThe Spectrum of WisdomBut what Master nanda was that noble spectrum of wisdom that the Buddha praisedWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it and project it toward knowledge and visionThey understandThis body of mine is physical Its made up of the four primary elements produced by mother and father built up from rice and porridge liable to impermanence to wearing away and erosion to breaking up and destruction And this consciousness of mine is attached to it tied to itSuppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful eightfaceted wellworked transparent clear and unclouded endowed with all good qualitiesAnd it was strung with a thread of blue yellow red white or golden brownAnd someone with good eyesight were to take it in their hand and examine itThis beryl gem is naturally beautiful eightfaceted wellworked transparent clear and unclouded endowed with all good qualitiesAnd its strung with a thread of blue yellow red white or golden brownIn the same way when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it and project it toward knowledge and visionThis pertains to their wisdomWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it and project it toward the creation of a mindmade bodyFrom this body they create another body physical mindmade complete in all its various parts not deficient in any facultySuppose a person was to draw a reed out from its sheathTheyd thinkThis is the reed this is the sheath The reed and the sheath are different things The reed has been drawn out from the sheathOr suppose a person was to draw a sword out from its scabbardTheyd thinkThis is the sword this is the scabbard The sword and the scabbard are different things The sword has been drawn out from the scabbardOr suppose a person was to draw a snake out from its sloughTheyd thinkThis is the snake this is the slough The snake and the slough are different things The snake has been drawn out from the sloughIn the same way when their mind has

pertains to their wisdomWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it and project it toward psychic powerThey wield the many kinds of psychic power multiplying themselves and becoming one again going unimpeded through a wall a rampart or a mountain as if through space diving in and out of the earth as if it were water walking on water as if it were earth flying crosslegged through the sky like a bird touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon so mighty and powerful controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realmSuppose an expert potter or their apprentice had some wellprepared clay They could produce any kind of pot that they likeOr suppose an expert ivorycarver or their apprentice had some wellprepared ivory They could produce any kind of ivory item that they likeOr suppose an expert goldsmith or their apprentice had some wellprepared gold They could produce any kind of gold item that they likeIn the same way when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it and project it toward psychic powerThis pertains to their wisdomWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it and project it toward clairaudienceWith clairaudience that is purified and superhuman they hear both kinds of sounds human and divine whether near or farSuppose there was a person traveling along the roadTheyd hear the sound of drums clay drums horns kettledrums and tomtomsTheyd think Thats the sound of drums and thats the sound of claydrums and thats the sound of horns kettledrums and tomtomsIn the same way when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it

with hate mind without hate mind with delusion mind without delusion constricted mind scattered mind expansive mind unexpansive mind mind that is not supreme mind that is supreme immersed mind unimmersed mind freed mind They understand unfreed mind as unfreed mindSuppose there was a woman or man who was young youthful and fond of adornments and they check their own reflection in a clean bright mirror or a clear bowl of water If they had a spot theyd know I have a spot and if they had no spots theyd know I have no spotsIn the same way when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it and project it toward comprehending the minds of othersThis pertains to their wisdomWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it and project it toward recollection of past livesThey recollect many kinds of past lives that is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expandingThey rememberThere I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my foodThis was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life endedWhen I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else There too I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn here And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and detailsSuppose a person was to leave their home village and go to another villageFrom that village theyd go to yet another village And from that village theyd return to their home village Theyd thinkI went from my home village to another villageThere I stood like this sat like that spoke like this or kept silent like thatFrom that village I went to yet another village There too I stood like this sat like that spoke like this or kept silent like that And from that village I returned to my home villageIn the same way when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it and project it toward recollection of past livesThis pertains to their wisdomWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it and project it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beingsWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad placeThey understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsThese dear beings did bad things by way of body speech and mindThey spoke ill of the noble ones they had wrong view and they chose to act out of that wrong viewWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell These dear beings however did good things by way of body speech and mind They never spoke ill of the noble ones they had right view and they chose to act out of that right view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm And so with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsSuppose there was a stilt longhouse at the central squareA person with good eyesight standing there might see people entering and leaving a house walking along the streets and paths and sitting at the central square Theyd thinkThese are people entering and leaving a house walking along the streets and paths and sitting at the central squareIn the same way when their mind has become immersed

pertains to their wisdomWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it and project it toward knowledge of the ending of defilementsThey truly understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingThey truly understand These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilementsKnowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceWhen theyre freed they know theyre freedThey understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceSuppose that in a mountain glen there was a lake that was transparent clear and uncloudedA person with good eyesight standing on the bank would see the mussel shells gravel and pebbles and schools of fish swimming about or staying stillTheyd thinkThis lake is transparent clear and uncloudedAnd here are the mussel shells gravel and pebbles and schools of fish swimming about or staying stillIn the same way when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it and project it toward knowledge of the ending of defilementsThis pertains to their wisdomThis is that noble spectrum of wisdom that the Buddha praisedAnd there is nothing more to be doneIts incredible Master nanda its amazingThis noble spectrum of wisdom is complete not lacking anythingSuch a complete spectrum of wisdom cannot be seen among the other ascetics and brahminsAnd there is nothing more to be doneExcellent Master nanda ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master nanda has made the teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may Master nanda remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeLong DiscoursesWith SoṇadaṇḍaThe Brahmins and Householders of CampāSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Aṅgas together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants when he arrived at Campāwhere he stayed by the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus PondNow at that time the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa was living in Campā It was a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha teeming with living creatures full of hay wood water and grain a royal endowment of the highest qualityThe brahmins and householders of Campā heardIt seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyhas arrived at Campā and is

brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to othersHe teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pureIts good to see such perfected onesThen having departed Campā they formed into companies and headed to the Gaggarā Lotus PondNow at that time the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday napHe saw the brahmins and householders heading for the lotus pondand addressed his stewardMy steward why are the brahmins and

himThis is the extent of Master Gotamas praise that I have learned But his praises are not confined to thisfor the praise of Master Gotama is limitlessWhen he had spoken those brahmins said to himAccording to Soṇadaṇḍas praises if Master Gotama were staying within a hundred leagues itd be worthwhile for a faithful gentleman to go to see him even if he had to carry his own provisions in a shoulder bagWell then gentlemen lets all go to see the ascetic GotamaSoṇadaṇḍas Second ThoughtsThen Soṇadaṇḍa together with a large group of brahmins went to see the BuddhaBut as he reached the far side of the forest this thought came to mindSuppose I was to ask the ascetic Gotama a questionHe might say to meBrahmin you shouldnt ask your question like that This is how you should ask it And the assembly might disparage me for thatSoṇadaṇḍa is foolish and incompetent Hes not able to properly ask the ascetic Gotama a questionAnd when youre disparaged by the assembly your reputation diminishesWhen your reputation diminishes your wealth also diminishesBut my wealth relies on my reputationOr if the ascetic Gotama asks me a question I might not satisfy him with my answerHe might say to meBrahmin you shouldnt answer the question like that This is how you should answer it And the assembly might disparage me for thatSoṇadaṇḍa is foolish and incompetent Hes not able to satisfy the ascetic Gotamas mind with his answerAnd when youre disparaged by the assembly your reputation diminishesWhen your reputation diminishes your wealth also diminishesBut my wealth relies on my reputationOn the other hand if I were to turn back after having come so far without having seen the ascetic Gotama the assembly might disparage me for thatSoṇadaṇḍa is foolish and incompetent Hes stuckup and scared He doesnt dare to go and see the ascetic Gotama For how on earth can he turn back after having come so far without having seen the ascetic GotamaAnd when youre disparaged by the assembly your reputation diminishesWhen your reputation diminishes your wealth also diminishesBut my wealth relies on my reputationThen Soṇadaṇḍa went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one sideBefore sitting down to one side some of the brahmins and householders of Campā bowed some exchanged greetings and polite conversation some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha some announced their name and clan while some kept silentBut while sitting there Soṇadaṇḍa continued to be plagued by many second thoughts He thoughtIf only the ascetic Gotama would ask me about my own teachers scriptural heritage of the three Vedas Then I could definitely satisfy his mind with my answerWhat Makes a BrahminThen the Buddha knowing what Soṇadaṇḍa was thinking thoughtThis brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa is worried by his own thoughtsWhy dont I ask him about his own teachers scriptural heritage of the three VedasSo he said to SoṇadaṇḍaBrahmin how many factors must a brahmin possess for the brahmins to describe him as a brahminand so that when he says I am a brahmin he speaks rightly without falling into falsehoodThen Soṇadaṇḍa thoughtThe ascetic Gotama has asked me about exactly what I wanted what I wished for what I desired what I yearned for that is my own scriptural heritageI can definitely satisfy his mind with my answerThen Soṇadaṇḍa straightened his back looked around the assembly and said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama a brahmin must possess five factors for the brahmins to describe him as a brahminand so that when he says I am a brahmin he speaks rightly without falling into falsehoodWhat fiveIts when a brahmin is well born on both his mothers and fathers side of pure descent irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generationHe recites and remembers the hymns and has mastered the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth He knows philology and grammar and is well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great manHe is attractive goodlooking lovely of surpassing beauty He is magnificent splendid remarkable to beholdHe is ethical mature in ethical conductHes astute and clever being the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladleThese are the five factors which a brahmin must possess for the brahmins to describe him as a brahminand so that when he says I am a brahmin he speaks rightly without falling into falsehoodBut brahmin is it possible to set aside one of these five factors and still rightly describe someone as a brahminIt is possible Master GotamaWe could leave appearance out of the five factorsFor what does appearance matterA brahmin must possess the remaining four factors for the brahmins to rightly describe him as a brahminBut brahmin is it possible to set aside one of these four factors and still rightly describe someone as a brahminIt is possible Master GotamaWe could leave the hymns out of the five factorsFor what do the hymns matterA brahmin must possess the remaining three factors for the brahmins to rightly describe him as a brahminBut brahmin is it possible to set aside one of these three factors and still rightly describe someone as a brahminIt is possible Master GotamaWe could leave birth out of the five factorsFor what does birth matterIts when a brahmin is ethical mature in ethical conductand hes astute and clever being the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladleA brahmin must possess these two factors for the brahmins to rightly describe him as a brahminWhen he had spoken those brahmins said to himPlease dont say that Master Soṇadaṇḍa please dont say thatYoure just condemning appearance the hymns and birth Youre totally going over to the ascetic Gotamas doctrineSo the Buddha said to themWell brahmins if you think thatSoṇadaṇḍa is uneducated a poor speaker witless and not capable of having a dialogue with me about this then leave him aside and you can have a dialogue with meBut if you think thathes learned a good speaker astute and capable of having a dialogue with me about this then you should stand aside and let him have a dialogue with meWhen he said this Soṇadaṇḍa said to the BuddhaLet it be Master Gotama be silent I myself will respond to them in a legitimate mannerThen he said to those brahminsDont say this gentlemen dont say thisYoure just condemning appearance the hymns and birth Youre totally going over to the ascetic Gotamas doctrineIm not condemning appearance hymns or birthNow at that time Soṇadaṇḍas nephew the student Aṅgaka was sitting in that assemblyThen Soṇadaṇḍa said to those brahminsGentlemen do you see my nephew the student AṅgakaYes sirAṅgaka is attractive goodlooking lovely of surpassing beauty He is magnificent splendid remarkable to behold Theres noone in this assembly so goodlooking apart from the ascetic GotamaAṅgaka recites and remembers the hymns and has mastered the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth He knows philology and grammar and is well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great manAnd I am the one who teaches him the hymnsAṅgaka is well born on both his mothers and fathers side of pure descent irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generationAnd I know his mother and fatherBut if Aṅgaka were to kill living creatures steal commit adultery lie and drink alcohol then whats the use of his appearance his hymns or his birthIts when a brahmin is ethical mature in ethical conductand hes astute and clever being the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladleA brahmin must possess these two factors for the brahmins to rightly describe him as a brahminThe Discussion of Ethics and WisdomBut brahmin is it possible to set aside one of these two factors and still rightly describe someone as a brahminNo Master GotamaFor wisdom is cleansed by ethics and ethics are cleansed by wisdomEthics and wisdom always go togetherAn ethical person is wise and a wise person ethicalAnd ethics and wisdom are said to be the best things in the worldIts just like when you clean one hand with the other or clean one foot with the otherIn the same way wisdom is cleansed by ethics and ethics are cleansed by wisdomEthics and wisdom always go togetherAn ethical person is wise and a wise person ethicalAnd ethics and wisdom are said to be the best things in the worldThats so true brahmin thats so true For wisdom is cleansed by ethics and ethics are cleansed by wisdomEthics and wisdom always go togetherAn ethical person is wise and a wise person ethicalAnd ethics and wisdom are said to be the best things in the worldIts just like when you clean one hand with the other or clean one foot with the otherIn the same way wisdom is cleansed by ethics and ethics are cleansed by wisdomEthics and wisdom always go togetherAn ethical person is wise and a wise person ethicalAnd ethics and wisdom are said to be the best things in the worldBut what brahmin is that ethical conductAnd what is that wisdomThats all I know about this matter Master GotamaMay Master Gotama himself please clarify the meaning of thisWell then brahmin listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir Soṇadaṇḍa repliedThe Buddha said thisIts when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha Thats how a mendicant is accomplished in ethicsThis brahmin is that ethical conduct They enter and remain in the first absorption second absorption third absorption fourth absorption They extend and project the mind toward knowledge and vision This pertains to their wisdom They understand  there is no return to any state of existenceThis pertains to their wisdomThis brahmin is that wisdomSoṇadaṇḍa Declares Himself a Lay FollowerWhen he had spoken Soṇadaṇḍa said to the BuddhaExcellent Master Gotama ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeWould you and the Order of monks please accept a meal from me tomorrowThe Buddha consented in silenceThen knowing that the Buddha had consented Soṇadaṇḍa got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leavingAnd when the night had passed Soṇadaṇḍa had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home Then he had the Buddha informed of the time sayingIts time Master Gotama the meal is readyThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to the home of Soṇadaṇḍa together with the mendicant Saṅgha where he sat on the seat spread outThen Soṇadaṇḍa served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foodsWhen the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl Soṇadaṇḍa took a low seat and sat to one sideSeated to one side he said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama if when I have gone to an assembly I rise from my seat and bow to the Buddha that assembly might disparage me for thatAnd when youre disparaged by the assembly your reputation diminishesWhen your reputation diminishes your wealth also diminishesBut my wealth relies on my reputationIf when I have gone to an assembly I raise my joined palms please take it that I have risen from my seatAnd if I undo my turban please take it that I have bowedAnd Master Gotama if when I am in a carriage I rise from my seat and bow to the Buddha that assembly might disparage me for thatIf when I am in a carriage I hold up my goad please take it that I have got down from my carriageAnd if I lower my sunshade please take it that I have bowedThen the Buddha educated encouraged fired up and inspired the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa with a Dhamma talk after which he got up from his seat and leftLong DiscoursesKing MahāsudassanaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying between a pair of sal trees in the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā at the time of his final extinguishmentThen Venerable nanda went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir please dont become fully extinguished in this little hamlet this jungle hamlet this branch hamletThere are other great cities such asCampā Rājagaha Sāvatthī Sāketa Kosambī and BenaresLet the Buddha become fully extinguished thereThere are many welltodo aristocrats brahmins and householders there who are devoted to the Buddha They will perform the rites of venerating the Realized Ones corpseDont say that nanda Dont say thatthis is a little hamlet a jungle hamlet a branch hamletThe Capital City of KusāvatīOnce upon a time there was a king named Mahāsudassana whose dominion extended to all four sides and who achieved stability in the countryHis capital was this Kusinārā which at the time was named KusāvatīIt stretched for twelve leagues from east to west and seven leagues from north to southThe royal capital of Kusāvatī was successful prosperous populous full of people with plenty of foodIt was just like ḷakamandā the royal capital of the gods which is successful prosperous populous full of spirits with plenty of foodKusāvatī was never free of ten sounds by day or night namelythe sound of elephants horses chariots drums clay drums arched harps singing horns gongs and handbells and the cry Eat drink be merry as the tenthKusāvatī was encircled by seven rampartsone made of gold one made of silver one made of beryl one made of crystal one made of ruby one made of emerald and one made of all precious thingsIt had four gatesmade of gold silver beryl and crystalAt each gate there were seven

drunkards in Kusāvatī at that time were entertained by that soundThe Seven TreasuresThe WheelTreasureKing Mahāsudassana possessed seven treasures and four blessingsWhat sevenOn a fifteenth day sabbath King Mahāsudassana had bathed his head and gone upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbathAnd the heavenly wheeltreasure appeared to him with a thousand spokes with rim and hub complete in every detailSeeing this the king thoughtI have heard that when the heavenly wheeltreasure appears to a king in this way he becomes a wheelturning monarchAm I then a wheelturning monarchThen King Mahāsudassana rising from his seat and arranging his robe over one shoulder took a ceremonial vase in his left hand and besprinkled the wheeltreasure with his right hand sayingRoll forth O

saidDo not kill living creatures Do not steal Do not commit sexual misconduct Do not lie Do not drink alcohol Maintain the current level of taxationAnd so the opposing rulers of the eastern quarter

foremostHe had  milkcows with silken reins and bronze pailsHe had  fine cloths of linen cotton silk and woolHe had  servings of food which were presented to him as offerings in the morning and eveningNow at that time his  royal elephants came to attend on him in the morning and eveningThen King Mahāsudassana thoughtWhat if instead half of the elephants took turns to attend on me at the end of each centuryHe instructed the counselortreasure to do this and so it was doneThe Visit of Queen SubhaddāThen after many years many hundred years many thousand years had passed Queen Subhaddā thoughtIt is long since I have seen the kingWhy dont I go to see himSo the queen addressed the ladies of the haremCome bathe your heads and dress in yellowIt is long since we saw the king and we shall go to see himYes maam replied the ladies of the harem They did as she asked and returned to the queenThen the queen addressed the counselortreasureDear counselortreasure please ready the army of four divisions It is long since we saw the king and we shall go to see himYes my queen he replied and did as he was asked He informed the queenMy queen the army of four divisions is readyplease go at your convenienceThen Queen Subhaddā together with the ladies of the harem went with the army to the Palace of Principle She ascended the palace and went to the great foyerwhere she stood leaning against a doorpostHearing them the king thoughtWhats that it sounds like a big crowd Coming out of the foyer he saw Queen Subhaddā leaning against a doorpost and said to herPlease stay there my queen dont enter in hereThen he addressed a certain manCome mister bring the golden couch from the great foyer and set it up in the golden palm groveYes Your Majesty that man replied and did as he was askedThe king laid down in the lions postureon the right side placing one foot on top of the othermindful and awareThen Queen Subhaddā thoughtThe kings faculties are so very clear and the complexion of his skin is pure and bright Let him not pass away She said to himSire you have  cities with the royal capital of Kusāvatī foremostArouse desire for these Take an interest in lifeAnd she likewise urged the king to live on by taking an interest in all his possessions as described aboveWhen the queen had spoken the king said to herFor a long time my queen you have spoken to me with loving desirable pleasant and agreeable wordsAnd yet in my final hour your words are undesirable unpleasant and disagreeableThen how exactly Your Majesty am I to speak to youLike this my queenSire we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved Dont pass away with concerns Such concern is suffering and its criticizedSire you have  cities with the royal capital of Kusāvatī foremostGive up desire for these Take no interest in lifeAnd so on for all the kings possessionsWhen the king had spoken Queen Subhaddā cried and burst out in tearsWiping away her tears the queen said to the kingSire we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved Dont pass away with concerns Such concern is suffering and its criticizedSire you have  cities with the royal capital of Kusāvatī foremostGive up desire for these Take no interest in lifeAnd she continued listing all the kings possessionsRebirth in the Brahmā RealmNot long after that King Mahāsudassana passed awayAnd the feeling he had close to death was like a householder or their child falling asleep after eating a delectable mealWhen he passed away King Mahāsudassana was reborn in a good place a Brahmā realmnanda King Mahāsudassana played childrens games for  yearsHe ruled as viceroy for  yearsHe ruled as king for  yearsHe led the spiritual life as a layman in the Palace of Principle for  yearsAnd having developed the four Brahmā meditations when his body broke up after death he was reborn in a good place a Brahmā realmNow nanda you might thinkSurely King Mahāsudassana must have been someone else at that timeBut you should not see it like thatI myself was King Mahāsudassana at that timeMine were the  cities with the royal capital of Kusāvatī foremost And mine were all the other possessionsOf those  cities I only stayed in one the capital KusāvatīOf those  mansions I only dwelt in one the Palace of PrincipleOf those  chambers I only dwelt in the great foyerOf those  couches I only used one made of gold or silver or ivory or heartwoodOf those  bull elephants I only rode one the royal bull elephant named SabbathOf those  horses I only rode one the royal horse named ThundercloudOf those  chariots I only rode one the chariot named TriumphOf those  women I was only served by one a maiden of the aristocratic or merchant classesOf those  cloths I only wore one pair made of fine linen cotton silk or woolOf those  servings of food I only had one eating at most a serving of rice and suitable sauceSee nanda All those conditioned phenomena have passed ceased and perishedSo impermanent are conditionsso unstable are conditionsso unreliable are conditionsThis is quite enough for you to become disillusioned dispassionate and freed regarding all conditionsSix times nanda I recall having laid down my body at this place And the seventh time was as a wheelturning monarch a just and principled king at which time my dominion extended to all four sides I achieved stability in the country and I possessed the seven treasuresBut nanda I do not see any place in this world with its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humans where the Realized One would lay down his body for the eighth timeThat is what the Buddha saidThen the Holy One the Teacher went on to sayOh Conditions are impermanenttheir nature is to rise and fallhaving arisen they ceasetheir stilling is true blissLong DiscoursesInspiring ConfidenceSāriputtas Lions RoarSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Nālandā in Pāvārikas mango groveThen Sāriputta went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir I have such confidence in the Buddha that I believe theres no other ascetic or brahminwhether past future or presentwhose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakeningThats a grand and dramatic statement Sāriputta Youve roared a definitive categorical lions roar sayingI have such confidence in the Buddha thatI believe theres no other ascetic or brahminwhether past future or presentwhose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakeningWhat about all the perfected ones the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past Have you comprehended their minds to know thatthose Buddhas had such ethics or such qualities or such wisdom or such meditation or such freedomNo sirAnd what about all the perfected ones the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future Have you comprehended their minds to know thatthose Buddhas will have such ethics or such qualities or such wisdom or such meditation or such freedomNo sirAnd what about me the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha at present Have you comprehended my mind to know thatI have such ethics or such qualities or such wisdom or such meditation or such freedomNo sirWell then Sāriputta given that you dont comprehend the minds of Buddhas past future or presentwhat exactly are you doing making such a grand and dramatic statement roaring such a definitive categorical lions roarSir though I dont comprehend the minds of Buddhas past future and presentstill I understand this by inference from the teachingSuppose there were a kings frontier citadel with fortified embankments ramparts and arches and a single gateAnd it has a gatekeeper who is astute competent and clever He keeps strangers out and lets known people inAs he walks around the patrol path he doesnt see a hole or cleft in the wall not even one big enough for a cat to slip outTheyd thinkWhatever sizable creatures enter or leave the citadel all of them do so via this gateIn the same way I understand this by inference from the teachingAll the perfected ones fully awakened Buddhaswhether past future or presentgive up the five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom Their mind is firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation They correctly develop the seven awakening factors And they wake up to the supreme perfect awakeningSir once I approached the Buddha to listen to the teachingHe explained Dhamma with its higher and higher stages with its better and better stages with its dark and bright sidesWhen I directly knew a certain principle of those teachings in accordance with how I was taught I came to a conclusion about the teachings I had confidence in the TeacherThe Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is

are these three eternalist doctrinesFirstly some ascetic or brahminby dint of keen resolute committed and diligent effort and right focusexperiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect many hundreds of thousands of past liveswith features and detailsI know that in the past the cosmos expanded or contractedI dont know whether in the future the cosmos will expand or contractThe self and the cosmos are eternal barren steady as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillarThey remain the same for all eternity while these sentient beings wander and transmigrate and pass away and reariseThis is the first eternalist doctrineFurthermore some ascetic or brahminby dint of keen resolute committed and diligent effort and right focusexperiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect their past lives for as many as ten eons of the expansion and contraction of the cosmoswith features and detailsI know that in the past the cosmos expanded or contractedI dont know whether in the future the cosmos will expand or contractThe self and the cosmos are eternal barren steady as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillarThey remain the same for all eternity while these sentient beings wander and transmigrate and pass away and reariseThis is the second eternalist doctrineFurthermore some ascetic or brahminby dint of keen resolute committed and diligent effort and right focusexperiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect their past lives for as many as forty eons of the expansion and contraction of the cosmoswith features and detailsI know that in the past the cosmos expanded or contractedI dont know whether in the future the cosmos will expand or contractThe self and the cosmos are eternal barren steady as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillarThey remain the same for all eternity while these sentient beings wander and transmigrate and pass away and reariseThis is the third eternalist doctrineThis is unsurpassable when it comes to eternalist doctrinesRecollecting Past LivesAnd moreover sir how the Buddha teaches the knowledge of recollecting past lives is unsurpassableIts when some

one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding They rememberThere I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my foodThis was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else There too I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn here And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and detailsSir there are gods whose life span cannot be reckoned or calculatedStill no matter what incarnation they have previously been reborn inwhether physical or formless or percipient or nonpercipient or neither percipient nor nonpercipientthey recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and detailsThis is unsurpassable when it comes to the knowledge of recollecting past livesDeath and RebirthAnd moreover sir how the Buddha teaches the knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings is unsurpassableIts when some ascetic or brahminby dint of keen resolute committed and diligent effort and right focusexperiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsThese dear beings did bad things by way of body speech and mindThey spoke ill of the noble ones they had wrong view and they chose to act out of that wrong viewWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellThese dear beings however did good things by way of body speech and mindThey never spoke ill of the noble ones they had right view and they chose to act out of that right view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm And so

unsurpassableThere are these two kinds of psychic powerThere are psychic powers that are accompanied by defilements and attachments and are said to be ignobleAnd there are psychic powers that are free of defilements and attachments and are said to be nobleWhat are the psychic powers that are accompanied by defilements and attachments and are said to be ignobleIts when some ascetic or brahminby dint of keen resolute committed and diligent effort and right focusexperiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they wield the many kinds of psychic powermultiplying themselves and becoming one again going unimpeded through a wall a rampart or a mountain as if through space diving in and out of the earth as if it were water walking on water as if it were earth flying crosslegged through the sky like a bird touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon so mighty and powerful controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realmThese are the psychic powers that are accompanied by defilements and attachments and are said to be ignobleBut what are the psychic powers that are free of defilements and attachments and are said to be nobleIts when if a mendicant wishesMay I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive thats what they doIf they wishMay I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive thats what they doIf they wishMay I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive and the unrepulsive thats what they doIf they wishMay I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive thats what they doIf they wishMay I meditate staying equanimous mindful and aware rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive thats what they doThese are the psychic powers that are free of defilements and attachments and are said to be nobleThis is unsurpassable when it comes to psychic powersThe Buddha understands this without exception There is nothing to be understood beyond this whereby another ascetic or brahmin might be superior in direct knowledge to the Buddha when it comes to psychic powersThe Four AbsorptionsThe Buddha has achieved what should be achieved by a faithful gentleman by being energetic and strong by human strength energy vigor and exertionThe Buddha doesnt indulge in sensual pleasures which are low crude ordinary ignoble and pointless And he doesnt indulge in selfmortification which is painful ignoble and pointlessHe gets the four absorptionsblissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mindwhen he wants without trouble or difficultyOn Being QuestionedSir if they were to ask meReverend Sāriputta is there any other ascetic or brahminwhether past future or presentwhose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening I would tell them NoBut if they were to ask meReverend Sāriputta is there any other ascetic or brahminwhether past or futurewhose direct knowledge is equal to the Buddha when it comes to awakening I would tell them YesBut if they were to ask Reverend Sāriputta is there any other ascetic or brahmin at present whose direct knowledge is equal to the Buddha when it comes to awakening I would tell them NoBut if they were to ask meBut why does Venerable Sāriputta grant this in respect of some but not others I would answer them like thisReverends I have heard and learned this in the presence of the BuddhaThe perfected ones fully awakened Buddhas of the past and the future are equal to myself when it comes to awakeningAnd I have also heard and learned this in the presence of the BuddhaIts impossible for two perfected ones fully awakened Buddhas to arise in the same solar system at the same timeAnswering this way I trust that I repeated what the Buddha has said and didnt misrepresent him with an untruth I trust my explanation was in line with the teaching and that there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticismIndeed Sāriputta in answering this way you repeat what Ive said and dont misrepresent me with an untruth Your explanation is in line with the teaching and there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticismIncredible and AmazingWhen he had spoken Venerable Udāyī said to the BuddhaIts incredible sir its amazing The Realized One has so few wishes such contentment such selfeffacementFor even though the Realized One has such power and might he will not make a display of himselfIf the wanderers following other paths were to see even a single one of these qualities in themselves theyd carry around a banner to that effectIts incredible sir its amazing The Realized One has so few wishes such contentment such selfeffacementFor even though the Realized One has such power and might he will not make a display of himselfSee Udāyī how the Realized One has so few wishes such contentment such selfeffacementFor even though the Realized One has such power and might he will not make a display of himselfIf the wanderers following other paths were to see even a single one of these qualities in themselves theyd carry around a banner to that effectSee Udāyī how the Realized One has so few wishes such contentment such selfeffacementFor even though the Realized One has such power and might he will not make a display of himselfThen the Buddha said to Venerable SāriputtaSo Sāriputta you should frequently speak this exposition of the teaching to the monks nuns laymen and laywomenThough there will be some foolish people who have doubt or uncertainty regarding the Realized One when they hear this exposition of the teaching theyll give up that doubt or uncertaintyThats how Venerable Sāriputta declared his confidence in the Buddhas presenceAnd thats why the name of this discussion is Inspiring ConfidenceLong DiscoursesThe Prime NetTalk on WanderersSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was traveling along the road between Rājagaha and Nālanda together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicantsThe wanderer Suppiya was also traveling along the same road together with his pupil the brahmin student BrahmadattaMeanwhile Suppiya criticized the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha in many waysbut his pupil Brahmadatta praised them in many waysAnd so both teacher and pupil followed behind the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants directly contradicting each otherThen the Buddha took up residence for the night in the royal resthouse in Ambalaṭṭhikā together with the Saṅgha of mendicantsAnd Suppiya and Brahmadatta did likewiseThere too Suppiya criticized the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha in many waysbut his pupil Brahmadatta praised them in many waysAnd so both teacher and pupil kept on directly contradicting each otherThen several mendicants rose at the crack of dawn and sat together in the pavilion where the topic of evaluation came upIts incredible reverends its amazing how the diverse attitudes of sentient beings have been clearly comprehended by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaFor this Suppiya criticizes the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha in many wayswhile his pupil Brahmadatta praises them in many waysAnd so both teacher and pupil followed behind the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants directly contradicting each otherWhen the Buddha found out about this discussion on evaluation among the mendicants he went to the pavilion where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicantsMendicants what were you sitting talking about just now What conversation was left unfinishedThe mendicants told him what had happened addingThis was our conversation that was unfinished when the Buddha arrivedMendicants if others criticize me the teaching or the Saṅgha dont make yourselves resentful bitter and exasperatedYoull get angry and upset which would be an obstacle for you aloneIf others were to criticize me the teaching or the Saṅgha and you got angry and upset would you be able to understand whether they spoke well or poorlyNo sirIf others criticize me the teaching or the Saṅgha you should explain that what is untrue is in fact untrueThis is why thats untrue this is why thats false Theres no such thing in us its not found among usIf others praise me the teaching or the Saṅgha dont make yourselves thrilled elated and excitedYoull get thrilled elated and excited which would be an obstacle for you aloneIf others praise me the teaching or the Saṅgha you should acknowledge that what is true is in fact trueThis is why thats true this is why thats correct There is such a thing in us it is found among usThe Shorter Section on EthicsWhen an ordinary

peaceful sublime beyond the scope of logic subtle comprehensible to the astutewhich the Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight Those who genuinely praise the Realized One

ascetics and brahmins who are partial eternalists who assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal and partially not eternal on four groundsAnd what are the four grounds on which they relyThere comes a time when after a very long period has passed this cosmos contractsAs the cosmos contracts sentient beings are mostly headed for the realm of streaming radianceThere they are mindmade feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the sky steadily glorious and they remain like that for a very long timeThere comes a time when after a very long period has passed this cosmos expandsAs it expands an empty mansion of Brahmā appearsThen a certain sentient beingdue to the running out of their lifespan or meritpasses away from that host of radiant deities and is reborn in that empty mansion of BrahmāThere they are mindmade feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the sky steadily glorious and they remain like that for a very long timeBut after staying there all alone for a long time they become dissatisfied and anxiousOh if only another being would come to this state of existenceThen other sentient beingsdue to the running out of their lifespan or meritpass away from that host of radiant deities and are reborn in that empty mansion of Brahmā in company with that beingThere they too are mindmade feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the sky steadily glorious and they remain like that for a very long timeNow the being who was reborn there first thinksI am Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Undefeated the Champion the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord God the Maker the Author the First the Begetter the Controller the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be bornThese beings were created by meWhy is thatBecause first I thoughtOh if only another being would come to this state of existenceSuch was my hearts wish and then these creatures came to this state of existenceAnd the beings who were reborn there later also thinkThis must be Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Undefeated the Champion the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord God the Maker the Author the First the Begetter the Controller the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be bornAnd we have been created by himWhy is thatBecause we see that he was reborn here first and we arrived laterAnd the being who was reborn first is more longlived beautiful and illustrious than those who arrived laterIts possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existenceHaving done so they go forth from the lay life to homelessnessBy dint of keen resolute committed and diligent effort and right focus they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life but no furtherHe who is Brahmāthe Great Brahmā the Undefeated the Champion the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord God the Maker the Author the First the Begetter the Controller the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be bornis permanent everlasting eternal imperishable remaining the same for all eternityWe who were created by that Brahmā are impermanent not lasting shortlived perishable and have come to this state of existenceThis is the first ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternalAnd what is the second ground on which they relyThere are gods named depraved by play They spend too much time laughing playing and making merryAnd in doing so they lose their mindfulness and they pass away from that host of godsIts possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existenceHaving done so they go forth from the lay life to homelessnessBy dint of keen resolute committed and diligent effort and right focus they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life but no furtherThe gods not depraved by play dont spend too much time laughing playing and making merrySo they dont lose their mindfulness and dont pass away from that host of godsThey are permanent everlasting eternal imperishable remaining the same for all eternityBut we who were depraved by play spent too much time laughing playing and making merryIn doing so we lost our mindfulness and passed away from that host of godsWe are impermanent not lasting shortlived perishable and have come to this state of existenceThis is the second ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternalAnd what is the third ground on which they relyThere are gods named malevolentThey spend too much time gazing at each other so they grow angry with each other and their bodies and minds get tiredThey pass away from that host of godsIts possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existenceHaving done so they go forth from the lay life to homelessnessBy dint of keen resolute committed and diligent effort and right focus they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life but no furtherThe gods who are not malevolent dont spend too much time gazing at each other so they dont grow angry with each other their bodies and minds dont get tired and they dont pass away from that host of godsThey are permanent everlasting eternal imperishable remaining the same for all eternityBut we who were malevolent spent too much time gazing at each other we grew angry with each other our bodies and minds got tired and we passed away from that host of godsWe are impermanent not lasting shortlived perishable and have come to this state of existenceThis is the third ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternalAnd what is the fourth ground on which they relyIts when some ascetic or brahmin relies on logic and inquiryThey speak of what they have worked out by logic following a line of inquiry expressing their own perspectiveThat which is called the eye or the ear or the nose or the tongue or the body that self is impermanent not lasting transient perishableThat which is called mind or sentience or consciousness that self is permanent everlasting eternal imperishable remaining the same for all eternityThis is the fourth ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternalThese are the four grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal and partially not eternalAny ascetics and brahmins who assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal and partially not eternal do so on one or other of these four grounds Outside of this there is noneThe Realized One understands thisIf you hold on to and attach to these grounds for views it leads to such and such a destiny in the next lifeHe understands this and what goes

Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these thingsThe Cosmos is Finite or InfiniteThere are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about size and assert that the cosmos is finite or infinite on four groundsAnd what are the four grounds on which they relyIts when some ascetic or brahminby dint of keen resolute committed and diligent effort and right focusexperiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they meditate perceiving the cosmos as finiteThe cosmos is finite and boundedWhy is thatBecause by dint of keen resolute committed and diligent effort and right focus I experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that I meditate perceiving the cosmos as finiteBecause of this I knowThe cosmos is finite and boundedThis is the first ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the cosmos is finite or infiniteAnd what is the second ground on which they

thingsEquivocatorsThere are some ascetics and brahmins who are equivocators Whenever theyre asked a question they resort to evasiveness and equivocation on four groundsAnd what are the four grounds on which they relyIts when some ascetic or brahmin doesnt truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillfulThey thinkI dont truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillfulIf I were to declare that something was skillful or unskillful I might be wrongThat would be stressful for meand that stress would be an obstacleSo from fear and disgust with false speech they avoid stating whether something is skillful or unskillful Whenever theyre asked a question they resort to evasiveness and equivocationI dont say its like this I dont say its like that I dont say its otherwise I dont say its not so And I dont deny its not soThis is the first ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely when resorting to evasiveness and equivocationAnd what is the second ground on which they relyIts when some ascetic or brahmin doesnt truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillfulThey thinkI dont truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillfulIf I were to declare

equivocationAnd what is the third ground on which they relyIts when some ascetic or brahmin doesnt truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillfulThey thinkI dont truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillfulSuppose I were to declare that something was skillful or unskillfulThere are clever ascetics and brahmins who are subtle accomplished in the doctrines of others hairsplitters Youd think they live to demolish convictions with their intellectThey might pursue press and grill me about thatId be stumped by such a grillingThat would be stressful for meand that stress would be an obstacleSo from fear and disgust with examination they avoid stating whether something is skillful or unskillful Whenever theyre asked a question they resort to evasiveness and

when resorting to evasiveness and equivocationAnd what is the fourth ground on which they relyIts when some ascetic or brahmin is dull and stupidBecause of that whenever theyre asked a question they resort to evasiveness and equivocationSuppose you were to ask me whether there is another world If I believed there was I would say soBut I dont say its like this I dont say its like that I dont say its otherwise I dont say its not so And I dont deny its not soSuppose you were to ask me whether there is no other world whether there both is and is not another world whether there neither is nor is

thingsDoctrines of Origination by ChanceThere are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about chance They assert that the self and the cosmos arose by chance on two groundsAnd what are the two grounds on which they relyThere are gods named nonpercipient beingsWhen perception arises they pass away from that host of godsIts possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existenceHaving done so they go forth from the lay life to homelessnessBy dint of keen resolute committed and diligent effort and right focus they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect the arising of perception but no furtherThe self and the cosmos arose by chanceWhy is thatBecause formerly I didnt exist Now having not been Ive sprung

seven grounds on which they relyThere are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and viewThis self is physical made up of the four primary elements and produced by mother and father Since its annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up and doesnt exist after death thats how this self becomes rightly annihilatedThat is how some assert the annihilation of an existing beingBut someone else says to themThat self of which you speak does exist I dont deny itBut thats not how this self becomes rightly annihilatedThere is another self that is divine physical sensual consuming solid foodYou dont know or see thatBut I know it and see itSince this self is annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up and doesnt exist after death thats how this self becomes rightly annihilatedThat is how some assert the annihilation of an existing beingBut someone else says to themThat self of which you speak does exist I dont deny itBut thats not how this self becomes rightly annihilatedThere is another self that is divine physical mindmade complete in all its various parts not deficient in any facultyYou dont know or see thatBut I know it and see itSince this self is annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up and doesnt exist after death thats how this self becomes rightly annihilatedThat is how some assert the annihilation of an existing beingBut someone else says to themThat self of which you speak does exist I dont deny itBut thats not how this self becomes rightly annihilatedThere is another self which has gone totally beyond perceptions of form With the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite its reborn in the dimension of infinite spaceYou dont know or see thatBut I know it and see itSince this self is annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up and doesnt exist after death thats how this self becomes rightly annihilatedThat is how some assert the annihilation of an existing beingBut someone else says to themThat self of which you speak does exist I dont deny itBut thats not how this self becomes rightly annihilatedThere is another self which has gone totally

some ascetics and brahmins who speak of extinguishment in the present life They assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life on five groundsAnd what are the five grounds on which they relyThere are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and viewWhen this self amuses itself supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation thats how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present lifeThat is how some assert the extinguishment of an existing being in the present lifeBut someone else says to themThat self of which you speak does exist I dont deny itBut thats not how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present lifeWhy is thatBecause sensual pleasures are impermanent suffering and perishable Their decay and perishing give rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressQuite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities this self enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected Thats how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present lifeThat is how some assert the extinguishment of an existing being in the present lifeBut someone else says to themThat self of which you speak does exist I dont deny itBut thats not how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present lifeWhy is thatBecause the placing of the mind and the keeping it connected there are coarseBut when the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled this self enters and remains in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected Thats how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present lifeThat is how some assert the extinguishment of an existing being in the present lifeBut someone else says to themThat self of which you speak does exist I dont deny itBut thats not how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present lifeWhy is thatBecause the rapture and emotional excitement there are coarseBut with the fading away of rapture this self enters and remains in the third absorption where it meditates with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss Thats how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present lifeThat is how some assert the extinguishment of an existing being in the present lifeBut someone else says to themThat self of which you speak does exist I dont deny itBut thats not how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present lifeWhy is thatBecause the bliss and enjoyment there are coarseBut giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness this self enters and remains in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness Thats how this self attains ultimate extinguishment in the present lifeThat is how some assert the extinguishment of an existing being in the present lifeThese are the five grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present lifeAny ascetics and brahmins who assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life do so on one or other of these five grounds Outside of this there is noneAnd those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these thingsThese are the fortyfour grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the future assert various hypotheses concerning the futureAny ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the future do so on one or other of these fortyfour grounds Outside of this there is noneAnd those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these thingsThese are the sixtytwo grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past and the future assert various hypotheses concerning the past and the futureAny ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past or the future do so on one or other of these sixtytwo grounds Outside of this there is noneThe Realized One understands thisIf you hold on to and attach to these grounds for views it leads to such and such a destiny in the next lifeHe understands this and what goes beyond this Yet since he does not misapprehend that understanding he has realized extinguishment within himselfHaving truly understood the origin ending gratification drawback and escape from feelings the Realized One is freed through not graspingThese are the principlesdeep hard to see hard to understand peaceful sublime beyond the scope of logic subtle comprehensible to the astutewhich the Realized One makes known after realizing them with his own insight And those who genuinely praise the Realized One would rightly speak of these thingsThe Grounds For Assertions About the Self and the CosmosAnxiety and EvasivenessNow these things are only the feeling of those who do not know or see the agitation and evasiveness of those under the sway of craving Namely when those ascetics and brahmins assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal on four grounds partially eternal on four grounds finite or infinite on four grounds or they resort to equivocation on four grounds or they assert that the self and the cosmos arose by chance on two grounds they theorize about the past on these eighteen grounds or they assert that the self lives on after death in a percipient form on sixteen grounds or that the self lives on after death in a nonpercipient form on eight grounds or that the self lives on after death in a neither percipient nor nonpercipient form on eight grounds or they assert the annihilation of an existing being on seven grounds or they assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life on five grounds they theorize about the future on these fortyfour grounds When those ascetics and brahmins theorize about the past and the future on these sixtytwo grounds these things are only the feeling of those who do not know or see the agitation and evasiveness of those under the sway of cravingConditioned by ContactNow these things are conditioned by contact Namely when those ascetics and brahmins assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal on four grounds partially eternal on four grounds finite or infinite on four grounds or they resort to equivocation on four grounds or they assert that the self and the cosmos arose by chance on two grounds they theorize about the past on these eighteen grounds or they assert that the self lives on after death in a percipient form on sixteen grounds or that the self lives on after death in a nonpercipient form on eight grounds or that the self lives on after death in a neither percipient nor nonpercipient form on eight grounds or they assert the annihilation of an existing being on seven grounds or they assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life on five grounds they theorize about the future on these fortyfour grounds When those ascetics and brahmins theorize about the past and the future on these sixtytwo grounds that too is conditioned by contactNot PossibleNow when those ascetics and brahmins theorize about the past and the future on these sixtytwo grounds it is not possible that they should experience these things without contactDependent OriginationNow when those ascetics and brahmins theorize about the past and the future on these sixtytwo grounds all of them experience this by repeated contact through the six fields of contact Their feeling is a condition for craving Craving is a condition for grasping Grasping is a condition for continued existence Continued existence is a condition for rebirth Rebirth is a condition for old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress to come to beThe End of the RoundWhen a mendicant truly understands the six fields of contacts origin ending gratification drawback and escape they understand what lies beyond all these thingsAll of these ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past or the future are trapped in the net of these sixtytwo grounds so that wherever they emerge they are caught and trapped in this very netSuppose a deft fisherman or his apprentice were to cast a finemeshed net over a small pondTheyd thinkAny sizable creatures in this pond will be trapped in the netWherever they emerge they are caught and trapped in this very netIn the same way all of these ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past or the future are trapped in the net of these sixtytwo grounds so that wherever they emerge they are caught and trapped in this very netThe Realized Ones body remains but his attachment to rebirth has been cut offAs long as his body remains he will be seen by gods and humansBut when his body breaks up after life has ended gods and humans will see him no moreWhen the stalk of a bunch of mangoes is cut all the mangoes attached to the stalk will follow alongIn the same way the Realized Ones body remains but his attachment to rebirth has been cut offAs long as his body remains he will be seen by gods and humansBut when his body breaks up after life has ended gods and humans will see him no moreWhen he had spoken Venerable nanda said to the BuddhaIts incredible sir its amazing What is the name of this exposition of the teachingWell then nanda you may remember this exposition of the teaching as The Net of Meaning or else The Net of the Teaching or else The Prime Net or else The Net of Views or else The Supreme Victory in BattleThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidAnd while this discourse was being spoken the galaxy shookLong DiscoursesThe Great Discourse on the Buddhas ExtinguishmentSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on the Vultures Peak MountainNow at that time King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Māgadha wanted to invade the VajjisHe declaredI shall wipe out these Vajjis so mighty and powerful I shall destroy them and lay ruin and devastation upon themAnd then King Ajātasattu addressed Vassakāra the brahmin minister of MāgadhaPlease brahmin go to the Buddha and in my name bow with your head to his feet Ask him if he is healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortablyAnd then saySir King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Māgadha wants to invade the VajjisI shall wipe out these Vajjis so mighty and powerful I shall destroy them and lay ruin and devastation upon themRemember well how the Buddha answers and tell it to meFor Realized Ones say nothing that is not soThe Brahmin VassakāraYes sir Vassakāra replied He had the finest carriages harnessed Then he mounted a fine carriage and along with other fine carriages set out from Rājagaha for the Vultures Peak MountainHe went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed then descended and approached the Buddha on foot and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Māgadha bows with his head to your feet He asks if you are healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortablyMaster Gotama King Ajātasattu wants to invade the VajjisHe has declaredI shall wipe out these Vajjis so mighty and powerful I shall destroy them and lay ruin and devastation upon themPrinciples That Prevent DeclineNow at that time Venerable nanda was standing behind the Buddha fanning himThen the Buddha said to himnanda have you heard that the Vajjis meet frequently and have

heard that the Vajjis organize proper protection shelter and security for perfected ones so that more perfected ones might come to the realm and those already here may live in comfortI have heard that sirAs long as the Vajjis organize proper protection shelter and security for perfected ones so that more perfected ones might come to the realm and those already here may live in comfort they can expect growth not declineThen the Buddha said to VassakāraBrahmin this one time I was staying near Vesālī at the Sārandada woodland shrineThere I taught the Vajjis these seven principles that prevent declineAs long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the Vajjis and as long as the Vajjis are seen following them they can expect growth not declineWhen the Buddha had spoken Vassakāra said to himMaster Gotama if the Vajjis follow even a single one of these principles they can expect growth not declineHow much more so all sevenKing Ajātasattu cannot defeat the Vajjis in war unless by diplomacy or by sowing dissensionWell now Master Gotama I must go I have many duties and much to doPlease brahmin go at your convenienceThen Vassakāra the brahmin having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said got up from his seat and leftPrinciples That Prevent Decline Among the MendicantsSoon after he had left the Buddha said to nandaGo nanda gather all the mendicants

this Dhamma talk to the mendicantsSuch is ethics such is immersion such is wisdomWhen immersion is imbued with ethics its very fruitful and beneficialWhen wisdom is imbued with immersion its very fruitful and beneficialWhen the mind is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements namelythe defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceWhen the Buddha had stayed in Rājagaha as long as he wished he addressed Venerable nandaCome nanda lets go to AmbalaṭṭhikāYes sir nanda repliedThen the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Ambalaṭṭhikāwhere he stayed in the royal resthouseAnd while staying there too he often gave this Dhamma talk to the mendicantsSuch is ethics such is immersion such is wisdomWhen immersion is imbued with ethics its very fruitful and beneficialWhen wisdom is imbued with immersion its very fruitful and beneficialWhen the mind is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements namelythe defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceWhen the Buddha had stayed in Ambalaṭṭhikā as long as he wished he addressed Venerable nandaCome nanda lets go to NāḷandāYes sir nanda repliedThen the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Nāḷandāwhere he stayed in Pāvārikas mango groveSāriputtas Lions RoarThen Sāriputta went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir I have such confidence in the Buddha thatI believe theres no other ascetic or brahminwhether past future or presentwhose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakeningThats a grand and dramatic statement Sāriputta Youve roared a definitive categorical lions roar sayingI have such confidence in the Buddha thatI believe theres no other ascetic or brahminwhether past future or presentwhose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakeningWhat about all the perfected ones the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past Have you comprehended their minds to know thatthose Buddhas had such ethics or such qualities or such wisdom or such meditation or such freedomNo sirAnd what about all the perfected ones the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future Have you comprehended their minds to know thatthose Buddhas will have such ethics or such qualities or such wisdom or such meditation or such freedomNo sirAnd what about me the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha at present Have you comprehended my mind to know thatI have such ethics or such teachings or such wisdom or such meditation or such freedomNo sirWell then Sāriputta given that you dont comprehend the minds of Buddhas past future or presentwhat exactly are you doing making such a grand and dramatic statement roaring such a definitive categorical lions roarSir though I dont comprehend the minds of Buddhas past future and presentstill I understand this by inference from the teachingSuppose there was a kings frontier citadel with fortified embankments ramparts and arches and a single gateAnd it has a gatekeeper who is astute competent and intelligent He keeps strangers out and lets known people inAs he walks around the patrol path he doesnt see a hole or cleft in the wall not even one big enough for a cat to slip outHe thinksWhatever sizable creatures enter or leave the citadel all of them do so via this gateIn the same way I understand this by inference from the teachingAll the perfected ones fully awakened Buddhaswhether past future or presentgive up the five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom Their mind is firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation They correctly develop the seven awakening factors And they wake up to the supreme perfect awakeningAnd while staying at Nāḷandā too the Buddha often gave this Dhamma talk to the mendicantsSuch is ethics such is immersion such is wisdomWhen immersion is imbued with ethics its very fruitful and beneficialWhen wisdom is imbued with immersion its very fruitful and beneficialWhen the mind is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements namelythe defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceThe Drawbacks of Unethical ConductWhen the Buddha had stayed in Nāḷandā as long as he wished he addressed Venerable nandaCome nanda lets go to Pāṭali VillageYes sir nanda repliedThen the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Pāṭali VillageThe lay followers of Pāṭali Village heard that he had arrivedSo they went to see him bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir please consent to come to our guest houseThe Buddha consented in silenceThen knowing that the Buddha had consented the lay followers of Pāṭali Village got up from their seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on their rightThen they went to the guest house where they spread carpets all over prepared seats set up a water jar and placed a lamp Then they went back to the Buddha bowed stood to one side and told him of their preparations sayingPlease sir come at your convenienceIn the morning the Buddha robed up and taking his bowl and robe went to the guest house together with the Saṅgha of mendicants Having washed his feet he entered the guest house and sat against the central column facing eastThe Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet entered the guest house and sat against the west wall facing east with the Buddha right in front of themThe lay followers of Pāṭali Village also washed their feet entered the guest house and sat against the east wall facing west with the Buddha right in front of themThen the Buddha addressed themHouseholders there are these five drawbacks for an unethical person because of their failure in ethicsWhat fiveFirstly an unethical person loses substantial wealth on account of negligenceThis is the first drawback for an unethical person because of their failure in ethicsFurthermore an unethical person gets a bad reputationThis is the second drawbackFurthermore an unethical person enters any kind of assembly timid and embarrassed whether its an assembly of aristocrats brahmins householders or

the night educating encouraging firing up and inspiring the lay followers of Pāṭali Village with a Dhamma talk Then he dismissed themThe night is getting late householders Please go at your convenienceYes sir replied the lay followers of Pāṭali Village They got up from their seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on their right before leavingSoon after they left the Buddha entered a private cubicleBuilding a CitadelNow at that time the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra were building a citadel at Pāṭali Village to keep the Vajjis outAt that time thousands of deities were taking possession of building sites in Pāṭali VillageIllustrious rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by illustrious deitiesMiddling rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by middling deitiesLesser rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by lesser deitiesWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman the Buddha saw those deities taking possession of building sites in Pāṭali VillageThe Buddha rose at the crack of dawn and addressed nandananda who is building a citadel at Pāṭali VillageSir the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra are building a citadel to keep the Vajjis outIts as if they were building the citadel in consultation with the gods of the ThirtyThreeWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw those deities taking possession of building sitesIllustrious rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by illustrious deitiesMiddling rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by middling deitiesLesser rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by lesser deitiesAs far as the civilized region extends as far as the trading zone extends this will be the chief city the Pāṭaliputta trade centerBut Pāṭaliputta will face three threatsfrom fire flood and dissensionThen the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over they stood to one side and saidWould Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept todays meal from meThe Buddha consented in silenceThen knowing that the Buddha had consented they went to their own guest house where they had a variety of delicious foods prepared Then they had the Buddha informed of the time sayingIts time Master Gotama the meal is readyThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to their guest house together with the mendicant Saṅgha where he sat on the seat spread outThen Sunidha and Vassakāra served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with their own hands with a variety of delicious foodsWhen the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl Sunidha and Vassakāra took a low seat and sat to one sideThe Buddha expressed his appreciation with these versesIn the place he makes his dwellinghaving fed the astuteand the virtuous herethe restrained spiritual practitionershe should dedicate an offeringto the deities thereVenerated they venerate himhonored they honor himAfter that they have compassion for himlike a mother for the child at her breastA man beloved of the deitiesalways sees nice thingsWhen the Buddha had expressed his appreciation to Sunidha and Vassakāra with these verses he got up from his seat and leftSunidha and Vassakāra followed behind the Buddha thinkingThe gate through which the ascetic Gotama departs today shall be named the Gotama GateThe ford at which he crosses the Ganges River shall be named the Gotama FordThen the gate through which the Buddha departed was named the Gotama GateThen the Buddha came to the Ganges RiverNow at that time the Ganges was full to the brim so a crow could drink from itWanting to cross from the near to the far shore some people were seeking a boat some a dinghy while some were tying up a raftBut as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha vanished from the near shore and landed on the far shoreHe saw all those people wanting to cross overKnowing the meaning of this on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentimentThose who cross a deluge or streamhave built a bridge and left the marshes behindWhile some people are still tying a raftintelligent people have crossed overTalk on the Noble TruthsThen the Buddha said to Venerable nandaCome nanda lets go to KoṭigāmaYes sir nanda repliedThen the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Koṭigāmaand stayed thereThere he addressed the mendicantsMendicants not understanding and not penetrating four noble truths both you and I have wandered and transmigrated for such a very long timeWhat fourThe noble truths of sufferingthe origin of sufferingthe cessation of sufferingand the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingThese noble truths of suffering origin cessation and the path have been understood and comprehended Craving for continued existence has been cut off the attachment to continued existence is ended now there are no more future livesThat is what the Buddha saidThen the Holy One the Teacher went on to sayBecause of not truly seeingthe four noble truthswe have transmigrated for a long timefrom one rebirth to the nextBut now that these truths have been seenthe attachment to rebirth is eradicatedThe root of suffering is cut offnow there are no more future livesAnd while staying at Koṭigāma too the Buddha often gave this Dhamma talk to the mendicantsSuch is ethics such is immersion such is wisdomWhen immersion is imbued with ethics its very fruitful and beneficialWhen wisdom is imbued with immersion its very fruitful and beneficialWhen the mind is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements namelythe defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceThe Deaths in NādikaWhen the Buddha had stayed in Koṭigāma as long as he wished he said to nandaCome nanda lets go to NādikaYes sir nanda repliedThen the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Nādikawhere he stayed in the brick houseThen Venerable nanda went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir the monk named Sāḷha has passed away in Nādika Where has he been reborn in his next lifeThe nun named Nandāthe layman named Sudattaand the laywoman named Sujātā have passed away in Nādika Where have they been reborn in the next lifeThe laymen named KakkaṭaKaṭissahaSantuṭṭhaBhadda andSubhadda have passed away in Nādika Where have they been reborn in the next lifenanda the monk Sāḷha had realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilementsThe nun Nandā had ended the five lower fetters Shes been reborn spontaneously and will be extinguished there not liable to return from that worldThe layman Sudatta had ended three fetters and weakened greed hate and delusion Hes a oncereturner he will come back to this world once only then make an end of sufferingThe laywoman Sujātā had ended three fetters Shes a streamenterer not liable to be reborn in the underworld bound for awakeningThe laymen KakkaṭaKaṭissahaSantuṭṭhaBhadda andand Subhadda had ended the five lower fetters Theyve been reborn spontaneously and will be extinguished there not liable to return from that worldOver fifty laymen in Nādika have passed away having ended the five lower fetters Theyve been reborn spontaneously and will be extinguished there not liable to return from that worldMore than ninety laymen in Nādika have passed away having ended three fetters and weakened greed hate and delusion Theyre oncereturners who will come back to this world once only then make an end of sufferingIn excess of five hundred laymen in Nādika have passed away having ended three fetters Theyre streamenterers not liable to be reborn in the underworld bound for awakeningThe Mirror of the TeachingIts hardly surprising that a human being should pass awayBut if you should come and ask me about it each and every time someone passes away that would be a bother for meSo nanda I will teach you the explanation of the Dhamma called the mirror of the teaching A noble disciple who has this may declare of themselvesIve finished with rebirth in hell the animal realm and the ghost realm Ive finished with all places of loss bad places the underworld I am a streamenterer Im not liable to be reborn in the underworld and am bound for awakeningAnd what is that mirror of the teachingIts when a noble disciple has experiential

consists of the four pairs the eight individuals This is the Saṅgha of the Buddhas disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods worthy of hospitality worthy of a religious donation worthy of greeting with joined palms and is the supreme field of merit for the worldAnd a noble disciples ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones unbroken impeccable spotless and unmarred liberating praised by sensible people not mistaken and leading to immersionThis is that mirror of the teachingAnd while staying there in Nādika the Buddha often gave this Dhamma talk to the mendicantsSuch is ethics such is immersion such is wisdomWhen immersion is imbued with ethics its very fruitful and beneficialWhen wisdom is imbued with immersion its very fruitful and beneficialWhen the mind is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements namelythe defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceWhen the Buddha had stayed in Nādika as long as he wished he addressed Venerable nandaCome nanda lets go to VesālīYes sir nanda repliedThen the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Vesālīwhere he stayed in Ambapālīs mango groveThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicants a mendicant should live mindful and awareThis is my instruction to youAnd how is a mendicant mindfulIts when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect

carriages harnessed Then they mounted a fine carriage and along with other fine carriages set out from VesālīSome of the Licchavis were in blue of blue color clad in blue adorned with blue And some were similarly colored in yellow red or whiteThen Ambapālī the courtesan collided with those Licchavi youths axle to axle wheel to wheel yoke to yokeThe Licchavis said to herWhat the hell Ambapālī are

hundred thousandMasters even if you were to give me Vesālī with her fiefdoms I still wouldnt give that meal to youThen the Licchavis snapped their fingers sayingWeve been beaten by the mangomatron Weve been beaten by the mangomatronThen they continued on to Ambapālīs groveThe Buddha saw them coming off in the distanceand addressed the mendicantsAny of the mendicants whove never seen the gods of

BuddhaSir may the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrows meal from usThen the Buddha said to the LicchavisI have already accepted tomorrows meal from Ambapālī the courtesanThen the Licchavis snapped their fingers sayingWeve been beaten by the mangomatron Weve been beaten by the mangomatronAnd then those Licchavis approved and agreed with what the Buddha said They got up from their seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on their right before leavingAnd when the night had passed Ambapālī had a variety of delicious foods prepared in her own park Then she had the Buddha informed of the time sayingSir its time The meal is readyThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to the home of Ambapālī together with the mendicant Saṅgha where he sat on the seat spread outThen Ambapālī served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with her own hands with a variety of delicious foodsWhen the Buddha had eaten and washed his hands and bowl Ambapālī took a low seat sat to one sideand said to the BuddhaSir I present this park to the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the BuddhaThe Buddha accepted the parkThen the Buddha educated encouraged fired up and inspired her with a Dhamma talk after which he got up from his seat and leftAnd while staying at Vesālī too the Buddha often gave this Dhamma talk to the mendicantsSuch is ethics such is immersion such is wisdomWhen immersion is imbued with ethics its very fruitful and beneficialWhen wisdom is imbued with immersion its very fruitful and beneficialWhen the mind is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements namelythe defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceCommencing the Rains at BeluvaWhen the Buddha had stayed in Ambapālīs grove as long as he wished he addressed Venerable nandaCome nanda lets go to the little village of BeluvaYes sir nanda repliedThen the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at the little village of Beluvaand stayed thereThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicants please enter the rainy season residence with whatever friends or acquaintances you have around VesālīIll commence the rainy season residence right here in the little village of BeluvaYes sir those mendicants replied They did as the Buddha saidwhile the Buddha commenced the rainy season residence right there in the little village of BeluvaAfter the Buddha had commenced the rainy season residence he fell severely ill struck by dreadful pains close to deathBut he endured unperturbed with mindfulness and situational awarenessThen it occurred to the BuddhaIt would not be appropriate for me to become fully extinguished before informing my attendants and taking leave of the mendicant SaṅghaWhy dont I forcefully suppress this illness stabilize the life force and live onSo that is what he didThen the Buddhas illness died downSoon after the Buddha had recovered from that sickness he came out from his dwelling and sat in the shade of the porch on the seat spread outThen Venerable nanda went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir its fantastic that the Buddha is comfortable and wellBecause when the Buddha was sick my body felt like it was drugged I was disorientated and the teachings werent clear to meStill at least I was consoled by the thought thatthe Buddha wont become fully extinguished without making some statement regarding the Saṅgha of mendicantsBut what could the mendicant Saṅgha expect from me nandaIve taught the Dhamma without making any distinction between secret and public teachingsThe Realized One doesnt have the closed fist of a teacher when it comes to the teachingsIf theres anyone who thinksIll take charge of the Saṅgha of mendicants or the Saṅgha of mendicants is meant for me let them make a statement regarding the SaṅghaBut the Realized One doesnt think like thisso why should he make some statement regarding the SaṅghaIm now old elderly and senior Im advanced in years and have reached the final stage of lifeIm currently eighty years oldJust as a decrepit cart keeps going by relying on strapsin the same way the Realized Ones body keeps going by relying on straps or so youd thinkSometimes the Realized One not focusing on any signs and with the cessation of certain feelings enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart Only then does the Realized Ones body become more comfortableSo nanda be your own island your own refuge with no other refuge Let the teaching be your island and your refuge with no other refugeAnd how does a mendicant do thisIts when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the bodykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the worldThey meditate observing an aspect of feelings principleskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the worldThats how a mendicant is their own island their own refuge with no other refuge Thats how the teaching is their island and their refuge with no other refugeWhether now or after I have passed any who shall live as their own island their own refuge with no other refuge with the teaching as their island and their refuge with no other refugethose mendicants of mine who want to train shall be among the best of the bestAn Obvious HintThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Vesālī for almsThen after the meal on his return from almsround he addressed Venerable nandananda get your sitting clothLets go to the Cāpāla shrine for

the host of Joyful Gods hes conceived in his mothers belly mindful and aware Then the earth shakes and rocks and tremblesThis is the third cause and reason for a great earthquakeFurthermore when the being intent on awakening comes out of his mothers belly mindful and aware the earth shakes and rocks and tremblesThis is the fourth cause and reason for a great earthquakeFurthermore when the Realized One realizes the supreme perfect awakening the earth shakes and rocks and tremblesThis is the fifth cause and reason for a great earthquakeFurthermore when the Realized One rolls forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma the earth shakes and rocks and tremblesThis is the sixth cause and reason for a great earthquakeFurthermore when the Realized One mindful and aware surrenders the life force the earth shakes and rocks and tremblesThis is the seventh cause and reason for a great earthquakeFurthermore when the Realized One becomes fully extinguished through the natural principle of extinguishment without anything left over the earth shakes and rocks and tremblesThis is the eighth cause and reason for a great earthquakeThese are the eight causes and reasons for a great earthquakeEight AssembliesThere are nanda these eight assembliesWhat eightThe assemblies of aristocrats brahmins householders and ascetics An assembly of the gods of the Four Great Kings An assembly

carts pass byNo friend I didnt see themBut sir didnt you hear a soundNo friend I didnt hear a soundBut sir were you asleepNo friend I wasnt asleepBut sir were you consciousYes friendSo sir while conscious and awake you neither saw nor heard a sound as five hundred carts passed by right next to youWhy sir even your outer robe is covered with dustYes friendThen that person thoughtIts incredible its amazing Those who have gone forth remain in such peaceful meditationsin that while conscious and awake he neither saw nor heard a sound as five hundred carts passed by right next to himAnd after declaring his lofty confidence in ḷāra Kālāma he leftWhat do you think PukkusaWhich is harder and more challenging to do while conscious and awaketo neither see nor hear a sound as five hundred carts pass by right next to youOr to neither see nor hear a sound as its raining and pouring lightnings flashing and thunders crackingWhat do five hundred carts matter or six hundred or seven hundred or eight hundred or nine hundred or a thousand or even a hundred thousand cartsIts far harder and more challenging to neither see nor hear a sound as its raining and pouring lightnings flashing and thunders crackingThis one time Pukkusa I was staying near tumā in a threshinghutAt that time it was raining and pouring lightning was flashing and thunder was cracking And not far from the threshinghut two farmers who were brothers were killed as well as four oxenThen a large crowd came from tumā to the place where that happenedNow at that time I came out of the threshinghut and was walking mindfully in the open near the door of the hutThen having left that crowd a certain person approached me bowed and stood to one sideI said to themWhy friend has this crowd gatheredJust now sir it was raining and pouring lightning was flashing and thunder was cracking And two farmers who were brothers were killed as well as four oxenThen this crowd gathered hereBut sir where were youI was right here friendBut sir did you seeNo friend I didnt see anythingBut sir didnt you hear a soundNo friend I didnt hear a soundBut sir were you asleepNo friend I wasnt asleepBut sir were you consciousYes friendSo sir while conscious and awake you neither saw nor heard a sound as it was raining and pouring lightning was flashing and thunder was crackingYes friendThen that person thoughtIts incredible its amazing Those who have gone forth remain in such peaceful meditationsin that while conscious and awake he neither saw nor heard a sound as it was raining and pouring lightning was flashing and thunder was crackingAnd after declaring their lofty confidence in me they bowed and respectfully circled me keeping me on their right before leavingWhen he said this Pukkusa said to himAny confidence I had in ḷāra Kālāma I sweep away as in a strong wind or float away as down a swift streamExcellent sir ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeThen Pukkusa addressed a certain manPlease my man fetch a pair of ready to wear polished golden garmentsYes sir replied that man and did as he was askedThen Pukkusa brought the garments to the BuddhaSir please accept this pair of ready to wear polished golden garments from me out of compassionWell then Pukkusa clothe me in one and nanda in the otherYes sir replied Pukkusa and did soThen the Buddha educated encouraged fired up and inspired Pukkusa the Malla with a Dhamma talkafter which he got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha before leavingThen not long after Pukkusa had left nanda placed the pair of golden garments on the Buddhas bodyBut when placed on the Buddhas body they seemed to lose their shineThen nanda said to the BuddhaIts incredible sir its amazing how pure and bright is the color of the Realized Ones skinWhen this pair of ready to wear polished golden garments is placed on the Buddhas body they seem to lose their shineThats so true nanda thats so true There are two times when the color of the Realized Ones skin becomes extra pure and brightThe night when a Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening and the night he becomes fully extinguished through the natural principle of extinguishment without anything left overThese are the are two times when the color of the Realized Ones skin becomes extra pure and brightToday nanda in the last watch of the night between a pair of sal trees in the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā shall be the Realized Ones full extinguishmentCome nanda lets go to the Kakutthā RiverYes sir nanda repliedA pair of golden polished garmentswas presented by Pukkusawhen the teacher was clothed with themhis golden skin glowed brightThen the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants went to the Kakutthā River He plunged into the river and bathed and drank And when he had emerged he went to the mango grovewhere he addressed Venerable CundakaPlease Cundaka fold my outer robe in four and spread it out for me I am tired and will lie downYes sir replied Cundaka and did as he was askedAnd then the Buddha laid down in the lions postureon the right side placing one foot on top of the othermindful and aware and focused on the time of getting upBut Cundaka sat down right there in front of the BuddhaHaving gone to Kakutthā Creekwhose water was transparent sweet and clearthe Teacher being tired plunged inthe Realized One without compare in the worldAnd after bathing and drinking the Teacher emergedBefore the group of mendicants in the middle the Buddhathe Teacher who rolled forth the present dispensationthe great hermit went to the mango groveHe addressed the mendicant named CundakaSpread out my folded robe so I can lie downThe selfdeveloped one urged Cundawho quickly spread the folded robeThe Teacher lay down so tiredwhile Cunda sat there before himThen the Buddha said to Venerable nandaNow it may happen nanda that others may give rise to some regret for Cunda the smithIts your loss friend Cunda its your misfortune in that the Realized One became fully extinguished after eating his last meal from youYou should dispel remorse in Cunda the smith like thisYoure fortunate friend Cunda youre so very fortunatein that the Realized One became fully extinguished after eating his last meal from youI have heard and learned this in the presence of the BuddhaThere are two meal offerings that have identical fruit and result and are more fruitful and beneficial than other meal offeringsThe meal after eating which a Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening and the meal after eating which he becomes fully extinguished through the natural principle of extinguishment without anything left overThese two meal offerings have identical fruit and result and are more fruitful and beneficial than other meal offeringsYouve accumulated a deed that leads to long life beauty happiness fame heaven and sovereigntyThats how you should dispel remorse in Cunda the smithThen knowing the meaning of this on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentimentA givers merit growsenmity doesnt build up when you have selfcontrolA skillful person gives up bad thingswith the end of greed hate and delusion theyre extinguishedThe Pair of Sal TreesThen the Buddha said to nandaCome nanda lets go to the far shore of the Golden River and on to the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near KusinārāYes sir nanda repliedAnd thats where they wentThen the Buddha addressed nandaPlease nanda set up a cot for me between the twin sal trees with my head to the north I am tired and will lie downYes sir replied nanda and did as he was askedAnd then the Buddha laid down in the lions postureon the right side placing one foot on top of the othermindful and awareNow at that time the twin sal trees were in full blossom with flowers out of seasonThey sprinkled and bestrewed the Realized Ones body in honor of the Realized OneAnd the flowers of the heavenly Flame Tree fell from the sky and they too sprinkled and bestrewed the Realized Ones body in honor of the Realized OneAnd heavenly sandalwood powder fell from the sky and it too sprinkled and bestrewed the Realized Ones body in honor of the Realized OneAnd heavenly music played in the sky in honor of the Realized OneAnd heavenly choirs sang in the sky in honor of the Realized OneThen the Buddha pointed out to nanda what was happening addingThats not how the Realized One is honored respected revered venerated and esteemedAny monk or nun or male or female lay follower who practices in line with the teachings practicing properly living in line with the teachingsthey honor respect revere venerate and esteem the Realized One with the highest honorSo nanda you should train like this We shall practice in line with the teachings practicing properly living in line with the teachingThe Monk UpavāṇaNow at that time Venerable Upavāṇa was standing in front of the Buddha fanning himThen the Buddha made him moveMove over mendicant dont stand in front of menanda thoughtThis Venerable Upavāṇa has been the Buddhas attendant for a long time close to him living in his presenceYet in his final hour the Buddha makes him move sayingMove over mendicant dont stand in front of meWhat is the cause what is the reason for thisThen nanda said to the BuddhaThis Venerable Upavāṇa has been the Buddhas attendant for a long time close to him living in his presenceYet in his final hour the Buddha makes him move sayingMove over mendicant dont stand in front of meWhat is the cause sir what is the reason for thisMost of the deities from ten solar systems have gathered to see the Realized OneFor twelve leagues all around this sal grove theres no spot not even a fraction of a hairs tip thats not crowded full of illustrious deitiesThe deities are complainingWeve come such a long way to see the Realized OneOnly rarely do Realized Ones arise in the world perfected ones fully awakened BuddhasThis very day in the last watch of the night the Realized One will become fully extinguishedAnd this illustrious mendicant is standing in front of the Buddha blocking the view We wont get to see the Realized One in his final hourBut sir what kind of deities are you thinking ofThere are nanda deitiesboth in the sky and on the earthwho are percipient of the earth With hair disheveled and arms raised they fall down like their feet were chopped off rolling back and forth lamentingToo soon the Blessed One will become fully extinguished Too soon the Holy One will become fully extinguished Too soon the seer will vanish from the worldBut the deities who are free of desire endure mindful and aware thinkingConditions are impermanent How could it possibly be otherwiseThe Four Inspiring PlacesPreviously sir when mendicants had completed the rainy season residence in various districts they came to see the Realized OneWe got to see the esteemed mendicants and to pay homage to themBut when the Buddha

doublelayers Then they place it in an iron case filled with oil and close it up with another case Then having built a funeral pyre out of all kinds of fragrant substances they cremate the corpseThey build a monument for the wheelturning monarch at the crossroadsThats how they proceed with a wheelturning monarchs corpseProceed in the same way with the Realized Ones corpseA monument for the

said to himEnough nanda Do not grieve do not lament Did I not prepare for this when I explained thatwe must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and belovedHow could it possibly be so that what is born created conditioned and liable to fall apart should not fall apart even the Realized Ones bodyFor a long time nanda youve treated the Realized One with deeds of body speech and mind that are loving beneficial pleasant wholehearted and limitlessYou have done good deeds nanda Devote yourself to meditation and you will soon be free of defilementsThen the Buddha said to the mendicantsThe

same way there are those four incredible and amazing things about nandaTeaching the Discourse on MahāsudassanaWhen he said this Venerable nanda said to the BuddhaSir please dont become fully extinguished in this little hamlet this jungle hamlet this branch hamletThere are other great cities such asCampā Rājagaha Sāvatthī Sāketa Kosambī and BenaresLet the Buddha become fully extinguished thereThere are many welltodo aristocrats brahmins and householders there who are devoted to the BuddhaThey will perform the rites of venerating the Realized Ones corpseDont say that nanda Dont say thatthis is a little hamlet a jungle hamlet a branch hamletOnce upon a time there was a king named Mahāsudassana who was a wheelturning monarch a just and principled king His dominion extended to all four sides he achieved stability in the country and he possessed the seven treasuresHis capital was this Kusinārā which at the time was named KusāvatīIt stretched for twelve leagues from east to west and seven leagues from north to southThe royal capital of Kusāvatī was successful prosperous populous full of people with plenty of foodIt was just like ḷakamandā the royal capital of the gods which is successful prosperous populous full of spirits with plenty of foodKusāvatī was never free of ten sounds by day or night namelythe sound of elephants horses chariots drums clay drums arched harps singing horns gongs and handbells and the cry Eat drink be merry as the tenthGo nanda into Kusinārā and inform the MallasThis very day Vāseṭṭhas in the last watch of the night the Realized One will become fully extinguishedCome forth Vāseṭṭhas Come forth VāseṭṭhasDont regret it later thinkingThe Realized One became fully extinguished in our own village district but we didnt get a chance to see him in his final hourYes sir replied nanda Then he robed up and taking his bowl and robe entered Kusinārā with a companionThe Mallas Pay HomageNow at that time the Mallas of Kusinārā were sitting together at the meeting hall on some businessnanda went up to them and announcedThis very day Vāseṭṭhas in the last watch of the night the Realized One will become fully extinguishedCome forth Vāseṭṭhas Come forth VāseṭṭhasDont regret it later thinkingThe Realized One became fully extinguished in our own village district but we didnt get a chance to see him in his final hourWhen they heard what nanda had to say the Mallas their sons daughtersinlaw and wives became distraught saddened and griefstricken And some with hair disheveled and arms raised falling down like their feet were chopped off rolling back and forth lamentedToo soon the Blessed One will become fully extinguished Too soon the Holy One will become fully extinguished Too soon the seer will vanish from the worldThen the Mallas their sons daughtersinlaw and wives distraught saddened and griefstricken went to the Mallian sal grove at Upavattana and approached nandaThen nanda thoughtIf I have the Mallas pay homage to the Buddha one by one they wont be finished before first lightId better separate them family by family and then have them pay homage sayingSir the Malla named soandso with children wives retinue and ministers bows with his head at your feetAnd so thats what he didSo by this means nanda got the Mallas to finish paying homage to the Buddha in the first watch of the nightOn Subhadda the WandererNow at that time a wanderer named Subhadda was residing near KusinārāHe heard thaton that very day in the last watch of the night the ascetic Gotama would become fully extinguishedHe thoughtI have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior the teachers of teachers saidOnly rarely do Realized Ones arise in the world perfected ones fully awakened BuddhasAnd this very day in the last watch of the night the ascetic Gotama will become fully extinguishedThis state of uncertainty has come up in meI am quite confident that the Buddha is capable of teaching me so that I can give up this state of uncertaintyThen Subhadda went to the Mallian sal grove at Upavattana approached nanda and said to himMaster nanda I have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior the teachers of teachers saidOnly rarely do Realized Ones arise in the world perfected ones fully awakened BuddhasAnd this very day in the last watch of the night the ascetic Gotama will become fully extinguishedThis state of uncertainty has come up in meI am quite confident that the Buddha is capable of teaching me so that I can give up this state of uncertaintyMaster nanda please let me see the ascetic GotamaWhen he had spoken nanda saidEnough Reverend Subhadda do not trouble the Realized One He is tiredFor a second timeand a third time Subhadda asked nanda and a third time nanda refusedThe Buddha heard that discussion between nanda and SubhaddaHe said to nandaEnough nanda dont obstruct Subhadda let him see the Realized OneFor whatever he asks me he will only be looking for understanding not troubleAnd he will quickly understand any answer I give to his questionSo nanda said to the wanderer SubhaddaGo Reverend Subhadda the Buddha is taking the time for youThen the wanderer Subhadda went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama there are those ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a community and teach a community Theyre wellknown and famous religious founders regarded as holy by many peopleNamely Pūraṇa Kassapa Makkhali Gosāla Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta Pakudha Kaccāyana and Ajita KesakambalaAccording to their own claims did all of them have direct knowledge or none of them or only someEnough Subhadda let that beI shall teach you the DhammaListen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir Subhadda repliedThe Buddha said thisSubhadda in whatever teaching and training the noble eightfold path is not found there is no true ascetic found no second ascetic no third ascetic and no fourth asceticIn whatever teaching and training the noble eightfold path is found there is a true ascetic found a second ascetic a third ascetic and a fourth asceticIn this teaching and training the noble eightfold path is found Only here is there a true ascetic here a second ascetic here a third ascetic and here a fourth ascetic Other sects are empty of asceticsWere these mendicants to practice well the world would not be empty of perfected onesI was twentynine years of age Subaddhawhen I went forth to discover what is skillfulIts been over fifty yearssince I went forthI am the one who points out the proper teachingOutside of here there is no true asceticWere these mendicants to practice well the world would not be empty of perfected onesWhen he had spoken Subhadda said to the BuddhaExcellent sir ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaSir may I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presenceSubhadda if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth the ordination in this teaching and training they must spend four months on probationWhen four months have passed if the mendicants are satisfied theyll give the going forth the ordination into monkhoodHowever I have recognized individual differences in this matterSir if four months probation are required in such a case Ill spend four years on probationWhen four years have passed if the mendicants are satisfied let them give me the going forth the ordination into monkhoodThen the Buddha said to nandaWell then nanda give Subhadda the going forthYes sir nanda repliedThen Subhadda said to nandaYoure so fortunate Reverand nanda so very fortunateto be anointed here in the Teachers presence as his pupilAnd the wanderer Subhadda received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presenceNot long after his ordination Venerable Subhadda living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessnessHe understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceAnd Venerable Subhadda became one of the perfectedHe was the last personal disciple of the BuddhaThe Buddhas Last WordsThen the Buddha addressed Venerable nandaNow nanda some of you might thinkThe teachers dispensation has passed Now we have no TeacherBut you should not see it like thisThe teaching and training that I have taught and pointed out for you shall be your Teacher after my passingAfter my passing mendicants ought not address each other as reverend as they do todayA more senior mendicant ought to address a more junior mendicant by name or clan or by saying reverendA more junior mendicant ought to address a more senior mendicant using sir or venerableIf it wishes after my passing the Saṅgha may abolish the lesser and minor training rulesAfter my passing give the prime punishment to the mendicant ChannaBut sir what is the prime punishmentChanna may say what he likesbut the mendicants should not advise or instruct himThen the Buddha said to the mendicantsPerhaps even a single mendicant has doubt or uncertainty regarding the Buddha the teaching the Saṅgha the path or the practice So ask mendicants Dont regret it later thinkingWe were in the Teachers presence and we werent able to ask the Buddha a questionWhen this was said the mendicants kept silentFor a second timeand a third time the Buddha addressed the mendicantsPerhaps even a single mendicant has doubt or uncertainty regarding the Buddha the teaching the Saṅgha the path or the practice So ask mendicants Dont regret it later thinkingWe were in the Teachers presence and we werent able to ask the Buddha a questionFor a third time the mendicants kept silentThen the Buddha said to the mendicantsMendicants perhaps you dont ask out of respect for the TeacherSo let a friend tell a friendWhen this was said the mendicants kept silentThen Venerable nanda said to the BuddhaIts incredible sir its amazing I am quite confident that theres not even a single mendicant in this Saṅgha who has doubt or uncertainty regarding the Buddha the teaching the Saṅgha the path or the practicenanda you speak from faithBut the Realized One knows that theres not even a single mendicant in this Saṅgha who has doubt or uncertainty regarding the Buddha the teaching the Saṅgha the path or the practiceEven the last of these five hundred mendicants is a streamenterer not liable to be reborn in the underworld bound for awakeningThen the Buddha said to the mendicantsCome now mendicants I say to you allConditions fall apart Persist with diligenceThese were the Realized Ones last wordsThe Full ExtinguishmentThen the Buddha entered the first absorption Emerging from that he entered the second absorption Emerging from that he successively entered into and emerged from the third absorption the fourth absorption the dimension of infinite space the dimension of infinite consciousness the dimension of nothingness and the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception Then he entered the cessation of perception and feelingThen Venerable nanda said to Venerable AnuruddhaVenerable Anuruddha has the Buddha become fully extinguishedNo Reverend nanda He has entered the cessation of perception and feelingThen the Buddha emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling and entered the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception Emerging from that he successively entered into and emerged from the dimension of nothingness the dimension of infinite consciousness the dimension of infinite space the fourth absorption the third absorption the second absorption and the first absorption Emerging from that he successively entered into and emerged from the second absorption and the third absorption Then he entered the fourth absorption Emerging from that the Buddha immediately became fully extinguishedWhen the Buddha became fully extinguished along with the full extinguishment there was a great earthquake aweinspiring and hairraising and thunder cracked the skyWhen the Buddha became fully extinguished Brahmā Sahampati recited this verseAll creatures in this worldmust lay down this bag of bonesFor even a Teacher such as thisunrivaled in the worldthe Realized One attained to powerthe Buddha became fully extinguishedWhen the Buddha became fully extinguished Sakka lord of gods recited this verseOh Conditions are impermanenttheir nature is to rise and fallhaving arisen they ceasetheir stilling is true blissWhen the Buddha became fully extinguished Venerable Anuruddha recited this verseThere was no more breathingfor such a one of steady heartImperturbable committed to peacethe sage has done his timeHe put up with painful feelingswithout flinchingThe liberation of his heartwas like the extinguishing of a lampWhen the Buddha became fully extinguished Venerable nanda recited this verseThen there was terrorThen they had goosebumpsWhen the Buddha endowed with all fine qualitiesbecame fully extinguishedWhen the Buddha became fully extinguished some of the mendicants there with arms raised falling down like their feet were chopped off rolling back and forth lamented Too soon the Blessed One has become fully extinguished Too soon the Holy One has become fully extinguished Too soon the seer has vanished from the worldBut the mendicants who were free of desire endured mindful and aware thinkingConditions are impermanent How could it possibly be otherwiseThen Anuruddha addressed the mendicantsEnough reverends do not grieve or lamentDid the Buddha not prepare us for this when he explained thatwe must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and belovedHow could it possibly be so that what is born created conditioned and liable to fall apart should not fall apartThe deities are complainingBut sir what kind of deities are you thinking ofThere are nanda deitiesboth in the sky and on the earthwho are percipient of the earth With hair disheveled and arms raised they fall down like their feet were chopped off rolling back and forth lamentingToo soon the Blessed One has become fully extinguished Too soon the Holy One has become fully extinguished Too soon the seer has vanished from the worldBut the deities who are free of desire endure mindful and aware thinkingConditions are impermanent How could it possibly be otherwisenanda and Anuruddha spent the rest of the night talking about DhammaThen Anuruddha said to nandaGo nanda into Kusinārā and inform the MallasVāseṭṭhas the Buddha has become fully extinguishedPlease come at your convenienceYes sir replied nanda Then in the morning he robed up and taking his bowl and robe entered Kusinārā with a companionNow at that time the Mallas of Kusinārā were sitting together at the meeting hall on some businessnanda went up to them and announcedVāseṭṭhas the Buddha has become fully extinguishedPlease come at your convenienceWhen they heard what nanda had to say the Mallas their sons daughtersinlaw and wives became distraught saddened and griefstricken And some with hair disheveled and arms raised falling down like their feet were chopped off rolling back and forth lamentedToo soon the Blessed One has become fully extinguished Too soon the Holy One has become fully extinguished Too soon the seer has vanished from the worldThe Rites of Venerating the Buddhas CorpseThen the Mallas ordered their menSo then my men collect fragrances and garlands and all the musical instruments in KusinārāThentaking those fragrances and garlands all the musical instruments and five hundred pairs of garmentsthey went to the Mallian sal grove at Upavattana and approached the Buddhas corpse They spent the day honoring respecting revering and venerating the Buddhas corpse with dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances and making awnings and setting up pavilionsThen they thoughtIts too late to cremate the Buddhas corpse today Lets do it tomorrowBut they spent the next day the same way and so too the third fourth fifth and sixth daysThen on the seventh day they thoughtHonoring respecting revering and venerating the Buddhas corpse with dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances let us carry it to the south of the town and cremate it there outside the townNow at that time eight of the leading Mallas having bathed their heads and dressed in unworn clothes saidWe shall lift the Buddhas corpse But they were unable to do soThe Mallas said to AnuruddhaWhat is the cause Venerable Anuruddha what is the reason why these eight Mallian leaders are unable to lift the Buddhas corpseVāseṭṭhas you have one plan but the deities have a different oneBut sir what is the deities planYou plan tocarry the Buddhas corpse to the south of the town while venerating it with dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances and cremate it there outside the townThe deities plan tocarry the Buddhas corpse to the north of the town while venerating it with heavenly dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances Then they plan to enter the town by the northern gate carry it through the center of the town leave by the eastern gate and cremate it there at the Mallian shrine named MakuṭabandhanaSir let it be as the deities planNow at that time the whole of Kusinārā was covered kneedeep with the flowers of the Flame Tree without gaps even on the filth and rubbish heapsThen the deities and the Mallas of Kusinārā carried the Buddhas corpse to the north of the town while venerating it with heavenly and human dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances Then they entered the town by the northern gate carried it through the center of the town left by the eastern gate and deposited the corpse there at the Mallian shrine named MakuṭabandhanaThen the Mallas said to AnuruddhaSir how do we proceed when it comes to the Realized Ones corpseProceed in the same way as they do for the corpse of a wheelturning monarchBut how do they proceed with a wheelturning monarchs corpseThey wrap a wheelturning monarchs corpse with unworn cloth then with uncarded cotton then again with unworn clothIn this way they wrap the corpse with five hundred doublelayers Then they place it in an iron case filled with oil and close it up with another case Then having built a funeral pyre out of all kinds of fragrant substances they cremate the corpseThey build a monument for the wheelturning monarch at the crossroadsThats how they proceed with a wheelturning monarchs corpseProceed in the same way with the Realized Ones corpseA monument for the Realized One is to be built at the crossroadsWhen someone there lifts up garlands or fragrance or powder or bows or inspires confidence in their heart that will be for their lasting welfare and happinessThen the Mallas ordered their menSo then my men collect uncarded cottonSo the Mallas wrapped the Buddhas corpseand placed it in an iron case filled with oil Then having built a funeral pyre out of all kinds of fragrant substances they lifted the corpse on to the pyreMahākassapas ArrivalNow at that time Venerable Mahākassapa was traveling along the road from Pāvā to Kusinārā together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicantsThen he left the road and sat at the root of a treeNow at that time a certain jīvaka ascetic had picked up a Flame Tree flower in Kusinārā and was traveling along the road to PāvāMahākassapa saw him coming off in the distance and said to himReverend might you know about our TeacherYes reverend Seven days ago the ascetic Gotama became fully extinguishedFrom there I picked up this Flame Tree flowerSome of the mendicants there with arms raised falling down like their feet were chopped off rolling back and forth lamentedToo soon the Blessed One has become fully extinguished Too soon the Holy One has become fully extinguished Too soon the seer has vanished from the worldBut the mendicants who were free of desire endured mindful and aware thinkingConditions are impermanent How could it possibly be otherwiseNow at that time a monk named Subhadda who had gone forth when old was sitting in that assemblyHe said to those mendicantsEnough reverends do not grieve or lamentWere well rid of that Great Ascetic harassing usThis is allowable for you this is not allowable for youWell now we shall do what we want and not do what we dont wantThen Venerable Mahākassapa addressed the mendicantsEnough reverends do not grieve or lamentDid the Buddha not prepare us for this when he explained thatwe must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and belovedHow could it possibly be so that what is born created conditioned and liable to fall apart should not fall apart even the Realized Ones bodyNow at that time four of the leading Mallas having bathed their heads and dressed in unworn clothes saidWe shall light the Buddhas funeral pyre But they were unable to do soThe Mallas said to AnuruddhaWhat is the cause Venerable Anuruddha what is the reason why these four Mallian leaders are unable to light the Buddhas funeral pyreVāseṭṭhas the deities have a different planBut sir what is the deities planThe deities plan is thisVenerable Mahākassapa is traveling along the road from Pāvā to Kusinārā together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicantsThe Buddhas funeral pyre shall not burn until he bows with his head at the Buddhas feetSir let it be as the deities planThen Venerable Mahākassapa came to the Mallian shrine named Makuṭabandhana at Kusinārā and approached the Buddhas funeral pyre Arranging his robe over one shoulder and raising his joined palms he respectfully circled the Buddha three times keeping him on his right and bowed with his head to the Buddhas feetAnd the five hundred mendicants did likewiseAnd when Mahākassapa and the five hundred mendicants bowed the Buddhas funeral pyre burst into flames all by itselfAnd when the Buddhas corpse was cremated no ash or soot was found from outer or inner skin flesh sinews or synovial fluidOnly the relics remainedIts like when ghee or oil blaze and burn and neither ashes nor soot are foundIn the same way when the Buddhas corpse was cremated no ash or soot was found from outer or inner skin flesh sinews or synovial fluidOnly the relics remainedAnd of those five hundred pairs of garments only two were not burnt the innermost and the outermostBut when the Buddhas corpse was consumed the funeral pyre was extinguished by a stream of water that appeared in the skyby water dripping from the sal treesand by the Mallas fragrant waterThen the Mallas made a cage of spears for the Buddhas relics in the meeting hall and surrounded it with a buttress of bows For seven days they honored respected revered and venerated them with dance and song and music and garlands and fragrancesDistributing the RelicsKing Ajātasattu of Magadha heardthat the Buddha had become fully extinguished at KusinārāHe sent an envoy to the Mallas of KusinārāThe Buddha was an aristocrat and so am I I too deserve a share of the Buddhas relics I will build a monument for them and conduct a memorial serviceThe Licchavis of Vesālī also heardthat the Buddha had become fully extinguished at KusinārāThey sent an envoy to the Mallas of KusinārāThe Buddha was an aristocrat and so are we We too deserve a share of the Buddhas relics We will build a monument for them and conduct a memorial serviceThe Sakyans of Kapilavatthu also heardthat the Buddha had become fully extinguished at KusinārāThey sent an envoy to the Mallas of KusinārāThe Buddha was our foremost relative We too deserve a share of the Buddhas relics We will build a monument for them and conduct a memorial serviceThe Bulas of Allakappa also heardthat the Buddha had become fully extinguished at KusinārāThey sent an envoy to the Mallas of KusinārāThe Buddha was an aristocrat and so are we We too deserve a share of the Buddhas relics We will build a monument for them and conduct a memorial serviceThe Koḷiyans of Rāmagāma also heardthat the Buddha had become fully extinguished at KusinārāThey sent an envoy to the Mallas of KusinārāThe Buddha was an aristocrat and so are we We too deserve a share of the Buddhas relics We will build a monument for them and conduct a memorial serviceThe brahmin of Veṭhadīpa also heardthat the Buddha had become fully extinguished at KusinārāHe sent an envoy to the Mallas of KusinārāThe Buddha was an aristocrat and I am a brahmin I too deserve a share of the Buddhas relics I will build a monument for them and conduct a memorial serviceThe Mallas of Pāvā also heardthat the Buddha had become fully extinguished at KusinārāThey sent an envoy to the Mallas of KusinārāThe Buddha was an aristocrat and so are we We too deserve a share of the Buddhas relics We will build a monument for them and conduct a memorial serviceWhen they had spoken the Mallas of Kusinārā said to those various groupsThe Buddha became fully extinguished in our village district We will not give away a share of his relicsThen Doṇa the brahmin said to those various groupsHear sirs a single word from meOur Buddhas teaching was acceptanceIt would not be good to fight overa share of the supreme persons relicsLet us make eight portions good sirsrejoicing in unity and harmonyLet there be monuments far and wideso many folk may gain faith in the SeerWell then brahmin you yourself should fairly divide the Buddhas relics in eight portionsYes sirs replied Doṇa to those various groups He divided the relics as asked and said to themSirs please give me the urn and I shall build a monument for it and conduct a memorial serviceSo they gave Doṇa the urnThe Moras of Pippalivana heardthat the Buddha had become fully extinguished at KusinārāThey sent an envoy to the Mallas of KusinārāThe Buddha was an aristocrat and so are we We too deserve a share of the Buddhas relics We will build a monument for them and conduct a memorial serviceThere is no portion of the Buddhas relics left they have already been portioned outHere take the embersSo they took the embersVenerating the RelicsThen King Ajātasattu of Magadhathe Licchavis of Vesālīthe Sakyans of Kapilavatthuthe Bulas of Allakappathe Koḷiyans of Rāmagāmathe brahmin of Veṭhadīpathe Mallas of Pāvāthe Mallas of Kusinārāthe brahmin Doṇaand the Moriyas of Pippalivana built monuments for them and conducted memorial servicesThus there were eight monuments for the relics a ninth for the urn and a tenth for the embersThat is how it was in those daysThere were eight shares of the Seers relicsSeven were worshipped throughout IndiaBut one share of the most excellent of menwas worshipped in Rāmagāma by a dragon kingOne tooth is venerated by the gods of the Three and Thirtyand one is worshipped in the city of Gandhāraanother one in the realm of the Kaliṅga Kingand one is worshipped by a dragon kingThrough their glory this rich earthis adorned with the best of offeringsThus the Seers corpseis well honored by the honorableIts venerated by lords of gods dragons and spiritsand likewise venerated by the finest lords of menHonor it with joined palms when you get the chancefor a Buddha is rare even in a hundred eonsAltogether forty even teethand the body hair and head hairwere carried off individually by godsacross the universeLong DiscoursesThe Longer Discourse on the Lions RoarSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Ujuñña in the deer park at KaṇṇakatthalaThen the naked ascetic Kassapa went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he stood to one side and said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama I have heard the followingThe ascetic Gotama criticizes all forms of mortification He categorically condemns and denounces those selfmortifiers who live roughDo those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said and not misrepresent him with an untruth Is their explanation in line with the teaching Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticismFor we dont want to misrepresent Master GotamaKassapa those who say this do not repeat what I have said They misrepresent me with what is false baseless and untrueWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I see some selfmortifier who lives rough reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellBut I see another selfmortifier who lives rough reborn in a good place a heavenly realmI see some selfmortifier who takes it easy reborn in a place of lossBut I see another selfmortifier who takes it easy reborn in a good place a heavenly realmSince I truly understand the coming and going passing away and rebirth of these selfmortifiers in this way how could I criticize all forms of mortification or categorically condemn and denounce those selfmortifiers who live roughThere are some clever ascetics and brahmins who are subtle accomplished in the doctrines of others hairsplittersYoud think they live to demolish convictions with their intellectThey agree with me in some matters and disagree in othersSome of the things that they applaud I also applaudSome of the things that they dont applaud I also dont applaudBut some of the things that they applaud I dont applaudAnd some of the things that they dont applaud I do applaudSome of the things that I applaud others also applaudSome of the things that I dont applaud they also dont applaudBut some of the things that I dont applaud others do applaudAnd some of the things that I do applaud others dont applaudExaminationI go up to them and sayLet us leave aside those matters on which we disagreeBut there are some matters on which we agree Regarding these sensible people pursuing pressing and grilling would compare teacher with teacher or community with communityThere are things that are unskillful blameworthy not to be cultivated unworthy of the noble ones and darkand are reckoned as suchWho behaves like theyve totally given these things up the ascetic Gotama or the teachers of other

how when sensible people pursue the matter they will mostly praise usThe Noble Eightfold PathThere is Kassapa a path there is a practice practicing in accordance with which you will know and see for yourselfOnly the ascetic Gotamas words are timely true and meaningful in line with the teaching and trainingAnd what is that pathIt is simply this noble eightfold path that isright view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersionThis is the path this is the practice practicing in accordance with which you will know and see for yourself Only the ascetic Gotamas words are timely true and meaningful in line with the teaching and trainingPracticing SelfMortificationWhen he had spoken Kassapa said to the BuddhaReverend Gotama those ascetics and brahmins consider these practices of selfmortification to be what makes someone a true ascetic or brahminThey go naked ignoring conventions They lick their hands and dont come or wait when asked They dont consent to food brought to them or food prepared on purpose for them or an invitation for a mealThey dont receive anything from a pot or bowl or from someone who keeps sheep or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home or where a couple is eating or where there is a woman who is pregnant breastfeeding or who has a man in her home or where theres a dog waiting or flies

mouthfulsThey feed on one saucer a day two saucers a day up to seven saucers a dayThey eat once a day once every second day up to once a week and so on even up to once a fortnightThey live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervalsThose ascetics and brahmins also consider these practices of selfmortification to be what makes someone a true ascetic or brahminThey eat herbs millet wild rice poor rice water lettuce rice bran scum from boiling rice sesame flour grass or cow dung They survive on forest roots and fruits or eating fallen fruitThose ascetics and brahmins also

airThey sleep wherever they lay their matThey eat unnatural things committed to the practice of eating unnatural foodsThey dont drink committed to the practice of not drinking liquidsTheyre committed to the practice of immersion in water three times a day including the eveningThe Uselessness of SelfMortificationKassapa someone may practice all those forms of selfmortificationbut if they havent developed and realized any accomplishment in ethics mind and wisdom they are far from being a true ascetic or brahminBut take a mendicant who develops a heart of love free of enmity and ill will And they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilementsWhen they achieve this theyre called a mendicant who is a true ascetic and also a true brahminWhen he had spoken Kassapa said to the BuddhaIts hard Master Gotama to be a true ascetic or a true brahminIts typical Kassapa in this world to think that its hard to be a true ascetic or brahminBut someone might practice all those forms of selfmortificationAnd if it was only because of just that much only because of that selfmortification that it was so very hard to be a true ascetic or brahmin it wouldnt be appropriate to say thatits hard to be a true ascetic or brahminFor it would be quite possible for a householder or a householders childor even the bonded maid who carries the waterjarto practice all those forms of selfmortificationIts because theres something other than just that much something other than that selfmortification that its so very hard to be a true ascetic or brahmin And thats why it is appropriate to say thatits hard to be a true ascetic or brahminTake a mendicant who develops a heart of love free of enmity and ill will And they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilementsWhen they achieve this theyre called a mendicant who is a true ascetic and also a true brahminWhen he had spoken Kassapa said to the BuddhaIts hard Master Gotama to know a true ascetic or a true brahminIts typical in this world to think that its hard to know a true ascetic or brahminBut someone might practice all those forms of selfmortificationAnd if it was only by just that much only by that selfmortification that it was so very hard to know a true ascetic or brahmin it wouldnt be appropriate to say thatits hard to know a true ascetic or brahminFor it would be quite possible for a householder or a householders childor even the bonded maid who carries the waterjarto know that someone is practicing all those forms of selfmortificationIts because theres something other than just

insight due to the ending of defilementsWhen they achieve this theyre called a mendicant who is a true ascetic and also a true brahminThe Accomplishment of Ethics Immersion and WisdomWhen he had spoken Kassapa said to the BuddhaBut Master Gotama what is that accomplishment in ethics in mind and in wisdomIts when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha Seeing danger in the slightest fault a mendicant keeps the rules theyve undertaken They act skillfully by body and speech Theyre purified in livelihood and accomplished in ethical conduct They guard the sense doors have mindfulness and situational awareness and are contentAnd how is a mendicant accomplished in ethicsIts when a mendicant gives up killing living creatures They renounce the rod and the sword Theyre scrupulous and kind living full of compassion for all living beingsThis pertains to their accomplishment in ethics There are some ascetics and brahmins who while enjoying food given in faith still earn a living by unworthy branches of knowledge by wrong livelihood They refrain from such unworthy branches of knowledge such wrong livelihoodThis pertains to their accomplishment in ethicsA mendicant thus accomplished in ethics sees no danger in any quarter in regards to their ethical restraintIts like a king who has defeated his enemies He sees no danger from his foes in any quarterIn the same way a mendicant thus accomplished in ethics sees no danger in any quarter in regards to their ethical restraintWhen they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics they experience a blameless happiness inside themselvesThats how a mendicant is accomplished in ethicsThis Kassapa is that accomplishment in ethics They enter and remain in the first absorption This pertains to their accomplishment in mind They enter and remain in the second absorption third absorption fourth absorptionThis pertains to their accomplishment in mindThis Kassapa is that accomplishment in mindWhen their mind is immersed like thisthey extend and project it toward knowledge and vision This pertains to their accomplishment in wisdom They understand  there is no return to any state of existenceThis pertains to their accomplishment in wisdomThis Kassapa is that accomplishment in wisdomAnd Kassapa there is no accomplishment in ethics mind and wisdom that is better or finer than thisThe Lions RoarThere are Kassapa some ascetics and brahmins who teach ethicsThey praise ethical conduct in many waysBut as far as the highest noble ethics goes I dont see anyone whos my equal still less my superiorRather I am the one who is superior when it comes to the higher ethicsThere are Kassapa some ascetics and brahmins who teach mortification in disgust of sinThey praise mortification in disgust of sin in many waysBut as far as the highest noble mortification in disgust of sin goes I dont see anyone whos my equal still less my superiorRather I am the one who is superior when it comes to the higher mortification in disgust of sinThere are Kassapa some ascetics and brahmins who teach wisdomThey praise wisdom in many waysBut as far as the highest noble wisdom goes I dont see anyone whos my equal still less my superiorRather I am the one who is superior when it comes to the higher wisdomThere are Kassapa some ascetics and brahmins who teach freedomThey praise freedom in many waysBut as far as the highest noble freedom goes I dont see anyone whos my equal still less my superiorRather I am the one who is superior when it comes to the higher freedomIts possible that wanderers who follow other paths might sayThe ascetic Gotama only roars his lions roar in an empty hut not in an assemblyThey should be told Not soWhat should be said is this The ascetic Gotama roars his lions roar and he roars it in the assembliesIts possible that wanderers who follow other paths might sayThe ascetic Gotama roars his lions roar and he roars it in the assemblies But he doesnt roar it boldlyThey should be told Not soWhat should be said is this The ascetic Gotama roars his lions roar he roars it in the assemblies and he roars it boldlyIts possible that wanderers who follow other paths might sayThe ascetic Gotama roars his lions roar he roars it in the assemblies and he roars it boldly But they dont question him Or he doesnt answer their questions Or his answers are not satisfactory Or they dont think him worth listening to Or theyre not confident after listening Or they dont show their confidence Or they dont practice accordingly Or they dont succeed in their practiceThey should be told Not soWhat should be said is this The ascetic Gotama roars his lions roar he roars it in the assemblies he roars it boldly they question him he answers their questions his answers are satisfactory they think him worth listening to theyre confident after listening they show their confidence they practice accordingly and they succeed in their practiceThe Probation For One Previously OrdainedKassapa this one time I was staying near Rājagaha on the Vultures Peak MountainThere a certain practitioner of selfmortification named Nigrodha asked me about the higher mortification in disgust of sinI answered his questionHe was extremely happy with my answerSir who wouldnt be extremely happy after hearing the Buddhas teachingFor I too am extremely happy after hearing the Buddhas teachingExcellent sir ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there so too the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaSir may I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presenceKassapa if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth the ordination in this teaching and training they must spend four months on probation When four months have passed if the mendicants are satisfied theyll give the going forth the ordination into monkhoodHowever I have recognized individual differences in this matterSir if four months probation are required in such a case Ill spend four years on probationWhen four years have passed if the mendicants are satisfied let them give me the going forth the ordination into monkhoodAnd the naked ascetic Kassapa received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presenceNot long after his ordination Venerable Kassapa living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessnessHe understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceAnd Venerable Kassapa became one of the perfectedLong DiscoursesWith JāliyaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi in Ghositas MonasteryNow at that time two renunciatesthe wanderer Muṇḍiya and Jāliya the pupil of Dārupattikacame to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over they stood to one side and said to the BuddhaReverend Gotama are the soul and the body the same thing or they are different thingsWell then reverends listen and pay close attention I will speakYes reverend they repliedThe Buddha said thisTake the case when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha Thats how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics They enter and remain in the first absorption When a mendicant knows and sees like this would it be appropriate to say of themThe soul and the body are the same thing or The soul and the body are different thingsIt would reverendBut reverends I know and see like thisNevertheless I do not sayThe soul and the body are the same thing or The soul and the body are different things They enter and remain in the second absorption third absorption fourth absorptionWhen a mendicant knows and sees like this would it be appropriate to say of themThe soul and the body are the same thing or The soul and the body are different thingsIt would reverendBut reverends I know and see like thisNevertheless I do not sayThe soul and the body are the

the same thing or The soul and the body are different thingsThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the two renunciates were happy with what the Buddha saidLong DiscoursesWith KevaddhaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Nālandā in Pāvārikas mango groveThen the householder Kevaddha went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir this Nāḷandā is successful and prosperous and full of peopleSir please direct a mendicant to perform a demonstration of superhuman psychic powerThen Nāḷandā will become even more devoted to the BuddhaWhen he said this The Buddha saidKevaddha I do not teach the mendicants like thisCome now mendicants perform a demonstration of superhuman psychic power for the whiteclothed laypeopleFor a second time Kevaddha made the same requestand the Buddha gave the same answerFor a third time Kevaddha made the same requestand the Buddha said the followingThe Demonstration of Psychic PowerKevaddha there are three kinds of demonstration which I declare having realized them with my own insightWhat threeThe demonstration of psychic power the demonstration of revealing and the demonstration of instructionAnd what is the demonstration of psychic powerIts a mendicant who wields the many kinds of psychic power multiplying themselves and becoming one again going unimpeded through a wall a rampart or a mountain as if through space diving in and out of the earth as if it were water walking on water as if it were earth flying crosslegged through the sky like a bird touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon so mighty and powerful controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realmThen someone with faith and confidence sees that mendicant performing those superhuman featsThey tell someone else who lacks faith and confidenceIts incredible its amazing The ascetic has such psychic power and mightI saw him myself performing all these superhuman featsBut the one lacking faith and confidence would say to themTheres a spell named GandhārīUsing that a mendicant can perform such superhuman featsWhat do you think KevaddhaWouldnt someone lacking faith speak like thatThey would sirSeeing this drawback in psychic power Im horrified repelled and disgusted by demonstrations of psychic powerThe Demonstration of RevealingAnd what is the demonstration of revealingIn one case someone reveals the mind mentality thoughts and reflections of other beings and individualsThis is what youre thinking such is your thought and thus is your state of mindThen someone with faith and confidence sees that mendicant revealing another persons thoughtsThey tell someone else who lacks faith and confidenceIts incredible its amazing The ascetic has such psychic power and mightI saw him myself revealing the thoughts of another personBut the one lacking faith and confidence would say to themTheres a spell named MāṇikāUsing that a mendicant can reveal another persons thoughtsWhat do you think KevaddhaWouldnt someone lacking faith speak like thatThey would sirSeeing this drawback in psychic power Im horrified repelled and disgusted by demonstrations of psychic powerThe Demonstration of InstructionAnd what is the demonstration of instructionIts when a mendicant instructs others like thisThink like this not like that Focus your mind like this not like that Give up this and live having achieved thatThis is called the demonstration of instructionFurthermore a Realized One arises in the world Thats how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics They enter and remain in the first absorption This is called the demonstration of instructionThey enter and remain in the second absorption third absorption fourth absorptionThis too is called the demonstration of instructionThey extend and project the mind toward knowledge and vision This too is called the demonstration of instructionThey understand  there is no return to any state of existenceThis too is called the demonstration of instructionThese Kevaddha are the three kinds of demonstration which I declare having realized them with my own insightOn the Mendicant In Search of the Cessation of BeingOnce it so happened Kevaddha that a mendicant in this very Saṅgha had the following thoughtWhere do these four primary elements cease without anything left over namely the elements of earth water fire and airThen that mendicant attained a state of immersion such that a path to the gods appearedThen he approached the Gods of the Four Great Kings and saidReverends where do these four primary elements cease without anything left over namely the elements of earth water fire and airWhen he said this those gods said to himMendicant we too do not know thisBut the Four Great Kings are our superiorsThey might knowThen he approached the Four Great Kings and asked the same questionBut they also said to himMendicant we too do not know thisBut the gods of the ThirtyThree Sakka lord of gods the gods of Yāmā the god named Suyāma the Joyful gods the god named Santussita the gods who delight in creation the god named Sunimmita the gods who control the creation of others the god named Vasavattī the gods of Brahmās HostThey might knowThen that mendicant attained a state of immersion such that a path to Brahmā appearedThen he approached those gods and saidReverends where do these four primary elements cease without anything left over namely the elements of earth water fire and airBut they also said to himMendicant we too do not know thisBut there is Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Undefeated the Champion the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord God the Maker the Author the First the Begetter the Controller the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born He is our superiorHe might knowBut reverends where is that Brahmā nowWe also dont know where he is or what way he liesBut by the signs that are seenlight arising and radiance appearingwe know that Brahmā will appear For this is the precursor for the appearance of Brahmā namely light arising and radiance appearingNot long afterwards the Great Brahmā appearedThen that mendicant approached the Great Brahmā and said to himReverend where do these four primary elements cease without anything left over namely the elements of earth water fire and airThe Great Brahmā said to himI am Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Undefeated the Champion the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord God the Maker the Author the First the Begetter the Controller the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be bornFor a second time that mendicant said to the Great BrahmāReverend I am not asking you whether you areBrahmā the Great Brahmā the Undefeated the Champion the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord God the Maker the Author the First the Begetter the Controller the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be bornI am askingwhere these four primary elements cease without anything left overFor a second time the Great Brahmā said to himI am Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Undefeated the Champion the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord God the Maker the Author the First the Begetter the Controller the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be bornFor a third time that mendicant said to the Great BrahmāReverend I am not asking you whether you areBrahmā the Great Brahmā the Undefeated the Champion the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord God the Maker the Author the First the Begetter the Controller the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be bornI am askingwhere these four primary elements cease without anything left overThen the Great Brahmā took that mendicant by the arm led him off to one side and said to himMendicant these gods think that there is nothing at all that I dont know and see and understand and realizeThats why I didnt answer in front of themBut I too do not know where these four primary elements cease with nothing left overTherefore mendicant the misdeed is yours alone the mistake is yours alone in that you passed over the Buddha and searched elsewhere for an answer to this questionMendicant go to the Buddha and ask him this question You should remember it in line with his answerThen that mendicant as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of meThen he bowed sat down to one side and said to meSir where do these four primary elements cease without anything left over namely the elements of earth water fire and airThe Simile of the LandSpotting BirdWhen he said this I said to himOnce upon a time mendicant some seamerchants set sail for the ocean deeps taking with them a landspotting birdWhen their ship was out of sight of land they released the birdIt flew right away to the east the west the north the south upwards and inbetweenIf it saw land on any side it went there and stayedBut if it saw no land on any side it returned to the shipIn the same way after failing to get an answer to this question even after searching as far as the Brahmā realm youve returned to meMendicant this is not how the question should be askedSir where do these four primary elements cease without anything left over namely the elements of earth water fire and airThis is how the question should be askedWhere do water and earthfire and air find no footingwhere do long and shortfine and coarse beautiful and uglywhere do name and formcease with nothing left overAnd the answer to that isConsciousness thats invisibleinfinite entirely given upthats where water and earthfire and air find no footingand thats where long and shortfine and coarse beautiful and uglythats where name and formcease with nothing left overwith the cessation of consciousnessthats where this ceasesThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the householder Kevaddha was happy with what the Buddha saidLong DiscoursesThe Great StewardSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on the Vultures Peak MountainThen late at night the fairy Pañcasikha lighting up the entire Vultures Peak went up to the Buddha bowed stood to one side and said to himSir I would tell you of what I heard and learned directly from the gods of the ThirtyThreeTell me Pañcasikha said the BuddhaThe Council of the GodsSir it was more than a few days agoon the fifteenth day sabbath on the full moon day at the invitation to admonish held at the end of the rainy seasonwhen all the gods of the ThirtyThree were sitting together in the Hall of JusticeA large assembly of gods was sitting all around and the Four Great Kings were seated at the four directionsThe Great King Dhataraṭṭha was seated to the east facing west in front of his godsThe Great King Virūḷhaka was seated to the south facing north in front of his godsThe Great King Virūpakkha was seated to the west facing east in front of his godsThe Great King Vessavaṇa was seated to the north facing south in front of his godsWhen the gods of the ThirtyThree have a gathering like this that is how they are seatedAfter that come our seatsSir those gods who had been recently reborn in the company of the ThirtyThree after leading the spiritual life under the Buddha outshine the other gods in beauty and gloryThe gods of the ThirtyThree became uplifted and overjoyed at that full of rapture and happiness sayingThe heavenly hosts swell while the demon hosts dwindleSeeing the joy of those gods Sakka lord of gods celebrated with these versesThe gods rejoicethe ThirtyThree with their Lordrevering the Realized Oneand the natural excellence of the teachingand seeing the new godsso beautiful and gloriouswho have come here after leadingthe spiritual life under the BuddhaThey outshine the othersin beauty glory and lifespanHere are the distinguished disciplesof he whose wisdom is vastSeeing this they delightthe ThirtyThree with their Lordrevering the Realized Oneand the natural excellence of the teachingThe gods of the ThirtyThree became even more uplifted and overjoyed at that full of rapture and happiness sayingThe heavenly hosts swell while the demon hosts dwindleEight Genuine PraisesSeeing the joy of those gods Sakka lord of gods addressed themGentlemen would you like to hear eight genuine praises of the BuddhaIndeed we would sirThen Sakka proffered these eight genuine praises of the BuddhaWhat do the good gods of the ThirtyThree thinkabout how much the Buddha has acted for the welfare and happiness of the people out of compassion for the world for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humansI dont see any Teacher past or present who has such compassion for the world apart from the BuddhaAlso the Buddha has explained the teaching wellvisible in this very life immediately effective inviting inspection relevant so that sensible people can know it for themselvesI dont see any Teacher past or present who explains such a relevant teaching apart from the BuddhaAlso the Buddha has clearly described what is skillful and what is unskillfulwhat is blameworthy and what is blameless what should be cultivated and what should not be cultivated what is inferior and what is superior and what is on the side of dark and the side of brightI dont see any Teacher past or present who so clearly describes all these things apart from the BuddhaAlso the Buddha has clearly described the practice that leads to extinguishment for his disciples And extinguishment and the practice come togetheras the waters of the Ganges come together and converge with the waters of the YamunaI dont see any Teacher past or present who so clearly describes the practice that leads to extinguishment for his disciples apart from the BuddhaAlso possessions and popularity have accrued to the Buddha so much that youd think it would thrill even the aristocrats But he takes his food free of vanityI dont see any Teacher past or present who takes their food so free of vanity apart from the BuddhaAlso the Buddha has gained companions both trainees who are practicing and those with defilements ended who have completed their journeyThe Buddha is committed to the joy of solitude but doesnt send them awayI dont see any Teacher past or present so committed to the joy of solitude apart from the BuddhaAlso the Buddha does as he says and says as he does thus he does as he says and says as he doesI dont see any Teacher past or present who so practices in line with the teaching apart from the BuddhaAlso the Buddha has gone beyond doubt and got rid of indecision He has achieved all he wished for regarding the fundamental purpose of the spiritual lifeI dont see any Teacher past or present who has achieved these things apart from the BuddhaThese are the eight genuine praises of the Buddha proffered by SakkaHearing them the gods of the ThirtyThree became even more uplifted and overjoyedThen some gods thoughtIf only four fully awakened Buddhas might arise in the world and teach the Dhamma just like the Blessed OneThat would be for the welfare and happiness of the people out of compassion for the world for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humansOther gods thoughtLet alone four fully awakened Buddhas if only three fully awakened Buddhasor two fully awakened Buddhas might arise in the world and teach the Dhamma just like the Blessed OneThat would be for the welfare and happiness of the people out of compassion for the world for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humansWhen they said this Sakka saidIts impossible gentlemen for two perfected ones fully awakened Buddhas to arise in the same solar system at the same timeMay that Blessed One be healthy and well and remain with us for a long timeThat would be for the welfare and happiness of the people out of compassion for the world for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humansThen the gods of the ThirtyThree having considered and deliberated on the matter for which they were seated together in the Hall of Justice advised and instructed the Four Great Kings on the subjectAnd each stood at their own seat without departingThe Kings were instructedand heeded good adviceWith clear and peaceful mindsthey stood by their own seatsThen in the northern quarter a magnificent light arose and radiance appeared surpassing the glory of the godsThen Sakka lord of gods addressed the gods of the ThirtyThreeAs indicated by the signslight arising and radiance appearingBrahmā will appear For this is the precursor for the appearance of Brahmā namely light arising and radiance appearingAs indicated by the signsBrahmā will appearFor this is the sign of Brahmāa light vast and greatOn SanaṅkumāraThen the gods of the ThirtyThree sat in their own seats sayingWe shall find out what has caused that light and only when we have realized it shall we go to itAnd the Four Great Kings did likewiseHearing that the gods of the ThirtyThree agreed in unisonWe shall find out what has caused that light and only when we have realized it shall we go to itWhen Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the ThirtyThree he does so after manifesting in a solid corporeal formfor the gods of the ThirtyThree arent able to see a Brahmās normal appearanceWhen Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the ThirtyThree he outshines the other gods in beauty and gloryas a golden statue outshines the human formWhen Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the ThirtyThree not a single god in that assembly greets him by bowing down or rising up or inviting him to a seatThey all sit silently on their couches with their joined palms raised thinkingNow Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra will sit on the couch of whatever god he choosesAnd the god on whose couch Brahmā sits is overjoyed and brimming with happinesslike a king on the day of his coronationSeeing the joy of those gods Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra celebrated with these versesThe gods rejoicethe ThirtyThree with their Lordrevering the Realized Oneand the natural excellence of the teachingand seeing the new godsso beautiful and gloriouswho have come here after leadingthe spiritual life under the BuddhaThey outshine the othersin beauty glory and lifespanHere are the distinguished disciplesof he whose wisdom is vastSeeing this they delightthe ThirtyThree with their Lordrevering the Realized Oneand the natural excellence of the teachingThat is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spokeAnd while he was speaking on that topic his voice had eight qualities it was clear comprehensible charming audible rounded undistorted deep and resonantHe makes sure his voice is intelligible as far as the assembly goes but it doesnt extend outside the assemblyWhen someone has a voice like this theyre said to have the voice of BrahmāThen the gods of the ThirtyThree said to Brahmā SanaṅkumāraGood Great Brahmā Knowing this we rejoiceAnd there are the eight genuine praises of the Buddha spoken by Sakkaknowing them too we rejoiceEight Genuine PraisesThen Brahmā said to SakkaIt would be good lord of gods if I could also hear the eight genuine praises of the BuddhaSaying Yes Great Brahmā Sakka repeated the eight genuine praises for himHearing them Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra was uplifted and overjoyed full of rapture and happinessThen Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra manifested in a solid corporeal form taking on the appearance of the youth Pañcasikha and appeared to the gods of the ThirtyThreeRising into the air he sat crosslegged in the skylike a strong man might sit crosslegged on a wellappointed couch or on level groundThere he addressed the gods of the ThirtyThreeThe Story of the StewardWhat do the gods of the ThirtyThree think about the extent of the Buddhas great wisdomOnce upon a time there was a king named DisampatiHe had a brahmin high priest named the StewardDisampatis son was the prince named Reṇuwhile the Stewards son was the student named JotipālaThere were Reṇu the prince Jotipāla the

Jotipāla came to be known as the Great StewardDividing the RealmThen the Great Steward went to the six aristocrats and saidKing Disampati is old elderly and senior advanced in years and has reached

the two Dhataraṭṭhasthese are the seven BhāratasThe first recitation section is finishedA Good ReputationThen the six aristocrats approached the Great Steward and saidSteward just as you are King Reṇus friend dear beloved and cherishedyou are also our friendWould you manage our affairs Please dont turn us downYes sirs replied the Great StewardThen the Great Steward managed the realms of the seven kings And he taught seven welltodo brahmins and seven hundred bathed initiates to recite the hymnsAfter some time he got this good reputationThe Great Steward sees Brahmā in person The Great Steward discusses converses and consults with Brahmā in personThe Great Steward thoughtI have the reputationof seeing Brahmā in person and discussing with him in personBut I dontI have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior the teachers of teachers saidWhoever goes on retreat for the four months of the rainy season and practices the absorption on compassion sees Brahmā and

brahmins of the past said thatwhoever goes on retreat for the four months of the rainy season and practices the absorption on compassion sees Brahmā and discusses with himBut I neither see Brahmā nor discuss with himA Discussion With BrahmāAnd then Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra knowing what the Great Steward was thinking as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in the Great Stewards presenceAt that the Great Steward became frightened scared his hair standing on end as he had never seen such a sight beforeSo he addressed Brahmā
