Most biographies are written by someone else or when the person in question is already dead
There is the tendency to follow conventional writing sensibilities by eulogising the subject in a way similar to what one hears at the funeral rites
Though one might know that the person had also committed some dark deeds etiquette and decorum dictate what can be recorded
Good manners are exhibited in four ways
A person is good in few ways
When asked about him or her one describes them all
One's own bad traits are few
When asked about them one describes them all
Though one's good traits are many if nobody asks one says nothing and when asked one says little
I am someone who goes directly for the truth and therefore I don't want anyone to write this sort of biography after I am dead
I know about myself so it is better that I do the job
After my death they can then write as they like about me
If they dislike me this will influence what they relate perhaps they will inflate the trifling cause of their displeasure beyond the truth
On the other hand if they love me they will magnify my good points out of all proportion
In truth I first wrote this Autobiography only for myself to show my appreciation of a life wearing the saffron robe
There was no thought of publication because I would have felt rather ashamed at the idea for an autobiography is selfpromoting
Even when people asked to have it printed for me I still wasn't happy with the idea
When lay devotees arranged my sixth cycle birthday celebrations on the twentysixth of April they also asked to print and to distribute my Autobiography at that time
I realized that if I didn't agree it would get written after I was dead anyway
I therefore quickly finished off the Autobiography that I had been writing so that it was ready for the celebration
May readers forgive me if my Autobiography sometimes seems too selfcongratulatory and therefore offends against good taste
But if one doesn't write about what really happened what else can one include
 Although I have brought this Autobiography uptodate please understand that the essential core has not been changed because the real subject of the book is still here
My first name is Thate and I had the family name of Reeo rahng
I was born at about nine o'clock on a Saturday morning April
It was the fourth day of the waning moon in the year of the tiger
My birth place was the village of Nah Seedah in the subdistrict of Glahng Yai Bahn Peur District Udornthani Province
My father's name was Usah and my mother's Krang
They were ordinary ricefarmers and both had grown up as fatherless orphans
After migrating from different regions they had met and married at the village of Nah Seedah
My father originally came from Darn Sai in Loei Province while my mother was from Muangfahng in the district of Luplaer Uttaradit Province
They established themselves in Nah Seedah Village and continued living there producing ten children in all
When I was nine I went with all my friends to the village monastery for schooling studying central Thai and the indigenous and traditional Dhamm' and Korm alphabets and scripts
There were many monks and novices at the local village monastery of Nah Seedah and my eldest brother  who had ordained as a monk  was our teacher
He taught following the Mullabot Bapakit the old fashioned reading primer and I studied there for three years
However I was not very good at my lessons for I preferred to play rather than study
In those days the establishment of government schools had not yet spread throughout the country side
So while my eldest brother was a monk he had taken the opportunity to go out and travel and gain some wider experience
He also had a good retentive memory and was able to learn central Thai quickly and on returning could teach us
There were many of us studying under him  monks and novices as well as children
The numbers became so large that some people on seeing the situation asked him whether it had already become an official school
We not only studied Thai script but also learned some religious chanting and how to read the texts written in the Dhamm' and Korm scripts
These lessons lasted for three years and then I had to leave the monastery because my elder brother withdrew from the monkhood
Most of my classmates also left because no one could take over the job of teaching
Although I had left the monastery my life continued to be involved mainly with the monks and novices
When my brother left the monkhood no monk remained to take on the responsibilities of abbot
Occasionally visiting monks would pass through and it was my job to act as liaison between these monks and the villagers
I regularly offered my services in the morning I went to present them with their food in the evening it was the fetching and filtering of their water and then gathering flowers for the monks to use in their devotional offerings
It was my job quickly to inform the village about how many monks had come and make sure that there was enough food to go round
I conscientiously and unfailing took on these duties for a full six years
My parents gave me their full support and encouragement and urged me on in my services to the monks
My undertaking of these duties caused my parents to show me even more love and affection
Nevertheless whenever I was slow or tardy they would always make sure that I was put right
It was not just my parents who considered that I was successfully serving the monks for all the villagers seemed to have a special affection and warmth for me
This was evident whenever business affecting the monks or the monastery came up for then they would always seek me out
About this time I began thinking with increasing interest about good and evil about virtuous and base deeds
Whenever any doubts or questions came up I would always make sure to ask my father
Consequently he started to take more interest in me
At night when he was free he liked to explain about things  about the ways of the world and about Dhamma
I can still remember some of his instructions
He taught me Having been born a son don't be the son of a family cremated in the same cemetery
This means that a son should go and seek experience and knowledge away from his home village
One has to die but one shouldn't lie down and die in one's birth place
This advice really appealed to me because my character already inclined in this direction
I asked him If two people go and make merit through good deeds and generosity and one is ordained as a monk while the other isn't which one of them would gain the greater merit
He replied that if a monk does this much merit and he exhibited his thumb he will gain this much result  lifting up two fistfuls in emphasis
Whereas he continued the nonordained person might make this much  two fistful's  merit but he would only receive one thumb's worth
Although I probably didn't then fully understand his explanation I still felt completely satisfied after hearing and seeing it through
This might have been because my character already naturally inclined towards the monastic life
I still remembered an occasion from my early days in the monastery when I went with my elder brother to visit another monastery
There was a novice there whose demeanour and behavior were exemplary
He made such a strong impression on me he was so inspiring and admirable that I felt a special sympathy towards him
I found myself following his every movement whether he was walking or sitting or going about his various duties
The more I gazed after him the stronger my faith and feeling grew
On returning to our monastery I couldn't get his image out of my mind
I could think of only one thing 'Oh when can I ordain and become a novice like him'
This was my continual preoccupation
At this point there is something that I feel must relate
It concerns the life story of my parents
This is something very special for me because I recall their love and kindness towards me with such immense gratitude
Particularly so concerning the time they spent teaching me about various things  especially about morality and religious values
It really seems as if they had a special love and concern for me
They also used to tell me about their younger days in quite some detail so much so that listening to their trials and tribulations aroused sadness and a feeling of great pity and compassion for them both
As I have mentioned before both my father and mother were refugees and fatherless orphans
My father originally lived in the highlands of Darn Sai District in Loei Province
He migrated from there to escape the privations of its handtomouth existence and came down to the more fertile lowlands
People had told him that the region around the town of Nongkhai was fertile and abundant in rice and food
This was in stark contrast to his home region where even though their occupation was the growing of rice they never seemed able to produce enough rice to eat
The countryside there was mostly mountainous with little land available for normal paddy fields so planting supplementary fields up on the mountain slopes was necessary
This called for the cultivation of large areas to produce sufficient rice
My father told me that because his father was already dead the responsibility for supporting his four brothers and sisters together with his mother had fallen on him
Their fields had extended as far as the eye could see
When they paused in their work to have a meal they would not bother putting up any shelter but would eat out under the open sky
This was done because my father was concerned that his younger brothers and sisters after eating their fill would become lazy and want to rest rather than getting on with the work
Despite all such effort in years of inadequate rainfall there would not be enough to eat
Some families had no rice at all and so were reduced to consuming magor fruits as a substitute
This might have had to keep people going for as long as a month at a time
He trekked down to the lowlands with his four younger brothers and sisters and their mother
There was sister Boonmah brothers Gunhah and ChiangIn and sister Dtaengorn
The party expanded when many relatives and other people also elected to go
Their migration involved crossing several high mountain ranges  the Poo Fah and Poo Luang for instance  and dense jungle tracts
People owning elephants or pack animals could more easily convey their belongings and so had an advantage over those who were forced to carry everything on their shoulders
Their own strength had to serve as their vehicle
It took more than a week to reach the village of Nah Ngiew
On arrival they established a temporary camp on the edge of a large lake Nong Pla or Fish Lake in Nong Dtao
Later they moved on and made a permanent settlement in the village of Nah Ngiew which is still there to this day
My mother's side of the family was of the Lao Puan tribe
They had been forced out of Laos by the Thai army in the reign of King Rama III and were released in the region of Uttaradit
They later settled down in Muang Fahng Lup Laer District Uttaradit Province
My mother told me that her mother had related the events of the migration down from the town of Chiang Kwahng to her
My grandmother was still too young to walk so the adults put her in a woven bamboo basket that they then suspended from one end of a bamboo carrying pole the other end being balanced with their belongings
In this way they blazed a trail  penetrating dense jungles fording streams and traversing mountain ranges until they reached Muang Fahng
When my grandmother grew up she married and had two children and these were my mother and her younger brother
Afterwards her husband died and my grandmother was left alone with two children
At that time the surrounding regions had become infested with bandits and thieves and the authorities seemed powerless and unable to deal with them
Under such conditions even ordinarily honest people were corrupted and became criminals
An example of such a person was the man Chiang Tong who had been a member of their migrant group
He joined the bandits and was constantly leaving home and going out to cause mischief
In the end he had to flee from the threat of arrest by hiding out around Glahng Yai in Bahn Peur District
While there he witnessed the goodnaturedness of the local inhabitants and saw their peaceful ways with their abundant and prosperous life
He decided to go back to Muang Fahng and report and try to persuade his relatives and friends to move on to Glahng Yai
My mother told me that scores of people decided to join the party that was to journey on
They traveled on foot down through Phetchaboon continuing to Loei Province and stopping to rest at the monastery in Hooay Port Village
It was there that people came down with smallpox and many died
The inhabitants of Hooay Port Village showed such good will and kindness in their help towards the needy at this time that several of the party decided to stay on and settle down right there
Those remaining in Chiang Tong's group struggled on down and eventually arrived at Glahng Yai Village
My grandmother with her younger brother and her two children  this was my mother and her younger brother my uncle  had to remain dependent on older and senior friends in the group
When the time arrives for us to experience suffering then odd things can occur
It happened that my grandmother's younger brother met a group of traveling Burmese traders and abruptly decided to go off with them
There had never been any argument or disagreement between them throughout the long journey he simply left and was never heard from again
On arrival at Glahng Yai Village a group separated from the main party and moved on to settle in the village of Nah Bong Poo Pet in the district of Ponpisai
One of my mother's uncles on her father's side went away with this group leaving my grandmother and her two fatherless children to depend on her elder companions
Afterwards when my mother had grown up she met my father and fell in love
They were married and settled down to live together in the village of Nah Seedah and produced ten children  as has been mentioned earlier
My grandmother eventually married again this time to the same Chiang Tong who had been their leader on the journey
They lived out their later years together until misfortune struck a tree branch fell on my grandmother's head and fatally injured her
Chiang Tong was a person guilty of many wrong doings and kammic retribution soon caught up with him
After my grandmother's death he again married a woman of the same migrant party but this time his new wife committed suicide by hanging herself
He realized that he had much evil kamma and so decided to enter a monastery
Chiang Tong wore white robes and kept the Eight Precepts of a Buddhist devotee and lived into old age reaching almost a hundred years
Yet he didn't stay in the monastery preferring to live with his grandchildren in their house in the village
However when he chanted his daily devotions to the Lord Buddha Dhamma and Sangha his grandchildren would become annoyed at the disturbance and would scold him
He was very old and had nowhere else to go and he was also becoming senile forgetting things such as whether he had eaten or not
His grandchildren became more frustrated and cursed and abused him and not a day passed without them saying they wished he were dead
He returned the abuse and cursed them in endless ways saying he hoped they turned out like him
It was a pitiful state of affairs
Those people who have done evil will find that the consequences are liable to catch up with them before they die
Living amongst base people  those who are unprincipled and lacking in virtue and morality  tends to pass on such evil so that it corrupts most of the people involved
This suffering of ours has no limits
We let go of one thing and grasp hold of something else
It goes on and on and on in this way throughout our life
This is why the wise person becomes weary and tired of the suffering inherent in this world and seeks for a way to go beyond it
After her mother passed away my mother was able to find support from her husband and children for their livelihood was now enough to get by on
Although they might only have as little as six baht to their name they were not too concerned
Food and rice were abundant and money wasn't so necessary in those days
Rice farming alone produced enough food to last through the whole year while the cultivation of too large an area meant there would be nowhere  no space left in the granary  to store the extra grain
Even farming a modest area still produced a large surplus of paddy rice
After a time their third son died
My father had had a particular love for this son and he became so distraught with the loss that he almost went out of his mind
The child had been so loveable and intelligent so wellspoken and articulate so easy to teach
He had been obedient had loved his parents and always listened to their instructions
Although there remained six children besides his wife it seemed to my father as if he had lost everything
He could see only as far as that lone dead child while his despair enveloped everything else in darkness
With time the dark clouds of sorrow gradually dissipated and the light of Dhamma  as found in the Buddhist teachings  began to illuminate his heart allowing him dimly to see the way out
He thought that if he could distance himself from all concerns  by becoming a monk  it might somewhat assuage his grief
One consideration was that he could share the merit gained from such ordination with his dead son and that would certainly enable the son to take rebirth in a happy realm
My father consequently took leave of his wife and children to be ordained and stayed a monk for two Rains Retreats
This going forth as a monk into the Buddha's religion does not automatically end any of the distress that a person might be feeling
Such suffering arises dependent on internal defilements and we have been accumulating these worldly defilements from the time of our birth
This is something that has been going on for innumerable lives and births so don't even try to disclose and count all those defilements
Someone lacking in wisdom can't possibly unearth those layers of defilements  laid down and accumulated already beyond counting  and spread them out to see
For that reason they can't bring about their final elimination

As the clouds of his sorrow gradually lifted my father realized that he missed his six innocent children and his abandoned wife
They were fatherless without friends or relatives and this moved him to leave the monkhood and become a householder again
This was good fortune for those of us who still had to take birth
My young sister and I were subsequently born into my parent's home born to people who had founded their lives in goodness
I am proud to say that this birth place compares favorably with any other in this world because from birth onwards I was always in contact with virtue and Dhamma
I was able to grow up and mature in the cool shade of the yellow robe of Buddhism right until today
The thing that I rejoice in most is that although I didn't support my parents in the normal lay manner I could still sustain and foster their goodwill and kindheartedness
This was achieved by my following the holy life as a monk and by being able to help train their hearts in stages right up to the last days of their lives
Both my parents seemed well pleased with how I had turned out and were not disappointed in having brought me up
This was because I had fulfilled a son's filial obligations
That is to say I had given them teachings and instruction concerning the practice of morality and virtue which enabled what they already knew to develop progressively higher and higher
I am especially happy that I was able to help my father with advice and suggestions about his meditation practice right until his last day
He was delighted and more than willing to receive my training methods and to put them into practice until he was able clearly to see the results in his own heart
Eventually he was able to exclaim that throughout all his seventyfive years he had never known such peace and happiness
It gives me enormous joy to have taught my mother right through to her final day
When she was breathing her last I was present caring for her helping her to remember Dhamma
She was consciously aware and willingly took my counsel to heart so that in her last moments her face became bright and radiant
There is a stanza of the Lord Buddha  if I remember it correctly  where he outlined how a son of good family intent on repaying the kindness and virtue of his father and mother should act
'If he were to administer to their every need in the best possible way to a degree difficult to find in the world even if he were to provide them with the treasure of a World Ruling Monarch
as an offering  all this would still fall short
It still could not be considered full recompense for the kindness and excellence of one's parents
This is because all those things can only offer pleasure and happiness during their lifetime
Once they have died there is no way they can take such things with them
However if the son of good family instructs his mother and father who are deficient in morality and virtue to establish themselves in these wholesome and fine qualities or if they are already established therein he encourages and supports their further development then that son can be considered one who has truly repaid his debt'
The wealth of the Noble Treasure is priceless and can go with the individual wherever he or she may go
Therefore saying that I have managed to practice following all the Lord Buddha's instructions is not incorrect
It is the complete fulfillment of one's obligations even though a proper and formal contract may never have been made
About this time in my life  perhaps it was because I was entering my teens or for another reason I don't know  my father showed an extra special interest in me
After the evening meal around seven o'clock he was liable to bring up some topic and illustrate it with examples
He regularly taught me in this way no matter whether it was concerned with spiritual or worldly matters
Sometimes he would question me or ask my opinion
For example he would enquire Do you like girls
And when you marry what sort of girl will you marry
This is how it proceeded
I can still remember my answer I like girls with a fair and light complexion without blemish courteous and well mannered in thought speech and behavior
Her family background wouldn't pose any problem
However if she came from a good respectable family all the better
While asleep one night I had a visionary dream
There I was with a large group of friends setting out from the house to go and play in the fields
This was typical boyish behavior for us in those days
Just then two forest monks appeared walking towards us with alms bowl and 'krot' over their shoulders
On seeing me one of the monks rushed at me and I was so afraid that I fled for my life
Yet all my friends just stood there unconcerned as if nothing untoward was taking place
The circumstances were such that I had to take the final resort by seeking refuge at home with my parents
Yet it wasn't to be for when I ran into the house yelling to mother and father for help both remained impassive and unconcerned as if nothing unusual was going on
Meanwhile the forest monk hadn't stopped chasing after me and was close on my heels
I ran into the bedroom and dived under the mosquito net
The monk burst in after me and yanked up the mosquito net
Then using a whip he lashed at me with all his strength
I was terrified and so startled that it woke me up
When I came to my senses I found I was still trembling and was soaked in perspiration from head to toe
My heart throbbed violently and where I had been whipped still stung
I really thought that it had all actually happened and even gingerly felt with my hand to check
It was so vivid that it seemed real
I then pulled myself together and mindfully went over what had happened
After careful consideration the mind eventually calmed down and my fear went away
This episode gradually faded from my memory and was forgotten for a long time
It was only when I was out wandering in the jungle as a forest novicemonk with my meditation teacher that it all came back to me
That visionary dream from the distant past did truly seem to point out future events and to have been correct in every respect
About this time another incident happened to me  but this was no dream or vision
I had been unable to get to sleep until late at night for I was taken up with recalling and reflecting on the great kindness and goodness of my parents
I allowed my thoughts to wander and pondered about them seeing how they had raised and nurtured us ten children with great sacrifice and grinding toil until we reached maturity
Soon their children would be grown up and married and have families of their own
They would all then disperse going their separate ways
I reached that thought and felt compelled to consider what my parent's situation would then be like
Who was going to provide for and take care of my mother and father
I was considering all this according to the sensibility of a child without real thought for the future
This made me feel very sad and despondent grieving for the future destitute condition of my parents
It moved me so much that I began to sob and the tears soaked my pillow
I was in this state for a long time and the more I thought about them the greater my despondency
I made the decision that when I was grown up I would not get married like everyone else
When everyone else left home I would take over the responsibility of caring for mother and father all by myself and do it to the best of my ability
My heart was gladdened and contented after arriving at this resolution and as it was already very late into the night I fell asleep
All dhammas exist here within each of us and the one that knows Dhamma is the heart or mind
Whether it knows much or little whether it knows in a course or more refined way depends on one's present competence one's aptitude and maturity and the training each person has received
The resolution that I made then came from gratitude and appreciation of the goodness and virtue of my parents
Another night a similar thing happened
I lay there reflecting on the condition of the ordinary village farmer and their routine working year
The annual cycle begins during the months of March and April when forest needs to be cleared for new fields
The area is burned off the remaining stumps and roots dug out and fences erected
When the monsoon rains arrive the various crops have to be prepared and planted out according to whatever is planned
Those families with few or insufficient members would have to decide how to divide their time between the various tasks
There is the general plowing to do and the sowing and preparation of the nurseryrice seedlings
This entails working and laboring continuously until the rice seedlings are ready for transplanting
There is then the replanting of each young rice plant into the plowed and ready fields
Of course I am speaking here of a year with good and timely rain
A dry year means wasted time and effort with deprivation and loss
It is mainly the housewife's task to have previously organized adequate supplies
This would include for example rice chilipeppers salt pickled fish and tobacco
Then when everyone gets down to work in the fields there is no need to be concerned about finding provisions
Normally with favorable rainfall they will complete the rice planting by August or it might extend into September
With that done everyone turns to gathering food reserves to be put away ready for harvest time
Besides this there is fishing gear to be repaired and readied for use in the coming dry season
As the monks come to the end of their Rains Retreat the villagers will usually begin harvesting the paddy rice
However prior to this they must first harvest any hill rice
Throughout the harvesting season there is still the added labor of picking the other crops and vegetables as they ripen in their fields
There may be chilipeppers cotton and beans
In those days when the paddy crop was abundant the harvesting might not be completely finished much before late January
Then came the job of transporting the threshed rice to the storage granaries that might go on into February
Even when harvesting was taking place during the day at night the bamboo strips to bind the rice sheaves had to be fashioned
With the harvest over there would then be firewood to find for boiling up the sugar cane to obtain the syrup
About the boiling up of the sugar cane
The daily process began in the early afternoon with entry into the sugar cane plantation
Sufficient cane had to be cut ready for the next morning's boiling
The cut cane was carried out of the fields and carted off  if one owned a cart  and stacked at the boiling shed
Getting up at first light one had to go and press the juice out of the cane and this would go on late into the morning
Inadequate help would bring delay so that someone would have to go off and prepare the meal
With the sugar cane all pressed everyone could come together for a communal meal
After that they would all separate and go about their respective duties leaving one person to watch over the cauldron of boiling sugar cane juice
Some farmers had so much sugar cane that they didn't finish processing it until March
By then it was time to start clearing the forest to make fields once more
Well then
What was it on that night that led me to go over all this in such detail
All the different phases of the adult's working year
What was I after
It saddened me so feeling for and sympathizing with the sort of life we are born into deficient in opportunity or free time
After our birth there seems only to be actions and deeds to be done
Individual distinctions only appear because of disparate duties and difference in rank or status
The future leads on into a continuing doing unless that is one is asleep or dead
This way of thinking went directly against my juvenile views and perception of reality
I was intoxicated with the idea that 'this world is so much fun'
Remember in those days children didn't have to go to school nor did they have any responsibilities to worry about
After having eaten there was only playing around and looking for fun with my friends
If sometimes we had to go and take the cattle or buffalos out to graze we could also turn that into fun
On that night I clearly perceived all the suffering involved in being born into this world as a human being
I saw it for myself right there in my own heart previously never having given it any consideration at all
This time however my perception was only about seeing the suffering inherent in the struggle to fill one's stomach with seeing that each day offered no free time no break in the process
I could not see what I had to do to surmount and go beyond such suffering
That lack of understanding shows that it cannot be considered the Noble Truth of Suffering for it is only concerned with the ordinary mundane truth of suffering
It was during this period that our part of the country became infested with brigands and cattle rustlers
These gangsters took over the whole region and even tenyearold children and women engaged in the thieving
The authorities were impotent and so the villagers had to look after themselves
Each household kept a whole pack of guard dogs and at night everyone had to take it in turns to stand guard
Whenever cattle were stolen the owner would have to go and pay an absurdly overpriced ransom for their return
The stouthearted would go out after the thieves and hunt them down like wild animals
There would then be some peace and respite
The authorities seemed to approve and even actively encourage such retaliation
I was still only small but I also had some big ideas about being famous
I did not want to become renowned as thief or robber but rather as the hero who conquered them so I set my mind on one thing 'What can I do to make myself invulnerable to all weapons'
I could then go out and crush these hordes of brigands wiping them all out
At this time I was also helping to look after a very talkative and boastful monk  excuse me but that is the description he deserves
His place of origin was the village of Muang Kai which is where the district of Varnornnivart borders on Bueng Kahn District
He shrewdly must have guessed my innermost thoughts because before long he was suggesting After the Rains Retreat why don't you come back with me to my home village
I have there every sort of thing
If you want charms arcane herbs the whole range of accessories that give invulnerability I have them all
I was delighted with this
So as soon as the Rains Retreat ended three older youths  my elder brother and two of his friends  with myself as a much younger fourth accompanied this monk back to his home village
We discovered on reaching our destination that the monk had really duped us into escorting him back home
None of the villagers in that area had any respect for him because he had already ordained and disrobed numerous times
The last news I heard of him was that he had disrobed yet again had got married and that both husband and wife were smoking opium
The two bigger youths who had gone with us still pleaded with him to learn about and obtain the various special things
But he was always evasive and beat around the bush and looked for excuses to extricate himself
We discovered the truth when we spoke to the other monks in that monastery for really he didn't have anything remarkable or rare his only accomplishment being that of bragging and talking big
Our group stayed with him for about ten days before taking leave to return home with our hopes all unrealized
Every day while we had been staying with him he had urged us to go out to find eels for him to eat
He really loved eels although he didn't like any other type of fish
It took us three days to walk home
I felt particularly humiliated and ashamed
On leaving home I had resolved to seek out and learn the occult knowledge of 'invulnerability' so that by my return I would be secure against any weapon belonging to anyone
When I reached home my friends found every possible opportunity to make fun of me and this made me feel even more humiliated
However the experience did have its positive side for I became disillusioned with the whole thing and lost my foolish credulity in charms and magical powers
From that day forward right up to the present whenever anyone comes in and talks of their wondrous properties my mind remains wholly indifferent
When I later became a novice my friends had tried to persuade me to go and study about such things
They were even willing to pay the customary 'teacher's fee' and sponsor the whole venture but I would not change my mind
I consider myself particularly fortunate on this account I had been born into a family of good moral conduct and virtuous behavior I had been taught and prepared through living in a monastery with monks  who could be truly regarded as good monks
Whenever external conditions and surroundings coerced and pressured my mind forcing it to turn towards what was low and base it seemed that things never turned out as my base desires would have it
If they had who knows what might have happened to me
Perhaps one can say that my good kamma and past merit guided and protected me
That long journey was the first time in my life that I had gone away from home
We were all staying at Muang Kai Village when the news first came through about the outbreak of World War It was all anyone ever spoke about when they came to visit the monastery
I became so homesick that I cried every day
Some days I couldn't get to sleep until late into the night because of my constant pining for my parents
When I arrived home again I resumed my practice of serving the monks in the monastery as I had always done
However I didn't always sleep at the monastery and had the duty of bursar or steward to the monks being the intermediary and liaison between them and the villagers
This worked out very well
All the villagers seemed increasingly to appreciate my efforts because I had become adept and competent
Another consideration in their growing interest in me might have been that I was also entering adolescence
They would give me jobs to do and simultaneously tease me
I had been going regularly to the monastery throughout an extended period of about six years and had become closely acquainted with the monks and novices
However on no occasion did any of the monks teach me about keeping the Five or Eight Precepts
Strange as it may seem this is quite understandable because the Sangha or Community of monks of that time was seriously deficient in learning
In Ven
Ajahn Singh Khantayaagamo and Ven
Ajahn Kham  disciples of the Venerable Meditation Master Ajahn Mun Bhuuridatta Thera  were out walking tudong
They were the first forest monks to reach the village of Nah Seedah
Although there were monks resident in the local monastery they still came and asked to stay with us
It almost seemed to me as if they had aimed specifically at coming to see my father and me
We attended on them with deep reverence and faith because we saw that their way of practice was different from other groups of meditation monks

In particular the visiting monks taught me about their various obligations and duties
For example I learned the 'do's and don'ts' in offering things to a monk and about meditation using the mantra word 'Buddho' as an object of preliminary recitation
My mind was able to converge in samadhi to the point where I lost all desire to speak with anyone
This was where I first experienced the flavor of meditation's peace and stillness
It's something I've never forgotten
Later when I was a novice studying with many others I would slip out  unknown to anyone  into the cool and quiet of the night to meditate alone
The venerable monks stayed with us for a little more than two months
At first they were also intending to spend the Rains Retreat but a previous malarial infection flared up again
Therefore just before the start of the Rains Retreat they left to stay at an abandoned monastery in the village of Nah Bong Nahm Mong Subdistrict in the district of Tah Bor and I was able to go with them
The monks were ill with malaria throughout the three months of the Rains Retreat
In spite of his illness Ven
Ajahn Singh would still kindly use some of his free time to teach me reading and writing with occasional training in religious matters
Towards the end of the Rains Retreat something came up in his mind  I don't know quite what  for he said that after the Retreat he would have to return to his home village and asked if I would go with him
The journey will be long and tough he added
My answer was an immediate Venerable Sir I will go with you
A few days before the end of the Rains Retreat I asked his permission to go home to take leave of my parents
Both of the monks seemed pleased with the idea that I would be going with them and they quickly organized some flowers incense and candles for me to go and offer to my parents
This is the traditional way of asking forgiveness and blessing

On the evening of that night after seeking forgiveness and a blessing from my parents I continued around and asked the same of all the family elders and the older people in the village
Whomever I went to see would weep with sorrow as if I were going off to my death
I became a bit sentimental and could not hold back my own tears
At daybreak my mother and aunt set out with me to where the Venerable Ajahn was staying and we all spent the night there
It was Pavarana the last day of the Rains Retreat and early the following morning after the meal the Venerable Ajahn led us off on our journey
Once again my aunt and the villagers gathered there and shed some tears together
It was perhaps unprecedented for a boy of that region and my age to venture away from home on such a long journey
It also meant being cut off from my relatives and friends who would have offered comfort and warmth
Not only that it seems that I may well have been the first boy to venture off  without any worries or regrets  following after forest meditation monks
We set off walking from Tah Bor wading through water and mud steadily pressing on through the forest and passing across the rice fields
Whenever one of the monks became feverish with malaria he would climb up to rest in a field shelter or else under a tree that was shady and dry out of the mud
At day break the venerable monks would still make the effort to go out on alms round and they were able to feed me too
We walked for three days before reaching the provincial town of Udornthani staying at Wat Majjhimavat for ten nights before setting off again on our journey
We took the road to Khon Kaen Province and passed through the present provinces of Mahasarakam Roiet and Yasotorn
This journey of ours  the two of us with the Venerable Ajahn  took just over a month before reaching Nong Korn Village of Hua Dtaphan Subdistrict in the district of Amnart Charoen
This was the village where the Venerable Ajahn's mother lived
He stayed there for about three months so that he could teach and help her in spiritual matters
While staying in Nong Korn Village Ven
Ajahn Singh sent me to ask for novice ordination with the Venerable Upajjhaaya Looee from the monastery in Keng Yai Village who would act as my Preceptor
I was about to enter my eighteenth year
At this time I was becoming somewhat more proficient in my reading and had been going through the Trailokavithan
This book describes the future degeneration and destruction of the world of the satthantara kappa time
Reading this moved me to deep sadness and my eyes were filled with tears for many a day
At meal times I had no appetite because my heart was lost in thoughts of the approaching degeneration and the calamity awaiting human beings and all creatures
It was as if all this would be unfolding before my eyes within just a few days
Venerable Ajahn Singh took me to stay at Wat Sutatnarahm in Ubon town
It was a monastery where he himself had once lived
I now entered the monastery school at Wat Seetong to continue with my Thai Language studies
Having settled me there and with the Rains Retreat being over Ven
Ajahn Singh turned back to his forest wandering
He returned by way of Sakhon Nakorn Province because a group of monks led by the Venerable Ajahn Mun was wandering in that region
The night before Ven
Ajahn Singh set out he called a meeting of the monks and novices and informed us of his intentions
On hearing this news I felt such an enormous reluctance to be parted from him that I began to sob  right there in the middle of that large gathering
Feeling selfconscious and embarrassed in front of my friends I beat a hasty retreat and hurried outside to reestablish some mindfulness and try to compose myself
I remembered the occasion in the time of the Lord Buddha when the Venerable Ananda wept on learning that the Lord Buddha was soon finally to pass away
By reflecting on this it somewhat assuaged my own heart's grief and I could go back into the meeting
The Venerable Ajahn had meanwhile been teaching on various themes
At the same time as learning Thai I had to allocate time for memorizing Pali chanting and studying the General Dhamma Studies Course
I was very conscious that in spite of being so much older than the other students keeping up with them would be difficult
I was going through the third grade of the course but couldn't sit the final examination because the Ecclesiastical Head Monk of that Region had made a rule that one had to be more than twenty years old
It therefore wasn't until my third year there that I could take the examination and was able to pass it that same year
My memorizing of the Pali texts continued and I was learning by heart the Paatimokkha Rule
I applied myself to this because of my regard and admiration for the monastic discipline
My Thai language studies only extended to the completion of the primary education course
On leaving the Thai language school I turned my full attention to studying Pali
However in that year of my studies it so happened that Ven
Mahaa Pin Paññaabalo  who was the younger brother of Ven
Ajahn Singh  came back from Bangkok
He initiated a course in Nak Dhamm' Toh Grade Two which was the first of its kind in that administrative region of the Northeast
I therefore also enrolled for that course but I was never able to finish it nor indeed the Pali because Ven
Ajahn Singh returned to spend the Rains Retreat at Wat Sutatnarahm
After the Rains Retreat  and before I could take my examinations  he led Ven
Ajahn Mahaa Pin and me off on tudong
It was the novice Thate who became the millionaire
Here I am talking about the time when the government thought up the idea of creating one new 'millionaire' every year in Thailand
They thus brought out an annual lottery with a first prize of fifty or sixty thousand baht
In those days this was considered a fortune large enough for a Thai millionaire
It was all done so that we Thais would not feel humiliated before other richer countries
One night it so happened that Novice Thate was unable to sleep because he had just won first prize in the lottery
It was time to set about finding the site to build himself a grand and extensive three story mansion
This residence would be furnished to the most modern designs and be in the center of the commercial district
The employees and assistants would have to fill the shelves with every imaginable kind of merchandise
He would be at ease in body and mind without a worry in the world and spend his time lounging on a sofa making eyes at the attractive young women who would come in to shop
Whoever chanced a glance in his direction and smiled would receive a happy smile back
Throughout his life of eighteen to nineteen years he had never known greater happiness
He had indeed attained the rank of millionaire  just as the government had wished
Yet then within the blink of an eye with all the things still fresh and new aniccaa or impermanence intrudes
Ah impermanence
All abruptly breaks down and disappears from his heart and that's something he regrets so much
Novice Thate comes to his senses and he realizes that it is already late into the night 'It should already be time for sleep  Hey what is this
Not only has the lottery yet to take place but I haven't even bought a ticket
How come I've already become a millionaire
I must be going crazy'
That night he felt an unspeakable degree of mortification and shame
If any knowledgeable persons were to know about these fantasies what would they say
He finally fell asleep and awoke at dawn with guilty feelings from the night before and never told anyone about this occurrence
Anyone can become this sort of 'millionaire'  not just Novice Thate
I described him as a millionaire only in the sense that in his mind's eye he could imagine possession of an abundance of property and wealth
Still at least he was content with the amount that his imagination produced
This is much better than those people already possessing material wealth who fantasize about getting even more
They are forever dissatisfied with what they already have and thereby are always discontented and troubled
Of what benefit is all that wealth to such people
Wealthy or poor the real question lies with whether one is happy or not
It is certainly not the case that the more one possesses the better it is
The Lord Buddha thus taught that contentment with what one actually has is a resource and wealth of great value
I went forth as a monk through my faith in the Lord Buddha's Teaching  the Dhamma and the Vinaya Discipline
Then I sincerely followed the way of practice clearly seeing the truth that he had indicated
The Lord Buddha once pointed out a money bag to Venerable Ananda and explained that it was something poisonous
He added that it was not only poisonous to monks and nuns who involve themselves with it but also to lay people who do not know how to handle it correctly
For lay people however it is a necessity something that has to be used for their condition and way of life is quite different from that of a monk or nun
Taking this further anyone in possession of great wealth but unable to deal with it properly is in the same position as someone holding a firebrand
The fire will inevitably burn down from the ignited end to scorch the hand that grasps it
I was a novice for five years before becoming a monk and having spent such a long time in a monastery gave me a considerable advantage over the other newly ordained monks
I was on old hand so to speak and knew very well how the monastery worked
It gave me a head start over those who were given bhikkhu ordination with me
For instance I already knew the chanting and could recite the Patimokkha
On the th of May atAM I went forth as a monk in the ordination boundary of Wat Sutat'
I was approaching twentytwo years of age
My Preceptor was the Venerable Phra Maharat with Venerable Maha Pin Paññaabalo acting as the Announcing Ajahn
This was the year that my teacher the Venerable Ajahn Singh Khantayaagamo led a party of six  four monks and two novices  to spend the Rains Retreat at Wat Sutat'
It was the first time that a community of forest meditation monks stayed the Rains Retreat in the provincial town of Ubon
Venerable Ajahn Singh came back to spend the Rains Retreat in Ubon because he learned that his younger brother Venerable Maha Pin had arrived back there from Bangkok
Ven
Ajahn Singh's plan was to take his brother out wandering for meditation in the jungle
Before Ven
Maha Pin had gone to Bangkok he had promised Ven
Ajahn Mun that he would first go and study and then come back to take up the way of practice
Ven
Ajahn Singh had been delighted to hear that his younger brother had returned and thus came to spend the Rains Retreat at Wat Sutatnarahm
Following the end of the Rains Retreat and the Kathina season Ven
Ajahn Singh led a large group of us walking on tudong
Those of us new to tudong apart from Ven
Maha Pin and myself were Ven
Kam Phooay Ven
Torn and two novices
There were twelve of us all together
I had been living at Wat Sutat' in Ubon separated from family and close friends for a full six years
While I was living there various people left their sons and grandsons under my care
Four boys lived with me as my 'disciples' of whom two were ordained as novices
They had been with me ever since my own novice days right through to my ordination as a monk
We had developed a fatherson relationship and so when it came time to separate they all began to weep thinking how much they were going to miss me
I too was almost unable to hold back my tears
However being their teacher it would have looked bad if I cried in front of them so I gritted my teeth and suppressed my sorrow not letting my true feelings show
Even so I found my voice hoarse with emotion
At the time those feelings hadn't seemed too overpowering but later after we had left they seeped in and made me feel dull and listless for a remarkably long time
Whether I was walking standing sitting or lying down even while talking or eating my heart was preoccupied in gloom and sadness longing for my 'disciples'
How will they manage
What will they eat
Will they have enough to eat or have to go without
Who will teach them
Or perhaps someone would come along to bully and boss them about
This was the first time in my life that I had ever experienced such depression
I therefore had to think through and reflect on my situation 'These boys are neither my children nor my grandchildren they aren't blood relatives they only came to rely and depend on me
I guided and instructed them to the best of my ability
Why is it that I miss and pine about them so much' At this point I pondered what it must be like for people with a wife and children of their own
There
If these 'disciples' had been my own sons my own flesh and blood how much greater would have been my grief
I now perceived the drawback and danger in such longing and yearning and this realization permeated right through to my heart
This understanding has never been lost
Human beings are really no different from young monkeys that cannot live alone separated from their mother
This caused me to become overwhelming fearful of sentimental attachment
Such yearning and longing lead to suffering both when one is united and when separated
What can we do to gain freedom
Our party of twelve  eight monks and four novices  with Ven
Ajahn Singh leading made our way out of Ubon town during November
We walked steadily on never staying anywhere along the way for more than a single night until we arrived at the village of Hua Dtaphan
We rested there for quite some time before moving on to stay at Hua Ngoo Village where we readied our requisites before continuing our wanderings through the forest
Our walking on tudong this time did not offer much solitude and seclusion because of the large number in our party
Nevertheless it did give a fair taste of the experience of walking and wandering through forests and jungle
For instance one night we arranged our resting places with krot umbrellas and mosquito nets in place
After we had chanted our evening puja a storm broke on us with gale force winds and pouring rain
To lie down or even to sit became impossible as the area started to flood
We quickly gathered up our gear and fled thinking to ask for shelter in the nearby village monastery
Besides everything else we couldn't find the right path into the village which meant we had to circle back and forth close to the village perimeter for many hours
When we eventually reached the village monastery we found that it was already occupied by sleeping lay people
These were the six traveling salesmen who had been walking with us for part of the journey
When they had previously spotted the mass of dark storm clouds building up on the horizon they had announced that they were going to stay in the village rather than sleeping out
They now helped to arrange whatever sleeping places could be found for us
With the sleeping places arranged we hurried back to escort the Ven
Ajahn in with those seven or eight of our companions who had remained outside with him
Reaching the monastery and sorting out our things we could then lie down and try to get some sleep
The hut though was absolutely soaked through and there were no mats or pillows available because it was an abandoned monastery
Yet our exhaustion enabled us to gain some brief sleep even if everything was wet through
At daybreak we went out on alms round to the village and received nothing more than plain cooked rice and a banana each
After the meal we continued our journey
The Ven
Ajahn led us straight through dense jungles towards the provincial towns of Roiet and Kalasin
We passed through Dong Ling and emerged in the district of Sahassakan near Koomphavapee District of Udornthani Province
However we didn't actually enter the main town but stayed to the west in the village of Chiang Pin
We went there to await the arrival from Bangkok of the Ecclesiastical Head of that Region or Chao Kana Monton
The Chao Kana Monton instructed our party to come and wait upon him in Udorn at this time with the aim of bringing Ven
Maha Pin to take up residence in Udorn
This was because Udorn town didn't yet have any monks of the Dhammayut' Community
However things didn't turn out that way
When the Chao Kana Monton arrived from Bangkok it was learned that Phraya Rachanukoon had requested Ven
Mahaa Joom Bandhulo to accompany him to Udorn so that he could take up residence at Wat Bodhisomphorn there
We all went to pay our respects to the Chao Kana Monton as soon as he arrived and found that there had been another change of plans
He now wanted to send Ven
Maha Pin to stay in the province of Sakhon Nakorn and to have me stay with Ven
Maha Joom in Udorn
His reasons being that there weren't any suitable monks in Udorn
Also he thought that as I was a local and already had some academic training I should stay and help see to the administrative business of the monks
I instead requested that he allow me to go off to practice meditation to honor his authority and dignity
For meditation monks were few and far between whereas scholastic and administrative monks were numerous and wouldn't be difficult to find
He gave his permission and recommended that I should stay and assist Ven
Maha Pin
After these matters had all been settled Ven
Ajahn Singh led our group off to pay respects to Venerable Ajahn Mun who was staying at Kor Village in the district of Bahn Peur
Venerable Ajahn Sao also happened to be there at that time
So it came about that I was able to meet both Venerable Ajahns and pay my respects to them for the first time in my life
That evening Ven
Ajahn Mun wholeheartedly bestowed on us a Dhamma talk to mark the occasion of seeing us for the first time
This was especially so when he saw Ven
Maha Pin
It was Ven
Maha Pin who had previously committed himself  after listening to Dhamma talks by Ven
Ajahn Mun and Ven
Ajahn Singh while in Ubon  to return and practice after studying academically in Bangkok
As for me Ven
Ajahn Mun probably only knew as much about me as Ven
Ajahn Singh had passed on to him
That night after the Dhamma talk was over Ven
Ajahn Mun spoke more informally with us about Dhamma
He concluded the discussion by forecasting something about the various abilities and qualities of Ven
Maha Pin and myself
This made me feel extremely uncomfortable and abashed for I was right there in the midst of the monks and was not only newly ordained but I couldn't see in myself anything special enough to interest the Ven
Ajahn Mun
In fact I had begun to feel very selfconscious from the moment we entered the monastery area in the early part of the evening  although I don't know how the others felt about it
I had looked over the place and noted the way the monks lived similarly with the novices and right through to the lay people in the monastery
How could they all be so well mannered and orderly
Each seemed to be going about their personal duties and routine tasks
Then came the predictions about Ven
Maha Pin and when he moved on to me it doubled my embarrassment
Venerable Maha Pin himself probably didn't feel much at all apart from some introspective checking of his abilities with what Ven
Ajahn Mun had predicted
The next morning after the meal Ven
Ajahn Singh led our party off again on the trail to the village of Nah Seedah
We stayed there for four nights before retracing our steps back to spend another night with Ven
Ajahn Mun
Then we walked back to Udorn and carried on to Sakhon Nakorn in line with what we had agreed with the Chao Kana Monton
However subsequent events didn't work out as the Chao Kana Monton had planned because Ven
Maha Pin became ill and couldn't take up the duties entrusted to him
Therefore for that year's Rains Retreat the Ven
Ajahn Singh took our group of monks off to stay at the forest monastery of Nong Laht Village
This action made the Chao Kana Monton highly displeased with us so we had to send Ven
Boon who had completed the General Dhamma Studies Course to stay in Sakhon Nakorn
Before entering the Rains Retreat I found an excellent Dhamma companion in a monk by the name of Venerable Glom from Loei Province
We had twice gone up to the cave Tam Puang on Poo Lek mountain to develop meditation together
The first time we went up for four nights and the second time for six nights
The village headman named Ornsee   arranged for someone to climb up to offer us food on a regular basis
I will always remember his kindness and goodwill
Ven
Ajahn Mun had remarked that this particular village headman was intelligent and astute about everything  from his quickwitted speech to his work and social involvements in the community
He always seemed able to keep abreast of affairs
When it came to monks his talents were remarkable for he was immediately and competently able to arrange whatever a monk might need with nothing more than the barest hint by the monk
The two of us were thus supplied with all four suitable things supportive of meditation practice and so were able to push strongly forward
The more we meditated the more we felt grateful to the headman and the villagers for all their goodwill
Our daily meal consisted of one ball of glutinous rice about the size of a baelfruit with some dried chili powder
This was enough to sustain us in our meditation practice without any harmful effects
Reducing food intake while increasing meditation exertion brings lightness to the body clarity to the mindfulness and makes samadhi less difficult
I meditated with great diligence and my mindfulness improved and became more firmly established
While living in the cave I trained my mindfulness to give it a constancy throughout the day and night
I refused to allow any lapse when my mind might heedlessly wander away following after external objects
Mindfulness became steadily and exclusively established in the body and mind
I even made sure that however my mind had been established before going to sleep it would return to the same state on awakening
Although sometimes there was still a bit of absentmindedness during the meal
Increasing my exertion also raised my appreciation for the villagers' goodwill  it seemed to follow like the shadow its subject
I was very much aware that being a monk my existence rested in the hands of the villagers and I therefore continued my meditation practice to repay my debt to them
I became certain that my meditation efforts during this time completely fulfilled the obligations of my indebtedness
As the Rains Retreat approached we went down to stay with Ven
Ajahn Singh in the monastery of Nong Lart Village
As I was still a newly ordained monk during this Rains Retreat I didn't have to take on any responsibilities
Apart that is from attending to the needs of the senior monk and applying myself to the meditation practice
The Venerable Ajahn gave us special consideration in this
Throughout the Rains Retreat I further developed my meditation practice following the scheme that I had observed while out on the mountain
On top of that I added some yoga techniques as an experiment
By this I mean progressively reducing my daily food intake from seventy small lumps of sticky rice down to three mouthfuls
Then I gradually increased again to thirty mouthfuls before cutting back down to five mouthfuls
Each sequence of this would take some three or four days and I continued like this throughout the Rains Retreat
Although the longest period was when I ate only fifteen mouthfuls of food a day and then it was only vegetarian food
My build is naturally quite slim and so when that became quite emaciated the villagers started to notice
Everyone who saw me asked what was wrong but I had the will power and the spirit to carry on as normal with my duties and meditation practice
As soon as the Rains Retreat was over I resumed eating some meat and fish again
But Oh
How foul they now smelled
We human beings consume their meat and make it into our own flesh
It's just as if we snatch away and steal something foul and then eat it
This is why the devas and other heavenly beings won't come close to humans  it's our offensive smell
Yet human beings themselves seem to find no difficulty in embracing and admiring these corpses of ours
After the Rains Retreat I went up onto the mountain once more but this time accompanied by Ven
Ajahn Singh himself
We had stayed up there for nine days when he became ill and asked me to go down and bring back the rest of our party of monks
When we saw that taking care of him there wouldn't be convenient we all moved down to nurse him in the forest area of Nong Booa

Ven
Ajahn Mun sent a message at that time requesting that I go and meet him in the district of Tah Bor
I complied with those instructions and took my leave of Ven
Ajahn Singh and as it happened met up with Ven
Ajahn Mun and Ven
Ajahn Sao along the way
They had received an invitation from Wat Bodhisomphorn in the town of Udornthani
It was at this time that 'Grandmother' Noi came to take part in the consecration ceremony for the laying down of the boundary stones of Wat Bodhisomphorn
This was her first meeting with Ven
Ajahn Mun
She had been able to listen to one of his sermons and her faith in him began
I was able to stay there with Ven
Ajahn Mun for many days before we both set out for Tah Bor
During this Rains Retreat I resided near the village of Nah Chang Nam and not far from Tah Bor where Ven
Ajahn Mun was staying
Venerable Ajahn Oon and I conscientiously made the effort to go regularly to see him and listen to his Dhamma talks
This Rains Retreat I was again without any responsibilities except continuing with my own meditation practice
All other tasks such as receiving any guests I had handed over to Ven
Ajahn Oon
Previously he had been a teacher in the Mahaanikaya and a monk there for nine years having only recently transferred to the Dhammayut' Nikaya
During this Rains Retreat a sad event concerning Ven
Ajahn Tah took place
He was one of the more senior monks and I think I am right in saying he was also Ven
Ajahn Mun's very first disciple
I think he had been a monk for about sixteen or seventeen years
Originally he had gone to undertake studies in Bangkok but was unable to complete them
He had heard of Ven
Ajahn Mun's good reputation from the frequent extolling by Ven
Chao Khun Phra Upali and therefore left Bangkok to follow Ven
Ajahn Mun
This year Ven
Ajahn Tah had gone with Ven
Ajahn Khan to spend the Rains Retreat in the Pah Bing Cave in Loei Province
While there he had become unbalanced and had fled in the middle of the Retreat to see Venerable Ajahn Mun
Ven
Ajahn Tah said that he had committed the worst possible breach of the Monastic Discipline and that his distress was so intense that it felt as if his yellow robes were on fire
When a thorough inquiry into the circumstances and events in question was made there was evidently no truth in the matter at all
It was just his own exaggerated doubts and anxieties over some trivial incidents that had thrown him into turmoil
One of Ven
Ajahn Tah's tribulations concerned what had occurred some time previously when he had gone to develop his meditation near the village of Pone Sawang
His samadhi had become strong and this had brought great brightness to the mind
Any Dhamma issue that he brought up for investigation seemed to be totally cleared up and then the heart would converge to onepointedness
This made him believe that I have come to the end of the Holy Life
He later announced this claim in the midst of the community of monks
Afterwards when that bright condition of mind faded he began to suspect that he was guilty of boasting about obtaining supernormal states and had thus broken the monk's discipline in the worst possible way
Although people explained to him that there was definitely no offence because he had made his claim through mistaken assumptions and misinterpretations he wouldn't believe them
In fact this guiltridden anxiety had already caused him many years of distress but he had previously endured it
However with the arrival of this Rains Retreat it had become unbearable and he thought the only way left for him was to disrobe
Ven
Ajahn Mun was unable to cure him and so had to let him go sending him to stay with Ven
Ajahn Sao
Unfortunately the following year Ven
Ajahn Sao could no longer restrain him and the final result was that he did indeed disrobe
After that he completely vanished as if into thin air and no one has heard news of him right up to the present
Witnessing all this really made my heart sink and I felt downhearted and saddened
I reflected that if such a senior longpracticed monk could still become mentally unstable what about me
What could I do to avoid such unbalance
These thoughts made me so apprehensive and fearful for my own wellbeing that I revealed my anxieties to Ven
Ajahn Mun
He told me That's right
You have to be careful of yourself
Don't stay too far away from a competent and knowledgeable teacher
When something comes up then hurry to confer and consult with him
After the Rains Retreat had ended Ven
Ajahn Mun and his party set out to walk down towards Sakhon Nakorn
I had been thinking of my mother and so I returned home in order to assist her
I think I was successful in this respect for I recommended that she observe the Eight Precepts and dress in white
On this occasion my aunt uncle and my elder brother were also all inspired with faith and determined to keep the Eight Precepts and wear white
This was especially so with my elder brother for he left his wife and a newly born son of only a few months to ordain as a monk
I had them leave their village and follow the senior monks so that they could become better acquainted with Dhamma companions and receive training from many different meditation teachers
I followed along later with my brother and uncle catching up with them at the village of Plah Lo Phannah Nikom District where Ven
Ajahn Singh had spent the Rains Retreat
He led our group on to establish a temporary base near the village of Ahgaht Amnoy
Not long after our arrival there Ven
Ajahn Mun came to join us and he had me go on with him to set up a base near the village of Sahm Pong
Living in close association with such senior monks was very good for me
It forces one to be mindful and alert at all times
One day the novice who regularly attended on Ven
Ajahn Mun was absent so I took over his duties
One of these included going to sleep on the veranda of Ven
Ajahn Mun's hut
Venerable Ajahn Mun was usually awake and starting to meditate at three o'clock every morning
On waking he would immediately reach for a box of matches to light a candle and they would make a slight rattling noise
I felt obliged to be up before him each morning so that I could be quick enough to go into his room and attend to his needs
After sleeping there and doing this for many nights Ven
Ajahn Mun obviously began to think that it was unusual because he asked me Venerable Thate don't you ever sleep
I replied that I certainly did
The climate in Sahm Pong did not seem to agree with my health and constitution
Although I still had quite a good appetite I seemed to lack energy and my body continually ached and was stiff and sore all over
My meditation exertion however never faltered
After the meal I would go into the jungle to find a secluded spot to develop calm in solitude throughout the day
During the night time I would walk in meditation and then go up to listen to Ven
Ajahn Mun's Dhamma talk that lasted from eight until ten o'clock
If a large gathering of monks was present his Dhamma talk might not finish until midnight or two o'clock in the morning
Ven
Ajahn Mun always made sure that he kept up this way of teaching and training and it continually inspired his circle of dedicated disciples to be zealous in their meditation practice
After Venerable Ajahn Mun left that place Ven
Ajahn Sao took over for three years
I learned later that many monks who stayed on there had died
One was Ven
Ajahn Bhoomee who 'died' there only to recover
At the approach of the Rains Retreat I made my way back to the district of Ahgaht Amnoy and stayed just north of the town in a cremation ground
Meanwhile Ven
Ajahn Singh was spending the Rains Retreat to the south of that same district town
My elder brother my uncle mother and aunt with a nun from Pon Sawang Village all stayed together for the Rains Retreat
I was the sole monk although there was a novice by the name of Chuen who was from Tah Bor
My uncle died nearing the start of the Retreat which left just six of us
During this time there was an outbreak of smallpox among the townspeople
Almost all of them scattered and fled into the surrounding fields and forests to escape the infection
Even the resident monks of the local monastery followed the same route as the lay people leaving virtually nobody behind who could offer alms for us to eat
This occurred because the residents of Ahgaht Amnoy had never experienced an epidemic of smallpox before
It was a town of more than a thousand households and only as few as five people had contracted smallpox
However those who became infected pretended to be healthy to escape detection and by the time they were found out the disease was already well advanced
The procedure for anyone found with symptoms was to move them away into the forest
They were quarantined there in a small bamboo hut built for them while food was sent out for them to eat
It was indeed a happy chance that Ven
Ajahn Singh had some knowledge of forest herbs
He was thereby able to bring out some medicinal herbs to use in treating the disease and could tell the townspeople not to cast their sick away in the jungle
The result was that only a few people actually died
When news reached the authorities they came and inoculated everyone
We were remarkably fortunate that the townspeople retained their deep respect for meditation monks
This meant that although the town had been completely abandoned they would still stealthily come back in at four or five o'clock in the morning to prepare rice to put into the monks' bowls
When we went on alms round they would come out to offer food and then rush off back into the forest
I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks and appreciation for the generosity of the townspeople of Ahgaht Amnoy
Such merit and goodwill go beyond life itself for they form a true refuge for the suffering people of this world and the next
When we suffer if we can't rely on our virtue and past good deeds what can we depend upon
The people of Ahgaht Amnoy were more afraid of smallpox than the tigers of the surrounding jungle
Even neighbours and relatives wouldn't speak to each other
I asked them when they would start talking together again and they told me it would still be quite some time after the end of the Rains Retreat in January or February
During this Rains Retreat I often went to listen to Ven
Ajahn Singh's Dhamma talks
This meant that I had to walk through Ahgaht Amnoy town and then on for a farther three kilometres
I received a Dhamma talk from Ven
Ajahn Singh that really shook me up
Perhaps he was making a show of it to unsettle me or was it just that he didn't understand my true character
It's difficult to say
He said that I had an obstinate and unyielding sort of character that I was stubborn and unwilling to accept anyone else
While he was saying this I focussed my mind to check out how it was within my heart
I really did have the utmost respect and reverence for Ven
Ajahn Singh and therefore was always ready to receive his teachings and instructions
Yet why did he say such things about me
Still what he said about me  my not easily acquiescing to others  was certainly true
I had always been that sort of person finding anything that seemed illogical or unreasonable difficult to accept
My own opinions were subjected to the same careful checking and if they didn't measure up or lacked foundation I would be absolutely intractable in not accepting them
That's how I was

I sat there listening to Venerable Ajahn Singh's Dhamma talk and also examining the state of my own mind
It caused an audacious boldness to spring up like pouring fuel on a fire to put it out
I seemed to glide on the way back to the monastery feeling so light because my mind was fully engaged on that point
That night I redoubled my efforts in meditation thinking that
Here I am
I've been trying with my meditation practice as far as this
And yet why is it that I can't identify the defilements that must definitely be present right there in my heart while another person can turn around and know about them before me
This is really humiliating
Ven
Ajahn Singh is a human being born of mother and father nourished by mother's milk and weaned through spoon feeding
Just like me and yet he can perceive the defilements within me better than I can myself
Here today if I can't fathom out my own defilements then I should die in the attempt
When I actually got down to my meditation practice nothing in particular seemed to happen
I did however examine Ven
Ajahn Singh's assessments and the way he had used them  as he was supposed to  in giving his Dhamma talk and concluded Even if I'm not as he seems to think I am I can but continue to purify myself for in the end no one else can know better than I can myself
With that my heart became tranquil and unperturbed
My accelerated exertions brought upset to the bodily 'humors' making me feel that I should lie down and rest
However I couldn't really get to sleep for as I started to doze off I experienced what the country folk call a peeum
Everyone knows about this phenomenon so there is no need to describe it fully here
The important question remained whether or not the pee or spirit of the pee um actually exists
That night I was able to search out the truth in many ways
At first it felt as if some huge looming black form came forward and seated itself on my chest so that I couldn't breathe
My heart nearly gave out in the struggle to regain consciousness
Some people assert that the spirits of all the creatures that one killed reside in one's thumbs
Resting the hands on one's chest during sleep therefore allows the spirits to come out and suffocate one
So I now removed my hands from my chest and stretched them down by my sides
Nevertheless it came back and suffocated me again 'Hey what's happening here
Could it possibly be because I'm sleeping on my back' I turned over and lay on my side to see what would happen and the suffocating sensation came on again
This time the suffocating pressure was such that it felt as if I would smother and die
I therefore turned to focus on the condition of those about to die
The first time I directed mindfulness so that it was keeping closely aware of the mind following it to know what happens at death
Mindfulness stayed with the heart right up to the final moment when only the barest awareness remained
A feeling was present that to release that faint degree of awareness would be death
At this point the question became whether it would be better for me to let go and allow death to take place
I felt that my heart was currently quite pure and that if I were to let go I wouldn't lose because of it
Although there also remained a delicate feeling that expressed the thought that 'rather than letting go and die by remaining alive I could continue to be of benefit to other people
If it were all to finish here with my death then it could only be to my own purely personal advantage
Also people wouldn't know the full circumstances and causes of this death
If that's the case it's certainly better not to let myself die' I therefore attempted to wiggle and move my hands and feet until I came around
The second time it happened I saw no bodily form but rather an enormous dark mass that loomed over me
I knew now for certain that it wasn't a ghost
The cause seemed more connected with the 'elemental winds' driving upwards
After trying to move my hands and feet it all cleared up
When it happened for a third time it seemed less intense than before
It was more of a drowsy state and I just determined to get up
For all my readers in this situation notice your state when you regain consciousness
There should be a heavyheaded dullness and lassitude present
At this point if you don't take any medicine to balance these 'winds' before going back to sleep it will happen again
In my own case I've always found that the best and only cure is by smelling borneol crystals
At this same period I tried to uncover and understand the condition that exists during the state of sleep
As a rule we are never aware of the actual moment of falling asleep
It's only upon waking that we come to know that we fell asleep
Before we fall asleep there will be the state of tiredness weakness and drowsy dullness of body and mind
The chains of thinking processes become shorter and eventually all awareness of thoughtobjects is released and we quickly enter what they call sleep
When we bring in mindfulness to focus on the current condition of that final moment before sleep we will find that there is only the barest awareness left
It's almost impossible to fix on it while no mentalobjects are left at all
Only the most delicate mindfulness remains present to follow and watch the current condition of the mind arising in that moment
It is like when the mind drops into bhavanga
If at this point we don't wish to allow sleep to take over an effort has to be made to look out for a single mental or emotional object
This can then be subjected and held to and taken up for thoughtprocessing
As a result the mind will brighten up and be refreshed free from all fatigue and drowsiness
It will also have the beneficial effect equal to having slept for four or five hours
On the other hand if we wish to sleep this is achieved by letting go of that final remaining trace of mindfulness and sleep will come with ease and comfort
This way is especially good because one only sleeps for a very short period so there is no wasting of time
It won't last for more than five or ten minutes
If you have actually established and focussed mindfulness as I have been explaining you can rest assured that you won't be asleep for more than five minutes
If rather than going to sleep you just want to rest body and mind go and find a suitably quiet and peaceful place to rest in
It can either be somewhere completely secluded or among other people
Lie down stretch out relax and be comfortable without tensing any part of the body
Then settle the mind on a single object in that condition of letting go
Let it just remain alone in emptiness for a while and on getting up you will feel in all respects as if you had been sleeping for four or five hours
This word sleep
In truth the mind doesn't sleep
It is rather that the body rests without having to make any movements
Even those who enter the high state of meditation called the attainment of cessation can't be said to have gone into a state of sleep
This is really the state where the meditator supervises the heart with mindfulness to fix it on one mental object
That object steadily becomes ever more refined  as does mindfulness and the heart  until all feelings and thoughts completely cease due to the strength of the meditator's skilled practice
Mindfulness no longer has anything to do and so fades out completely
Although bodily breathing continues it has become so subtle and refined that one can hardly say whether it exists or not
In fact it does exist but it no longer appears to move through the nose
One can compare it to an external breeze that while present is not enough to manifest in the stirring and fluttering of leaves
No one could then assert that no windbreath exists for if there is no windbreath there's no air and then all livingbreathing beings in this world would be dead
The Lord Buddha called this 'entering the attainment of cessation' for at this point the nervous system of the six sense doors will not receive any contact
This however is different from the state of sleep
When asleep something may very well impinge on the senses so that one immediately wakes up
The attainment of cessation requires sufficient practice and preparation of heart so that it becomes competent and skilled
After attaining this state many wondrous things can occur
It's not possible to hurt the meditator who has entered into this state  even if someone set him on fire it would never touch him
On the other hand after entering Nibbana the body can indeed disintegrate
The meditator can withdraw from the attainment of cessation through the power of a previously made determination
When they reach the determined time the breath will gently start to become progressively coarser and coarser until all the bodily functions have reverted to their previously normal state
Attainment of cessation is not Nibbana but a state of absorption
This is because absorption lacks the rightview wisdom that can investigate the root causes of the defilements such as those of the Sense Sphere and the Finematerial Sphere
This is rather the domain of insightknowledge and rightknowledge and realization of the Path
All the absorptions are only instruments of encouragement and support that smooth the Way and enhance energy
Thus before the Lord Buddha's Final Passing Away he entered and progressed up through the various levels of absorption
He then returned to the Fourth Absorption which forms the foundation for insight and entered Nibbana from there
That was between the Sense Sphere and the Finematerial Sphere for that forms the base for the supramundane dhamma
The question might arise here So
Why is this old monk going on about the attainment of cessation about Nibbana and states of absorption
Has he reached and realized these states or not The doubter might answer himself with Can't one say that this is really a matter of boasting about attaining to supramundane states
In truth anyone who attains to the cessation of perception and feeling or to Path Fruit and Nibbana or to the absorption of the attainment of cessation does not make the assumption that 'I have reached entered or reside in such a state'
There is simply a proficiency with the necessary skillful means that leads to and connects with them
Just when the meditator is about to enter such a state any remaining assumptions and suppositions about 'I' will bring him up short
Otherwise the average sort of person everywhere intelligent and knowledgeable about the Teachings and the Discipline they could all go off together and attain to the Path and Fruit and Nibbana to the absorption of the attainment of cessation
The whole town the whole country would all be doing the same
At the moment of realizing such states there is no hope of making up assumptions and formulations about them
Only after transcending those conditions can one recollect and systematically check back over their successive stages and development
Once having worked it out one will then be able to formulate and set out all aspects of these states
It's not always necessary for the person who explains about these things to have actually reached those levels
When the Teachings have been set down and their essential meaning established one has to explain about it to the best of one's own understanding
Sometimes this will be done correctly and sometimes it will be mistaken
If things had not been worked out in this way how could the Teachings of the Lord Buddha have endured and continued down to the present day
People listen yet even though they all may be listening to the same theme to the same points many will understand in quite different ways from different angles
Furthermore those meditators who have attained to exactly the same stage via an identical technique will still find that their individual skill and ingenuity are quite different
This is why the Dhamma that one sees by and for oneself is so wondrous and amazing and why it's so difficult to achieve
So why do you come along finding fault and only condemning me
It's simply not fair
Please excuse this digression into the nether realms
Now let us return to my autobiography
With the end of the Rains Retreat Ven
Ajahn Singh led our party to the village of Sahm Pong
It was the customary practice for us all to gather and pay our respects to the Ven
Ajahn Mun
On our way there I related to Ven
Ajahn Singh all my recent experiences and thoughts about the peeum and sleep
He made no response at all remaining quite silent
When we arrived however he proceeded to relate this matter to Ven
Ajahn Mun
At that moment I was sitting a little apart from them so I don't know what he said about my experiences  I couldn't hear
I thought that probably it was all considered inconsequential and beside the point not being connected with the practice of the Noble Path
He therefore didn't pursue it any further as he might have done with other issues
Almost one hundred monks and novices gathered to pay their respects to the Venerable Elders and Senior Ajahns and it was considered quite an event for those times
After it was over Ven
Ajahn Mun had me with one other monk and a novice accompany him to the village of Kah Non Daeng
This was where the Ven
Ajahn Oon Ven
Ajahn Goo and Ven
Ajahn Fan had spent the Rains Retreat
We stayed there for three days and Ven
Ajahn Mun related to the group about my practice with sleeping and notsleeping
Everyone remained silent without comment
This was particularly so with Ven
Ajahn Oon who previously had discussed this very topic with me when I was still unable to do it
During the time that Ven
Ajahn Mun resided at the forest monastery of Sahm Pong he would give daily Dhamma talks
If anyone was feeling despondent or irresolute or someone had fallen ill he directed his talk like this
So then it isn't fear of death that you have but a desire to die many times 
As soon as Ven
Ajahn Mun departed no one was left in the monastery to continue to give Dhamma talks
The morale and strength of heart of his disciples thereby drained away and no one was able to carry on living there
The 'air' at that monastery was particularly inhospitable and it was plagued with malarial fever
Everyone with poor health or weak constitution would be struck down with fever
The whole resident community of monks eventually followed along behind us
They said that it was so bad that they couldn't continue to live there any longer and that the air of Sahm Pong monastery was so heavy and oppressive that it made them feel drowsy and lethargic all day long
When this group of monks caught up with us again Ven
Ajahn Mun made an observation about our ranging farther afield through secluded places so that we could spread the Dhamma even more widely
He continued by pointing out that we had already traveled throughout much of the three or four provinces of this region
These were Sakhon Nakorn Udornthani Nongkhai and Loei
He queried us about which provinces would be best to head for
The majority were for going down towards Ubon Province
But Ven
Ajahn Mun himself was not really satisfied with this suggestion because suitable jungle mountains and caves were hard to find in that region
However if there was a consensus for going there then he wouldn't object
Having come to this collective decision we made ready to set off traveling in small groups
It was necessary for me to accompany my mother on her journey back home and so I was not able to go with Ven
Ajahn Mun
It was on this trip that Ven
Ajahn Mun and his party encountered major upheavals
There were both good and bad results from this
The good side was an increase in the number of forest monasteries for Kammatthana forest monks which up to then had not existed at all
This was the occasion when forest monks for the first time permanently settled Ubon Province
From that time forward it has continued to spread out until today there are monasteries with Dhammayut' monks in virtually every district
The negative side was the deterioration in the quality of the monks' practice
In fact the decline this time was unprecedented until Ven
Ajahn Mun was finally obliged to turn away from the community there and leave for Chiang Mai Province
I returned to spend the Rains Retreat for a second time at Nah Chang Nam Village
Meanwhile my elder brother went for the Rains to Nah Seedah Village with our father
After the Retreat had ended I took my brother and we went to develop our meditation practice in the cave called Phra Nah Phak Hork
Sometime after this my brother went back down to find Venerable Ajahn Sao who had spent the Rains Retreat in Nakorn Panom Province
It was after this Rains Retreat that my brother went forth as a monk at Wat Srii Thep
I brought my father to come and stay with me in the Phra Nah Phak Hork Cave
It was the first time in the eleven years since his ordination into white robes that he had come to spend the Rains Retreat with me
Furthermore I had never stayed for the Rains so close to my home village as I did that year
I consider that it was an especially fortunate year for it gave me the opportunity to support my father in the way of Dhamma practice
He developed his meditation to the best of his ability and achieved excellent results
So much so that he was forced to exclaim that it was the first time since his birth that he had begun to experience deeply the flavor of Dhamma
He could sit in meditation for as long as three or four hours at a time
I was delighted to have fulfilled my aspirations by being of aid and assistance to him
Yet when circumstances come together and the time is ripe untoward things can come upon us
That is to say my father fell ill
His children and grandchildren saw only the hardship of his situation  when intense pain came during the night time who would look after him
For there were only the two of us father and son staying up in the cave
So the family came and carried him off down to the village so that they could attend to him there
He refused however to go back to stay in the village monastery where he had been before
Instead he had them set him up in his shack in the middle of the rice fields
I often went down to encourage his constant attention towards Dhamma
That was the year when something quite miraculous arose connected with my father
The rice seedlings in the villagers' fields of that whole area were in very poor condition despite the moderately good rainfall
All the stems had turned a reddish color with the startling exception of those in the patch surrounding my father's shack
These were a lush green and were so remarkable that the village people began to say that 'Father White Robe' would not survive the year
And this indeed proved to be the case
On that particular day I had gone to instruct my father
I had reminded him of Dhamma and offered him strategies to use in his meditation and investigations until he seemed quite pleased and contented
He still seemed quite strong and fit so at the approach of night I made my way back up to the Nah Phak Hork Cave
He passed away in the middle of that night possessed of mindfulness and a peaceful state of mind right up to the final breath
At dawn they came to get me and I arranged that his funeral and cremation rites were properly completed that same day
He passed away in August at the age of seventyseven having been ordained a white robe devotee for eleven years
I had been living by myself in the cave before my father came to join me and after his death I found myself alone again
To have the opportunity for this sort of solitude is rare and I determined in my heart to make the most of it 'In the same way as someone offers flowers in reverence to the Buddha  may my life may the flesh and blood of this body may the tasks and duties I undertake may they all become my offering and puuja to the Triple Gem'
Thus resolved I got down to intensifying my meditation practice with strength and determination
I established and set mindfulness within the heart not allowing any thoughts or imaginings to be directed outside
Everything was to remain wholly within an inner calm and stillness all day and all night
The setting of mindfulness before sleep should be the same on awakening
Sometimes it even happened that although I was asleep and aware of the fact I was unable to get up
It took some effort on my part to move the body and by that come back to waking consciousness again
My own understanding at that time was that the stilled onepointed heart didn't allow thoughts to careen away externally and so would definitely be able to transcend every bit of suffering
I thought that wisdom's only function was to purge the outwanderings of the heart and return it to a state of stillness
I therefore did not try to use wisdom in an examination of for example the body and sense impressions and so failed to come to an understanding about body and heart
These are still interrelated and interdependent and whenever any material or mental object comes into contact in whatever way there must inevitably be disturbance
This causes the stilled and settled mind to be shaken up and agitated following the influence of the defilements
I applied myself to walking meditation until my feet were split and bloody
Then I came down with a fever that persisted throughout the Rains Retreat but I wasn't going to slacken off my meditation efforts
I had once read accounts of some Eldermonks in times gone by who had walked in meditation until their feet had split and broken
However I had found this quite hard to believe
I had supposed that the use here of this particular verb 'broken' suggested that their feet had been pounding down and striking against some hard object which is what caused the abrasions
Walking with circumspection along a smooth and level meditation path  what was there to knock against
Actually the same Pali word is used to render both 'broken' and 'worn through' or 'perforated'
A monk is described as sick through several causes arising from kamma from season from bile disorders from clashing with external things and arising from striving in meditation
It was only then that I realized that my meditation exertions performed with a mind of such zealous energy were lacking in wisdom
Yet there I was living alone without a competent Dhamma companion to give me advice
To be only bold and daring in one's striving while the heart lags behind in wisdom is not so good
This was what caused my fever
When the Rains Retreat was over I retraced my steps and went to find my brother and the Ven
Ajahn Sao in Nakorn Panom
I went because I had been separated from all my Dhamma companions and meditation teachers for more than two years
Ever since Ven
Ajahn Sao and Ven
Ajahn Mun and company had left Tah Bor District I had been the sole monk of our group to remain in the area
At that time Luang Dtah Mun of Kor Village had come to spend the Rains Retreat at Nah Seedah the village where I was born
He was the sort of character that liked to travel around disputing with less knowledgeable monks
He would challenge them with his supposed mastery of the religion and was ready to debate with anyone and beat them hollow
Even all those forest meditation monks he said when they see me coming they duck away
Just look for yourself none of them can cope and they have all fled through their fear of me
The only one left now is this 'Mister Thate' but in a few days he'll be on his way too
After continually hearing things like this nobody could be bothered to speak to him anymore
If they did try they couldn't get a word in edgeways for he always had to be 'the only one to get it right'
It was during that Rains Retreat that a dispute arose between him and the monks in the monastery of Glahng Yai Village
These monks surreptitiously approached me with an invitation to come down from the cave to clear up and settle the conflict
As soon as I arrived he reversed his position and dropped the quarrel
Yet he repeated this kind of dispute and prevarication so often that all the local monks were totally disgusted with him
Perhaps one can use the Southern Thai phrase 'he had gone crazy for fame and celebrity'
They no longer bothered getting involved with him for any discussion was becoming clearly pointless
Then came the final day of the Rains Retreat the Pavarana Day
This is a traditional time for ceremonial offerings so they went and invited Luang Dtah Mun to come and join in the sermongiving
Likewise they came and invited me although they didn't mention that to him
By the time I got to the village there wasn't a person to be seen for they were all already waiting for me at the village monastery
This was unusual for on a normal day when they knew I was coming all the villagers tended to come out and wait lining both sides of the road
Some people would even call out and make quite a commotion so that I became reluctant to walk through Glahng Yai Village
When Luang Dtah Mun's sermon was over I convened a meeting of all the gathered monks to discuss the points he had brought up
He had said that chanting our praise to the Buddha by starting with Araham is wrong that as we ourselves were not arahants we couldn't pay reverence to them
He gave his logic and reasons for this and said that one must begin the recitation with Namo and then continue with Namo Arahato Sammaa Sambuddhassa
I pointed out to him that this formula pays homage to Arahato in just the same way so perhaps Luang Dtah Mun  following his own logic  is already an arahant and enlightened
It was at this point that Luang Dtah Mun exploded with anger and said If I wasn't an arahant I certainly wouldn't carry on being a monk like this and would have disrobed and gone home to sleep with my wife 
His language continued with more crudities and was offensive to everyone listening
I therefore came back and questioned what gauge he used in his assumptions about his own arahantship
He answered that 'to look at the earth' was the measuring standard
I replied that anyone could perceive the earth even grazing cattle bent their heads and looked at the earth from morn 'till night  that must make them all arahants
This Luang Dtah has boasted of having attained to supernormal states As soon as I had said this he was shocked and struck dumb unable to say anything at all
I went on to refer to many issues
I announced for instance that if it was true that he had continually disputed with and challenged the local monks and the forest meditation monks he should speak out now
But he absolutely refused to speak
By this time it was almost evening and the monks were preparing for the Pavarana Ceremony
Luang Dtah Mun went into the Uposatha Hall to join in the ceremony but the monks refused to allow him to take part and he therefore had to return to Nah Seedah Village alone
On that day most of the village had come to the monastery and nobody had been left behind to watch over the houses
Even the district headman who had never previously set foot in a monastery came that day
After that he continued with regular attendance for the rest of his life
I didn't immediately return to the cave that evening but went to sleep at the village monastery in Nah Seedah
Luang Dtah Mun came to see me panting and gasping for breath almost unable to put words together
He was sulking and felt so slighted that he was going to flee that very night
He said he was too ashamed and embarrassed to face people and had to leave
I requested him to think again and at least stay until the morning saying that I had no ill will towards him and had only been speaking according to truth and reason
But he couldn't sleep all night and at the crack of dawn went off to see the District Chief Monk and requested permission to disrobe
Although it had been only one day the news of what had happened had already spread
The Chief Monk already knew about it and therefore told him that permission was not needed and for him just to go ahead and disrobe
He then went to the village of Kor to ask permission from his former Dhamma Studies teacher but he too knew about the situation and likewise told him that permission wasn't necessary and to go ahead and take the robes off
Finally he did disrobe and quietly locked himself away in his former wife's bedroom
It was many days before he dared show his face again
I've included these rather ancillary episodes in this autobiography to make it more comprehensive
After relating those more tangential stories I now want to get back to essential matters
Luang Dteea Tong In was originally from Korat Province of the village of Koke Jor Hor
He moved to run a business in Tah Bor where he became a prosperous and prominent merchant well known throughout the area
He and his wife were both pious Buddhists and the people of Tah Bor came to know about the keeping of the lay precepts through his influence
Luang Dteea Tong In donated an orchard to establish a monastery and named it 'Wat Ambavan'  the Mango Grove Monastery  which incorporated both their names his wife's being 'Am' and his 'In'
Both eventually ordained as monk and whiterobed nun for four or five years
Later he became ill with some disease that caused his body to swell up and this confined him to bed
Each year Luang Dteea Tong In's children would gather to make merit and offer gifts to enhance his recovery
It so happened that they invited me to participate in the ceremony even though I had never set eyes on him before
At that time I had five Rains as a monk and he had seven making him senior to me by two years
Luang Dteea Tong In told me that his condition made him feel as if he were already dead
I replied when the person's dead that's good
He went on to say that he was not concerned about anything that he had set his heart solely on the Four Paths Four Fruits and One Nibbana
I told him that if such aspirations were still present he certainly couldn't yet be dead for deadmen didn't have any desires
At this he was taken aback and responded by asking If I'm not to have any aspirations what would you have me do
I told him to meditate using Buddho as his only object of attention
By this time I noticed that downstairs was already full of monks so I quickly completed my part of the ceremony and went down allowing the monks from other monasteries to carry on with the proceedings
Early the following morning someone came to invite me to go and see Luang Dteea who had something that he wanted to tell me
I said just to wait a few moments for as soon as I had eaten my meal I would be on my way
On arriving there he swiftly related to me his wonderful experience
Ajahn I really had a strange experience last night
The roosters normally crow 'cockadoodledoo' but last night it wasn't like that at all
Instead they said 'yourmindisonepointed' 'yourmindis onepointed
sounds can manifest in such a way
Ajahn he added before the gecko lizards always cried 'gecko gecko' but last night they said 'you'realreadyold' 'you'realreadyold' I reassured him that that was correct and that he should now be determined to further develop his meditation by making the heart well established and steady throughout the day and night
He should not allow any distractedness or carelessness to arise and he would then be ready and prepared for death
Some days later a lay man came to request that I immediately go and see Luang Dteea for he was about to disrobe
I was shocked
What on earth could this be about
Why ever would he want to disrobe just as he was becoming proficient in meditation
I told the layman to ask him to wait and not to disrobe right away that as soon as my meal was finished I would go and see him
His hut had two sets of balustrades and so when I arrived there I opened the outer gate and entered while one of the boys helping to nurse him opened the next gate for me
His hearing my approach proved enough to dispel all his misgivings as if they were plucked away
Luang Dteea explained to me what had happened
He said I related to my daughter all my various meditation experiences just as I had told them to you
Then it hit me  Oh no
 I am guilty of the worst sort of offence by boasting of supernormal attainments to her
I became so anxious and distressed by this that I thought I would have to disrobe
But as soon as I heard the sound of your arrival all that agitation evaporated
So I won't be disrobing now
I explained to Luang Dteea that it certainly wasn't a case of claiming supernormal attainments for he had not acted from a desire for praise or gain or fame
He had spoken to exchange Dhamma understanding and therefore there was no offence
Later I started to think back to my meditation teachers and became concerned about my long  two year  absence from them
So I took my leave of him and went off to Nakorn Panom to visit Ven
Ajahn Sao
Ven
Ajahn Sao generally did not give formal Dhamma sermons and when he did it would be more in the way of a Dhamma consultation
My going to stay with him that year meant that there would be another monk available to assist him
Ven
Ajahn Toom was already resident there so the two of us could contribute our energy in assisting Ven
Ajahn Sao in teaching and instructing the lay community
It was this year when I begged Ven
Ajahn Sao to consent to have his photograph taken as a memento
At first he did not want to but I pleaded and gave him reasons so that eventually he did acquiesce
I pointed out how essential it would be for his disciples and those of future generations always to have an opportunity to 'focus' on him and pay their respects
Previously he would have had nothing to do with that sort of thing so this was indeed quite a unique happening
Even so I was concerned that he would change his mind and so I had to act quickly
I therefore crossed over the River Mekong into Laos to bring back a photographer to take the picture
I was delighted at having been able to photograph Ven
Ajahn Sao and I gave copies to Ven
Chao Khun Dhammachedi and Phra Khru Siilasamban
The photograph of Ven
Ajahn Sao that I arranged at this time appears to have been the only one ever taken
Ven
Ajahn Mun was much the same
He always refused to allow photographs to be taken of him for mementos or keepsakes
I had frequently beseeched him to do so but he would reply that the money would be better spent 'buying some cakes for the dogs'
Yet when I persisted with my pleas and pointed out my reasons he finally relented
This was to be for the benefit of the following generations who would now have a picture of him to pay reverence and respect to
After the Rains Retreat Ven
Ajahn Sao went wandering ranging over on the other side of the River Mekong and going to stay in the Som Poi Cave
This was the cave where he and Ven
Ajahn Mun had gone off together when they first went forth in search of solitude
It was a large cavern with a whole series of chambers and many interconnecting passages
There was also a special cabinet for holding the Pali Scriptures but it was bare of books
I followed him there but by the time I arrived he had already left going on to stay in another cave
This was the Tiger's Cave which was quite far away along torturously winding paths through circuitous labyrinthine double ranges of mountains
A tigress had come and given birth to her cubs below the cave where Ven
Ajahn Sao was living
That is why they called it the Tiger's Cave
About forty metres above there was an elongated cavern extending right through the mountain to the far side
The local villagers said that it needed the lighting of five successive dtaitorches before one emerged at the other end
Ven
Ajahn Sao lived in the mouth of this cave with a couple of monks and novices
There was also an old man who had accompanied them so that he could attend on Ven
Ajahn Sao
This old man used to light a fire at the entrance to the cave where he slept
In the middle of one night he heard a loud wailing sound but couldn't see anything when he got up to look
This puzzled him so at dawn he walked around to inspect the spot from where the sound had come
He came across paw prints  a tiger had been standing there
It had probably wanted to enter the cave but on seeing a person lying there had gone back
Both side walls of this cave were completely smooth making it look something like the interior of a railway carriage
Water dripped down from stalactites into a pool deeper inside the cave and the monks could collect this for drinking
There was no need to filter it because it didn't contain any living creatures
One monk took me in to survey the inner reaches of the cave and our inspection lasted as long as it took half a wax candle to burn down
It was really pleasant without any feeling of oppressive stuffiness
The nearest village was about a kilometer away
I stayed there with the Ven
Ajahn Sao for two nights before walking back
I heard news that during World War II a company of Japanese soldiers had established a hidden camp inside these caves
When the Americans received intelligence reports about this they went in and bombed the caves
A bomb landed on the cave entrance sealing it off and causing the many Japanese inside to perish
No one has ever gone and excavated the site
How tragic that is  we have so devalued and wasted human life
As the Rains Retreat was approaching Ven
Ajahn Sao sent me to reside for the Rains at the village of Nah Sai while Ven
Ajahn Poomee went to stay near Nah Kee Rin Village
This was in response to invitations from the lay devotees in both these places
During this Rains Retreat my health was not at all good but I refused to become discouraged or lax in my meditation exertions
I was so resolved that I would willingly have sacrificed my life as an offering to the Triple Gem
It made me reflect upon the threats and hazards that might lie ahead for both me and for Buddhism overall
Would the order of monks I belong to be able to continue throughout
There might be political disorder or perhaps enemy forces would invade the country
I might end up conscripted into the army and if not that then the nation could be enslaved under foreign domination
How could I remain a monk under such circumstances
Even if I could carry on conditions wouldn't be conducive to the practice of Dhamma and the monk's Rule
So what was I to do
Furthermore although we now have many competent meditation teachers when old age sickness and death have taken their toll who then will be guide and leader to the group of monks on this path of Dhamma practice
The radiant light of the Lord Buddha's Dhamma can only become increasingly dim'
Such ponderings filled me with sadness and depression so that I felt sorry for both myself and the future state of Buddhism
It seemed as if such a state of affairs was just around the corner just a couple of days away
The more I thought of it the more lonely and despondent I felt
Having arrived at this junction I turned my thoughts to my present situation
The current state of national and political affairs was still good and stable
Meditation Masters were still present and I had already received much training and instruction from them
Having such an opportunity I felt I must hurry and accelerate my meditation practice
Eventually I would be able to understand the Lord Buddha's teachings and come to selfreliance
Whatever the future might then bring whatever obstacles might arise either for me personally or for the general state of Buddhism I wouldn't lose out
As soon as I had come up with this skillful approach my heart became resolute and ardent in its meditation exertion
During the Rains Retreat although I could not actually sit in meditation due to my illness and had to concentrate more on using walking meditation as the main posture it didn't affect my earnestness
After the Rains Retreat came news that Ven
Ajahn Singh's group together with Venerable Maha Pin had returned from Ubon and had gone on to Khon Kaen
As I wished to go and pay my respects to both of them I took leave of Ven
Ajahn Sao and set out
This was the same year that the government issued a proclamation officially prohibiting spirit worship and other animist and occult beliefs
It urged people instead to take refuge in the Triple Gem
The provincial authorities had accordingly mobilized Ven
Ajahn Singh and his group of monks to help in taming the demons and spirits
When I arrived I found that I too became somewhat involved in this
I had organized the villagers of Phra Kreur Village in the relocating of their monastery from the bank of the village stream to a small rise in the fields on the edge of the Bahn Aew Mong Lake
Afterwards Ven
Ajahn Maha Pin came to join me in spending the Rains Retreat there
The other senior monks resident there for the Rains included Ven
Ajahn Poomee Ven
Ajahn Gong Mah myself and Ven
Ajahn Maha Pin as the headmonk
Throughout this Rains Retreat I regularly helped Ven
Ajahn Maha Pin by taking on some teaching responsibilities and sometimes receiving visitors
Every Observance Day all the monks novices and visiting lay people would apply themselves to the development of their meditation as best they could in line with their individual abilities
One has to say that they did achieve very satisfactory results
Some lay people meditated and came to see many different and diverse things so that they became absorbed in the meditation and forgot all about their homes and families
After the Rains Retreat Ven
Ajahn Poomee and his party of monks together with me took our leave of Ven
Ajahn Maha Pin
We went off in search of seclusion in the direction of Jote Nong Bua Bahn Village in the district of Kantaravichai of Mahasarakam Province
At first we were invited to stay next to the school of Nong Waeng Village
While there we could give some Dhamma talks and instruction to the populace until the lay devotees from Jote Nong Bua Bahn Village came and requested us to return to their village
Eventually the site at Nong Waeng became a permanent monastery
This time when we returned to Jote Nong Bua Bahn Village we set ourselves up in some dense jungle by the side of the Dtork Paen Lake
During this period numerous people came for training in meditation including many white robed nuns and lay men keeping Eight Precepts
Some of these people achieved quite astonishing results in their meditation
They would sit in meditation in the monastery and know that back in the village their children or grandchildren had been bickering and abusing each other
Those who could meditate would succeed marvellously
There were also some who couldn't meditate and only took the Precepts because that was what their friends had done
One day one monk saw a vision when he was meditating
It concerned a certain young nun who seemed to approach wishing to touch his feet
I sent for the nun in question and instructed her about the need to perceive the harm in all sensuality because it was what would become a cause for suffering
I pointed out that physical form is the basis for innumerable attachments
This eventually enabled the nun to accept and understand the situation yet she certainly must have wondered how I knew about it
At the approach of the Rains Retreat Ven
Ajahn Singh directed that I go and spend the Rains in Phon District
Ven
Ajahn Poomee was to take over from where I was staying by Dtork Paen Lake
Venerable Gate my elder brother came to stay with me during this Rains Retreat
The teaching and instruction of lay people continued as normal while my personal meditation practice and that of the resident monks and novices kept up a steady pace
An extraordinary incident did occur however concerning a woman sorceress
She had ten or more disciples and she traveled around making a living by attending to the 'sick'
I advised her to forsake her spiritworship and to come and firmly establish herself in the Triple Gem
Her belief in spirits I pointed out is based in wrong view and lacks virtue and merit whereas going for refuge to the Triple Gem really is something of merit and wholesomeness
A person can then also be counted as a devotee with right view in the Buddhist Teachings
She replied that 'what she had was good' and that when some spirit mediumistically possessed her she could be directed to find buried treasure or enabled to leap into a clump of thorny bamboo without being gashed
I responded that that might be all very well for believers but spirits had never taught their devotees to abandon evil and cultivate good or to keep the Precepts
The only instructions they ever gave were for the person to make them an offering of the head of a pig or a chicken or duck
After having prompted this animal sacrifice they didn't even eat it
One has to kill the animal oneself and offer it to the spirits and when they don't come and eat it then one has to eat it oneself
The spirits will not have to accept the responsibility and the evil consequences of such killing it will all come back on the one who kills
In what way are these spirits supposed to help us
After the Lord Buddha had finally passed away he wasn't reborn as a spirit
He bequeathed his Teachings that taught people to relinquish evil and cultivate what is good for that is both for their own benefit and for the benefit of others
The Sangha conveys those Teachings to us all according to the path laid down by the Buddha
We have thus been able to know what is wholesome or unwholesome what is virtuous or harmful right up to these present times
The teaching of spirits is not like that
The sorceress made up her mind and agreed to abandon her spirit worship and dedicate herself to the Triple Gem
That night she put the teaching I had given her into practice and obtained marvellous results
That is before going to bed she chanted her devotions to the Triple Gem and then sat in meditation
She then saw two spiritchildren a girl and a boy
They were swinging on the hand rail of the rice mill pounder at the bottom of the stairs leading up to her house
They didn't say or do anything at all
This vision was as vivid as if it were happening before her very eyes but they were actually closed in meditation
She then became convinced that the spirits could no longer come and take possession of her and that the protecting virtue and power of the Triple Gem was indeed great
Her husband was also a medicine man and was so devoted to his own powers that he refused to acknowledge and raise his hands in añjali to Buddhist monks
Before entering a monastery he would raise high his foot instead
By strictly following his teacher's rules he did indeed become invulnerable
One could slash or stab or hit him without being able to inflict any injury on him
That same night however he was unable to get to sleep
Whenever he started to doze off he would be startled awake and become fearful as if something threatening was near
Consequently in the morning he asked his wife whether she had received anything 'special' when she had gone to see the Ajahn because he hadn't been able to sleep all night long
His wife confirmed that the Ajahn had indeed given her something 'special' and that she would take her husband to see him too
Finally both these old folk gave up their sorcery and took refuge in the Triple Gem
Such were the events of that Rains Retreat
The forest meditation monks who were disciples of the Ven
Ajahn Mun had never ventured near the province of Nakorn Rajasima
They had heard reports that the people there were fierce and cruel and had therefore always held back through concern that it wouldn't be safe
Then Somdet Phra Maha Virawong when he still had the ecclesiastical rank of Phra Dhammapamok requested Ven
Ajahn Singh and Ven
Ajahn Maha Pin to go there
Police Major Luang Charn Nikom commander of the second company of the Korat town police force found inspiration and faith in the monks
He donated a plot of land on which to establish a forest monastery beside the rail head at Korat
In consequence Ven
Ajahn Singh called his disciples living in Khon Kaen to come down
I walked down with this group of monks and we stayed in Luang Charn's orchard
I organized the monks in building temporary shelters because Ven
Ajahn Singh was away in Bangkok and hadn't yet returned
When he arrived I went and helped Ven
Ajahn Maha Pin to construct a place for the monks to stay in a cremation ground
This was the second site and I ended up spending that year's Rains Retreat there
This became
Many senior monks were resident there for that Rains Retreat Ven
Ajahn Fan Ven
Ajahn Poomee Ven
Ajahn Louei Ven
Ajahn Gong Mah and myself
Venerable Ajahn Maha Pin was the head monk
Throughout this Rains Retreat Ven
Ajahn Fan and I were responsible for assisting Ven
Ajahn Maha Pin in receiving visitors and giving sermons and instruction to the laity
This was the first time that any forest monasteries for meditation monks had been established in Korat
In fact two were set up in that one year
This was also the year when historic changes took place in Thailand with the ending of the Absolute Monarchy and its replacement by democracy
After the Rains Retreat I left with a party of monks who were out seeking secluded places in the direction of Gra Tok District and Ging Cheh
We came back through Gra Tok District again and I supervised the building of a preliminary monastery at Dorn Dtee Klee with the help of the District Officer Khun Amnart
But before it could be completed it became necessary for me to return to spend the Rains Retreat in Tah Bor in Nongkhai Province
I afterwards heard that Ven
Ajahn Singh had sent Ven
Ajahn Lee to spend the Rains Retreat at Gra Tok District in place of me
The weather had been incredibly hot when I was organizing the building of shelters and meditation huts at Wat Pah Salawan in Korat
I don't like hot weather but I had gritted my teeth and endured persevering in my meditation without let up
I had trained my mindfulness so well that there was stillness and calm throughout day and night
Sometimes it would converge and enter the bhavanga and totally disappear for many hours
This however is certainly not the way that allows wisdom to be born
I had been trying to correct this tendency for a long time both by my own efforts and by asking others for help
It had never previously succeeded but this time I found a way out for myself
This was by being ready to apprehend the heart when it was right at the point of convergence into bhavanga
At that moment the condition of awareness becomes unmindful and there is the inclination towards indulgence in the pleasure of the tranquillity and happiness
When mindfulness fades the mind will converge into bhavanga
The thing to do is to apprehend it right at the point when it is fading towards indulgence in that refined tranquillity
Catch it there and swiftly set mindfulness on to a coarser object and focus and examine it more externally
The problem will be immediately solved by not allowing the heart to converge towards that tranquillity and pleasure
Putting it simply forestall the heart's convergence and totally focus one's examination on just one place the physical body
I had been subject to this state of affairs since I first went off into the forests to meditate and it was only at this time that I could cure myself
If one reckons it all up that is more than ten years of practice to come to such understanding
Even so when sense objects impinged on my mind it could still become agitated
What about those people who have no experience of the heart's peace and happiness how will they make out when sense objects intrude
I had some doubts about the DhammaVinaya thinking that
'The purity of the Path Fruit and Nibbana  which form the culmination and ultimate goal of Buddhism  probably can no longer be attained
All that is presumably left now is the level of attainment to cessation which is still a mundane state' Nevertheless I still carried my meditation forward despite the mindbending hot weather
One day my mind converged in an extraordinary way  it totally converged into bright radiance being there alone
There was a clear and precise clarity of knowing illuminating brilliantly that one point
When I turned to examine or focus on any theme or aspect of Dhamma  all my wavering and doubts about DhammaVinaya seemed to disappear
It was as if I had already reached the ultimate point of all dhammas
I didn't however concern myself with that issue but fully resolved to know how to cleanse the heart to complete purity
Having already progressed as far as this what was there to do now how was I to proceed
When I had the opportunity to ask advice from Ven
Ajahn Singh he recommended that I concentrate my contemplation much more on the unbeautiful loathsome aspects of the physical body
He told me to focus there until I could see its rotting away and decay and the final disintegration into the four elements
I broke in with my misgivings Surely when the mind has already let go of form and only name remains isn't going back to bodily form too coarse an object of contemplation Well at that point he really made a loud noise charging that already I was boasting of reaching supernormal attainments
The truth is that I had never  right from the very beginning of my meditation practice  been skilled in examining the loathsomeness of the body
That's the truth
In my meditation practice I had always gone straight to focussing on the heart
I had deduced that because the defilements arise in the heart if the heart doesn't venture outwards into disturbance but remains well set in a peaceful state all the things of the world are left in their purity
My interrupting by voicing these doubts brought forth a very loud reaction from Ven
Ajahn Singh such a response showing the true expression of his character
So what was I to do
I stayed quiet and kept my 'selfsatisfied' feelings to myself pondering the reasons why his views didn't fit in with my own opinions
In this matter it became obvious that only Ven
Ajahn Mun remained for me to consult and depend on
After a while Ven
Ajahn Singh softened his voice and he turned and asked me what I now thought
I stood my ground and said that I still didn't agree
I insisted respectfully that he shouldn't take the idea that I had been bragging of supernormal attainments seriously
I genuinely submitted my deep veneration for my teachers with a pure heart
The reason I had come forward to open up my true feeling and express such an opinion was because I was totally at a loss about the way to go on
I explained that this was the first time that I had experienced such a condition of mind and that I didn't know if it were right or wrong or whether it needed rectification or how to proceed with it
I said with due respect that I didn't harbor any resentment towards my teacher and that if he had any further suggestion as to skillful means with which to resolve my uncertainties then out of kindness and compassion to please throw it all at me
Ven
Ajahn Singh then soothed and comforted me advising me to proceed slowly but surely as that was the way if things were to develop
Well that day my heart certainly felt as if it had totally lost everything upon which it could depend
It was as if all ties and attachment to the group were gone
One of Ven
Ajahn Singh's wishes had been that the group of monks not split up
He wanted us all to help each other in spreading Buddhism in that province
However I had long desired  ever since I had joined up with the others while staying in Khon Kaen  to separate myself and go off to seek some solitude
This was because I was well aware that my meditation efforts and the necessary skillful techniques were still weak and ineffective
I had continually tried to detach myself but always in ways that would not give the impression to my teacher or companions that I didn't like them
I had not however succeeded in this
It was on this occasion after the Rains Retreat that I got my chance
It was during this Rains Retreat that I readied myself to go and seek out Ven
Ajahn Mun in Chiang Mai Province
Throughout this period I was developing my meditation with the same techniques and methods that I had used while staying at Wat Pah Salawan in Korat
Although I firmly held Ven
Ajahn Mun in mind as the inspiration for my meditation efforts my heart didn't seem as refined as it once had been
After the end of the Rains Retreat I mentioned to Ven
Ornsee my intention to go to Chiang Mai Province following Ven
Ajahn Mun
I asked him if he would like to go with me and that if he would then we should lay down certain principles
There should be no grumbling about hardships encountered along the way for example difficulties with the journey food or shelter
If either of us were eventually to fall ill then we would help each other to the best of our ability  'together to the end'
If one of us became homesick for family or friends  for example for our parents  there should be no abetting or helping the other to go back
We must be resolved to face death wherever and however it came
I told Ven
Ornsee that if he accepted and agreed to abide by these three principles then he could go
However if he didn't feel able to follow them he certainly shouldn't even think of going
Going against this would only be the cause for his later regret and that might cause me anguish too
He said that he was happy with the arrangement and asked to go along
There was also a white robed layman who asked to travel with us
We embarked from Vientiane by motorizedboat going upstream towards Nakorn Luang Phra Bahng
Sometimes we spent the night in riverside villages and sometimes we camped out on river sand banks
It took three nights and four days to reach Nakorn Luang Phra Bahng
On the trip up we admired the beautiful natural scenery on both banks of the Mekong River
That together with the refreshing coolness of the local climate aroused a sense of solitude and isolation filling us with great happiness
This was enhanced by so few fellow passengers  and they had all gone to sleep
Only the skipper and some of his deck hands were about
The landscape though empty of villages was encompassed with vast stretches of virgin jungle with rocky outcrops jutting out over the river
Occasionally animals such as monkeys and langurs would make spectacular leaps as they playfully chased each other through the trees
Whenever the boat came closer to the bank they would all crowd together in troops and gaze down scrutinizing us
Nowadays such scenes are difficult to find but just recalling them still evokes in me a feeling of solitude
On arrival at Nakorn Luang Phra Bahng we sought permission to stay at Wat Mai the newly built monastery close to the royal palace of the King
This is where they enshrine the Phra Bahng  so greatly revered and cherished by the citizens of Nakorn Luang Phra Bahng
This also happened to be the day when the Queen came to ceremonially dedicate the restored plinth of the Phra Bahng
We therefore counted ourselves fortunate witnesses of these customs and meritmaking ceremonies of the citizens of Nakorn Luang Phra Bahng
However I won't go into further detail about them here
After the celebrations were over we took leave of the abbot and went across to stay at Wat Nong Sagaaw
This was situated on a high hill on the opposite bank of the Mekong River directly across from Nakorn Luang Phra Bahng
We stayed there to await the boat that would take us upriver to the district of Chiang Saen in Chiang Rai Province of Thailand
After waiting there for four nights we embarked again and the journey took another four nights
The journey upriver to Chiang Saen was thus of equal length to the previous stretch up from Vientiane
We rested in Chiang Saen for four or five nights before setting out overland for Chiang Rai and Lampang
In Lampang we stayed in the garden for visitors to Phra Bart Dtark Phah by the entrance way leading up to the mountain shrine
The chee pakao accompanying us fell ill while we were there
He had no fever but felt exhausted and weak and his urine was thick and reddish like water that has been used to rinse meat
We were far from any doctors and so had to resort to the Lord Buddha's medicine and depend on ourselves
So we told him to drink his own urine even though it appeared so clearly reddish
He drank it straight after urination while it was still warm
It worked wonders
Within less than ten days he was back to normal
After his recovery we set out walking for about the first thirty five kilometres and then continued sometimes on foot and sometimes catching a vehicle until we reached Lampoon and finally Chiang Mai
When we arrived at Wat Chedi Luang in Chiang Mai we enquired about Ven
Ajahn Mun but didn't find out much
Worse than that some of the monks there even referred to him with dismissive contempt
May I ask here for the indulgence of my readers for what I am about to relate concerns the risky encounters of a monk's life
You may be able to find in it some sort of significance
It makes me feel awkward and embarrassed but to leave it out would make this autobiography incomplete
Once when we were stopping over at Wat Chedi Luang in Chiang Mai I felt very fit and healthy  never before had my health been so good
I assume it was because of the cool climate which I have always found agreeable
Anyway I went and had my photograph taken as a memento
Two days later I went back to the shop myself to collect the prints
Just as I was picking up the photographs to examine them a woman  I'm not sure what sort of person she was  walked up behind me
She asked  in a very familiar manner  for one of the photos and her suggestive behavior seemed flirtatious and provocative
Hearing her speak in such a way gave me a fright for I had only just arrived in town and didn't know anyone
As soon as I had looked and taken in the situation I made a completely negative response and she hid her face turned away and fled
Hearing such remarks and seeing such behavior came as a very big Dhamma lesson
It made me reflect in a wider way on my previous experiences with women for I had already encountered similar behavior from women many times
Yet I had never shown any interest because I was determined to live my life as a monk in the DhammaVinaya of the Lord Buddha  viewing women only as a danger to the brahmacariya holy life
This latest incident then brought up all the previous episodes that had arisen during my life
For instance there was once a woman whom I respected as a pious person
She wasn't so young anymore either
I instructed her about meditation in the same way that I taught other people
Later she came and told me that whenever she came near to me it felt as if her heart were relieved of its sadness
Sometimes when a large group of monks came to see me she would still come and sit there with us for lengthy periods
At that point I realized what she was up to
I tried to teach her to remedy this by meditation but without success
I then used more intimidating forceful language in an attempt to make her angry with me but also to no avail
One day around dusk she dashed up into my hut
She wouldn't heed anything I said to forbid it and once up in my hut listlessly sat down and wouldn't speak
I called for her relatives to come and pull her away and that made her furious
In the morning while I was walking meditation she strode straight towards me and stopped not far away
She started screaming at me saying Why do you teach meditation like this
You teach people to go crazy
It doesn't matter who the meditation teacher is none of them will escape from lust
Then she turned her back and went away
It was a sight that made me feel very uneasy
Her relatives took her to a hospital where the doctor examined her and could find nothing wrong
From there she went to live in a center for whiterobed nuns with whom she already had close connections
Three months went by and she returned to see me
She had by then realized for herself the mistake and error she had made and came to confess that she had misconstrued the situation having thought that I had some magnetic charm that had made her fall in love with me
She then asked for my forgiveness and that was the end of the first affair
The second incident occurred a long time later
I was giving guidance and teachings to lay Buddhists in various places in the rural areas
It all came from a sense of kindness and good intentions with sincere concern and I managed to ignore any hardship that this caused me personally
I would sometimes still be teaching late into the night  I could manage to go on until midnight or even as late as three in the morning
I particularly felt sympathy for those young women present who were still without ties or obligations
I wanted them to see the stress involved with their gender to see that if they kept the precept of chastity purely after death they would be reborn in a higher realm or in a male body for that would allow them to ordain as a novice or monk
This rather naive and silly opinion of mine was a general one towards all women not for any individual in particular
It was this compassion that became my charismatic charm without me being aware of it
To explain I had become so popular and respected by so many people that a lot of them  women and men old and young  came and ordained with me in the forest
Some of them obtained wonderful results in their meditation evident to themselves and the other members of the group
Those people who couldn't meditate however would instead find opportunity to increase their defilements
One day I had to go off on some business and a nun came up and asked to accompany me on the journey
I wouldn't allow it and set out
After this the nun fell into a state of stupefied confusion and wouldn't utter a word
Whenever anyone asked her something her only response would be a smile
When I returned after many days away and saw her condition I tried using forceful language to make her indignant and thereby shake her out of her brooding fixation but she just kept on smiling
I tried using some Buddhist techniques to help bring her out of it but it was no use so I had someone take her back to stay with her relatives
At that time it didn't strike me as very significant and I just thought that these incidents arose solely from sexual desire
Afterwards I continued to train the local Buddhist laity in virtue and Dhamma with my efforts being founded on kindness and motivated by a sincere wish for their welfare
I had to pass through many similar minor incidents that might have endangered my following of the brahmacariya
However I neither paid them much attention nor thought anything untoward could happen and I feel rather abashed about such incidents so I'll ask not to go on about them
However I will say something about an incident that was the most horrifying close call in my life of brahmacariya
It happened back when I was newly ordained
Sometimes if I had spare time I would go with a boy usually in the evening to visit my lay supporters
On one such evening I went up into a house to call on one of the lay supporters
She came out and closed the door behind us
That gave me quite a fright
At that time she was alone with her young child
Anyway we began conversing about various things in the way that people who have regard for each other do
One thing she always seemed to ask me about was whether I wished to disrobe
Being both a straightforward sort of person and naturally shy I would always just say No and quickly go on to talk about religious topics
This time was no different
She asked the usual question but then continued to talk about her past
She spoke about the time before her marriage when a monk had fallen in love with her but they hadn't married
The marriage to her present husband was an arranged affair both families having thought it a good match
Their living together wasn't much more than that and she didn't know how much longer they would last together
I just sat listening assuming that she was confiding in me like this because we were close friends and that she had no ulterior motive
Yet her behavior did seem strange in the way she was gradually drawing herself closer to me always edging in closer and closer
Light from the dtaitorch began to flicker and was about to go out so I told her to trim it but she just smiled and did nothing
I began to feel uneasy and felt the innerheat from some desire that was arising mixed with a strong fear of wrongdoing and of being discovered
Even to this day I find that moment difficult to explain
It was as if I was totally stupefied
As far as I could make out she must have been feeling it as strongly if not more so  her facial expression seemed bereft of all mindfulness
She couldn't stand it anymore and went out to get some water to drink and splash on her face and then came back into the room
This was repeated many times and on reentering she would always sit herself even closer to me
Meanwhile my disquiet grew and I felt completely befuddled
That made me irritable so I told her I was leaving to go back to the monastery
However it wasn't that easy for when I turned to get the boy who had accompanied me he was sound asleep slumped up against the wall
She pleaded with me to stay the night there in the house and return to the monastery in the morning
That increased my feeling of stupefaction together with an incredible attack of bashfulness
I told her to wake up the boy and when I asked her a second time she complied
When the boy was awake we both climbed down the house stairs
As I left I still felt befuddled and extremely ashamed of myself
I was also afraid that my monastic brothers and teachers would get to know what had happened
We arrived back at the monastery about midnight but I lay sleepless right through till dawn reflecting on what had happened and why
I had somehow escaped those perilous circumstances in a miraculous way
That young woman stimulated all the remembered incidents from the past that I've been relating here a stranger who asked for my photograph that day
She certainly gave me the equivalent of a powerful sermon to which to listen
Ah so these are the wiles and ways of women still lost in intoxication with the worldly realm of sensual desire Therefore may I here again offer her my great thanks for her lesson
The incident involving her was quite straightforward but the latter two affairs happened because I overlooked the nature of worldly ways or some might say it was because of my naive foolishness
Yet I am willing to be an innocent simpleton about that sort of thing for that is why I was willing to forfeit such a life and go forth as a monk
I went forth in the radical way of one truly being willing to offer his life in homage to the Buddha's Teachings
If however I hadn't been such a simpleton and if my merit and good kamma hadn't been so supportive and if I had been reluctant to offer my life for Buddhism  I would probably have long ago become crows' bait
Recollecting my escapes from such frightening situations caused an immense feeling of exhilaration and satisfaction to arise in my heart so much so that my body was quivering for days afterwards
Later whenever I was to mention these episodes those same feelings would arise in me and such a reaction persisted for almost twenty years
I find it very embarrassing and I don't want bluntly to declare that women pose a threat to the brahmacariya  after all my mother was a woman and the Buddhist Teachings under whose cool shade I take shelter is still primarily dependent on the dedicated support of women
In the Buddha's time the lay woman the Lady Visakha was widely renowned as one of the preeminent devotees of the Buddha's Teaching
Nevertheless when the Buddha cautioned his close disciples to be circumspect about their life of brahmacariya for the most part he would warn them to remain vigilant concerning the opposite sex
Take for example one of the final sayings of the Lord Buddha
He was replying to Venerable Ananda's questions about how a monk should conduct himself with a woman after the Lord Buddha had finally passed away into Nibbana Not to see or hear them is good and safe while if there is contact then don't become too close or chat with them while if it becomes necessary to speak with them make sure that you take care and restrain your mind
For women who would train their hearts to a purity that transcends all suffering they should contemplate the dangers of the opposite sex the male which forms their object of desire
By seeing the fault and harm in this they will also come to dispassion
As with the Elder Upalavanna Bhikkhunii who once declared something to the effect that I have seen the harm of all sensual desires
Whenever sensual desire besets someone's heart it obscures and blinds them  a father then becomes capable even of sleeping with his own daughter
To summarize acute danger to the brahmacariya holy life comes most seriously from worldly sensuality
However this can't exclusively be about one gender because all humans and animals born into this realm of sensuality come to birth through both sexes through father and mother
Whatever we do therefore there can be no escape from contact with the opposite sex
Any person wishing to go beyond all sensuality must first pick out that very sensuality as something fundamental and as an object of deliberation
This applies especially to the opposite sex who make up the material form on which one hangs the signs of sexual desire
Lust and sexual desire are mental qualities that exist in everyone's heart and when they arise one feels the need to fix on a physical form as a target and object for grasping hold of
The physical form fixed upon is inclined in every way to be able to respond to that lustful desire and passion
It can do this for example through bodily form sexual characteristics complexion shape and appearance deportment decorum and speech
The opposite sex or any object stimulating sensual pleasure can thus be turned into something that promotes the conditions necessary for a person to discern the harm of all sensuality
We will then see them as great facilitators in liberating ourselves from the sensual realm
If that wasn't the case all the Dhammavinaya the Lord Buddha's ordinances and the way of practice of forest meditation monks  including all the various ways and faculties of wisdom  would be totally worthless and of no benefit
All people  whether they are ordained or lay  having been born into this sensual realm are obliged to defy this sort of threat and danger
Even if they don't possess the latest armaments there is always the weapon that their parents fashioned for them their basic constitution so that they can handle it
The person who won't stand up and fight has totally wasted the life to which he was born
However the strategy and tactics employed by the recluse and the lay person will differ in that the recluse battles for victory while the lay person battles against defeat
While the person who does not try at all is already rotting away while still alive
I have been discussing all this for the benefit of those who are ordained and who must safeguard their brahmacariya holy life
It is this that forms the basis for the future continuity of the Lord Buddha's Teaching
While women may be the greatest danger to the monk's holy life they are also equally of the greatest benefit and good to the Teaching
Women furnished the form from which the Lord Buddha and all the Noble Disciples came to be born and they also offered the object of contemplation through which was born their Dhamma realization
When I think about those monks who transgress the Discipline in the most offensive of ways by involving themselves in things that are regarded as worldly sensuality namely sexual desire and money
What can one say about such monks who are supposed to have already forsaken all that when they went forth to ordain
Even a lay person still completely immersed in the five strands of worldly pleasure would be considered base and sordid if they exhibited such behavior among morally principled people
I have already led my readers away cutting through a forest of potent dangers until they must be tired out
So now I'll return to the account of my search for Ven
Ajahn Mun
We stayed at Wat Chedi Luang in Chiang Mai town for two or three nights and then took leave of the abbot to continue our journey in search of Ven
Ajahn Mun
After fruitless enquiries at the various small monasteries where he had once stayed we decided to make absolutely sure and go farther afield beyond Thailand
We crossed into Burma going via the towns of Muang Hahng Muang Dtuan Mork Mai and Rahng Kruer heading on up to the Phah Hang Hoong Cliffs that are close to Muang Pan on the River Salwin
But our hopes were disappointed as there wasn't the slightest sign that he had been that way
The cold weather then proved too much for us and after spending two nights with the Palong hill tribes people we came down off the mountains
Such cold  right in the middle of the March and April Hot Season
We were forced to huddle for warmth around a fire throughout the day and night
What would it have been like in the actual Cold Season or during a particularly cold year
Ven
Ajahn Mun disappeared into the jungle because of what occurred when the Ven
Chao Khun Phra Upaligunuupamahjahn felt that he didn't have much longer to live
Ven
Chao Khun Phra Upali' saw there was a need for a suitable senior monk to take charge of Wat Chedi Luang and because of his already great respect for Ven
Ajahn Mun he was inclined to hand over responsibility for the administration of that monastery to him
Ven
Ajahn Mun preferred peace and quiet
He did not wish to get involved in such matters but in order to respond to Ven
Chao Khun Phra Upali's purpose he did go and reside there for one Rains Retreat
After the Retreat he took his leave and disappeared into the jungle
Ven
Chao Khun Phra Upali' had already passed away in Bangkok during that same Rains Retreat
For the next two years there had been no news of Ven
Ajahn Mun
That left the two of us Ven
Ornsee and myself to seek him out and our wanderings through the forests and mountains were all aimed at this
As long as we stayed within Thailand we felt at home with the various hardships we always had to put up but as soon as we crossed over the frontier our frustrations and hardships increased a thousandfold
For example there were different cultural traditions and customs and the language barrier
Although we were all supposed to be Buddhist the customs were sometimes very different from what we were familiar with and sometimes they didn't seem even in line with the DhammaVinaya that the Lord Buddha had set down
It was very trying and bothersome for us as we were their visitors and guests
This was especially so when we were with the various hill tribe villages that were particularly poor and undeveloped
And the paths and trails
In some places we were forced to follow the streams up into mountain valleys otherwise there were walks along the edge of precipices
On the descent from one such climb I slipped on some rocks and fell badly gashing my knees
I forced myself to hobble on until we reached the village of Pong Pah Khaem on the ThaiBurmese Border
We then went to stay in the Plong Cave where I could nurse my wounds and recuperate for ten days
While traveling in Burma we had seen many admirable features
The people there liked peace and quiet and they were generous and openhearted
There were no thieves or crooks and no domestic animals  no poultry or pigs  because they wouldn't kill animals
Their diet was basically vegetables seasoned with chili salt beans and sesame
Once in a long while some dried fish would be brought up from Cambodia for them to sample
I later heard that after the Second World War Field Marshall Por compelled these people to raise domestic animals that caused them much distress
I really appreciated their sincere good will and religious faith and their peaceful and orderly way of life
We would hear no disturbing noise at night even though village houses might adjoin the monastery's fence
It was just as if there was no village there at all
When the wound in my knee had healed well enough for me to walk the two of us set out across the mountains of the Morn Ahng Kahng range
We trekked through them all day without reaching the hill tribe village for this mountain was indeed extremely high
It had taken us until midday to reach the summit and then the descent proved so steep that darkness overtook us as we reached the mountain's foot
We carried on walking and about half way along the trail we heard the roar of a tiger not far away from us
I was almost frightened to death by the idea of a tiger being so close but I didn't let on to my friend  he had been born and raised in an agriculturally developed area and so didn't know the sound of a tiger
If I had told him I knew I would instantly draw him into my state of trepidation
Going beyond the range of the tiger's roar we lost the trail and so were forced to find a place to spend the night in the jungle
I was so afraid of the tiger that I lay sleepless throughout the night
There was a heavy dew and it was extremely cold yet my friend lay there snoring loudly all night
While I was terrified with the thought that the tiger might hear him and we would be killed  he blissfully slept through it all
At the crack of dawn we packed our things still soaking wet from the dew and set off again
On the way I told him that the noise he had heard the previous evening that sounded like the yelping of a dying dog was in fact a tiger
It was the roar a tiger makes just after having consumed a full meal expressing its high spirits
We carried on walking and by around eight o'clock in the morning we had reached a village where we could go on alms round
After eating our meal we set off again and reached the Dtap Dtow Cave where we stayed for a time to recover our strength
Feeling refreshed we then resumed our journey heading in the direction of Phrao District
Next something unbelievable occurred  yet it happened
On that day after having our meal we were leaving the Dtap Dtow Cave when a barkingdeer darted out from beside two houses and across our path
These houses had been built in the middle of an open grassy field close to the gate of the cavemonastery
The barking deer then strolled leisurely almost lazily in front of us but we didn't take any notice of it thinking that this was its territory and we were just passing through
We continued through the rest of the village and were cutting across the fields to join the start of the main trail when more barkingdeer appeared
A pair male and female that were among the village herd of water buffalo spotted us coming along and darted out in front of us again and again we paid them no notice
However not long after that we found that although we had started along the right footpath we had somehow wandered away from it
How was it possible that we could have mistaken our way and ended up on an old neglected trail leading into a side valley
For about ten hours we were forced to pick our way along the rocky stream bed for the steep mountain slopes rising on both sides forced the path down off the bank
As the climb progressed it became so narrow and the jungle so thick that no sunlight could penetrate
We didn't stop for rests not even to have a drink of water
When exhaustion began to set in I proposed to my companion that we retrace our steps and pick up the main path but he would not agree
I thought that the head of the stream we were following must be the main drainage source for the surrounding more lightly forested ridges  just like the streams back in my home region of the Northeast
It certainly did not turn out like that for when we finally reached the source we found a sheer cliff face confronted us
There were tracks of large deer and the wallowing holes of wild boar
As there was no longer any path forward we had to turn back and almost straightaway I misstepped on a rock and fell so that it deeply gashed the sole of my foot
Night was approaching so I used my shouldercloth to bind the wound and we decided to scale the steep side slopes that were mostly of scree
Well it was quite a scramble for wherever one placed a foot it would slip and slide
We reached the summit around seven o'clock in the evening and saw a rather indistinct footpath winding its way along the summit ridge line
We were glad of the path because it probably meant we were near a village
Suddenly nearby peep
peep  a stag startled by the light of our candle lanterns had cried out and stamped the ground in alarm
This startled us so much that my heart seemed to miss beats
On recovering our composure we realized that  Ah
It's only the sound of a deer
Looking in the direction of the noise we could make out its white chest and knew then that it was just a stag
Afterwards it let out another cry and jumped down from the ridge of the mountain and disappeared
After seeing the flattened sleeping place of this wild deer so close to the path it became obvious that we were still a long way from human habitation
As it was already late we decided to spend the night there and so we each arranged a place to our liking in the thick grassy undergrowth
Yet all night long we were unable to get any sleep
The wind was too strong to hang the mosquito nets from our krots while on the ground it wasn't just termites attacking us for swarms of ants also came attracted by the blood from my wound and the sweat of our bodies
We had to wrap cloths around our eyes to prevent the ants from getting in to drink from our tears
As soon as it was light we rose and looked back down on the way we had come
Far below we could see the paddy fields as tiny squares
We oriented ourselves and estimated that if we continued straight onwards along the present path we would probably meet up again with the trail that we had lost
So we cut across jungle and more open forest following our line of march
How my foot was hurting
Pushing on across the more open rocky pebbly ground was almost unbearable but I gritted my teeth for we had to press on as we were still a long way from any village
After quite some time we did indeed strike the hoped for trail
Walking along the trail we eventually reached a village not much before nine o'clock in the morning
We arrived with feelings of some relief and could slip our requisites from our shoulders by the side of a landing stage of a stream beside the houses
A moment or two later someone came out to see us and we related the whole course of events
We thought to ask straight out for something to eat but were afraid this was something blameworthy
So instead we tried to explain indirectly by mentioning that we had not yet eaten anything and that as I had an injured foot going on an alms round wouldn't be possible
If we were to wait there would we be able to obtain anything to eat
She said we would and as she went back into the house we assumed that she would bring some food for us to eat
We both therefore went to bathe ourselves in the stream
When I had finished washing the pain in my foot grew so excruciating that I couldn't walk on it at all
During the previous night it hadn't been at all painful and even that morning's walk had been bearable so why should it now suddenly hurt so much that I couldn't even stand up
Venerable Ornsee my companion through all this suffering felt faint and dizzy and couldn't stand up himself
All we could do was to wait for her to bring us something to eat  but there was no sign of that
Hunger and fatigue now surged in on us
Fortunately I had some herbal medicine for dizziness with me in my shoulder bag and so was able to attend to Venerable Ornsee but it was well after ten o'clock in the morning before he could get up
I suggested then that he go and ask what was happening
He only managed to find two young boys minding the house and discovered that all the adults had gone to work in the jungle
This village had only two houses and everyone made their living by cutting the young banana leaves and drying and smoothing them for sale as 'cheroot' or 'cigarette papers'
When Venerable Ornsee informed me of the situation I had him go and bring the two boys to see me and I asked them if they would exchange cooked rice for some matches  we had no other possessions
Each of us had a couple of boxes of matches and in exchange we got two baskets of sticky rice two dishes of chili and fermented soya bean paste with two small bunches of steamed vegetables
We had our meal and how good it tasted
After the meal was over the pain in my foot grew much worse so much so that my whole leg was inflamed and throbbing
I endured this until just after three o'clock in the afternoon when we moved on
I hobbled along for about three kilometres before we reached another village where we stayed for eleven nights
We rested and recovered our strength and I was able to attend to my wound
From there we climbed over a Karen settled mountain coming down into the district of Phrao in Chiang Mai at Manora Village
That evening we received some good news
Someone came and told us that Ven
Ajahn Mun was staying in the Pah Miang of Maer Pung and that Ven
Ajahn Sahn was at the entrance to the trail going up to Khork Kham Cave
We were delighted and thought that this time our aspirations would be fulfilled
After the meal we gathered our things and set out arriving just as night was falling at the Khork Kham Cave where Ven
Ajahn Sahn was staying
We spent the night with him discussing Dhamma and talking about this and that as was suitable
The next morning after the meal he put us on the right path and Venerable Ornsee and I took our leave and set off
We arrived at Ven
Ajahn Mun's place at about four o'clock in the afternoon
He was engaged in walking meditation but when he saw us coming he immediately recognized us and called out our names
He halted his walking meditation and went over to sit in his hermitage
We began to slip our things down from our shoulders and place them on the ground outside but he wouldn't have it and insisted that we put them on the veranda of his hermitage
Doing so we entered and bowed our respects to him
Ven
Ajahn Mun opened by enquiring after our wellbeing
I then respectfully explained to him the reason it's become necessary for me to seek the Venerable Ajahn out this time is that I need your help in sorting out my meditation
I have already learned a lot from others in our group but I'm convinced that the Venerable Ajahn is the only one who can resolve it all for me
I then proceeded to detail my meditation practice and experiences to him starting from my very first endeavors right up to those experiences that I had related to Ven
Ajahn Singh in Korat
This led him to describe how he had previously instructed his disciples in effect suggesting how I should assess the group of disciples whom he had taught
Any monk who follows my way of practice until he becomes skilled and firmly established in it should progress well and will at least hold his own and succeed
If a monk doesn't proceed along this way he won't last long and will eventually regress or disrobe
Even for myself should I be burdened with many responsibilities and involvements with the group of monks then my meditation development can't be consistently developed
My focussed investigation into the body wouldn't be refined nor would the heart become clear and lucid
In your investigating never allow the mind to desert the body for anywhere else
Whether or not it appears to be clearing and becoming more lucid don't retreat from fixing your investigation there
You can examine the body's loathsomeness or view it as made up from elements or examine it to see it as aggregates or by way of the Three Characteristics
Any of these methods can be used
But you really must fix your investigations within these including all the four bodily postures
Yet this isn't to say that after looking you can stop with that  regardless of whether it is seen clearly or not just continue with the investigation
When any of these aspects are fully and lucidly seen in one's heart all other exterior things will clearly manifest there too
He also told me not to allow the mind to enter the bhavanga
As soon as Ven
Ajahn Mun had finished speaking I made a resolution in my heart From that moment I would start again and learn a new way of practice
Right or wrong I would follow his instructions and let him be the only one to guide me and make the final decisions
One can say that from that day forward my mindfulness was solely directed towards investigating the body
Throughout the day and night I was now viewing it as loathsome as made up of the four elements and as a mass of suffering
I intensified my practice without let up or negligence for six months   without wearying of it
As a consequence my heart received calmness and peace and a new understanding arose
All things of this world are merely the four elements
But we make assumptions about them and then go and fall into delusion about our own suppositions
That is why there has to be so much trouble and distress with all these things
This new understanding gave great solidity and firmness to my heart which was very different from how it had been
I became confident that I was now going along the right path but did not inform Ven
Ajahn Mun about this because the firm belief in my new understanding convinced me that I could do that any time
The weather was so extremely cold that year that we had to sleep by the side of a fire
Although I got a splinter of wood in my hand no blood flowed because it was so cold
After the Rains Retreat Ven
Ajahn Mun went down to stay near the village of Toong Makhao
The two of us Venerable Ornsee and myself stayed on up there but we swapped places
I went down to stay where Ven
Ajahn Mun and Ven
Ornsee had spent the Retreat while Ven
Ornsee came up to my place on the mountain
In the middle of one night a tiger approached and sat watching over Ven
Ornsee who was lying asleep beside the fire
When the fire died down and he began to feel cold he stood up to stoke it up again at which point the tiger growled and sprang off into the jungle
Being born among the fields he wasn't familiar with the sounds of the jungle tiger and I didn't enlighten him being concerned that he would become frightened
Sometime later Ven
Ajahn Mun sent a letter telling us to come down to see him
We went to help him with some task for ten days and  what happened
Ah
All my meditation schemes that had seemed so lucid and obvious before were no longer so clear
I was now seeing 'people' as the 'people' that arise from conventional suppositions
When the task was completed Ven
Ajahn Waen and I requested permission from Ven
Ajahn Mun to go off wandering in search of solitude again
Venerable Ornsee stayed behind to attend on Ven
Ajahn Mun
We set off on our journey and after about twelve kilometres turned off into the forest for some seclusion
During the night I heard the roar of a tiger from a nearby mountain top and this helped to concentrate my mind in seclusion
I called up the virtues and qualities of the Lord Buddha as my meditation object and from this arose knowledge of a strange and marvellous nature in different ways never imagined or experienced before
We stayed there for two nights before continuing on to meet with Ven
Ajahn Sahn in the district of Phrao
I didn't stay long with him however because of my yearning for solitude
So taking leave of him I climbed up the mountain to where the Mooser hill tribes lived and continued with my meditation exertions there for nine days
I thought that by going to live with the Mooser and not having a language in common I would be able totally to commit myself to meditation practice
I knew quite well that they were generoushearted so that they would certainly give me enough food to eat
I exerted myself in meditation to the extreme limit of my ability until a misguided and distorted view arose
'There is no Lord Buddha no Sangha
There is only the Dhamma
This is because the Lord Buddha or in other words the 'Prince Siddhatthakumaara' only became the Lord Buddha through knowing the Dhamma
Even the Lord Buddha himself was only ruupadhamma and naamadhamma
The Sangha is the same for they all whether enlightened noble disciples or unenlightened ordinary disciples are sustained by Dhamma
Their physical form is but ruupadhamma and naamadhamma'
This was my rock certain opinion
I was absolutely convinced it was true
But I did review what the authorized version had to say about it and found well that they didn't agree with my opinions
I was unable to settle these two conflicting views and they continually disputed with each other over many days
It was certainly a good thing that I was unwilling to throw out the conventional wisdom for if I had the results would have created quite a song and dance
As it happened Ven
Ajahn Sahn sent someone to invite me to come down to receive some offerings and gifts from the lay people
I was in two minds whether or not I should go
However I then remembered the state of my lower robe
I had already been using it for three years and it might not last through the next Rains Retreat so I decided to go
Accepting his invitation I went to renew my robes so that my requisites would be complete and I could then return
On going down they offered me all the things I required and that distorted view seemed completely to disappear of itself
When I had finished cutting sewing and dyeing the robe I again went up the mountain
But this time I didn't return to my original spot but went on to the Mooser hill tribe village of Poo Phayah
On my arrival they were more than glad to see me and kindly came together to make a hut for my stay
First though  Ah
 my hopes that the language barrier would probably stop anyone coming to bother me were soon dashed
When I first arrived I stayed in one of their abandoned houses
These people had never seen forest tudong monks before and the whole village turned out from the youngest to the oldest to stare at me
They gawked from far and near some coming so close as almost to tread on my toes
As one onlooker went another one came to replace him and it went on from midday until around four in the afternoon
They stood there gawking and then sat there gawking then lay down gawking at me
They were dirty and smelled
It was all too much for me and made me feel quite dizzy
The villagers made me a path for walking meditation
Yet I only had to go out on it for them all to throng after me so that I ended with a long line behind me strung out the length of the path
This was more than I could handle so I went inside and sat again
Meanwhile they continued parading in groups along the path thinking it all great fun
Afterwards I was able to come to an understanding with their 'Chief'
We agreed that trailing behind me wasn't proper and that if they wanted to make merit then whenever they saw me out doing walking meditation they should 'peu'
That would certainly be meritorious
From then on whenever they saw me going out to do walking meditation they would all approach and standing together in a line 'peu'
Anyone missing would be called out to come and join the group
On reflection one couldn't help feeling sympathetic towards these forest people who though living far from material civilization were so honest and upright
In those days no one had come up to assist and teach them for decades and  unless some serious crime had been committed  no government officials would ever show their faces up there
They were selfgoverning and strictly trusted and relied on their 'Chief'
Those bad characters who were troublemakers and stubbornly ignored their Chief's admonition were expelled from the village by the Chief
If the perpetrator refused to go the villagers would all move away from him
You can be assured that nothing like stealing and thievery existed
Whenever I was walking through these mountain ranges and saw one or two isolated houses I could immediately surmise that I wouldn't be able to stay with so few people
The hill tribes in this region lacked sufficient rice after two successively bad harvests
There were twelve houses in the village where I was staying but only three of them had enough rice to eat
Yet they all had such a lot of faith
When I came on alms round only three people would come out to put food into my bowl but each one gave so much that it was sufficient for me to eat
Sometime later the Chief came to see me and explained that everyone had faith and wished to offer food on my alms round but they were embarrassed because they had no rice to give
They had to eat boiled yams and tubers instead of rice
I felt sorry for them and since I rather liked steamed yams myself I told him so
I said that that was why I was able to come up to live with them  if I hadn't liked them I wouldn't have come
Once they all knew about this they dug up wild yams to steam and offer into my bowl which was consequently filled everyday
They also were delighted with the idea laughing and smiling their faces lit up in an endearing way
They did though remain apprehensive that I wouldn't be able to eat their yams and so they followed me back to my hut to see for themselves
Having received their gifts I was determined to show my appreciation by letting them see me eat them
That year the rice crop had been sown but poor rainfall had caused the seedlings to shrivel and turn a pale yellow
The villagers built my hut ten days before the beginning of the Rains Retreat and when it was completed astonishingly the rain started to pour down
They were all overjoyed absolutely delighted to think that it was the result of the merit they had made in building a 'monastery' for me to stay in
The rice was transformed by the rain into a lush green splendid crop
Their rice fields that year produced so much that they couldn't use it all and some of them were even able to sell the surplus
Apparently no monks had previously spent the Rains Retreat with the Mooser hill tribes people so that I may possibly have been the first monk in Thailand to have done so
When they had completed the construction of my hut I recalled that in the 'Life of the Buddha' Venerable Phra Siddhattha had been thirty five years old when his strivings had come to fruition in his Awakening
That year I too would be thirty five years old
I therefore resolved that I would offer my strivings in meditation during that year to pay homage to the Enlightenment of the Lord Buddha
'I will wholeheartedly accept whatever way my meditation practice leads even if my life should be lost because of it
May this life of mine be offered as one would offer a lotus flower in worship of him'
Having made this resolution I applied myself to my meditation throughout the Rains Retreat
Yet it didn't seem to be progressing and remained firmly as it was before
To bring it up to the level of my resolution I decided to put myself through a trial by fasting for five days
The Mooser had never seen such a thing and were afraid I would die
They came and pleaded with me to partake of food as usual but I refused and continued for the full five days in accordance with my pledge
They took it in turns surreptitiously to come and watch over me
If I closed my door to sit in meditation inside the room they would call out and ask me to reply and only when I answered would they leave
Actually fasting is not the pathway to Enlightenment
The Lord Buddha had already tried this method and subsequently said that it was more like selfmortification
All my meditation teachers had repeated that
Having already tried it for myself I knew that it was merely a technique for tormenting the body without leading to the arising of the wisdom to explore Dhamma and sharpen one's understanding
I had fasted as a test of my willpower to see which was stronger  my attachment to life or my faith in the Dhamma qualities that I had already seen
When I had come to the truth within my own heart about this I returned to eating as before
Yet I didn't take any rice for the first four or five days eating just steamed yams and taro
When the Mooser saw that I was taking food again they were all delighted
During the Rains Retreat some visions arose in my meditation pointing to the strength and firmness of my meditation procedures
This brought me great satisfaction and contentment
The Mooser would rejoice and boast that Your being with us is very good
Our hillrice fields have produced a bumper harvest some people will even be able to sell cattle   which they have never managed to do before Dried chilipeppers are another income source for us but apart from these items we have no other means of making money
This year we have more than enough money and can put some aside
You came and taught us not to gamble and play pai tooah and beer so we have stopped
Previously groups of townspeople would come up and dupe us into gambling with them but now we've accepted your teachings and don't play any more
At the end of the Rains Retreat the Chief personally came to offer a tort phah pah from himself and gave a length of white cloth for robe material
I had to bid farewell to the Mooser people so that I could go down to pay my respects to Ven
Ajahn Mun who was at the village of Toong Makhao in the district of Maer Pung
They were all much grieved at my departure and began crying and pleading with me to return
I was still undecided so I told them I would first see what my Ajahn had to say
Perhaps I would then come back
When I reached Ven
Ajahn Mun and related to him all what had happened while I had been living with the Mooser he was pleased and suggested that we went back there
For the return trip all three of us  Ven
Ajahn Mun Venerable Ornsee and I  went in a group together
However when it came time to start climbing Venerable Ornsee became ill so we told him to wait down below to recuperate first
Returning to stay with the Mooser people this time made me feel somewhat uneasy because they were now more intimately acquainted with me than with Ven
Ajahn Mun
Moreover Ven
Ajahn Mun found it difficult to adjust to cold weather
Coming up into the colder atmosphere had affected his health so badly that it appeared that he could probably not stay on
But through his strength of mind and fighting spirit he was able to overcome this and spend the whole of the Rains Retreat there
This time around my meditation went very well because besides being able to use my own techniques I now also had those of the Ven
Ajahn and I was able to learn from him all the time
Close to the start of the Rains Retreat the Ven
Ajahn sent me down to bring Ven
Ornsee back up to be with us
I was away for five nights and that left the Ven
Ajahn by himself
It was during this period of solitude that he strove in his meditation with absolute and fearless determination and achieved outstanding results
His illness also completely disappeared at the same time
During this Rains Retreat period the three of us were all resolute in our meditation practice each of us striving to the limit of our individual ability
We were all so attuned to each other that any happenings  whether concerning external things or connected with the understanding of Dhamma  that occurred to one of us would seem to be known to all
It was during this Rains Retreat that Ven
Ajahn Mun foretold how long his life would last and this subsequently proved to be accurate
Sometimes he would bring forward the visions and 'knowledge' that had spontaneously arisen within his meditation as predictions about various things concerning certain of his disciples
Yet he would add that one must not blindly believe all such things for they could be wrong
As for me I maintained a balanced mind concerning the things he said about me because I understood that such things were very much an individual affair each case being different
They should not be the ultimate aim and purpose of one who truly practices meditation
That should be rather the total eradication of the defilements
This Rains Retreat saw Ven
Ajahn Mun teach us using 'canny' and shrewd means as well as his various subtle and skillful techniques
I had never seen him do anything like this before
I immediately carried out his teachings in every respect and so quickly that he once exclaimed to no one in particular that This Venerable Thate is hasty and impetuous
Ven
Ajahn Mun frankly opened up his true character to us and I can only count my great good fortune to have been under the guidance of a Meditation Master who taught in such a way
I think it would be difficult to find any other times when he could train his disciples in this way
The appropriate conditions of the people involved the place and the time could never again be quite so conducive
Although he might have given his blessing and encouragement for me to become an heir to his Dhamma I have never been heedless and complacently accepted it
I always held that what is true remains true whatever one might say
One can't go beyond the true state of things
During this Rains Retreat I came across a tribe of forest people who were known as the Yellow Leaf Spirits
They themselves resented this name and asked that it not be used for they said that they too were afraid of spirits and it was better to call them 'forest people'
The Mooser people said that although they had lived in that place for over fifty years they had never seen this tribe come near them
They were considered a tribe of 'ancient' Thais and their language and accent sounded very similar to what I had heard when talking with the people from the towns of Yong and Ruang located to the north of Chiang Dtoong
These townspeople had migrated southwards and settled down in Chiang Mai Province
They had made their living as wickerworkers weaving trays known as kern trays
They had told me about these forest people relating how originally the tribe had consisted of about sixty but smallpox had later killed some of them
At that time only about thirty men and women remained
I can offer here some brief collected notes about their way of life
Their existence didn't rely on any permanent settlement
They cut a few small tree trunks to act as posts then covered those with branches leaves and whatever they could find
It was enough to sleep in and find some shelter from rain and dew
Sometimes they would sleep in caves or under rock overhangs or trees
The base of a tree sufficed for them even if it offered only a little shelter
These forest people had no clothing except a few items that they had solicited for covering their nakedness when they entered a village
They lived together in groups and were afraid of spirits and tigers
Once they were in their shelters other people rarely noticed them
If by chance they were seen the women folk had to run away and if they weren't fast enough they would drop to the ground and roll away
Any men of the tribe would immediately come out with their spears to fight
They believed it was so inauspicious for a woman to see a stranger that it would end with her being eaten by a tiger
The tribe would stay for a long time wherever there was a plentiful food supply but once the food ran out they would migrate elsewhere
That is why they were known as the Yellow Leaf Spirits for when the leaves covering their shelters turned yellow they would move on
Their food and diet were based on animal meat wild forest yams and tubers and honey from wild bee hives
They wouldn't eat certain species of animals  snakes for example  and meat had to be cooked or roasted in the fire before it could be eaten
Rice or wheat did not make up their staple food unlike ordinary people
If they collected honey they would first mix it with rotted wood pulp or earth to give it some solidity before eating it
They lit their fires by striking a piece of iron against a stone   otherwise they would rub two sticks together
I gave them a box of matches but they were afraid to use them because of the sudden ignition and hissing flare when struck
Their way of hunting used spears the ends of which were poisoned
These forest people would stealthily follow any animal tracks they had observed until they saw the animal lying down for its dayrest
Then they would stalk in closer and hurl their spears directly at it
If the animal they sighted was still foraging for food they would stealthily find cover and creep in as close as possible before sending their spears arching up through the air to fall on their prey
They said that within a range of twenty to thirty metres they could be sure of their meal
A superficial penetration of the spear meant they could eat the meat but if it went in more than one inch all the meat would become contaminated by the poison and be rendered inedible
They once came and offered us some of their meat
It had an offensive rank smell arising from the smoke where it had been roasted
They put it in the fork of some tree branches about ten metres away and its rank and putrid smell almost kept us awake the whole night
Ven
Ajahn Mun told the Mooser to take it and try boiling it but nearly half of it proved to be dirt and so it couldn't be eaten
Their tradition and customs were based in the forest and they never really left it
The only time people ever caught sight of them was when they ventured out to ask for clothing rice salt or iron for their flints
The ancestors of this tribe as I understand it were probably fugitives who had long ago fled from their lords and masters into the jungle
We may deduce this from their taboo against crossing any open areas or cultivated fields
No matter how wide the fields or how difficult the route around they would avoid and bypass any signs of habitation or agriculture  even though nobody had actually forbidden them from crossing
This shows how the tribal elders had misled them away from going into open areas being afraid that someone would spot and take them
This also applies to what I've already said about the women  that if they should catch sight of any stranger a tiger would eat them
When the men came in to ask for rice wheat or yams and taro they would immediately eat everything without leaving any
I told them to take some back to share with their women folk
However they replied that they couldn't do such a thing for if the women ate such foods they would become addicted to the taste and be spoilt
Whenever they came among the Mooser their behavior betrayed their inherent fear of strangers especially of important people or officials
They walked slowly and cautiously always wary and alert in a quite pitiful way
However when they entered the jungle they became so swift and agile that following them was difficult for the eye
All one would see and hear were the stirring and rustling of the leaves
Their marriage customs gave individual freedom to both the women and the men
For example as elsewhere it was common that when a man had good luck and was prospering through successfully bringing in meat and food any woman attracted to him would go and stay with him and become his partner
I forgot to ask whether there was any dowry involved
The raising of children was the sole responsibility of the woman
They had come to see me sometimes
I then had an opportunity to question them about many aspects of their lifestyle and so was able to develop a good understanding about them
Whenever I saw these forest people I felt sympathy and pity because they were also of the same Thai tribe
I could understand every word of their conversation and their physical features were the same as ours in every way
The thought arose deep down in me to find some way to help them to become established in some stable livelihood or at least to assist them to reach the subsistence level of the Mooser and the other hill tribes up in the mountains
If they were willing to receive assistance I intended to inform the appropriate Government authorities so that they could bring in aid such as tools and supplies  including everything all the way to seedlings and seeds
When they later came to see me I sounded them out What do you think of the rice the maize the taro the chili and the salt that you have been given to eat
Was it delicious
Yes they replied it was all very tasty
So I continued if that is the case why don't you come and make a settlement like these Mooser people
You could then plant rice and taro for your own consumption  wouldn't that be good
That was as far as I got for they immediately started to protest that they were a forest people and that they couldn't do such a thing
If they did 'the ground would be turned upside down'
When I heard these objections all my aid plans and projects ceased right there
What a shame
Although these people were endowed with priceless humanity they were unable to take full advantage of it because of their birth in an unsuitable environment
More to be pitied though are some of the people born in an affluent and pleasant environment
They have everything including education opportunities yet heedlessly lose themselves through indulgence in pleasures that are without real substance
Meanwhile time consumes their life so that it isn't used for anything worthwhile
There are so many people like this
In this Rains Retreat Ven
Ajahn Mun not only foretold various things but also spoke of the responsibility he would have to shoulder concerning the group of Kammatthaana forest monks
He spoke of establishing a meditation monastery in the Chiang Mai area and asked if I had any suggestions to offer
I was delighted to hear that he was thinking of resuming responsibility for our group
So I remarked that the people of the Northeast of Thailand were more suited to Dhamma practice than the people of other regions
This was especially so I pointed out in this Northern region where the results had been minimal
Look I said Venerable Ajahn has been in this region for seven or eight years now but who has left their home to follow you and the way of practice
Those who do follow you are all without exception your old disciples from the Northeast
At this very moment the people there both monks and lay people  including Ven
Chao Khun Dhammachedi  are always yearning for you
Everyone pleaded with me to come and invite Ven
Ajahn to return to the Northeast
They are happy to make all the necessary travel arrangements and said that all I had to do was to tell them what was required
Ven
Ajahn Mun then recalled a mountain range towards Nah Kaer District of Sakhon Nakorn Province that would certainly make a good and suitable place to stay
He favored those sort of mountains and so declared that it would be the place for us all to go
But he also said that it would have to be my job to act as 'doorkeeper' for him
If someone came to visit him whom I considered unsuitable he told me that I was not to allow them in to see him
After the Rains Retreat Ven
Ajahn Mun went down to the district of Phrao again
For our part Ven
Ornsee and I had requested permission to remain in that area to continue our meditation efforts to our heart's content
Not many days later Ven
Ajahn Mun returned bringing Ven
Ajahn Sahn Ven
Ajahn Waen and Ven
Ajahn Khao up to see us
He mentioned again about establishing a meditation monastery for the group and I maintained my previous opinion that I didn't agree with it being set up in the North
Nevertheless if Ven
Ajahn did go ahead and establish something in this region after three years I would come and wholeheartedly help
Ven
Ajahn Mun and his group stayed with us for two nights before departing with Ven
Ajahn Sahn Ven
Ajahn Waen and Ven
Ajahn Khao returning to Phrao
Meanwhile Ven
Ajahn Mun and Ven
Manoo went off towards Maer Sai District of Chiang Rai Province where they eventually spent the coming Rains Retreat
Venerable Ornsee and I remained meditating in that place until everybody had gone then we also went our separate ways
Ven
Ornsee staying on there while I went over to another mountain
What I am about to relate makes me feel quite embarrassed but it will put even greater shame on the defilements
What was it
Well it happened when I left Ven
Ornsee and went off to stay alone
One day I heard a tiger roar and became so terrified by its noise that I began to tremble and shake so much that I couldn't sleep and my meditation wouldn't settle down at all
Some local people helped to chase it away by firing threatening shots with their guns and by hurling firebrands at it
It fled for a moment but then came back again
In the early morning when the villagers were going out to work in the fields they would sometimes spot the tiger crouching in the jungle ahead of them
They would then run away  although I never heard that it had done any harm to anyone
No matter how I tried to sit in meditation it just didn't seem to come together
At that point I was still unaware that it was all to do with my fear of the tiger
My whole body would be soaked in sweat
Hey I thought what's all this about then
I'm cold and yet I'm still sweating
I tried removing the blanket wrapped around me and saw that I was still trembling
I felt exhausted with not being able to progress with my meditation
Then I thought of lying down to rest a little and refresh myself ready for future efforts
At that very moment I heard the tiger roar out and my whole body started shivering and shaking as if I had a malarial fever
It was then I realized that this was all due to my fear of the tiger's roar
I sat up and established mindfulness settling the mind in stillness on a single object and ready to sacrifice my life
Hadn't I already accepted death
Wasn't that the reason for my coming to live here
Aren't tiger and human both a fabrication of the same four elements
After death won't both end in the same condition
Who eats whom  who is the one who dies and who is the one that doesn't die
When I was willing to relinquish and investigate in this dauntless singleminded way I could no longer hear the noise of the tiger
Whenever I afterwards heard the tiger's roar my mind remained quite unconcerned
I now saw it just as air reverberating from a material form causing sound
Ever since childhood I had had a natural tendency to be easily upset being of a rather nervous disposition
The sound of the tiger had brought up some past conditioning that had caused my unconscious fear
It is these latent defilements lying submerged in the depths of the heart that are so extremely difficult to dispose of
To conquer the defilements is absolutely impossible without a willingness to relinquish one's attachment and grasping for these conditioned things
There has to be an exchange of things wholly devoid of value for the taste of the deathless  that is only found within the heart
Although Venerable Sariputta the righthand disciple of the Lord Buddha could abandon these things when he became an arahant his character traits remained  unlike the Fully Enlightened Buddha
During this period when I was fearlessly pressing forward with my practice something disagreeable came up as a meditation vision
It's something that should be revealed to my readers so that some of the shameful tendencies of the defilements can be exposed
Recognition of the harm of this type of defilement might then perhaps serve as a caution for their future restraint
The image that appeared was that of a middleaged woman someone whom I well remembered from about five or six years previously
She had then been a lay supporter of mine full of faith and sincere intentions
I considered her a good person a person of Dhamma courteous and refined someone suitable for me to be associated with and a fine example of a genuine upaasikaa of the Buddhist Teachings
Her physical appearance was rather ordinary or so it seemed to me
Apart from that I had never given her much thought except recalling her kind support to me as a monk  for a monk lives dependent on others
When the image appeared in my meditation she seemed to be sitting close to me on my right in a rather familiar way
There then arose in my heart a spontaneous feeling as if the two of us had been living closely together for what seemed like decades
Yet there was no lust or desire involved in it
This shocked me
I withdrew from meditation and examined my heart but I couldn't detect any feelings of attachment towards her
Furthermore I hadn't given her a moment's thought over the previous five or six years
Why then should I have such a vision
After a more thorough investigation I came to understand the nature of the latent defilement of sensuality
This lies deeply submerged in the 'ocean bed' beyond the reach and understanding of the negligent person
 A person possessing wisdom but lacking faith energy and dauntless perseverance will be incapable of searching out and confronting it
 A person possessing faith energy and dauntless perseverance but lacking wisdom will still be incapable of eliminating it
 A person possessing faith energy and dauntless perseverance together with wisdom and someone who develops meditation by steadily cultivating those virtuous qualities without lapses will be able totally to eliminate the latent tendencies
I then proceeded to reflect further about those meditators who had successfully achieved all the absorptions yet could still be deceived and fall down badly because of the defilements of sensuality and lust
They take the sort of vision that I have just mentioned as genuine as truly signifying that they had been husband and wife in a previous life
This leads to the arising of tenderness and affection sexual excitement and desire that develop as is their wont into the searching out of that 'vision'
There is then a meeting and a frank telling of what should not be revealed
The twin live wires already run side by side and if some metal object comes too close it has to be attracted and pulled in
They make contact and that is why it's possible for so many meditators particularly monks  sometimes they have even been senior Teachers  to fall into the abyss
On seeing such a vision instead of being alarmed and seeing it as a threat and danger  and therefore arming themselves for victory over it  they submit and ally themselves with it
What a waste
The Lord Buddha recounted how human beings and animals born into this world one and all have been mothers and fathers sisters and brothers husbands and wives
They have all been relatives to one another  in one or another birth
Perhaps even the poultry and pork that we eat might be the flesh of our father or mother from a previous birth
We still have defilements and so are liable to die and take birth to die and be born through countless lives
Yet what sort of case is it when a seductive vision arises just once and one is lured away and goes after it
Well now that we have already exposed and shamed Maara the defilements I would like to relate another instance
This concerns an attractive young woman
She and her parents and relatives held me in deep regard and I tried to help by advising and instructing her in morality and virtue
I particularly wanted her to see the hazard inherent in the feminine condition and to keep to the brahmacariya precepts all her life
Yet events didn't turn out that way for instead she went and lost her virginity in a very unfortunate way
When she came to her senses she was overwhelmed by tearful remorse
I happened to hear about this and felt a deep weariness with all such gullibility and credulousness
Afterwards she both respected me and felt ashamed before me
All I could think of was 'how could things have come to this pass'
Looking at her I felt that although her form might appear human her mindstate was that of an animal
The more I thought about it the more it made me feel sick and tired about her and the whole matter  almost to the point of nausea
This state of mind persisted for many years afterwards and that nauseous feeling would arise whenever I recalled the incident
There was such a strong feeling of weariness  I had never felt anything quite so deeply before  yet it certainly was not the correct way of practice
However that had all happened in the past
Afterwards I came to reflect on the harm of sensuality pondering the extent of its fierce severity
When it arises in the underlying personality of anyone it can vent its power and devour its victim
This may happen regardless of whether the person has moral principles or is delinquent or whether they are seasoned meditators who have reached the highest levels of absorption
The only exceptions being the Lord Buddha and the arahants
Sensuality is totally lacking kindness or consideration being like a tiger pouncing on a defenceless puppy and coldbloodedly consuming it
This made me feel a lot more sensitive and open towards that young woman
She had always had wholesome intentions had hoped to be good yet passion can be so very destructive
It pounces without caring whom its victim is
It is this sensual desire that must bear so much of the blame and is unforgivable
This increased my sympathy and compassion for her
Those who are still sunk in the depths of the flood of sensual desires must come to birth in the sensual realm
This sensual realm or sphere is a place to develop spiritual virtues
For those who want to progress in the way of the heart it is the field of battle where one can fight for victory
While for miscreants it can become their graveyard
The sensual realm or plane of existence is endowed with a full complement of natural resources and all the outer and the inner ones are complete
Persons of wisdom can take advantage of this in whatever way they want
If there are no trees in the forest where will one go to find herbal medicines
If there are no doctors then such medicines remain useless
If there are medicine and doctor but the sick patient refuses treatment or will not take the prescription they cannot cure their illness
Those who see any 'worth' in the sphere of sensuality and engross themselves in its array of sensual delights are called 'worthies of sensuality'
Those whom the poison of sensuality has infected and are aware of its virulence are called 'handicapped by sensuality'
Those who have totally relinquished all sensuality are called 'freed from sensuality'
Returning to where I had stayed before I exchanged places with Ven
Ornsee
It was then that I really did have quite an encounter with a tiger
One night a tiger came and pounced on and began to eat a water buffalo close by my hut
I tried to drive it away by striking a bamboo and shouting loudly but the tiger would have none of it
It refused to let go of its prey and succeeded in dragging it away to eat
This time I was not afraid but I didn't dare leave my hut and go over to aid the water buffalo in case the tiger decided to gobble up a man too
As the two of us had spent enough time meditating in that place we moved on to other Mooser villages scattered along those mountains
After we had spent some time introducing them to Dhamma and inspiring them with faith we returned down to the district of Phrao
Then we looked around the region of Chiang Dao before returning to Maer Dtaeng District
The small forest monastery at Pong Village was where Ven
Ajahn Mun had once stayed for the Rains Retreat
Ven
Chao Khun Phra Upaaliigunuupamaacaariya had also spent some time there
The lay people of this village were quite clever and had a reasonably good understanding of Dhamma
That year's Rains saw five of us staying there Ven
Ajahn Boontham Venerable Kheung a monk from Loei Province Ven
Ajahn Chorp and myself
I was the head monk and so had to choose suitably skillful means to use in my Dhamma talks to the group so that they would gain a solid basis for their future individual Dhamma practice
In this group it was Ven
Ajahn Chorp who was the most strict in his dhutanga practices
While including all the monks gathered for that Rains Retreat it would be difficult to find a better group of Dhamma companions
I gave a Dhamma talk almost every night and throughout the instruction my companions would willingly listen with calm and attentive minds
Afterwards I would give them an opportunity to bring up any questions or problems and to air whatever views they had
Besides Ven
Ajahn Chorp Ven
Kheung was particularly gifted in the faculty of knowing another person's mind
If something was preoccupying anyone's mind or if someone had committed any breach of the monastic Rule one of these two monks would detect it
In our group the monk whom I felt most sorry for was Ven
Ajahn Boontham
He had been a monk for many years but still couldn't meditate very well
Ven
Ajahn Chorp and Venerable Kheung were able to follow everything he was thinking and doing which concerned matters in which he certainly shouldn't have been indulging
Whenever his companions cautioned him about it he would readily admit his faults and would even humbly bow to them even though they were his juniors
His feelings of inadequacy and shame in front of the group went with his having missed meeting Ven
Ajahn Mun  although he had once been a disciple of Ven
Ajahn Singh
He really wanted to hear a sermon by Ven
Ajahn Mun and believed that he was already knowledgeable enough instantly to understand and gain insight into Dhamma
I was continually warning him not to be presumptuous and to be careful when he did come to meet and listen to Ven
Ajahn Mun's Dhamma talk
His overconfidence might make him unreceptive and cause him to feel negative towards the Venerable Ajahn
After the Rains Retreat was over Ven
Ajahn Mun returned to visit us again and Ven
Ajahn Boontham was able to listen to a Dhamma talk
That was all it took for regrettably it had the opposite effect to what he had expected and he became dissatisfied with the methods of training offered by Ven
Ajahn Mun
Later perhaps because he felt so let down he deserted the group and went off wandering alone
However he met with misfortune and contracted cerebral malaria
Ven
Ajahn Reean found him and helped to bear him back to Chiang Mai where he died in the hospital without any relatives or disciples being around to help nurse him
After staying to receive teachings from Ven
Ajahn Mun for a suitable length of time Venerable Kheung and I took our leave to go off in search of solitude and secluded places by following the Maer Dtaeng River upstream
We stayed in a secluded spot near a mountain area of tea plantations
I left Venerable Kheung to watch over our belongings in an abandoned monastery at the foot of the mountain while I climbed the ridge to find a suitable place to stay above
It happened that a young woman came strolling by flirting with some local young men
Venerable Kheung saw this and he too became intensely excited
When I came back down from my place on the mountain and saw the state he was in I tried to counsel him and recommended various ways he could use to still the emotion  but without success
I had had an intimation of such a possibility ever since he had first come to stay with me
At that time he had told me about a vision that he had experienced while staying with Ven
Ajahn Mun in Maer Suay District
He said that hearing about me had inspired him so much that he wished to meet me
He had then had a vision
'A road appeared that led straight from him to where I was
He made a troublefree journey along the road that ended right at the foot of the stairs leading to my hut
He then seemed to catch hold of the stairs and started climbing  they seemed extremely high  up to me
After bowing to me three times I offered him a complete set of robes but he refused to accept them'
It seemed that circumstances were beginning to fit in with his vision
I also felt as if our sympathetic association had reached its limit
That morning during the meal he had lost his temper with me over some insignificant issue
By the evening he had come to see me and admitted his fault
He related his experience of the previous evening when lust had overcome him at seeing the flirtatious young woman
His meditation throughout the following night had not been successful and he came to take his leave and go off wandering alone
About three months later we met again and I encouraged him to make a fresh start with his meditation If you have enough determination it's still possible for you to succeed
Please just have done with it and start afresh
Nevertheless he wouldn't accept this advice and afterwards I learned with great regret that he had disrobed
He was a strongwilled individual and did nothing in half measures but he was also very opinionated and even Ven
Ajahn Mun's Dhamma talks didn't always convince him
He had once been a 'tough guy' back in his home village before ordaining and leaving without any real goal in mind
He originally came from Nam Gam Village in the district of Taht Panom
The Six Higher Psychic Powers  one example being 'knowing the minds of other beings'  are not something common to every person
They will not necessarily arise in the practice of everyone who meditates
With some people no matter how refined their mind becomes no higher powers will arise
While other people meditate and when the mind converges into momentary or access concentration these powers develop
Venerable Kheung was adept at training his mind to enter tranquillity and he could remain in such a calm state all day and night
While walking around in seemingly quite an ordinary way in his mind he would feel as if he were walking on air
While at other times he might feel as if he had penetrated into the interior of the earth
Although Ven
Kheung's mind didn't withdraw from concentration he lacked the wisdom to investigate the Three Characteristics
His powers were therefore only of the mundane sort arising out of mundane absorption
Let alone Ven
Kheung just consider Venerable Devadatta who had been able to consult with Prince Ajaatasatthu by flying in through the palace window  that is until his abilities failed
Nong Doo was a Mon village
The monks of the village seemed quite strict with their keeping of the monastic Rule
However the villagers also said that their abbot was supernaturally quite powerful
Whenever the villagers went to a festival or fair he would consecrate and empower some sesame seed oil and give it to them to drink and rub on their bodies
This would make them invulnerable to stabs and blows
When they went to neighbouring village fairs the other village folk would have to watch out for them very carefully
The villagers from Nong Doo were confident in their Abbotteacher's power and so started to consider themselves superior without fear of anyone else
The nearby villages gathered together laid out a plan and arming themselves to the teeth came en masse to invest Nong Doo Village intent on taking their revenge by wiping it out
When the resident menfolk there realized what was happening they had taken to their heels and hid themselves in the jungle to save their skins
The Abbotteacher was already eighty years old when he was converted from such practices by the teachings of a wandering meditation monk who stayed at his monastery
Remarkably he was able to gain some insight into the truth of the Dhamma teachings of the Lord Buddha
He then felt such faith in the meditation monk that he could give up his conceited opinions and offer himself as a disciple of the younger monk
Later the whole monastery supported by the lay people decided to change over to become part of the Dhammayut' community
Somdet Phra Maha Virawong when he was still Phra aanadilok and acting abbot of Wat Chedi Luang in Chiang Mai requested that I become the first abbot of the reestablished Wat Nong Doo with Ven
Palat Tongsook as deputy abbot
It was during this Rains Retreat that Ven
Mahaa Kan learned to give his first sermon and taught Dhamma studies
I instructed the lay community during this Rains Retreat
This inspired their faith so much that on the Quarter Moon Days they came to the monastery to observe the Eight Precepts in unprecedented numbers
Whole households would lock up the house and come to observe the Eight Precepts and spend the night in the monastery
Traditionally Mon young women were not expected to observe the Eight Precepts
For the young men it was the opposite
When the young men disrobed after their temporary ordination they would unfailingly continue to go every week to the monastery and keep the Eight Precepts
These people were really exemplary for despite their far from easy living conditions they were extremely devout
I also taught them to establish themselves steadfastly in the Three Refuges and to abandon their wrong views and beliefs in spiritworship
Many agreed to this and willingly renounced their Mon spirit worship and came to request the Three Refuges instead
Unfortunately after the Rains Retreat I had to leave them and travel back to the Northeast so things had to be suspended there
Being a millionaire or a pauper does not stand in the way of gaining the Noble Treasure of one endowed with faith and wisdom
This is why this Noble Treasure surpasses all other wealth
Before leaving the North I went to pay my respects to Ven
Ajahn Mun
He had spent the Rains Retreat at Wat Chedi Luang in Chiang Mai at the request of Somdet Phra Maha Virawong
I again took the opportunity to invite him to return to the Northeast having already submitted one invitation before the Retreat had started
He remarked that he had also received a letter of invitation from Ven
Chao Khun Dhammachedi
In fact I had been the one who had written to Ven
Chao Khun Dhammachedi suggesting that such an invitation be sent
I had done this after sounding out Ven
Ajahn Mun and sensing that there was a chance that he might be willing to return
When I enquired again about his going back he said that he would go at the right time
I then respectfully informed him of my own plans to go back and took leave of him
I explained that I had already been in the Northern region for quite a long time and felt that however things might turn out I would be able to take care of myself
After writing another letter to Ven
Chao Khun Dhammachedi explaining the situation I set out
This time they arranged for a boy to accompany me on my journey but Ven
Ornsee stayed behind with Ven
Ajahn Mun
When I reached Tah Bor in Nongkhai Province I was determined that the group of monks there be trained to be rigorous and conscientious in their practice
However after attempting this for around three or four years the results were only about or per cent of what they could have been
Later they seemed even less
I therefore turned more to integrating the study aspects into the practice
Together with that I also led all the monks in the daily chanting and afterwards we would practice the rhythmic styles of both mokotsangyok and roygaaw chanting
We would regularly finish by chanting the Patimokkha Rule and by that I was able to produce many expert chanters
The benefits became so obvious that I have continued this way of practice right up to the present
After I had stayed two Rains Retreats in Wat Araññavaasee  from to  I led the lay supporters to build a small monastery on the western side of Glahng Yai Village
It is now a permanent monastery and has continued to have resident monks and novices through each Rains Retreat
They have now named it Wat Nirodharangsee
It was during this period that Ven
Chao Khun Dhammachedi began to take a greater interest in meditation practice and in Venerable Ajahn Mun
In truth when Ven
Chao Khun Dhammachedi was still a novice  before he had gone off to Bangkok to study  he had been a disciple of Ven
Ajahn Sao and Ven
Ajahn Mun
At that time however he had shown no interest in the way of practice
I think it was probably at the time of the boundarystone laying ceremony at Wat Bodhisomphorn that he became more closely acquainted with the two venerable Ajahns
They so aroused his interest that he was always questioning me about their way of practice and about their character and qualities
He would sometimes ask me to give him a sermon based on what I had heard from the two Ajahns
When I recounted such teaching he would silently listen with great attention and respect
Afterwards Ven
Chao Khun Dhammachedi sent Ven
Ajahn Oon Dhammadharo to Chiang Mai to invite Ven
Ajahn Mun to return but without success
Ven
Ajahn Oon reported to Ven
Ajahn Mun about his vegetarian practices and this eventually led to quarreling and discord in the group
Ven
Ajahn Mun said that none of the arahants had ever quarreled over food and excrement so why were those present now doing so
Ven
Chao Khun Dhammachedi had to go to Bangkok on Sangha affairs and when they were completed he carried on to Chiang Mai and made the invitation himself
Ven
Ajahn Mun said Hey what's this you've come with the 'big letter'

I remained at Wat Araññavaasee in Tah Bor for a period approaching nine years
This was a record for my ordained life until then
I had never taken any interest in building work because I considered it an interference and not the task of a recluse
Thinking that one ordained should rather concentrate all his energies on the duties of a recluse
When I arrived in Wat Araññavaasee I realized that all the dwelling places there were an inheritance from the previous generation of senior monks
They had constructed them and we all lived in them
I then reflected on those clauses in the monastic Rule where permission is given to repair any existing dwelling places
This led me to feel rather ashamed of myself for I seemed to have been so busy making use of these resources and merely monitoring this heritage from the previous Teachers
This was when I began to guide the lay supporters in building projects and I've continued right up to the present day
However at no point have I gone out and solicited donations for this work
I have always been extremely sensitive about this  if the resources were available the work went forward if they weren't then we simply stopped the work
I never allowed myself to become bound to any project so that if it couldn't be finished or was underfunded I could easily abandon it without any feelings of attachment
While I was at Wat Araññavaasee I directed the lay supporters in the construction of two new huts a large study hall and many other smaller structures
Before this extended period at Wat Araññavaasee I can't remember ever staying anywhere longer than three Rains Retreats
It may have been due to the long period of my stay or perhaps for some other reason that my neurological disorder recurred
However I still forced myself to endure it so that those who wanted to study and practice there were given a good opportunity
In Venerable Gate came to spend the Rains Retreat with us
He died during the Retreat from appendicitis
He had been ordained for fourteen years and was fortyeight years old
Since his ordination   we had never before stayed together for a Rains Retreat
It now seems that our coming together was not a good omen
When he came I wasn't giving many sermons to the lay devotees and instead had them meditating quietly on their own
My neurological disorder had grown so much worse that after I took the Dhamma seat to give a sermon I had no idea what I was talking about  but I could still speak all right
When I finished my sermon I would ask the listening lay people what I had been speaking about and whether it had made sense
They answered that they could understand it very well
It was just as it had always been
One day I had a dream in which Venerable Gate and I were walking on tudong together through the jungle
We came to a stream and started following the stream bed
The water wasn't very deep only reaching our waists yet it didn't appear to wet our robes
I noticed how fresh the water looked and felt like scooping it up in my hands to rinse my mouth out
When I did take a mouthful I gargled with it and then spat it out  and all my teeth came out with the water
Waking up I thought that it had really happened
I had to feel in my mouth before I knew it was only a dream
I had never really believed in the absolute truth of dreams
I thought that dreams occurred through our not attending to the activities of the mind so that it dithers when we fall asleep and then trails after its preoccupations
If we were to take care of the heart then there would be no dreaming
If however we did dream we would be aware of the dreaming though we couldn't get up because the body remained still
When the body was able to move again and could get up the mind would no longer be asleep
Dreaming would occur when the heart wasn't asleep but was vacillating and dithering
When I refused to believe in the dream a vision appeared to my inner sight
As I've mentioned above I became ill about four or five days before the full moon of the tenth lunar month
It was the time of the traditional festival of Khao Boon Salahkpat and I was feeling so unwell that I couldn't stand up without vomiting
I lay down with closed eyes and when I opened them again I found myself gazing at the sky with clouds passing across the sun
It hurt my eyes and I vomited
It happened to be an Observance Day but I couldn't manage to go and give a sermon so instead they invited Venerable Gate
He gave a sermon for one and a half hours
The people listening were quite amazed at this not expecting him to be able to do so much
The next morning my nervous disorder seemed to have cleared up and I was invited away to a meeting
At around eleven o'clock in the morning someone came to tell me that Venerable Gate had stomach pains and so I returned to the monastery
When I arrived all I could do was look at him for we had no medicines and I didn't know what else to do
More than ten years before he had been ill with similar symptoms
Sometimes if medicine were available he would take it and get better while at other times it seemed to clear up even without medicines
He had once been ill for five days and nights at Nah Seedah Village without being able to lie down or eat
The illness had then cleared up after he had used his finger to remove three or four small lumps  I don't know what they were  from his anus
In those days modernstyle doctoring had yet to spread widely
If one's stomach was painful one found some stomachache pills to swallow
We didn't know anything about the appendix
If the stomach pains came from food poisoning or from fermentation and flatulence they would clear up
If they came from appendicitis they wouldn't and countless people died of it
This time Venerable Gate really did have appendicitis  and we had no medicine
The pain was almost beyond bearing so that he was tossing about but I never heard him cry out
Finally he managed to get out a few words
He said that he certainly wouldn't be able to carry on in that way
He thought that trying some walking meditation might help so he asked us to assist him up to the meditation path where he took about four or five steps before collapsing
The monks and novices who were attending him saw his condition and brought him back to lie down where he had been before
At that time I had begun to feel so weak after caring for him for such an extended period that I had asked leave from everyone to go and rest
A novice then came to call me with news that Venerable Gate had become very weak and fainted
I rushed to see and found that he was lying there without speaking
Coming closer I reminded him of Dhamma and asked if he could hear what I was saying
He replied that he could and this continued until about eight o'clock that night when he died
Venerable Gate had been a person of great endurance in times of both sickness and health
It wasn't just the one illness either for he had also suffered from appendicitis kidney stones and malaria
Even when his appendix became infected for many days he neither complained nor troubled anyone
He would quietly lie there alone
If he were able to eat he would eat and if he couldn't he would just continue quietly to lie there
He had always eaten only a small amount and had never been fussy about food
Once he had managed on plain rice and salt for more than ten days
All the meditation teachers had praised his great qualities of endurance
After I had arranged his funeral and finished the Rains Retreat of my mother also passed away
That year had seen the whole village and town come down with infected sores and ulcers and this included my mother who had an ulcer on her shin
Those who were affected had gone for treatment and were all cured except my mother
I fetched the particular medicines that should have been effective in treating her but the problem didn't clear up
The flesh started festering and was suppurating so much that it fell away exposing the bone
There was no pain however
While my mother was ill in Nah Seedah Village Glahng Yai Subdistrict of Nongkhai I had spent the Rains Retreat in Tah Bor District of Nongkhai Province
The block that had made me so incredulous about the validity of my dream abruptly cleared up
The morning after dreaming that all my teeth had fallen out I felt certain that I would have some traveling to do that day
I returned from my alms round and saw someone waiting for me with news that my mother's condition had seriously deteriorated
Those who mark dreams down as unbelievable useless affairs  well they can think what they want
But I accept them with percent certainty
If one dreams that one's teeth fall out then it definitely means that one's father or mother or one of one's brothers or sisters is very ill or has died
It might otherwise relate to a very close friend or acquaintance
I nursed my mother as much as I could with both spiritual medicine and with medication but her body was already extremely aged
She was eightytwo years old
Whatever medicine we brought no longer seemed to help for she could no longer take it and her condition continued to deteriorate
This went on until things could no longer hold together and just as an old brown leaf falls she withered away and sank
Nevertheless I ministered to her heart and mind supporting her mindfulness and settling her in full tranquillity right up to the final moment when little breath remained
I thus fulfilled the obligations necessary for an ideal son
When her condition had still been stable she had always thought of me as an adviser
She would consult me if she wanted for anything or if she had any problems and would adopt any opinion I offered
When she was unwell I had supported her mindfulness so that sometimes she wouldn't need to take any other medicine
She had often recovered through her trust and faith in my teaching
It was the same when she was approaching death and perhaps it was due to this that the wound in her leg was not painful
I had experienced a vision of this mountain while staying in Wat Araññavasee Tah Bor but it was still very different from my expectations
For a start it was hardly credible as a place of solitude for it was just a small hill in the middle of fields with villages clustered all around its base
However it was amazing how anyone who went there for meditation practice  whether monk novice or villager  would achieve remarkable results
These would be great or small depending on the basic ability of the person
The strangest case was that of one old man more than seventy years old who with his penchant for drinking liquor all day had been left so destitute that he was dependent on the villagers
They would hire him at fifty baht a month to attend on the resident monks but he wasn't very willing
When I was there he found such faith that it was no longer necessary to hire him to do the job
Such a wonderful vision had arisen in his meditation that he gave up all alcohol and was even able to take on the Eight Precepts on Observance days
The villagers became so impressed with him that he could go into any house or shop and receive a free meal
This made him even more aware of the benefits of his practice and he continued his attendance on the monks
Even stranger was the case of a mute person of Tah Chalaep who was also forced to be dependent on the village
I had taught him by sign language to observe the Eight Precepts on the Observance Day and to meditate
This eventually became so wonderfully meaningful to him that he taught other people by sign language to see the harm of drinking alcohol
While meditating at home his mind would become so bright that he was able to view me in the monastery
I've recently heard that this person is alive and has built a monastery by himself invited monks to stay there and attends on them himself
For myself things were also amazing
I was searching out Dhamma that I never could have conceived of and comprehending Dhamma that I had never known before
The ways and means of the practice were clarified in precise detail so that I felt confident enough to compose my first book Illuminating the Way of Calm and Insight
Following my original plans I continued practicing there for two Rains Retreats
After the end of the second Rains Retreat came news of Ven
Ajahn Mun's illness and I left full of appreciation for the virtues of this small hill
I went to attend on Ven
Ajahn Mun through his last illness until his passing away
After his cremation had been completed I never found an opportunity to return to Khao Noi even though the people there had offered me such outstanding support
I sent other monks to go in my place because my own plans were still uncertain
After the cremation ceremony for Ven
Ajahn Mun was over I pondered on the situation of our group of meditation monks
Until then we had only been a small group and among people in general still not well known
We had had backing and support from some highly placed elders
For example Ven
Chao Khun Phra Upaaliigunuupamaacaariya had always come up to assist us
He had taken it upon himself to deal with any issue involving Sangha affairs that affected us
When he died it was Somdet Phra Maha Virawong who looked after this
After he died Ven
Ajahn Mun Bhuuridatta Thera was already well known and widely respected among the ecclesiastical hierarchy
Then Ven
Ajahn Mun himself passed away and the group seemed to be left alone
The senior ecclesiastical elders neither knew many monks of our group nor did they seem likely to take on obligations about us
Later in fact monks who were disciples of Ven
Ajahn Mun did steadily become more widely known

Such concerns caused me to travel to Bangkok for should the right occasion present itself I would be able to construct some bridges with the elders of the ecclesiastical hierarchy
I could listen to their rulings and strategies and get to know their opinions about our group
I set out and stayed at Wat Bahn Jik in Udorn
Then I came to stay with Ven
Ajahn Orn aanasiri at Wat Tip'rat' in Udorn
He was obviously under the impression that I was deserting our group and going off alone
I had to explain all the facts before he understood my intentions
During the next Rains Retreat I heard that he had gone off to spend the Retreat in Khao Yoi Cave in Phetburi Province so I'm not sure what interpretation he had put on my words
When I reached Bangkok I had the chance to go and pay my respects to many ecclesiastical elders and could learn the attitude of each towards our group of meditation monks
This allowed me to feel quite confident towards the group's position and my own
I wanted to go and look over some of the famous places of meditation practice for example those of Rahtburi and Phetburi
I therefore traveled around those places requesting permission to stay a while and learn from each before eventually reaching Songkla Province
At that time Ven
Khun Siritejodom  who had once been a district officer and then had stayed with me  had gone down to Phuket and Phangnga where he had been spreading Dhamma and the way of practice
He had later been joined in this propagating by Ven
Mahaa Pin Jalito who was a native of Nakorn Patom
However he did not belong to our group
Their activities had overexcited the people so much  it was causing rifts and factional troubles  that the situation was getting out of control
Ven
Mahaa Pin Jalito could no longer handle things and had no group support so when he heard that I was in Songkla he came and appealed for my group to go and help clear up the situation there
To most people of that time the island of Phuket was regarded as an isolated place abundant in valuable natural resources and full of millionaires
Other than the business community most islanders weren't considered to know very much about the outside world
In fact this was about percent accurate because communications were indeed still difficult
One mainly crossed to the island by boat but I remember that my own first visit was by plane
We took off from Songkla and landed in Phuket itself
The only passengers on that trip were we two monks and one lay person its return flight had only one solitary passenger
At that time only a few laborers had come down from the Northeast of Thailand to stay although the locals feared them as if they were somehow monsters or tigers
This originated in various rumours about Northeasterners how 'they were brutal and cruel catching killing and eating children'
I had been on the island for a year before all the Northeaster laborers started heading there
They arrived walking in file along the road and became an object of intense interest to the townspeople
Meanwhile people out on the town's outskirts or in the countryside who saw them coming would flee to the shelter of their homes
Anyone out in the forest ducked and hid themselves in the trees
I didn't witness this with my own eyes but they reported it to me later
The prosperity of any single region of Thailand didn't seem to me to diverge by more than per cent from any of the others
As the Thai saying has it 'If we have a lot we can expend a lot if we have little we can expend a little'
The saddest aspect of the Phuket people was the desire of the poor to present themselves on the same level as the rich
That wasn't so good
When I first went to stay on Phuket Island it caused no excitement but it did bring me some painful encounters
I'm referring to what happened about ten days before the start of the Rains Retreat
A party of people together with a group of local monks schemed together to prevent our residing there
They tried various ways to frustrate us setting fire to our huts poisoning our food throwing stones at us and forbidding the people to give us alms food
When we were out on alms round they would sometimes head straight towards us on a collision course
As we were the visitors in their territory we tried to be as conciliatory as possible
We went to see their head and pleaded to be allowed at least to spend the coming Rains Retreat there for it was already so close
But he wouldn't permit this and further accused us of being vagrant monks
He adamantly rejected whatever explanations and reasons I put forward until finally he let out that it was really his superiors who would not allow us to stay
I therefore told him quite frankly that although he might have his superiors I also had mine
Afterwards I learned that he had set down this serious challenge if Dhammayut' Nikaya monks were able to spend the Rains Retreat in Phuket and Phangnga he would put on trousers
So you can see how disturbing it was
The end result of these events came when our lay devotees eventually did succeed in arranging places for us to spend the Rains Retreat
Fifteen monks and novices had accompanied me that year which with those who had been with me before made eighteen in all
We divided ourselves between three locations Dtagooa Toong Tai Muang and Koke Kloi which was where I was staying
It was during this Rains Retreat that we were not only subjected to buffeting from 'surface waves' but were also affected by pressure from undercurrents
I refer here to other monks of our own Dhammayut' group who started clamouring against us
They accused us of 'not keeping the disciplinary Rule' 'that our practice was outside what the scriptural authorities set down' 'that we didn't observe the Patimokkha Sangha duties inside an official Uposatha Hall'
These monks apparently said that anyone who wanted to be enlightened should go over to Ajahn Thate
If that were their true opinion then it wouldn't be strange for newly ordained ignorant monks
However I did also understand and sympathize with those other monks who were more senior and learned because they only knew about study and had no experience of the way of practice
My circumstances had allowed me the opportunity to practice regularly from the first year of my ordination
The dispute about whether or not we were going to be allowed to stay for the Rains Retreat in that area wasn't yet finished with
I found out that they had sent a report to the Religious Affairs Department which accused us of being 'vagrant monks come to disturb and sow discord among the populace'
An order was issued that details from our monk's identification papers be noted so that a future investigation into the truth of these claims could be made
The Chief Education Officer of the Province however didn't dare come himself and instead sent the local District Education Officer to take the details
I asked to see his official authorization and when he couldn't produce it I refused his inspection
I then gave him a thorough and detailed explanation of the proper procedures for Sangha Affairs
When he went away I still had no idea how they would react to this but later I found that the Ecclesiastical Regional Head Monk had afterwards sent a strongly worded letter of instruction and admonishment to both the Provincial Head Monk and the Provincial Governor
I've related here only a part of what I experienced during my first year's stay in Phangnga Province
If I were to go into everything I fear the reader would get bored with such trifling matters
On being born into this world it becomes inevitable that there will be obstacles to achieving one's goal
Whoever it is whatever their task whether it is done for good or ill decline or progress it will all depend on their circumspection and perseverance on their finding out the causes of the situation and thereby clearing them up
Otherwise there can never be success
As one moves forward this will bring confidence and determination in dealing with such hurdles and this in turn speeds up one's realization
With reference to the Dhammayut' Nikaya monks
They always seemed to be faced with obstacles wherever they went and whatever they did
However they were usually successful in their objectives
Here I would like to quote the fable about the fox and the lamb
'The fox accused the lamb Hey you
Why have you muddied my drinking water by walking through it
The lamb Please Sir I didn't muddy your water I crossed downstream from you
The fox Huh
You may not have muddied my water but your father certainly caused me a lot of trouble
And with that he pounced on the lamb and ate it up
Evam  The End
After the Rains Retreat was over we started building a wooden hut for the abbot but it wasn't completed at that time
That Chinese New Year Madame Loei Woon the wife of Luang Anuphat Phuketgahn who was proprietor of the Chao Fah Mine invited us to go to Phuket
There were four of us Ven
Mahaa Pin Jalito and myself with two novices
Any suitable opportunity that presented itself was used for searching out and setting up a place for us to stay
Leaving Ven
Mahaa Pin Jalito to organize and finish the building work I returned to Koke Kloi where I had spent the previous Rains Retreat
We stayed in Phuket for the Rains Retreat
There were four monks and a novice staying for that Rains Retreat and the monastery was situated at the foot of Dtoh Se Mountain beside the Provincial Town Hall
At first our dwellings were made from nipa palm with a tiny room just big enough to set up a krot with its mosquito net
The exception was the abbot's hut which was a little bigger
They were situated in a dense area of lalang grass up on the slopes of Dtoh Se Mountain below the Phuket Provincial Courthouse
Madame Kae had bought those four rai of land from Nai Borworn the ore dealer for one thousand baht
Previously it had been a coconut plantation belonging to one of the rich old families but had long since fallen into neglect
Nai Borworn had then bought it to mine for ore but as he hadn't found anything had sold it to Madame Kae
As the area that Madame Kae bought was too small I arranged for another four rai to be acquired for another four thousand baht
This was the aforementioned dense tract of lalang grass and it was home to a variety of wild animals including tiger panther stag barking deer wild boar and monkeys
We made little huts in clearings just big enough to sweep around with narrow paths connecting them
One night when I opened my hut to go and meet with the others a tiger noisily jumped away into the forest
Sometimes while we were sitting together having a hot evening drink we could almost see the perpetrator of the roaring and scratching sound in the nearby trees
In broad daylight the tiger would come and pounce on dogs and cats and eat them up
It was fortunate that it didn't go on the rampage  the tiger kept to its own affairs and we humans did the same
The people of Phuket could not even identify the typical tiger's sounds but I had been much in the jungle and knew all its voices
We stayed together in Phuket for fifteen years never returning to spend the Rains Retreat in Phangnga
However the monks of our group throughout the three provinces of Phangnga Phuket and Krabee came under my leadership
We all lived as one monastic community with the same rules and way of practice
A monk or novice from any of our monasteries who was in need of something essential would receive help from those who had things to share and spare
Work at one monastery found everyone else ready and willing to lend a hand in a spirit of harmony
Donations that came to be offered would be collected and assigned for the maintenance of this or that monastery while donations given to individuals would be held in a central fund
Being a Preceptor I put all the donations offered to me personally into the central fund  notwithstanding the objections I received from some quarters
We never worried about not having our own money and the lay supporters conscientiously looked after all our needs
Whatever we lacked would be carefully supplied  even train tickets were offered when we had to travel
Since my ordination I have never come across such excellent care and attention
I will therefore take this opportunity to thank the people there especially of Phangnga and Phuket for all their help and support
During the time I was resident on Phuket Island I was always trying to establish and encourage virtue in both myself and among people in general
I maintained contact with all the local administrative head monks and they always responded with generous support towards our group
Any work or business that arose would often bring them in for mutual consultations and we always understood each other very well
At the entry to the Rains Retreat I led my group of monks to present each senior elder with offerings of respect
This took place every year without fail and was quite unlike what had happened when we were in Phangnga
News even came from Phangnga that it was only Ven
Mahaa Pin Jalito that they disliked and that they didn't mind our group
I think this arose because of Ven
Mahaa Pin Jalito's brusque and outspoken manner of speaking when his listeners provoked him
One really should not take such people so seriously
A Northeaster dialect proverb asserts that 'anyone endorsing such a person won't have a spoon to sip his soup'
We tried our best to train the lay devotees so that they would know the customs and traditions of Buddhism making ourselves a model for them to see
We instructed them about keeping the Uposatha Eight Precepts  not just during the Rains Retreat but outside it too
We supported and strengthened the grounding that they had received from previous monks and then trained them in developing meditation every night
The results of this then became clearly visible to each individual depending on the strength of their faith and dedication to the practice
Another development was the increasing stream of our group of monks from the Northeast coming down to stay with me
The local youths were also regularly finding enough faith to ordain
Those people in the South who admired and appreciated the way of practice came to be trained in the Dhammayut' Community in greater numbers
We expanded into Krabee Province and with Phang nga and Phuket there were eleven monasteries where we could spend the Rains Retreat
All together this meant that in an average year there would be more than one hundred monks resident in these monasteries
This was more than the total monks and novices of Muang District in Phuket at that time and twice the number that had been there when I had first arrived
As our numbers increased I organized the teaching of a regular General Dhamma Studies Course in each monastery
We would all come together at examination time and the first year we went to Wat Mahathat in Nakorn Seedhammaraht Province
In the following years we asked permission to hold the examinations in Wat Chareon Samanakit in Phuket itself
Each year those who were examined in all three grades never numbered less than sixty
They passed with good marks too
Eventually Mahamakut Monastic College upgraded our status to that of a 'level two center'
I saw the benefit to Buddhism's function in having both study and practice  pariyatti and patipatti  going along together
This has been the approach that I have followed up to today
We stayed there struggling against various obstacles throughout fifteen years
It was accomplished for the sake of continuing the Buddhist way for the benefit of both the individual and the community overall
It also fulfilled the wishes of the lay supporters of Phuket and Phangnga who had been so kind and generous to us
At least they were able to become genuinely acquainted with the monks of the Dhammayut' Group and the disciples of Ven
Ajahn Mun Bhuuridatta
In fact the Dhammayut' Group had gone to Phuket many times intent on establishing itself there but it had never been successful
One doesn't need to ask whether Ven
Ajahn Mun was well known there for even his disciples had never managed to penetrate as far as Phuket
Our group had been able to build an established monastery there for the first time in both the history of the Dhammayut' Group and of Phuket
We felt proud of our accomplishments there in repaying the debt that we owed to the people of Phuket and Phangnga  who had never made any claims on us
My apprehensions  those that I expressed in Section
about the administration of our group  seemed to be coming true
It concerned my making contact with the senior elders in Bangkok before I had gone south and when on moving south I had become acquainted with all the senior monks on the way to my stay on the island of Phuket
Phuket was renowned as a place that brought great wealth to anyone who went to stay there
They made accusations even against me saying that I was incredibly rich  of course this was completely untrue
Although I had been in Phuket for fifteen years I didn't have anything because every penny offered to me or to any of the monks went into a central fund that was then all used for building
But in any case not many dwelling places were built there
In the ten years since I came to the Northeast a much greater number have been completed together with an Uposatha Hall and a twostorey study hall
I don't mention this matter out of any disdain for the people of Phuket and Phangnga thinking to answer their doubts about my supposed wealth
They had taken such good care of us  as I've already mentioned they are unequalled anywhere  but the building of monasteries wasn't popular with them
In fact such a view was good in its own way for if a monastery were to be built in an overly grand and luxurious style it would then become a burden and worry when one was away
I departed Phuket Island without any worries although I did sympathize with the villagers there who had looked after us so well
On departure I left more than one hundred thousand baht for Ven
Phra Khru Sathidabuññaarakkh' who had been building an Uposatha Hall for four or five years and this allowed it to be finished in record time
The site of this Uposatha Hall was on a mountain slope that had to be levelled first
I don't think that any of the other monks of Phuket and Phangnga could have hoped to have finished such a building within only four or five years
It is quite a record
The senior elders in Bangkok and the lay devotees in general took a much greater interest in us when they saw how our groups were settling on Phuket Island
However I remained unmoved by all this extra attention
I've already explained how encountering obstacles had become quite an ordinary event for me because I had to overcome so many before
At that time Wat Mahaa Dhaatuyuvaraajarangsarit' in Bangkok had begun to popularize the Burmese meditation technique of 'rising and falling'
Although they widely publicized their technique they never ventured out into the jungle remaining in the villages and monasteries
Many people made their grade in the technique some of them so much so that they became unaware of how inflexible they were
At the same time Wat Raajapraditth' Wat Bovoranives and other monasteries initiated a group
It was formed from the disciples of Ven
Ajahn Mun Bhuuridatta Thera
They had been practicing for more than fifty years but had never publicized themselves
When one group uses publicity and the other doesn't it follows that both groups will become well known
'Becoming well known without a lot of noise' happened in this way
In the Ecclesiastical Regional Governor invited Ven
Ajahn Singh Khantayaagamo to go and teach meditation to the Buddhists of Phetburi Province
On the fifth of December he requested that Ven
Ajahn Singh' be given the title of Ven
Phra Khru aanavisitth'
He also asked that a title be given to me but this didn't come about because I wasn't head of a monastery that had been officially recognized by the Sangha Act
On the thirtieth of May they appointed me a Preceptor and simultaneously Ecclesiastical Head Monk of the districts of Phangnga Phuket Krabee
On the fifth of December I received the title of Phra Khru Nirodharangsee
On the sixteenth of June I became the Acting Ecclesiastical Provincial Governor of Phangnga Phuket Krabee Provinces
I also held the office of Director of Dhamma Studies for these three provinces
On the fifth of December I received the title of the ordinary level the insight category of Phra Rajanirodharangseekampiira'paññaajarn'
At the same time Ven
Ajahn Singh Khantayaagamo received the title Phra aanavisitth'samiddhiviiraajaarn' and Ven
Ajahn Lee Dhammadharo was made Phra Suddhidhammarangsiikampira' medhaajarn'
On the twentieth of August I was made full Ecclesiastical Governor of those three provinces
On the twentyeighth of November I asked to resign from both my administrative governing positions and remained with just an honorary rank
This may have been the first time  except for the Chao Khun Vipassanaa Koson Thera of Wat Phaseechareon  that meditation monks received such royal ecclesiastical rank
Before this there had only been the designation without anybody truly taking it on
This can be seen where important elder's names are listed and the appellation araññavaasee is appended
From that time onward a steady stream of senior meditation Ajahns of the lineage of Ven
Ajahn Mun were to receive ecclesiastical titles
I would in fact prefer that these titles were not given to our group of meditating monks because they don't seem appropriate
I once sent a private letter to the senior elders opposing this practice especially when it concerned the disciples of Ven
Ajahn Mun Bhuuridatta Thera
I had also challenged it when I met them face to face and I referred to what I considered was the appropriate way to go
I had compared it to hanging jewellery around the neck of a monkey  it wouldn't mean anything to the monkey
Still this is only my personal opinion  although some monkeys decorated in such a way might even suggest that they were humans
However the final result was that the elders requested that this practice of giving ecclesiastical titles should go forward for the benefit of the administration of the Sangha as a whole
We have all been born into this vast world with its privileges and freedoms
Yet whatever our condition or status every one of us is liable to be encircled by the worldlydhammas
It will all depend on whether we are willing to submit to their dominance in our heart
We might also be able to turn the worldlydhammas to some use
Before when the monks or anyone for that matter saw me coming they thought that I was a rustic old monk out of the forest
Actually I preferred it when people considered me in such a way
Yet as soon as I had position and rank I could go anywhere and anyone seeing me would greet me with my title and an invitation
Contacting people about assistance for some project or other was made even easier
The receiving of such rank and title adds to one's obligations and burden therefore I don't think such honors are at all suitable for those monks who wish for peace and solitude in the forest
During the first few years on Phuket Island things had gone well and my health had been fairly good but in later years I had become increasingly sensitive to the climate
This followed the normal course of my 'wanderlust symptoms' for wherever I stayed my health wouldn't remain sound for more than three years
In my heart I had never intended to stay permanently in Phuket and I had said as much to my fellow monks and the lay people when I had first gone there
Still I ended up staying there for all of fifteen years because of the earnest requests from senior monks and the lay people
By it was time to bid a sympathetic farewell to the tearful people of Phangnga PhuketKrabee bequeathing to the Southern people all the various monasteries that we had established through our effort of mind and body and through their contributions and material resources
I also left them my ecclesiastical titles and honors
May all the people of the South who were so kind and supportive of us may they all without exception find only happiness and success and be blessed with ever growing station prosperity long life health and complete contentment
May all the monasteries there develop and grow for the benefit of all
Leaving Phuket Island and being freed of all those burdens I was determined to follow my old inclinations towards solitude and peace
When visiting Ven
Ajahn Fan in Phannah Nikom District I went on farther to see his monastery in the Khahm Cave
I was delighted with it and asked his permission to spend one Rains Retreat there
Although the monastery didn't extend over a great area and the mountain wasn't so high the climate and atmosphere were excellent
Ven
Ajahn Fan had been conscientious and at the end of each Rains Retreat he had led the villagers in extending the track up the mountain until it had almost reached the top
The villagers actually enjoyed helping with the work and if called by Ven
Ajahn Fan they would drop whatever they were engaged with to go and help
All feelings of exhaustion from the long climb up to his monastery would disappear with a revitalising rest of five or six minutes
The atmosphere there was such that it more than compensated for the energy expended in climbing up
Some homebound people say that There's no need to go looking for the right place or climate for everything depends on the conditions within oneself
Making peace and solitude within oneself is all that has to be done
Yet this is not true because all four supporting conditions give real energy to the Dhamma practice
Unless we become like the domesticated pig of the village changing our abode means varying the atmosphere and our disposition too
The domesticated pig and the wild boar are very different animals  even their food and behavior stand out in stark contrast
During that Rains Retreat I could give full energy to my practice because all the lay devotees and monks had already been well trained by Ven
Ajahn Fan
I therefore was not hampered by having to train them again
Such a steady and uninterrupted development of the practice allows realizations and strategies directly applicable to oneself to arise in quite wonderful ways
I didn't need to sit and close my eyes for meditation was always developing wherever I happened to be
Whatever I took up for examination whether it was myself other people or even the landscape and scenery it would all bring Dhamma discernment
Past memories and concerns  whether they were of worldly desires or not  were taken up solely with a view towards developing disenchantment with them all
After the Rains Retreat Ven
Ajahn Khao led a group of his disciples up to visit us for a time
He was also pleased with the place and even asked me to take over his monastery at Wat Tam Klong Paen so that he could come and stay there himself
But I had already unloaded myself of such burdens and didn't want any more
Shortly after that I was invited to attend a funeral in Udornthani and so was able to travel on to visit Wat Tam Klong Paen for the first time
However I didn't like the air there
I left Udornthani after the ceremony was over and went to stay at Wat Pah Phra Sathit in Srii Chiang Mai District with Ven
Ajahn Booa Pha Paññaabhaaso
I then took a boat with Ven
Kam Pan and we went to seek solitude at Hin Mark Peng
Hin Mark Peng was well known among the people of those parts for its extreme cold
They had a saying If you don't have a blanket don't go and sleep at Hin Mark Peng
It's the coldest spot in all that region during the Cool Season
It was a place haunted by fierce spirits and wild animals such as tigers and bears
About forty years previously anyone passing by boat would remain deadly silent and not even dare look up
Fears like this led it to become a place of isolation and solitude without anyone daring to go near
Such isolation always attracted forest meditation monks so that they could put the quality of their renunciation to the test
Any forest monk able to stay there considered it a sign of the steadfastness and confidence of his practice while his Dhamma companions saw him as truly courageous in renunciation
It also became a place of significance for the law enforcement officers
As the surrounding population started to expand the wild animals were forced out and gradually disappeared
Smugglers and cattle rustlers then used it as a place for sending contraband across the river
Whenever any water buffalo or cattle went missing or if news came of smuggling activities government officers and those who had lost their things would gather there to wait in ambush to recover their property and catch the culprits
Eventually such a bad reputation also tarnished the neighbouring villages of Koke Sooak Phra Baht and Hooay Hat
Whenever the old people who were custodians of the local history got together they would always tend to tell about the future of Hin Mark Peng Kings from three cities would come to develop a flourishing Hin Mark Peng
This arose because of those three great rocks lined up together on the bank of the Mekong River
The northern rock would belong to Luang Phra Bahng the middle rock to Bangkok and the southern rock to Vientiane
Listening to this made me laugh for whoever would come and build anything worthwhile in such a place
The jungle there was impenetrable
It was home to wild animals that were still to be found there more than forty years later  towards the end of  when I first came to check out the place
I both saw and heard the barking deer and partridges while to my delight overgrown monkeys appeared leaping from branch to branch
This kind of air and landscape were rare so I was delighted to have discovered such a place
I therefore resolved to come with Ven
Kum Pan and spend the Rains Retreat there
I thought that I would be able to cease all building work and avoid taking on any further commitments
Other people might equate that with confused thinking but in my heart I truly knew my position I had already accomplished much building work
I had not inconsiderably ministered to the group of monks and lay devotees
In the future it was better that I cease with all that and focus all my efforts on the practice  readying myself for death
I had reached an age when one couldn't be sure when death would come
I therefore spoke with Ven
Kum Pan about staying with him and taking a restful break
This meant all construction work and such things would be left totally to him although I would be happy to advise on Dhamma practice
He not only agreed but was happy with this arrangement
He said that finding the material resources to start building was beyond his ability but that if funds became available he would accept all responsibilities
I told him that something might possibly turn up however I would not go out looking for anything
We would accept anything offered and if no one brought things well that was all right too
After the Rains Retreat Nahng Dtim in Vientiane Por Lee Maer Pao of Koke Sooak Village with Nai Prasopphon Khun Nitisahn and relatives resolved to come and build us each a hut
Each hut cost about five thousand baht
Nahng Nuay built one kuti in memory of Nahng Boowa thaew Malaikong at a cost of ten thousand baht
In lay people from Bangkok came to visit by boat
The location and surroundings so impressed them that they helped to raise funds to renovate and to build a large wooden Study Sala
It was built in the Thai style with two floors the lower storey having a veranda on three sides surfaced with concrete
The area of the top floor was seventeen metres by eleven metres while that of the ground floor was nineteen and a half by sixteen metres
It was all finished on the twentieth of July at a cost of more than eighty thousand baht
The actual labor came mostly from the monks and novices themselves
Ven
Kum Pan was suffering from some eye disease and left for treatment and never returned
In the same year the Bangkok devotees sponsored the building of two more huts while Nai Sakchai and his relatives from Pangkhone market of Pangkhone District in Sakhon Nakorn Province offered another
Each cost about seven thousand baht while monastery funds were used to build another four toilets
In a reinforced concrete rain water storage tank was built behind the Study Sala
It was eleven metres by three metres with a depth of a hundred and eighty centimetres
It cost fifteen thousand baht
In a twostorey kuti was built on the bank of the Mekong River another hut was built In a hut was built and when a storm blew a tree down onto the western veranda of the large Study Sala the authorities repaired this at a cost of twenty thousand baht
This year also saw the building of a reinforced concrete rain water tank in the nuns' quarters with dimensions of three by six by two metres another reinforced concrete rain water tank of similar dimensions and the area in front of the large study hall was paved After the Rains Retreat thirty student monks from Korat came to receive meditation training for five days
In another hut was built together with another six toilets for the nuns' quarters and two more for visitors and a place for visitors to stay also a reinforced concrete rain water tank in front of the Uposatha Hall costing thirty thousand baht
These projects were all sponsored through the monastery's funds
I fell ill around the fifth of July just before the entry to the Rains Retreat
At first it was influenza with a bronchial infection  to which I am susceptible
They sent for the doctor at the local tobacco estate but I did not improve
Dr
Tawinsree Amornkraisarakit  lady doctor and assistant director of the Nongkhai Provincial Hospital  with Khun Tawan the provincial economics officer brought a car to take me for treatment in Nongkhai Provincial Hospital
The doctor treated me for five days but my condition didn't improve
An xray showed lung congestion pleurisy and pneumonia with an area of infection
Khun Dtoo Khovinta therefore sent a telegram about the situation to Prof
Udom Posakrisna in Bangkok
When Prof
Udom learned about this he invited me to go to Bangkok where he would await me at Siriraj Hospital
The lack of specialist care and equipment in Nongkhai required my traveling to Bangkok
Thao Kae Kim Kai and Dr
Somsak the director of Nongkhai Provincial Hospital put me on the plane so that they could take me to Siriraj Hospital
I was a patient there under the specialist care of Prof
Udom with Dr
Thira Limsila in regular attendance on me
I received excellent care and attention from all the doctors
They used suction to bring up a large amount of fluid from the lungs and during the first week my condition steadily improved
By the second week however I was beginning to have allergic reactions to the drugs and then other complications set in
Perhaps this had something to do with an idiosyncratic unease when staying in large buildings
As my hospitalization extended so my condition deteriorated until my breathing became quite shallow and my voice was reduced to an almost inaudible whisper
The doctors would draw a lot of fluid from my lungs and the condition would ease a little bit but my general feeling of weakness did not improve
I therefore asked the doctors to allow me to leave the hospital but they requested that I stay longer
I was not able to do this and so asked to be discharged from the hospital on the fifteen of August
This was the period when I became disenchanted with and saw the irksomeness of the body 'This lump of a body that had brought illness and trouble to me and others
Of what use was the tiny amount of food all that I was able to swallow each day
Better not to eat at all today'
I told Mrs
Kantharat' Sapying who brought me food every day please not to bring the food in for I had decided not to eat anymore
She wept and went to find Dr
Chavadee Rattapong
Dr
Chavadee sent for Dr
Rote Suwanasutth' because Prof
Udom's duties had taken him out to the provinces
I explained to the doctor about my condition and how I didn't feel well in such large buildings
Dr
Rote therefore gave me permission to leave and arranged a car to take me to stay at Mrs
Kantharat's house for three days
Before I left Dr
Banyat Paritnyanon' came to examine me and gave some advice on my treatment
Dr
Rote and Dr
Chavadee kept in close contact bringing me medicine every day and my condition gradually improved
Examining within myself I realized that I wasn't going to die quite yet  although to other people it might have appeared otherwise
Some fortune tellers were even predicting that I would certainly die within five days
When Prof
Ouay Ketusingh' came to visit me I asked his opinion about returning to my monastery
He answered by saying the quicker I could return the better
This was a pleasant surprise since I had already resolved that if I were going to die it would be better and more fitting for me as a true monk to die in the monastery
Thao Kae Kim Kai hired a special plane to take me back and it filled up with the monks and lay devotees helping to see me on my way
We arrived at the air field in Nongkhai at almost midday
The Mekong River had just burst its banks and because of the flooding we had to request help from the NPK
who were kind enough to lend us a boat from Kong Nang Village
This took us to Wat Hin Mark Peng where we arrived at five o'clock in the evening
Dr
Chavadee had accompanied me and taken care of me all the way back to the monastery and then stayed on to treat me for another five or six days
When she saw that I was out of danger and improving she traveled back to Bangkok
While I was ill whether in Nongkhai Provincial Hospital or in Siriraj Hospital many monks novices and lay people  some known to me and some unknown  had come together to show me extraordinary care and concern
This was evident from the throngs that came to visit me every day while I was in Nongkhai Provincial Hospital
Even more so in Siriraj Hospital where such great numbers came that the doctors had to forbid visiting
Some people who came to visit were not allowed to see me so they asked instead to be allowed to bow their respects from outside my room
This was amazing
So many people came to visit when I was ill and yet I hardly knew anyone in Bangkok
Some people who had never seen me before would come in and then burst into tears even before they had time to bow their respects
I would therefore like to record here the good will shown by everyone  my appreciation for everyone's kindness will always remain with me
This applies especially to those people who came to visit and help care for me in Wat Hin Mark Peng
Some came back repeatedly even though traveling conditions during that time had become so difficult because of the flooding
It meant journeying by longtailed boat because all the road links were cut
This could sometimes take three or four hours so it really does deserve the utmost appreciation
As soon as I was back in the monastery my general condition began steadily to improve
I had eminent and respected visitors come to call on me
My Rains Retreat however was curtailed because I had not returned in time
My illness at that time brought great benefit to my meditation practice
When I arrived at Nongkhai Provincial Hospital my condition was deteriorating so much that I had immediately set about preparing myself for death
I had resolved to let go not grasping at anything
I had instructed myself You must leave your body and disease in the doctor's hands
Ready yourself for death concentrate your heart establish potent mindfulness and investigate your heart to purify it completely
After that my mind was calm and peaceful without any disturbances
When the doctors had come along and asked how I felt I would answer that I was just fine
Thao Kae Kim Kai had come and carried me off by plane to Bangkok and I went along with it
I even went as far as Siriraj Hospital where the doctors had asked about my condition and I had again said that I was 'as good as ever'
However onlookers might have thought the opposite
My extended stay in the hospital had its effect when I had started to find it tiresome and the days and nights seemed to lengthen
I therefore needed to bring back to mind my original resolution about not holding back but being willing to let go of everything I've already relinquished all that haven't I
Why then am I involving myself in that sort of thing
It's all their affair
It has to follow its own course and schedule
My dying though is not involved with all that
We each must do our separate duties as best we can
My resolution towards letting go then settled down in the stillness of the presentmoment Dhamma until there was no feeling of what was day and what was night time
There was only the brightness of the stilled heart one with itself
When I later came to examine the state of my body and mind I realized that it wasn't yet time for them to disintegrate and pass away
Nevertheless if I were to stay in the hospital there would be continual encounters with external sense impressions and their defusing would demand the constant attention of my concentration and wisdom
No way
Better that I go back and fight them on my own battle ground 
That was why I had returned to the monastery as I have described above
The year saw the start of the construction of the Uposatha Hall
I will give a more detailed account of this in a future section
At the same time we also built a meeting sala for the nuns
It was a wooden twostorey structure with concrete posts and an asbestos roof four metres by nine with a four meter wide veranda on the ground floor going all the way around It cost a little over seventy thousand baht
I had helped to relocate the old school of Koke Sooak and Phra Bart villages so that it could be connected up to the rear of the new building
This new structure had concrete posts and four class rooms
It cost eighty thousand baht but hadn't been fully completed through lack of funds
In I was able to continue the work by joining up the old and new buildings and partitioning off an office for the head teacher
Underneath I made a reinforced concrete rain water tank of seven by six by two metres
At the time we were moving the school I also went to set up another dwelling place for monks in the Wang Nam Mork Forest
This was about six kilometres to the west of Wat Hin Mark Peng and still had jungle with mountains caves and streams
It was therefore ideal for anyone intent on developing their meditation in solitude and its natural environment was also well worth preserving
A lay person gave about three rai of land in Lumpini District
When other donations increased the area to eleven or twelve rai another place for solitude and practice could be set up
Wat Lumpini was the equal of Wang Nam Mork  that I had just established  because streams skirted it on all four sides
It was aimed at those who wished for more solitude as Wat Hin Mark Peng was becoming less peaceful
From about there seems to have been a steadily growing interest among the people of Bangkok and Central Thailand in making contact with the various monasteries in the Northeast
Wat Hin Mark Peng also became more involved in receiving visitors from Bangkok
In Somdet Phra aanasangworn the present Supreme Patriarch of Thailand was supporting the scheme of sending the foreign monks who had been ordained at Wat Bovoranives to study Dhamma in many different parts of Thailand and many came here to stay for the Rains Retreat
They were all well committed to the practice
My trip to foreign lands this time received support and assistance from many parties who were concerned with teaching Dhamma abroad
Besides I wanted to go and visit both the Thai and foreign monks living over there
They had gone to spread the Dhamma and I wanted to hearten and encourage them
It struck me as amusing that although I was old and had recently been readying myself for death I found myself preparing to go abroad
Moreover I didn't even know their language
In fact this trip wasn't completely satisfactory for me as I always bear three things in mind
If one wants to go to any particular place or region 
One should know their language
One should know their customs and traditions
One should know about their livelihood
This is all concerned with proper social discourse and communication with people
However the lack of language alone makes the other two points almost moot
Notwithstanding this I still received ample help with interpretation and liaison from those who were knowledgeable about such things
This gave me such good understanding that the language barriers fell away and almost ceased to be a problem
I well knew that I was already very old already advanced in years
Going here and there no longer held any appeal for me  I had already traveled around quite widely  and finding a place to die like Wat Hin Mark Peng seemed ideal indeed
Then Maer Chee Chuang   invited me to visit Singapore Australia and Indonesia
She felt with my old age and the constant stream of visitors coming to see me in the monastery that I didn't have enough time to rest
Furthermore most of my visitors only seemed interested in asking for lottery numbers
If I were to go away it might give me some time to rest
I gave this some consideration and came to the conclusion that besides the problems with my language deficiency my 'strange face' might provoke the curiosity of the crowds over there
What sort of rest would that be
Of more important was that I should clearly consider all possible contingencies
I was elderly and had come to be considered quite a popular figure so that any mishap or my illness or death might cause difficulties for other people
This would especially bring criticism down on the one who had made the original invitation that they had taken me away but not looked after me
Even so she kept up with her efforts aimed at inviting me
These were bolstered when her elder brother  who helped lead the Buddhist Society in Perth Western Australia  sent a letter inviting me to go and visit the Buddhists there
After due consideration I came to the conclusion that this time there were three good reasons to accept the invitation
The first reason concerned the lack of senior monks in Indonesia which with a population of more than a hundred and thirty million had ten million Buddhists living among Muslims and Hindus
When someone mentioned this to me it made me feel really compassionate towards them all
I was also delighted to learn that they liked to meditate

The second reason arose because of the many monks from Indonesia and Australia who had come to ordain with Somdet Phra aanasangworn  the present Supreme Patriarch of Thailand  in Wat Bovoranives
Before the beginning of that year's Rains Retreat the Englishborn Ven
Dorn had taken tapes of my Dhamma talks and photographs to show in Australia
Once he knew that I was going with a party to Australia his preparations to receive us caused some people to become quite excited at the prospect
There was also a senior Thai monk Ven
Phra Bunyarit' Pandito already living and teaching there
This monk had done much to propagate Buddhism in Australia and had inspired many to come and ordain in Thailand
The third reason came from my reflection that in the future Buddhism would be spreading to many other countries
It might come to be disseminated following the Christian missionizing model where Thai monks might go out and only spread the superficialities of Buddhism
Whereas if individuals from the country concerned came to be ordained they could be trained truly to penetrate to the inner core of Buddhism
They could then spread the genuine Teaching themselves for that's the only way to penetrate to the essential
One Indonesian monk Ven
Sudhammo who had been ordained at Wat Bovoranives under Somdet Phra aanasangworn had then come to spend the preceding Rains Retreat at Wat Hin Mark Peng
He was exactly the sort of monk who would be able to spread Buddhism  and he was in Indonesia awaiting my visit there
After considering all three reasons for going I made up my mind 'In whatever way I can may the remainder of this life be dedicated to the advancement of Buddhism'
This decision allowed me increasingly to see the possible value of my life and caused me to give up personal comfort for Buddhism
I had in fact previously received invitations from various individuals and groups in Bangkok to make a pilgrimage to the Buddhist holy places in India
They offered to look after me and take care of my needs in every way but I had never accepted
To find the inspiration to go I had often tried to imagine what such a trip would be like but my heart always remained indifferent to the idea
I reflected that India had been the birth place of Buddhism and that although I may have missed the chance to be born in time to meet the Lord Buddha and the age when Buddhism was flourishing the Holy Places were still there
I should therefore go and pay my respects so that I could gain inspiration understanding and empathy  yet my heart remained indifferent to the idea
Perhaps this apathy arose from a previous birth as I might have been born as a Buddhist monk in India when the Hindus were suppressing the monks and the holy places
Perhaps this had been so traumatic an experience that it was deterring me from going to India in this life
Whoever has the faith and opportunity to go on pilgrimage to the Four Holy Places will gain great merit
The Lord Buddha spoke about this to Venerable Ananda These four holy places will be a great source of merit for people after I have finally passed away
I lack the merit to go there so I can only esteem and commend them
Anyhow I would like to take this opportunity to remark how indebted I feel towards the people of India because their soil was the birth place of Buddhism
Before setting out for foreign lands I went to stay at Air Force Lt
General Payom Yensootjai's garden abode for monks in Dorn Muang
Every night more and more people were attracted to come and listen to Dhamma and sit in meditation
I feel that the present day citizens of Bangkok City of Angels are more aware of their situation 'Though born in a heavenly city as the worldly description has it we remain very much human beings struggling and stuck in the 'rat race'  the common lot of human beings everywhere'
So perhaps we will want to transform ourselves into true spiritual beings knowing that angels born in heaven don't have the same opportunity for skillful and generous actions as we do in this human realm
When such angels have exhausted their store of merit made in their previous human life times they return to birth in the human realm
Sometimes even this is not certain and they may be born in the lower realms
It is different for the Noble Disciple  for instance the streamenterer  who after death is assured of not being born into any woeful existence
I am just an old monk and I was born in a place with inadequate educational opportunities
On occasion they have invited me to give Dhamma instruction to highly educated people and at first I felt quite reticent and embarrassed about it
This does however fit in with the Buddhist principles of not discriminating because of caste or class
Assessment should be based on right knowledge and good conduct
When a knowledgeable person turns to evil ways he or she is liable to cause more strife and trouble to the country than the uninformed person who does the same thing
An ignoramus who doesn't do evil is better than a learned man who uses his knowledge for evil means
People may have only limited knowledge but if they employ it in trying to develop goodness it will bring advancement to all  from the immediate group right through to the national level
Such considerations gave me more selfconfidence about teaching knowing that the more educated my listeners the easier they should be able to understand
The Lord Buddha's Dhamma Teaching points towards knowing the nature of things and this can fit in with the latest ideas of science
Good scholars should only explore and enquire for knowledge that is concerned with weighty significant issues that may lead to the enrichment of peoples' lives
They shouldn't be aiming for knowledge to increase their social position or status
For instance teachers nowadays can educate their pupils to high levels so that they in turn may take that knowledge and teach other teachers
On the other hand there are bad pupils who spotting the teacher's trifling mistake or having a difference of opinions with them work to have their teacher dismissed
They use their teacher's services and then plot together to force him or her out and even think it an honorable and admirable thing to have done
This then becomes an era for the development of corruption and wickedness and that can only lead to decline
Our party included Ven
Steven Ven
Chai Charn Dr
Chavadee and Maer Chee Chuang
We set out from Bangkok on the seventh of November reaching Singapore the same day where a welcoming party of devotees received us and showed us all of the city
Singapore is a small island
It is only thirty kilometres long by twentyfive kilometres wide and with slightly more than three million people on the main and smaller surrounding islands it is densely populated
They have therefore built blocks of flats of ten twenty or more floors to utilize all available space
Seeing all these highrise apartment buildings we might imagine all Singaporeans to be rich but in truth they are just the same as in any other country of the world
There are quite ordinary houses with tin roofs or even thatch just as there are in our villages
As long as all human beings have defilements of greed aversion and delusion every sort of contrast and variety will continue to exist
Although each country's government aims and strives to attain equality achieving it must remain impossible
I don't know of a single country that has been successful
Regimes that employ communist ideology give out propaganda that all their citizens are prosperous trouble free and equal
Why then should their people try to sneak away and escape from such a so called 'promised land'
Why
Because our human defilements are too deeply entrenched
The Lord Buddha continually taught about this saying that one should have sympathy and pity for one's fellow creatures always wishing them well through mutual harmony
Everyone wishes this
Yet when one comes to act on the principle the defilements insidiously veil and cover it up so that one forgets and falls once again for the old delusions
Singapore had wide roads sufficient for its traffic needs and their drivers kept to the highway code  they didn't drive in a selfish way
There were no traffic policemen at the crossroad and intersections with traffic lights standing in their place
The roads were swept clean few people were milling about and the shops had plate glass frontages to keep out the dust
Besides the tall blocks of flats the ordinary houses were also all set out in a very orderly pleasing fashion
Between the houses and along the roadsides were shady trees  all very pleasant and worth seeing
When there was sufficient space between houses  whether it was in the central or outer suburbs  they planted it as a public park sometimes big and sometimes small where people could go to sit and relax
The beaches were planted with trees and provided with proper car parking
They liked to plant beautiful varieties of flowers all over the place
Their soil was good and their climate was blessed with frequent rain that kept their flowers and bushes always green and flourishing
Although Singapore might be a small heavily populated island don't imagine that it lacks jungle
There were conservation areas even in the midst of the city for an awareness of their scarce resources made them take especially good care of such things
Singapore seemed higher above sea level than Bangkok and therefore didn't flood so easily and could be more easily kept clean
The inhabitants also conscientiously upheld the laws and regulations
Whatever the outer circumstances we shouldn't lose sight of our condition
Our birth was messy and then we continually associate with both external and internal impurities
We bathe and shower and in no time are dirty again
This only concludes with the corruption and putrefaction of death
If these are the underlying conditions where can we find a place that is clean
It is only possible when all the individuals of a group come together in mutual understanding about the truth
They can then help each other  according to their various responsibilities  to uphold the cleanliness
How can we each safeguard this inner cleanliness
Well we can start by watching over and securing the cleanliness in what is around us
For any society to prosper and flourish it requires these four conditions
The land and terrain are favorable to the people living there
The leaders and government who lay down the laws are just being neither too slack nor too oppressive towards the populace
All the populace helps in keeping and respecting the laws of the land
The bureaucrats and officials are just and honest
A society enjoying all four conditions will have full prosperity
A deficiency in one of them means that any prosperity will remain incomplete
It's out of the question that Bangkok can be made as clean as Singapore because its location is not favorable
It is sinking below sea level  so don't let anyone pretend they can fix Bangkok's problems as is vacuously claimed in the newspapers
The best way is that we uphold purity in our own lives and responsibilities
Please don't be so negligent and selfish about your affairs
Hurling abuse at each other over trivial mistakes tarnishes one's behavior and manners forfeiting all culture and refinement as if one were a completely ignorant person
I taught Dhamma and meditation every night of the ten nights that our party remained in Singapore
The meetings would not last more than three hours with each night between twenty and thirty Singaporeans coming for training
This teaching of Dhamma was really nothing more than a pointing out of the afflictions and flaws of the worldly life
Anyone capable of seeing the harmful nature of the world can also see Dhamma because the world and Dhamma are interrelated and interconnected
Whenever I explained Dhamma the problems of the world always became highlighted on every side
These problems are the same the world over and can be summarized into three issues
Problems concerning family and livelihood
Problems about looking for inspiration
Problems about overcoming and transcending suffering
It's not surprising that problems of this first category should arise
When there is a world there must also be worldshattering problems
If we fasten something ourselves we must also be able to untie it
Who else can do it
Unless that is someone could help by explaining the means of disentanglement
The fish hooks itself because it mistakes the angler's camouflaged bait
It hungrily snaps it up but when the hook catches there is no more eating only pain and suffering
This is how desire leads to suffering
I offer you this consideration Make do without
Once the hook catches the more we struggle the more we intensify the pain
We then become full of remorse and feel sorry for ourselves because of what we are suffering
Yet it all originated in our own fatal error
All we can do is wait for the lucky fisherman to take us away for his evening meal
With the second issue as long as we still have hopes and dreams we will have to struggle all the way until every exit has been tried and failed
The manner of the untrained heart is like that of a newly caught wild animal
However much it might stamp and paw the ground provided that its bindings remain firm and unbroken it will eventually tire and become still knowing when it is beaten
We human beings are much the same
When our wishes don't find fulfillment in the object of affection our heart's contentment is stilled
That is how one knows where one's heart is going for refuge
It is going out to find pleasure in external objects that are only able to provide a superficial false sort of happiness
True happiness is that of the quiet and serene mind without struggle
This will be the experience of anyone who discovers the point of true happiness
Their heart will continue to abide in happiness irrespective of their posture or activity
Although anyone lacking such realization won't be able to appreciate such a possibility  it will be totally beyond their comprehension
Concerning the third issue I taught them to review and go over the first two points until they perceived that apart from the stilled heart every other kind of happiness was temporary and false
I then instructed them to be diligent in cultivating and developing that happiness and to continue their analysis until they became skilled
When adept they would be able to abide as their heart wished whatever conditions they were subjected to for with this accomplishment one may abide in freedom either in happiness or pain
From what I heard from the Singaporeans it seems that they are blessed with virtuous views and opinions
They realized the peril of birth in this world seeing that this existence is unauthentic and full of deception
I had no idea that the people of Singapore would be so knowledgeable about the basic principles of the Lord Buddha's Teaching When they received the genuine Buddhist Teaching all their previous beliefs seemed to disappear so that only the essential Dhamma Truth prevailed
It was admirable how they showed their joy and firm conviction in their understanding of Dhamma
Amazingly some people seemed instinctively to be keeping the Five Precepts and practicing samadhi meditation so that insightknowledge could arise about themselves and others
We flew out of Singapore for Australia on the seventeenth of November
Our point of entry was Perth and after stopping over there we carried on to Melbourne Sydney and Canberra
These were all big cities where there was much interest in Buddhism
If there was a local Buddhist society they would invite me to teach Dhamma
Whether they were Thai Lao Burmese Sri Lankan or Caucasian they all gave me an outstanding welcome
All in our party wish to express our great appreciation for this help
While I was in Perth a swami came to visit
By a swami I mean one ordained in Hinduism who wears robes in color and shape similar to a 'Tibetan monk'
He described himself as a Hindu Lama
Hinduism has many sects with many deities  it allows one to worship any of them provided it's remembered that they all originate from one deity

This swami had already been ordained for fortyfive years and was seventysix years old
He was already waiting for me in the reception room and when he saw me he immediately raised his palms together in añjali and gave a friendly welcome
I reciprocated with words of greeting and we established a friendly rapport so that I could ask about his religion and its particular way of practice
He said that he was a head swamilama who taught Hinduism and that his family was Hindu
He was a devout and dedicated Hindu who had ordained while still a youngster and had once gone to find the Mahayana monks in Tibet
Another swami came but he was an ordinary lay person and unlike the first one wasn't ordained
He was eightyone years old but his whole appearance was delightful  his complexion and constant smile made him look more like a sixtyoneyearold
He was already waiting for me and when I came in he lifted his hands in añjali as the first swami had done
He told me that as soon as he saw me he felt great lovingkindness for me

After words of welcome I first asked about his religion just as I had done with the first swami
I begged his pardon before making my enquiries but he said there was no need because our dhammas were equivalent

He said that he didn't adhere to any religion because This world only has one deity
The Teachings of every religion derive from the one deity   and when one's action was right and good then one touched the original deity
He told me that he had studied yoga in India with six different teachers and that they had taught him many techniques
Some examples he gave were the yoga postures fasting and controlling the breathing
He possessed great knowledge and ability concerning Hinduism and had given up everything  he had no family
This was why the Hindu devotees referred to him as swami
Our discussions together were harmonious and wellreceived by all  Ven
Steven acted as interpreter  and as they were about to depart they asked permission to bow at my feet for their blessing and good fortune
This caused me some embarrassment because they themselves were so aged worthy and virtuous
I therefore told them there was no need to bow for our dhammas 'being equal' was already blessing enough
As they left they kept turning around to face me and making añjali repeatedly clearly showing their respect
Although one swami was ordained and the other wasn't they explained their path to the deity in the same way for they were both Hindus
I had asked them about their techniques for reaching the deity and their response had been the same
The first swami told me about slowly repeating the mantra word 'Om' two or three times and evoking the deity in the heart
He said By the heart recollecting the deity it would manifest as different images in the heart
The deity would then teach knowledge about right and wrong doing good and spurning evil sometimes there would be only a voice rather than an image
The deity would then disappear leaving a state of emptiness and this is reaching the Lord Nirandorn
The second unordained swami explained in much the same way but he didn't refer to a mantra
Perhaps this was a secret of his sect that he didn't want to reveal
However I do think he used a mantra in the same way as the first because they were of the same sect
He simply said that when one reached the deity it might manifest as various images or as a voice that would teach one
He did not speak about the emptiness that remained after such visions and voices had disappeared about having reached the Lord Nirandorn
Those of you who are engaged with all the religions are you finding this absorbing and enjoyable
What do I mean
Well I will try to explain and ask your indulgence for my ideas because I have never had opportunity to research the scriptures of any religion other than Buddhism
They say that one needs a firm faith that the deity exists although they cannot see the deity's body
After putting faith in the deity one opens up to or one inclines the heart to rest in the deity at which point the deity manifests for one to see
It is similar to this in Mahayana Buddhism
In Theravaada or Hinayaana Buddhism the Lord Buddha does have a body which is that of Prince Siddhattha of the Sakyans
He went forth into the homeless life and with great exertion comprehensively cleansed all impurities and defilements from the heart
He realized Buddhahood through perfecting all the Dhamma virtues
However it was not merely the body of Phra Siddhattha that became the Lord Buddha
When one has faith and trust in the virtuous qualities of the Lord Buddha one can receive them into the heart or incline one's heart out to rest in those wholesome qualities until it becomes fully and firmly established in onepointedness
Various images or sounds can arise in such a state and according to the creed of the formless deity this state would be 'one with the deity' and it would manifest to teach one
The Buddhist Teaching would maintain that such manifestations were images or visions  nimitta  arising out of meditation and the sounds would be the clarifying voice of Dhamma
Dhamma  being itself without form  would need to manifest in this way to accommodate to people with bodies
In summary every religion or sect teaches its adherents to abandon evil and do good to receive the virtuous qualities of its deity into their heart or to give their heart to the deity
The way to reach the deity is the same for each religion
However when a particular religion's devotees don't understand the truth mistaken assumptions can arise
They may think that because another religion practices in a different way it is wrong and that only their way is correct
They propagandize and criticize and stir things up so that they can become preeminent with an increasing number of adherents
This is not what a Good Teacher with Dhamma would have taught and sages would view such ideas with a dubious eye
Those who practice should find this relationship  between meditative visions and coming in touch with the deity  as something worth investigating
During my trip to Australia I was not only able to teach Dhamma to anyone interested but could also exchange views with other monks
This was especially so with Ven
Mahaa Samai who had been sent out by Mahamakut Monastic College to take up residence at Wat Buddharangsee in Sydney
Although Ven
Mahaa Samai was originally from Champahsak in Laos he had gone to stay at Wat Sapatoom in Bangkok while still a boy
He had received novice and bhikkhu ordination and passed his grade five Pali examinations from Mahamakut Monastic College Wat Bovoranives
In he went to teach general studies for a year in Wat Bodhisomphorn Udornthani and then volunteered to go and spread Dhamma in Australia
He had been there for two years  being part of the second party that followed after Ven
Chao Khun Pariyat'  and was the first monk to stay at the new Wat Buddharangsee
At the time of writing he has been a monk for thirteen years and is a courteous model monk worthy of respect
Ven
Mahaa Samai could be considered a representative of the Thai Sangha who wished to spread Buddhism to Australasia for no Theravada monks had ever been resident there before
The local people were basically Christian and this was to be the first Theravada monastery with monks
People today all over the world are better educated especially about a science that is based on investigating the actual truth of things
Christianity teaches reliance on faith and disallows critical analysis of the teachings of one's faith
This conflicts with modern scientific principles and a pope once even punished someone whose calculations pointed to a spherical world system
Finally however everyone  including the later popes  has accepted and used that theory right up to today
Buddhist Teaching gives complete freedom to investigate anything  even the Buddhist Teachings themselves
This is because the principles on which Buddhism is based are far higher than those of science
It doesn't just examine and analyze material things but is able to detect the underlying truth of mental phenomena
After penetrating through with insight the realized truth is used solely for the peace and benefit of oneself and others without causing harm to anyone
Some people can apply it so that they are able to go beyond the world  for example the Lord Buddha and the arahants
It's such a pity that although modern people receive a superior education most of them consider just finishing their course work and securing a degree to be enough
It may not have even crossed the minds of some people that the text books that formed the basis of their course had originated in someone else's understanding  which contained more than they were able to read in their books
Their learning is not something original to their own understanding because true knowledge can only come through individual experience
The Buddhist Teaching calls this 'paccattam'  clearly seeing or knowing for oneself  and it arises from the strength of the cultivated mind that has attained to stillness and calm bringing insight and selftransformation
This is a genuine change from one's old nature to the true condition that is in line with the Buddhist Noble Truths
Anyone aiming for clear insight into the truth of Buddhism needs to combine learning with practice
One or another alone is not enough
In this time of advanced education it becomes necessary for anyone propagating Buddhism to have trained themselves in both ways
Any deficiency in this and the results will not be as good as might have been expected
My further advice to Ven
Mahaa Samai was that he should propagate the whole package
By this I mean that besides fully keeping the Patimokkha Rule  the small size of the group precluded study classes  the other duties and practices should be maintained
For instance the dhutanga practices  these include the going out on alms round which should also help reduce kitchen expenditures
The spreading of Buddhism needs study together with practice so that it can put down roots that will endure
Ven
Mahaa Samai and all the monks agreed with all my advice and decided to carry out such a plan in the future
I suggested to Ven
Mahaa Samai that there are three criticisms that are most common concerning the spreading of Buddhism in other countries
Theravada Sect monks unlike the other religions and sects being 'selfish' and only concerned about themselves without helping others in need or distress
Theravada monks who though they forbid the killing of animals still eat meat
Anyone going out to spread Buddhism will be certain to encounter these criticisms so I advised Ven
Mahaa Samai to prepare suitable replies and explanations
He could then answer instantly any of these criticisms
An even more dangerous hazard is that those who go to spread Buddhism are unfamiliar with the local ways and customs
This may cause offence during interactions with the local residents and can lead to discouragement and disillusionment or it may cause one to forget oneself and be lured away to join in the fun of 'going native'
As we all know the history of Australia describes how it had been a wild place with its peoples undeveloped and how Britain had got rid of its convicts and gangsters by transporting them there eventually the new people organized themselves and energetically developed agriculture and then supplied raw materials to the expanding industries of the world until its present prosperity was established Australia is endowed with many natural mineral resources and an enormous land area although its population is only thirteen million They don't just sit back enjoying their prosperity but try to develop it even further
Let's turn to have a close look at this Thai City of Angels of ours
If we go into town we cannot see a single 'angel' for its streets are crowded with loafers and layabouts
People haven't 'developed' nor do they know what that means
They mistakenly think that when something is finished there will be no need for any more work in the future
Children are delighted when they become teenagers
It's only when they become old that they realize it was just a stage on the way to old age
Materials have to be removed and lost from somewhere in order for them to be brought to construct the wellplanned and attractive city with its traffic system
It just shows how they take things from here to improve things over there
We come to growth because of food and yet that involves destroying the lives of other animals and crops
Going along our way we are only concerned with getting to our destination and have no thought that the base and origin from which we set forth is being left far behind step following step
Don't just look ahead with your 'frontfacing eyes' but also use wisdom to check behind
The truth that will free us from careless delusions and bring us to the Noble Truths of the Lord Buddha's Teachings can then be seen
From Australia we went back to Singapore and on the twentyfourth of December continued on to Indonesia
All the people I knew seemed to be there  Ven
Chao Khun Suviirañaan' Ven
Phra Khru Dhammadhornsombat' Ven
Sudhammo Ven
Aggapaalo and Ven
Khemiyo
They all had gathered to await me at Jakarta airport with members of the local Buddhist Society
I had the opportunity to visit other places besides Jakarta for example Bandung Jogjakarta Mendut Samarang Surabaya and Bali
I visited Buddhist Societies and the Buddhist monasteries that our Dhammaduuta monks coming from Thailand to spread Buddhism had established
Ven
Chao Khun Vidhoondhammaaporn' was the head of the organization that had built monasteries that included Wat Majjhimasaasanawong' that adjoined the Mendut Chedi Wat Dhammapadiipaaraam' in Badoo Malang and Surabaya
I viewed each site with delight and noted that the local Buddhists women and men young and old would without fail come every evening to chant their devotions
Afterwards there would be a sermon from a monk who would then lead them in meditation
Going around Indonesia I saw venerable sites and objects that had the features of a syncretic religion
I couldn't help but feel saddened by this and reflect on the situation in Thailand
Who can deny the great value of memorials and venerable sites  one only has to look at Indonesia
All the monks and scriptures have disappeared we cannot even say when it happened but anyhow their sacred sites remain for the minority Buddhists
My thoughts went back to Thailand with its immense wealth of religious objects and sacred Buddhist sites more numerous even than in Indonesia
However many immense and amazing monuments Indonesia may have they can't compare with the beauty of our Shrines and Uposatha Halls
Nowhere else in the world are there such inspiring and worthy sites
I am absolutely convinced that if only the Thai people were to study and come to a true understanding of Buddhism their correct practice would make it impossible for other sects and ideologies to overwhelm and obliterate Buddhism from Thailand
Ven
Chao Khun Suviirañaan' Ven
Phra Khru Dhammadhornsombat' and Ven
Sudhammo were our guides throughout our tour of Indonesia and they looked after us very well
Although Ven
Chao Khun Vidhoondhammaaporn' was away in Bangkok it became obvious to me how greatly they respected him there for even small children knew of him when his name was mentioned
This gives me trust in his devotion the sacrifices he's made for the Buddhist Teachings which make him an important asset for Somdet Phra aanasangworn the present Supreme Patriarch of Thailand
Many centuries have passed since the first Thai delegation of monks went to spread Buddhism overseas
This present endeavor in Indonesia seems to me to be the most effective and fruitful since Ven
Chao Khun Phra Upali of the Ayutthaya period led a group of fifteen monks to help reestablish Buddhism in Sri Lanka It is a shame that there are so few capable monks for they are a great boon to Buddhism and to the international community for nowadays they are much in demand
When the giver has something in demand shouldn't he give it to those in need Or is it that the Thai Sangha that numbers tens of thousands of monks is so impoverished that it doesn't have anything to offer them
At this time some of the people of Indonesia are finding inspiration again in Buddhism and totally dedicating themselves to it even when the monks had been unable to visit they had formed themselves into Buddhist Societies and they were all certain that the Buddhist revival would continue into the future in accordance with a fivehundredyearold legend
May all revered and worthy monks spread their lovingkindness towards Indonesia to reverence the Buddhist religion and recollect the great compassion of the Lord Buddha
After traveling around these various countries  Australia Indonesia and going through Singapore three times  we arrived back in Bangkok on the th of January
We had been away for a little over two months
Although this may seem a short period I certainly found it to be much more valuable than I had expected
Quite a few people in Singapore and Australia had shown a genuine interest in studying Dhamma
This was most evident in Indonesia where their enthusiasm and earnestness had grown even more following the teaching I had been able to give
After going and witnessing this for myself I had to feel sympathetic towards them
Though they have few teachers they manage for the most part to continue with the practice
I have written about these teachings in Dhamma Questions and Answers from Abroad while a more detailed description of our journey is found in An Account of Traveling Abroad
Anyone interested can read about it in these publications
The durian fruit is thick skinned and has sharp prickles to protect its inner flesh
Whoever wants to eat it must carefully turn it around to find the seam between the segments and split it open along that line
You have probably partaken of this choice fruit and know its delicious flavor
What is there in this world that is impeccably good and right in its every aspect
The art of knowing how to get at the good part of the durian fruit is similar to wise people who know how to train themselves and practice so as to develop flawless virtue
Among human beings of every gender age group race or tongue  and this extends to the animal kingdom  you probably won't find even one who doesn't admit to desiring their own happiness while abhorring suffering
It is because of these two conditions that all the sentient beings of the world struggle to find a way out of their loathed suffering and attain to the state of happiness that they desire
This struggle sometimes becomes apparent in the striving for development and progress
Although this development may seem to be a logical advance with proper inspection one will find that it is a very onesided progress
The other side being a fall into degeneration and retrogression
The experience of suffering is of enormous value on the road to progress and development 
Yet at the same time and in manifold ways one brings more turmoil and distress into the world
I had never gone abroad before except when I had gone for morning alms round by boat paddling across the River Mekong to the Laotian city of Vientiane and then returning to my monastery
Yet here I was with one foot in the grave going away with people on an overseas's trip
I can't say that I saw anything worth getting excited about other than seeing how the people and animals live in each country
Conditions were basically identical to what I already knew in Thailand and Laos except the minor differences arising from local preferences
All countries are in agreement on the one essential issue  an abhorrence of suffering and the struggle to overcome it
Thus the situation is that neither we nor any other creature wish to suffer yet we are born encircled by these two conditions
We therefore need to reflect on how we should proceed with our lives regarding the three things that I will explain below
Each of us must live in a right moral Dhamma way
The results of misunderstanding this and going astray will not just entail failure to achieve happiness for oneself and others but will also multiply the suffering and turmoil for both oneself and others
Whether they are influential intelligent and knowledgeable whether they are wealthy or poor they all come up with the same excuses when talking about the virtues of Dhamma and its moral restraint
I did it because of social pressure
It was what they expected of me Recognize the fact that society is corrupt and start to question your own role in it  why shouldn't each of us be able to help in correcting things
Why shouldn't we be able to counter the bad influences and develop a good and beneficial society
Family
Society
Livelihood
These three things will advance smoothly in an orderly peaceful way if their development accords with the Dhamma principles for lay people as set down by the Lord Buddha
A lack of harmonization will cause one's way of life to become worthless and it will only bring conflict
It is Dhamma with virtue that guides the world to happiness
The development of any nation ideology or system  whether it is of material or administrative progress  that is deficient in such Dhamma virtue won't bring complete happiness to the heart
Dhamma requires that each person withdraws from bad conduct and becomes fearful about initiating corrupt behavior together
This is the true and supreme progress for the family for society for the advancement of the standard of living and for the nation as a whole
My journey was facilitated in every way by the management  especially Air Force Lt
General Choo and Khun Supharp Sutthichot'  and staff of Thai International Airways They helped arrange my passport and visas and all along the way gave me exceptional assistance I must give a special mention to Khun Sutthiphon Kansut and his wife who arranged so much for us in Jakarta with air tickets and accompanying me safely to Singapore and later Indonesia
So my special thanks to everyone who helped our party
Approximately two months after our return the lay people in Singapore invited me to go back to see whether there was a suitable site to build a monastery as a center for teaching meditation
I went but although we looked at about ten different sites none of them seemed suitable
In one way this was a good thing for if we had indeed built a monastery the taking care of it would have become an extra burden for me
The bodily aggregate is the endlessly turning wheel of birth and death
The heart of one without training must also spin with it while anyone who has practiced will grow tired and weary of the whole affair
My body had been like this when in I had left our group in Phuket
Even when I was sitting quietly my voice had become so dried out and hoarse that I could no longer speak
It happened again when some newly ordained monks   came to train under me
Straight after they had left my old symptoms returned and I came down with various minor complaints
My voice was left hoarse and weak and it has never been the same since
Dr
Rote invited me to go to Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok for a general medical examination
The tests there found no particular disease except the illness of old age  this is the nature of the cycle of birth and death
This is what befalls all bodily and mental phenomena and only the circumstances will differ
Thinking back over those twentyseven years that I have been in Wat Hin Mark Peng  what a long time it seems
If one were a lay person that would be more than enough time to establish a comfortable position and standard of living
Being an elderly monk I take care of the monastery which is the normal role for old monks everywhere
I can no longer get around as I once could and even if I were able to go there is no forest left for tudong wandering like in the old days
They have cut it all down
The number of devotees also seems to be multiplying daily and wherever I go more 'children' appear  born from the word rather than the womb
They have trailed after me ever since when Air Force General Harin Hongsakun invited me to go into the solitude of Orb Luang Jormtong District of Chiang Mai Province
A crowd of people trailed after me and instead of being able to cut down on food and bodily comforts and get down to meditation  the opposite occurred
They provided a banquet with cushions and a luxurious bed on which to sleep
When the Four Requisites of clothing food shelter and medicine become extravagant and overabundant they can become an obstacle to the development of the beginner's meditation
A very wealthy and affluent monastery will tend towards dissension and disharmony and its Dhamma study will not progress as it should
It is the same with the everyday world where an excess of wealth and affluence can become a threat to the whole community
The leaders and officials become corrupt and swindle the public and government plundering the country and dividing the spoils
Contention arises among them when their vested interests don't agree
Any influential merchant or citizen who gets in their way is killed and so countless deaths occur
This is why the Lord Buddha said
Sakkaaro kaapurisam hanti  Power and influence destroy men of inferior wisdom
The longer one stays in the same place the more roots are put down
Lay devotees come to the monastery and notice features that aren't quite perfect or beautiful enough which inspires them to build more permanent replacement structures that are more attractively designed
These beautiful buildings then need looking after for not to do so would be an offence against the monks' Discipline
Need one ask who the caretaker is
It's this old monk of course
Teaching and training all the monks and novices who come here how to sit to lie down to eat to go on alms round and all the various duties and obligations including study requirements  this all falls on the shoulders of this old monk
They give one the title of senior incumbent and that seems quite fitting as one is truly encumbered
This though is unavoidable and one has to do one's best with the situation until the end of one's life
I called to mind my teachers and the great masters of the past the Lord Buddha being the prime example and how they led and guided the Teaching
The thought arose that I too had managed step by step to help guide this development along
My birth as a human being had not been wasted
Furthermore I had ordained as a Buddhist monk and had fulfilled my obligations
Whenever people paid respect or made offerings to me I always thought 'What are they venerating
They and I are identical  in that we are all conglomerations of the elements of earth water fire and air
They must at least be honoring the saffron robe which is the emblem and banner of the arahants
Such faith sustains the religion and although conviction from within may be halfhearted they have trust in what has been passed down to them'
I am fully aware of the immense virtue and value of Buddhism
Since my going forth and ordination it has supported and nurtured me towards becoming a good and virtuous person
The Teaching has never led me to commit the slightest immoral deed
Yet even so we are always resisting and being recalcitrant towards it and continuing our evil ways
Our dwelling and sleeping places our sleeping mat pillow and mosquito net the food we eat  everything we daily pick up and use here the whole lot belongs to the Buddha's Teaching
The medicines to treat any illness we might develop belong to the faithful Buddhist devotees who selflessly donate them
When we first ordain as monks we are completely dependent on the saffron robe the emblem of the Noble Ones which our Preceptor and Teachers bestow on us
When one has received this matchless apparel the people bow their respects and support one with floods of offerings
I have been able to survive to the present day because of this Teaching
Buddhism has brought infinite and untold virtue and blessings to me personally and to all of us in the world
Coming to live here wherever I have been before I have always done whatever I could provided my health was up to it to build a basis of solid durable constructions for Buddhism
Now that I am old and don't have enough strength for building projects lay devotees become inspired to sponsor the constructions that will stand in for me in the future
We have shared any resources that are left over out among other monasteries
Yet I will never become a slave to bricks concrete and wood because I know that such materials are just external things
Despite their beauty and stylish design no matter how many millions they cost if we behave immorally they all become hollow and completely meaningless
The true core or heart of Buddhism does not lie in material things but in individual actions
This has been my guiding principle
The going forth in ordination has been termed nekkhamma or renunciation because it is the giving up of all forms of sensuality
Having resolved to train oneself  following the Noble Truth of the Lord Buddha's Teaching  to escape from all suffering one should not then bury oneself under a pile of bricks and mortar
 These sorts of building projects tend to be the source of great complications and difficulties and they mainly fail through lack of adequate resources  especially lack of moral virtue
Success makes one feel happy and warm inside whereas failure brings the tearing of hair and agitation
I never allowed such feelings about my projects and remained quite impartial and unconcerned about whether or not they would succeed
I think of every project as just a part of the duties of the religion
The resources all come from the devotees for I myself have no wealth
When the work is completed it benefits Buddhism and brings much merit to the lay devotees
There should be no need to solicit contributions for that only brings annoyance so that people become fatigued with the whole business
I was able to complete all the projects because of donations that came in from all directions including overseas contributions
Any offerings  such as Kathina and Sanghadaana  towards Wat Hin Mark Peng were kept specifically for that purpose while any contributions given to me and intended for my personal use  from one baht to ten a hundred to even millions  I have channelled all into the various community projects that I have already mentioned
Funds for this never seem to have dried up and there remains a strong interest in aiding my projects I myself don't seem to have retrogressed because of this and everything has gone smoothly
Saadhu
Saadhu
Saadhu
Past merit seems to have enabled me to be successful in this
I have never gone out looking for even a penny but funds have rolled in from all directions
I've become something like a 'central reserve bank' for those Buddhists who want their funds directed to what will be most beneficial for Buddhism Administrating these funds can be difficult because of the lack of records But somehow I have smoothly managed them by allowing sufficient to accumulate in a projectfund  for Sala Uposatha Hall etc
 to complete the work then totally clearing its account
Any monk engaging in such management needs to be absolutely sure of his ability and his incorruptibility otherwise he should not involve himself
If one goes against this principle it will damage the Buddhism that one respects so much and will also lead to one's own downfall
There are examples of this everywhere
This 'Capital M' can be quite deadly and has already destroyed many people
Aiming solely for the benefit of Buddhism and the common good without taking selfish advantage will be of great fruit whereas undertaking anything for selfish motives will bring unfortunate results
It will be very damaging if one tries to get something for oneself while pursuing Buddhist projects
This is even more so for some 'monks'
After involving themselves in building works such projects seem to take them over and their inner spiritual work and discipline are all abandoned
They build outwardly but fail to build their inner selves and this leads to great decline
It is now about sixty years since I first saw the forest here and it was when I actually came to live here
I have steadily developed it since that time and you can see the results with your own eyes
The important point being that this all arose through the faith and energy of my disciples both monks and lay people who contributed whatever they could  whether labor or money
There are more of them than I can ever hope to mention
The Supreme Patriarch of Thailand graciously came to officiate at the ceremonial opening of the Mondop
He was very pleased and officially declared Wat Hin Mark Peng to be a 'Model Monastery' in the development field and gave me official recognition of this on the twentysixth of May
This marks quite an honor for the monastery
I really hope that Wat Hin Mark Peng may continue to be a place for monks to practice for the longlasting benefit of Buddhism
Therefore may all of you who have helped in the support of Wat Hin Mark Peng be happy long prosper and be firmly established in the noble Buddhist Teaching
I have been a monk now for sixtyeight years and I have tried to practice only for the benefit of myself and others starting with myself and then carrying this further for the good of others
By this I mean that I could go on tudong with great meditation teachers starting with my very first year as a monk
I was determined to practice following the instruction of my Teachers and as I had no other responsibilities to occupy me I could apply myself fully to the task
In later years I was able to be away from them and therefore had to accept many responsibilities
A group of monks started following me and I had regularly to instruct the lay people
In those days because there were so few forest meditation monks when lay people saw anyone with a following of monks they would immediately consider him an 'Ajahn' or Teacher and would trail after him
Even when it was like that I never slackened with my meditation efforts and even saw it as a stimulus to practice even harder
This then became of benefit both to myself and others
To be truly of benefit to others requires that one first be of benefit to oneself
One is then able to share what one has with other people
If no one shows interest in receiving it one hasn't lost anything
This has been part of my practice ever since I was ordained
On HM the King's birthday on the fifth of December I received by his order the ecclesiastical title of Ven
Phra Rajanirodharangsee Gambhiirapaññaavisit' Yatigansasorn Bowornsanghaaraam Araññavaasee
I have already described my feelings about such ecclesiastical titles and I haven't changed my mind but they explained to me that this was the way the king of Thailand always showed his appreciation for the work and responsibilities of senior monks and when they increased their good works so their title would be elevated
I am just a forest monk and I can only reflect on the gracious favor and offer my blessing  Anumodanaa
 to HM the King
We believe that having been born together in this world we all owe each other mutual benefit and welfare
Children are indebted to their parents and parents have new obligations towards their children
Each remembers their debt to the other without any thought of calling it in
The recalling to oneself of one's parental debt will however enable one to repay it according to one's perception of it  for some this will be great for others small
One got into this form of debt by one's own actions without coercion from anyone else and so no one else can take it over
People acknowledge their parental debt in innumerable ways
They recall that from their first until their last day they had been and always would be cared for with love and devotion in every way
For instance they had to rely on mother and father in learning how to sit up to lie down to stand up to walk and to talk  for everything
When their parents became angry with them and smacked or caned them the parents had also held back somewhat remembering that this is my child
Sometimes they couldn't bring themselves to do it
There is a natural instinct in all beings for parents to love their offspring and this includes even the animals
They love without thinking or knowing why or what they can gain from it and the children respond in the same way
The bonding between animals however is shortlived and only occurs while the offspring are still small for with maturity it is all lost
Human love and affection knows no end
It endures until death and even beyond
The person who doesn't acknowledge the goodness and beneficence of his parents and who doesn't repay their kindness is base and worse than an animal
I'm going to boast a bit here I was born their son but my ordination while still young prevented me from providing my parents with the material support that everyone usually gives
However my life as a monk allowed me to sustain and nourish their heart's aspirations and good will and that was what they appreciated beyond all else
They could constantly call to mind that our own son is a monk
No matter how near or far away  even a thousand kilometres distant  they could still be happy and content because their aspirations had been fulfilled
When both my parents became older I returned to teach and fortify their faith until both decided to ordain and wear white robes
Their meditation brought them many remarkable experiences that strengthened their faith even more
I taught them about the path to happiness and both would attentively listen to me as pupils listen to their teacher
They received all the teaching with open hearts not worrying that a 'child should be teaching his parents'
My father was a white robed chee pakao for eleven years before his passing away at the age of seventyseven
My mother was a whiterobed nun for seventeen years and died after my father when she was eightytwo
I taught them right up to their final moments offering all the advice I possible could and I really feel that I was able completely to repay my debt to them
I had no other outstanding debts
I organized funeral ceremonies suitable to their position and in accordance with my being a monk
Being ordained as a Buddhist monk for so long has allowed me to see the changing condition of this aging body with the transformations in the external world
I've seen so many things both good and bad and it has greatly expanded my wisdom and knowledge
I don't feel that I have wasted being born into the world with them
I consider that I have been indebted to this world for I have taken its elements of earth water fire and air to form a body
In maintaining it I have had to absorb and use the things of the world for absolutely nothing of it belongs to me
After death everything must be left behind in this world
Some people never consider such issues and by that fall into unyieldingly grasping hold of things  'everything is mine'
Husband wife children and grandchildren household possessions  'they are all mine'
To the end even when those things disappear or are broken they still retain their hold on them as 'mine'
There is activity that we should not perform yet having been born it has to be undertaken
We have been born with this self that is called 'conditioned' and so as a matter of course we must grow old become ill and die
Not a single person wants it to be like that  becoming old and decrepit until one can no longer go anywhere
No one wants to die not to see their children and grandchildren's faces again
After death those that remain even if they are the children of the deceased will not keep the corpse at home for more than fifteen days and most people will take it away for cremation
There it is the 'activity that we should not undertake'
One respects them so highly and then throws them on the fire  yet this has become a necessary action
No one is going to keep the corpse at home
The kamma that should not be made occurs after someone's death
It doesn't matter who it is one's father mother brothers sisters or other relatives including one's respected Teachers there have to be funeral rites
This requires a lot more labor and material things than at the time of birth which succeeded with just the two  mother and father
Funeral rites entail the feeding and receiving of guests lay people and monks and the finding of offerings for the monks
For those left behind who are not so well off this is no small burden
When they don't have enough they have to borrow from relatives and friends and so go further into debt
This sort of debt has absolutely no advantage and brings only loss
Still anyone who is practicing generosity will treat it as a meritorious deed which is a sort of profit for oneself
However one takes it it is still 'something that we should not undertake' and yet when those still living are confronted with this situation they feel obligated
Coming to birth and dying are not the same for human beings of this world
In being born there is a sequence dependent on the parents
Whoever is born before is called 'elder' and whoever comes after is 'younger'
Dying is not like that
Whether one dies first or later depends on the results of one's kamma each according to his or her own
Sometimes the younger dies before the elder or vice versa
After death one doesn't necessarily have to go on to be reborn as siblings for again this depends on the results of kamma
One who has committed evil may be born as a preta or fall into deepest hell into avicii
Those who have purified their heart and transcended the mass of suffering will attain even to Nibbana
It all depends
I think that I have completely repaid my debt to my parents who have passed away I was their youngest son and I've accomplished whatever duties were appropriate for a monk towards them both
Both probably thought the same about this and wouldn't have wanted to call in any debt of mine because it had all worked out as they wished
Ajahn Kumdee Reeo rahng my eldest brother loved me very dearly and I was sorry that he died when I was away spending the Rains Retreat in Chantaburi Province
I was unable to arrange his funeral in a way commensurate with his love for me
When my other elder brothers and sisters were still alive I was able to teach them about virtue and Dhamma each according to their temperament and potential so that when they were about to die they had some refuge in the heart
They hadn't wasted their life for on meeting the Lord Buddha's Teachings they had practiced as much as they could according to their ability
Mrs
Ahn Prahpphahn my eldest sister and the second child passed away in at the age of eightyeight
Mrs
Naen Chiangtong my elder sister and the third child passed away in at the age of ninety
Mr
Plian Reeo rahng my elder brother and the fourth child passed away in at the age of eighty
Mrs
Nooan Glah Kaeng my elder sister and the fifth child passed away in at the age of seventynine
Ven
Phra Gate my elder brother and the sixth child passed away in at the age of fortyeight with fourteen years as a monk
Mrs
Thoop Deeman my younger sister passed away on the sixteenth of May at the age of eightsix
I made sure that all my brothers and sisters received the complete and proper funeral that they would have expected
This was especially so with the youngest Mrs
Thoop Deeman who in the last part of her life came to receive training with me as a whiterobed nun at Wat Hin Mark Peng
She seems to have secured good results from her meditation practice that stood her in good stead when she became very ill in the final part of her life
Her children came and took her away for hospital treatment in Sakhon Nakorn Province
They told me that her mindfulness was good and she was aware right up to the final moments
She had described what she was feeling to her children and grandchildren who were caring for her that her feet were becoming cold that the coldness had reached her calves her knees and her chest
She mindfully concentrated on her chest and her breathing became fainter and fainter and finally everything became still
Now I have to depend on myself for all my relatives and Meditation Masters are no longer available
I will continue to do good until no life remains because after death no one else can do either good or evil for us
This autobiography has now reached my eightyninth year and I think I will finish with this much
In November Venerable Ajahn Thate again fell ill with a lung infection
Complications set in with symptoms of heart disease and prostrate problems and while treatment helped his health was never as strong as before
As described previously Venerable Ajahn Thate had always found Wat Tam Khahm to be an especially good place for both his Dhamma practice and his health
So in March he moved from Wat Hin Mark Peng to take up residence at Wat Tam Khahm in the mountains of Sakhon Nakorn Province
Ven
Ajahn Kiem Sorayo was the abbot there and was very happy to welcome his venerable guest
Venerable Ajahn Thate's health then gradually improved and he amazed everyone with his renewed vigour and appetite
At his ninetysecond birthday celebrations he praised the local people of Sakhon Nakorn as the most supportive and caring of all
He told them that he was sorry not to have come to stay there when he was younger when he could have taught them more
However during May of Venerable Ajahn Thate's condition again changed for the worse with a deterioration in his strength and appetite
A medical professor and his team came and discovered a gall bladder obstruction  from gall bladder stones or perhaps from a growth
Despite Venerable Ajahn Thate's advanced age of ninetytwo they tried their utmost to nurse him back to health so that he could continue his teaching for another couple of years
A few days before the start of the Rains Retreat Venerable Ajahn Thate spoke privately about his personal affairs
He charged that if he should die his body should first be kept at Wat Tam Khahm but that the cremation should take place at Wat Hin Mark Peng
When his disciple took this opportunity to ask how long his body should be kept Venerable Ajahn Thate replied that that should come from the general agreement of everyone involved
Although Venerable Ajahn Thate was obviously frail and in pain during most of the Rains Retreat of he never complained or displayed any upset
He was a shining example of the good Dhamma practitioner to those monks who were taking care of him
On the morning of Saturday December after some liquidized food and his medicine Ven
Ajahn Thate was as usual taken around in his wheelchair for some 'mobile meditation'
After thirty minutes he said he was tired and went back to bed
His body seemed somewhat restless so his disciples played a tape of one of his own Dhamma talks on meditation
He confirmed to the monks that 'it was certainly necessary to set in neutrality'
Later in the day after another 'wheelaround' he agreed that he was tired and so was helped into bed
This was at nine o'clock in the evening
The attendant monk respectfully suggested to the Venerable Ajahn that he should fix his attention on going to sleep so that he could wake up rested and strong
He nodded in agreement and almost immediately became still
His attendant noticed how easily he had gone to sleep and knowing that he usually slept on his right side the attendant called on another monk to help turn him to that side thinking that he could rest longer in that position
The monks massaged Venerable Ajahn Thate's hands as he slept and noticed that he was very still without any movement at all  abnormally so
The peaceful look on his face meant that the monks attending did not have an inkling that the Venerable Ajahn Thate had in fact already passed away
An ending of such great dignity and peace perfectly completes a life lived that way
His life had touched many many people and this became manifest in the funeral and cremation rites
When news spread about his passing local monks and villagers immediately started coming to pay their last respects
It was announced that HM the King of Thailand would officially sponsor the funeral rites
As Venerable Ajahn Thate had previously ordered his body was first kept at Wat Tam Khahm and then moved to Wat Hin Mark Peng
This is a bigger monastery and so much more appropriate for dealing with the funeral arrangements for the cremation was obviously to be a national event
The cremation of Venerable Ajahn Thate took place on January
People from all over Thailand  led by HM the King and the royal family  came to pay their final respects
Each region where the Venerable Ajahn had stayed seemed to be represented  even from overseas  so it was as if even in death he was still able to bring people together
It is estimated that there were ten thousand monks present and many hundreds of thousands of lay people
Yet even with such numbers it was arranged in a fitting and appropriate way and all accomplished through volunteer help and finance

The good weather allowed the arrangements to proceed smoothly
HM the King honored Venerable Ajahn Thate with royal sponsored funeral rites and the full panoply of ancient custom and ritual
When all was ready HM the King flew in by helicopter officially to lead the making of offerings and light the cremation fire
The monks followed this filing past the coffin then the dignitaries with all the ordinary people who had supported Venerable Ajahn Thate for more than seventy years as a monk
The actual cremation took place later that night with a full moon shining down on the crematorium lake and fountain specially built for the occasion
These remain as a landmark and memorial to Venerable Ajahn Thate when devotees come to practice Dhamma and remember his example
The next morning when the fire was cooled the bones and ashes of Venerable Ajahn Thate were reverently removed and safeguarded as relics
Thus ends the biography of Venerable Ajahn Thate
It started in a remote village at the beginning of the century and closed more than ninety years later surrounded by hundreds of thousands of disciples including the King of Thailand
Along the Way Venerable Ajahn Thate had continually taught and that continues in the practice he inspired and the books and taped talks he left behind  including this book
Anyone  of any religion or none  can appreciate the basic Buddhist guidelines for action and speech
There is no dogma hidden among these precepts for it is a plain and simple way of living without harming or hurting any creature
The other feature to bear in mind is that it is something that the individual accepts voluntarily
No one commands one to receive them
It is the individual's volition that changes a list of precepts into a way of living
The appreciation and mindfulness of one's actions and speech then become more subtle which automatically leads on to meditation
There are the basic Five Precepts and these become more refined with the Eight Precepts
These Precepts can be received by simply saying
I undertake the training ruleprecept 
 In the compiler brought a copy of her book Aajaaraaphiwaht to show Venerable Ajahn Thate
It was the commemorative book for the royal opening of the chedi and museum of the late Ven
Ajahn Fan Aacaaro
On leafing through the book he came across a sample of Ven
Ajahn Fan's handwriting using the dhamm' characters and asked whether the compiler of the book could understand them
When she admitted her ignorance Venerable Ajahn Thate smiled and remarked that it was a shame that such knowledge was disappearing so fast and that future generations would be completely ignorant of it Just a few days later Venerable Ajahn Thate kindly gave her the translation beautifully typed out
The original dhamm' characters and his translation appear below together with his explanation
'Wise people are those that are able to prevent the arising of evil in their personality
There is a simile about a person planting a tree a mango tree for example
The person steadily tends and cares for it stopping any growth of parasitical creepers or pests because he is afraid that otherwise the tree will not flourish and won't be fruitful
This is similar to the body of the wise person
It is natural for such a person to guard against wrong actions of body speech and mind so that they don't become the source for sadness and depression
Thus the SakavatiAjahn Teacher inquires into the first part of the Maatikaa which is kusala dhamma
He translates correctly and adds more similes so that I come to understand'
I wrote down the Thai translation of this text so that my readers can compare and understand its meaning
This Dhamm' alphabet is fast becoming extinct because nobody studies it anymore
Except that is for those who were ordained sixty years ago and learned it then
The Thai alphabet was then not so widespread and the monks had to learn the Dhamm' characters
We learned from actually reading the palm leaf manuscripts rather than just learning the vowels and consonants
The subject matter was always about the Buddha's Teachings
For instance about generosity morality and meditation about the heavenly fruits of good deeds and the dreadful results in hell of bad deeds
After studying one or two manuscripts one could read them all
In former days in the time of Wiangjan the people still flourished and prospered with the Lord Buddha's Teachings
They studied using three alphabets Dhamm' Korm and 'Small Thai'
They called them Dhamm' characters because they were only used for Dhamma the Teachings of the Lord Buddha
An exception being those monks who disrobed after many years and used their knowledge to gain a living in astrology or herbal medicine
Otherwise these characters were used to write down magic formula and spells
People then really held the Dhamm' characters to be sacred and supernaturally powerful
They considered them the very teaching of the Lord Buddha and it's true as they thought
We only studied the Korm characters enough to know what they were about but did not write in them
If they were used in writing again it was only for the Buddha's Teachings the same as the Dhamm'
The Lesser
Thai script could be used for anything and is still used to this day in Vientiane for that's where it originated but it has evolved a great deal since then The Buddhist Order of monks has an unbroken lineage of twentyfive centuries
In this world of growth and decay there is often need for reform as standards decline
Such reform historically has happened either through the king inviting knowledgeable monks to come and teach the ignorant monks or by an internal process
In the chaos that followed the destruction of the old Thai capital of Ayutthaya the general standard of the monk's understanding and conduct declined
When Crown Prince Monkut became a monk and learned the Pali language he found that there were great differences between what the texts described and what was actually practiced
A group of monks gathered around him intent on trying to follow more strictly the vinaya Discipline
When his son King Chulalongkorn ascended to the throne he formally acknowledged this reform group as the Dhammayut' Nikaya
As this reform movement spread in influence it acted as a catalyst for general reform
So that the majority grouping  the MahaaNikaya  reformed itself and the whole Community of monks became revitalized
This book spans the time when this reform movement was spreading and shows how it also affected the tudong monks out in the forests
Details of building projects abbreviated in the main text are detailed here
The Uposatha Hall of Wat Hin Mark Peng
Around Mr
Gong Pewsiri from Koke Sooak Village made a large Buddharuupa on the rocks facing the River Mekong using the local rock and organized it all himself for about one thousand baht
It was more than five metres high but wasn't particularly beautiful because the workers were just ordinary local artisans rather than expert craftsmen several attempts at remodelling transformed that into what we have today After it was finished we built a pavilion around it
On the twentysixth of March the monastery received a royal proclamation establishing its boundaries
Seeing that Wat Hin Mark Peng had now been properly established according to the law I decided it was the right time to build an Uposatha Hall
Formal meetings of the monks could then convene according to the Discipline and that would be for the future growth of the Buddhist Teaching
The site of the large Buddharuupa seemed ideal for if we were to build the Uposatha Hall around it we would have both a main Shrine Hall and the main presiding Buddharuupa
The foundation stonelaying ceremony took place on the twelfth of April with Somdet Phra Maha Virawong of Wat Sri Mahaa Dhaatu in Bangkaen Bangkok heading the monks and Air force Lt
General Choo Suddhichot' leading the lay devotees
They constructed this Uposatha Hall with tiered double roofs which are seven metres wide and twentyone metres long while the ceiling is nine metres above the floor in all it cost about seven hundred thousand baht
The consecration ceremony took place between the fifth and seventh of April
In the baked clay tile roof was replaced and it was redecorated inside and out which cost more than four hundred and fifty thousand baht
Wat Hin Mark Peng's Mondop
In I thought that this spot on the bank of the River Mekong would be an ideal site for building a mondop
It would be an artistic landmark for the Mekong River basin and have a Buddharuupa and Buddha relics
I also thought to myself that it could be a place to keep my bones and then other people would not have to trouble themselves about finding a place
 In things started to happen with plans being drawn and the Fine Arts Department inspecting and improving the artistic design it has three stories and is thirtysix metres high with each floor being thirteen metres square and the total cost was finally about five million baht
The Desarangsee Hall
 The original sala at Wat Hin Mark Peng was all wooden with some woven split bamboo sides and a tin roof this was replaced by the Sala Desapradit' that was also made of wood because of the number of visitors this gradually became too dilapidated and overcrowded so a new twostoried concrete sala was built twentythree metres wide by fortyfour metres long and cost more than seven and a half million baht
They named it the Sala Desarangsee BE
Mural Wall Painting
 Paintings were commissioned in September On the central wall they portray scenes from the Lord Buddha's life the righthand wall depicts aspects of Wat Hin Mark Peng the lefthand wall portrays Northeast regional customs and traditions They took twelve months to paint at a cost of six hundred and fifty thousand baht
The Bell Tower
 A bell that cost sixty thousand baht was cast and hung in a tower which cost three hundred and fifty thousand baht
Wat Hin Mark Peng's Library
The Drum Tower
Dwelling Places for the Monks
 Huts have been repaired and completely rebuilt large or small according to the circumstances usually in the Thai Style until there are now fiftysix huts or kutis for the monks and novices with thirtyseven in the nuns' quarters
The nuns' sala the kitchens toilets washing facilities a largish waterworks and electricity generators these are valued at not less than ten million baht
The Monastery Perimeter Wall
 Since the monastery became ever more solidly established with its area also expanding through donations
In the local District Officer helped arrange official acknowledgement of this with land deeds from the Department of Land for two hundred and sixtyone rai It was the first place in that region to have legal claim to the land
 seeing the expansion of the local villages and the already established nature of the monastery I thought it would be good to mark the boundaries clearly with a perimeter wall the provincial Accelerated Rural Development prepared the site and it was built in at a cost of more than one and a half million baht
After finishing all these building projects according to plan I thought it would be appropriate that everyone who had helped could come together and see the results and also take the opportunity to celebrate HM the King's Fifth Cycle Anniversary
So on the twentyfifth and twentysixth of April many senior monks and lay people came together to honor HM the King to admire the completed monastery and to celebrate my own eightyfifth birthday
I was able not only to establish Wat Hin Mark Peng on a solid foundation but the remaining resources were shared out among other deserving monasteries schools and hospitals etc To give some idea of this I will mention those projects that I can remember and have not yet described
Wat Araññavaasee received an Uposatha Hall a Dhamma Study Hall two kutis a perimeter wall and a concrete road
This cost more than nine million baht
Wat Phra Buddhabahtkorkaeng Srii Chiang Mai District received buildings costing more than three and a half million baht
Wat Pah Kut Ngiew Bahn Peur District more than two million baht
Wat Phra BuddhabahtBuabok Bahn Peur District more than three and a half million baht
Wat Pah Desarangsee Srii Chiang Mai District two and a half million baht
Wat Bodhisomphorn in Udornthani where one million baht was donated
The Phra BuddhabahtDesarangseeVitayah School of Srii Chiang Mai District and the Glahng Yai Nirodharangsee School in Bahn Peur District received school buildings worth four million seven hundred thousand baht
The Ministry of Education acknowledged this aid to their school's programme by honoring me in and with their special award and likewise in from the National Committee for Primary Education
The Nirodharangseekampeepaññajahn Trust which is a scholarship fund for poor but well behaved hard working and clever students in the province of Nongkhai
At present it contains almost one million twohundred thousand baht
There is also Nongkhai's Midday Meal Programme fund for pupils that stands at almost two and a half million baht
We are helping to provide a lunch time meal for pupils in six schools in the Bahn Mor  Phra Buddhabaht area and aim to give help provincewide
The Thate Desarangsee Fund for caring for the monks and novices and the maintenance of the buildings of Wat Hin Mark Peng which stands at five million seven hundred thousand baht
Besides this there are the following projects still being implemented
A hospital ward for monks and novices at Khon Kaen University Medical School that has four million two hundred thousand baht allocated to it at present
A hospital ward in the district hospital of Pa Tew in Chumporn Province that my devotees have named the Luang Poo Thate Desarangsee Eightyeighth Year Memorial Building and to which they have contributed three million baht
An Uposatha Hall at Wat Pah Nah Seedah
A crematorium for Wat Hin Mark
A water treatment plant for Wat Hin Mark
A Shrine Hall and guest kuti at Wat Hin Mark
Plans to build a ChediMuseum are now nearing completion
The words defined in this concise Glossary are mostly either Pali the language of the Theravada Buddhist scriptures or Thai
For Thai measurements place names titles etc also see under that heading
Anything fashioned by conditions whether physical or mental is called a sankhaara
All sankhaaras are unsteady and inconstant because they are continually moving and changing about
All sankhaaras are incapable of maintaining a lasting oneness This is why they are said to be stressful
No sankhaaras lie under anyone's control
They keep changing continually and no one can prevent them from doing so which is why they are said to be notself
All things whether mental or physical if they have these characteristics by nature are said to be notself
Even the quality of deathlessness  which is a quality or phenomenon free from fashioning conditions and which is the only thing in a state of lasting oneness  is also said to be notself because it lies above and beyond everything else
No one can think it or pull it under his or her control
Only those of right view whose conduct lies within the factors of the path can enter in to see this natural quality and remove their attachments to all things  including their attachment to the agent that goes about knowing those things
In the end there is no agent attaining or getting anything
However natural phenomena behave that is how they simply keep on behaving at all times
When meditators practice correctly and have the discernment to see that quality as it really is the result is that they can withdraw their attachments from all things  including their attachment to the discernment that enters in to see the quality as it really is
The practice of all things good and noble is to reach this very point

Phra Ajahn Thate Desarangsee
What are the four
Bhikkhus the bhikkhu following my Teaching keeps his mind steadfastly on the body with diligence comprehension and mindfulness thus keeping away covetousness and distress
The bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on sensation with diligence comprehension and mindfulness thus keeping away covetousness and distress
The bhikkhu concentrates steadfastly on the mind with diligence comprehension and mindfulness thus keeping away covetousness and distress
The bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the dhamma with diligence comprehension and mindfulness thus keeping away covetousness and distress
Then with entire mindfulness he breathes in and with entire mindfulness he breathes out
Breathing in a long inhalation he is conscious of breathing in a long inhalation or breathing out a long exhalation he is conscious of breathing out a long exhalation
Breathing in a short inhalation he is conscious of breathing in a short inhalation or breathing out a short exhalation he is conscious of breathing out a short exhalation
He trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the incoming breath at its beginning its middle and at its end
He trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the outgoing breath at its beginning its middle and at its end
he trains himself to calm down the strong inhalation as he breathes in
he trains himself to calm down the strong exhalation as he breathes out

Just as bhikkhus a skilful turner or a turner's apprentice knows a long pull when a long pull is made or knows a short pull when a short pull is made even so bhikkhus the bhikkhu breathing in a long inhalation is conscious of breathing in a long inhalation or breathing out a long exhalation is conscious of breathing out a long exhalation or breathing in a short inhalation is conscious of breathing in a short inhalation or breathing out a short exhalation is conscious of breathing out a short exhalation
He trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the incoming breath at its beginning its middle and at its end
He trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the outgoing breath at its beginning its middle and at its end
He trains himself to calm down the strong inhalation as he breathes in
He trains himself to calm down the strong exhalation as he breathes out
Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his
Occasionally he realizes that the aggregate of physical phenomena of others must be of a similar nature
Because of this realization he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena of others
In this way he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his or which is that of others
When he gains more concentration he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the aggregate of physical phenomena
He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena
He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena with their causes

And further the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there is only the aggregate of physical phenomena
That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights progressively solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage
The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating
Bhikkhus it is in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body perceiving its true nature
Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body
Occasionally he realizes that the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body of others must be of a similar nature
Because of this realization he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body of others
In this way he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his own body or which is that of others
When he gains more concentration he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body
He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body
He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body with their causes
And further the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there is only the aggregate of physical phenomena
That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights progressively solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage
The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating
Bhikkhus it is in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body perceiving its true nature
Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body Bhikkhus it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body
Just as if bhikkhus there were a bag with an opening at each end and full of various kinds of grain such as hillpaddy paddy green gram cowpea sesame and husked rice and a man with sound eyes having opened it should examine and reflect on the contents thus This is hillpaddy this is paddy this is green gram this is cowpea this is sesame this is husked rice even so bhikkhus the bhikkhu examines and reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet up and from the tips of the hair down enclosed by the skin and full of manifold impurities There are in this body hair of the head urine
Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body Bhikkhus it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body
Just as if bhikkhus a skilful butcher or a butcher's apprentice having slaughtered a cow and cut it up into portions should be sitting at the junction of four main roads even so the bhikkhu examines and reflects on this very body in whatever position it remains or is placed as composed of the primary elements
There are in this body only the earth element the water element the fire element and the air element
Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body Bhikkhus it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body
Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body Bhikkhus it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body
And again bhikkhus as if the bhikkhu is seeing a body abandoned in the charnelground being devoured by crows being devoured by hawks being devoured by vultures being devoured by herons being devoured by dogs being devoured by tigers being devoured by leopards being devoured by jackals or being devoured by various kinds of worms he applies this perception to his own body thus Indeed this body of mine too is of the same nature it will become like that it cannot escape such a fate
Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body Bhikkhus it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body
And again bhikkhus as if the bhikkhu is seeing a body abandoned in the charnelground  reduced to a skeleton held together by the tendons with some flesh and blood still adhering to it reduced to a skeleton held together by the tendons bloodbesmeared fleshless reduced to a skeleton still held together by the tendons without flesh and blood reduced to loose bones scattered in all directions  at one place bones of a hand at another place bones of a foot at another place anklebones at another place shinbones at another place thighbones at another place hipbones at another place ribbones at another place spinalbones at another place shoulderbones at another place neckbones at another place the jawbone at another place the teeth at another place the skull he a applies this perception to his own body thus Indeed this body of mine
too is of the same nature it will become like that it cannot escape such a fate
Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body Bhikkhus it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body
And again bhikkhus as if the bhikkhu is seeing a body abandoned in the charnelground  reduced to bleached bones of conchlike color reduced to bones more than a year old lying in a heap reduced to rotted bones crumbling to dust he then applies this perception to his own body thus Indeed this body of mine too is of the same nature it will become like that it cannot escape such a fate
Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his
Occasionally he realizes that the aggregate of physical phenomena of others must be of a similar nature
Because of this realization he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena of others
In this way he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his or which is that of others

The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating
Bhikkhus it is in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body perceiving its true nature
of Perception of the True Nature of the Body
Bhikkhus the bhikkhu who follows my Teaching when experiencing a pleasant sensation knows that a pleasant sensation is experienced or when experiencing an unpleasant sensation knows that an unpleasant sensation is experienced or when experiencing a sensation neither pleasant nor unpleasant knows that a sensation neither pleasant nor unpleasant is experienced
When experiencing a pleasant sensation associated with sensual desires he knows that a pleasant sensation associated with sensual desires is experienced or when experiencing a pleasant sensation not associated with sensual desires he knows that a pleasant sensation not associated with sensual desires is experienced when experiencing an unpleasant sensation associated with sensual desires he knows that an unpleasant sensation associated with sensual desires is experienced or when experiencing an unpleasant sensation not associated with sensual desires he knows that an unpleasant sensation not associated with sensual desires is experienced when experiencing a sensation neither pleasant nor unpleasant associated with sensual desires he knows that a sensation neither pleasant nor unpleasant associated with sensual desires is experienced or when experiencing a sensation neither pleasant nor unpleasant not associated with sensual desires he knows that a sensation neither pleasant nor unpleasant not associated with sensual desires is experienced
Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on sensation vedanā experienced by himself
Occasionally he realizes that sensation experienced by others must be of a similar nature
Because of this realization he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on sensation experienced by others
In this way he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on sensation experienced by himself or by others
When he gains more concentration he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of sensation
He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of sensation
He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of sensation with their causes
And further the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there is only sensation
That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights progressively solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage
The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating
Bhikkhus it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on sensation perceiving its true nature
Bhikkhus the bhikkhu following my Teaching knows the mind accompanied by passion as 'Mind with passion' he knows the mind unaccompanied by passion as 'Mind without passion' he also knows the mind accompanied by anger as 'Mind with anger' he also knows the mind unaccompanied by anger as 'Mind without anger' he also knows the mind accompanied by bewilderment as 'Mind with bewilderment' he also knows the mind unaccompanied by bewilderment as 'Mind without bewilderment' he also knows the indolent state of mind as 'Indolent state of mind' he also knows the distracted state of mind as 'Distracted state of mind' he also knows the developed state of mind as 'Developed state of mind' he also knows the undeveloped state of mind as 'Undeveloped state of mind' he also knows the inferior state of mind as 'Inferior state of mind' he also knows the superior state of mind as 'Superior state of mind' he also knows the mind in a state of concentration as 'Mind in a state of concentration' he also knows the mind not in a state of concentration as 'Mind not in a state of concentration' he also knows 'the liberated state of mind as 'Liberated state of mind' he also knows the unliberated state of mind as 'Unliberated state of mind'
Thus the bhikkhu concentrates steadfastly on his own mind
Occasionally he realizes that the mind of others must be of a similar nature
Because of this realization he can be said to concentrate steadfastly on the mind of others
In this way he is considered to concentrate steadfastly on his own mind or on the mind of others
When he gains more concentration he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the mind
He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the mind
He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the mind with their causes
And further the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there is only Mind

Thus spoke the Bhagava
Delighted the bhikkhus received the words of the Buddha with respectful appreciation
When the bhikkhu can steadfastly keep his mind on the bodypostures by means of diligence mindfulness concentration comprehension he perceives the sign or incessant appearance of physical phenomena This perception usually begins when the bhikkhu achieves the second vipassanā ñāṇa  paccaya pariggaha ñāṇa
From this perception the bhikkhu draws the conclusion that rebirth of beings take place in a similar way
Therefore while the bhikkhu is perceiving the continuous appearance of physical phenomena he realizes that endless rebirths are due to ignorance of Four Ariya Truths craving for pleasure of the senses kamma which has the potency for rebirth as its effect nutriment which is essential for physical phenomena mind which is the motivating force heat and cold
The causes of dissolution of physical phenomena are the absence of the above factors
The bhikkhu then realizes that extinction of ignorance of Four Ariya Truths will cause the extinction of endless appearance of physical phenomena
The actual perception of the sign of change or disappearance or deterioration of physical phenomena will begin when the bhikkhu achieves the third vipassanā ñāṇa  Sammasana ñāṇa
The sign of change is called viparinama lakkhaṇā
In fact the perception of the appearance and disappearance of physical phenomena by means of nibbatti and viparināma lakkhaṇā becomes clearer when the bhikkhu achieves the fourth vipassanā ñāṇa  Udayabbaya ñāṇa
However the perception of only the disappearance of physical phenomena becomes stronger when he achieves the fifth vipassanā ñāṇa  bhaṅga ñāṇa
These false views of the body and limbs begin to disappear when he achieves the fifth vipassanā ñāṇa  bhaṅga ñāṇa
From that stage the bhikkhu perceives only the deterioration of the body
And he is no longer conscious of the body and the limbs as such
And therefore he does not take pride and pleasure in them
With this perception of the nonexistence of the body and limbs he fully achieves the eleventh vipassanā ñāṇa 
The Pathavīdhātu is predominant in the first twenty items of the list given in Section
The podhātu is predominant in the last twelve items
The Tejodhātu consists of four kinds of heat in the body and Vāyo dhātu consists of six kinds of Vāyo in the body
As a matter of fact anuttara is normally an epithet for Lokuttarā citta or Maggaphala citta
However in vipassanā practice the yogi can concentrate only on the five upādānakkhandhas the five Aggregates which form the objects of Clinging
He cannot concentrate on Maggaphala citta
Therefore jhānas are given the epithet anuttara

Kāmacchanda all forms of taṇhā and lobha craving and desire
Byāpāda ill will harbouring evil desires to illtreat or destroy others or to bring others into trouble
Thinamiddha sloth and torpor feeling or indolence particularly for doing good and meritorious deeds
Uddhaccakukkucca distraction and worry
This has two aspects flitting about of the mind in all directions and worrying over past commissions and omissions
Vicikicchā doubt or wavering of mind
The discarded kāmacchanda will not rise again due to Arahatta Magga
The discarded byāpāda will not arise again due to Anāgāmi Magga
The discarded thinamiddha will not arise again due to Arahatta Magga
The discarded uddhaccakukkucca will not arise again due to Arahatta Magga and Anāgāmi Magga respectively
The discarded vicikicchā will not arise again due to Sotāpatti Magga
rūpakkhandhā the aggregate of physical phenomena or the body
vedanākkhandhā the aggregate of sensation or feeling
saññākhandhā the aggregate of perception
saṅkhārakkhandhā the aggregate of volitional thought and action or mental formations and
viññānakkhandhā the aggregate of consciousness
But the maggaphala citta is not an object of Clinging
Therefore only the viññānakkhandhā which does not include maggaphala citta can be the object of Clinging
This discourse is an interesting example of the folklore of the Pali canon
It shows that the tendency of Asian popular Buddhism to regard the Buddha as a protective figure and not just as a teacher has its roots in the earliest part of the tradition
Metrical analysis indicates that the long tribute section of this discourse is very old while the verses in the introductory section  which is also found in the Samyutta Nikaya  are later in form
This fits with a more subjective judgment that the tribute was an earlier composition  in the honorific style of the ancient court bards  to which the introduction was added later
This judgment is based on the fact that the two sections do not quite fit each other
The introduction to the tribute indicates that the reciter of the tribute is the Buddha himself whereas the narration in the tribute indicates otherwise
At any rate this discourse is the closest thing in the Pali canon to a who's who of the deva worlds and should provide useful material for anyone interested in the cosmology of early Buddhism
The Commentary reports the belief that the devas enjoy hearing this discourse chanted in Pali
Until recently it was part of many monks' standard memorized repertoire to be chanted at weddings and the dedication of new buildings
Even today as many of the traditions of memorization in Asia seem to be falling by the wayside there are a few monks and laypeople who chant this discourse regularly
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Great Wood together with a large Sangha of approximately five hundred bhikkhus all of them arahants
And most of the devatas from ten worldsystems had gathered in order to see the Blessed One and the Bhikkhu Sangha
Then the thought occurred to four devatas of the ranks from the Pure Abodes The Blessed One is dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Great Wood together with a large Sangha of about five hundred bhikkhus all of them arahants
And most of the devatas from ten worldsystems have gathered in order to see the Blessed One and the Bhikkhu Sangha
Let us also approach the Blessed One and on arrival let us each speak a verse in his presence
Then just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm those devatas disappeared from among the devas of the Pure Abodes and reappeared before the Blessed One
Having paid homage to the Blessed One they stood to one side
As they were standing there one devata recited this verse in the Blessed One's presence
Then another devata recited this verse in the Blessed One's presence
Then another devata recited this verse in the Blessed One's presence
Then another devata recited this verse in the Blessed One's presence
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks most of the devatas from ten worldsystems have gathered in order to see the Tathagata and the Bhikkhu Sangha
Those who in the past were Pure Ones Rightly Selfawakened at most had their devatagathering like mine at the present
Those who in the future will be Pure Ones Rightly Selfawakened will at most have their devatagathering like mine at the present
I will detail for you the names of the deva hosts
I will describe to you the names of the deva hosts
I will teach you the names of the deva hosts
Listen and pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord the monks replied
The Blessed One said
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Mahavana near the city of Kapilavatthu in the province of the Sakyans together with a great retinue of monks all of them arahants and five hundred in number
Devas from ten thousand worldsystems frequently assembled for the purpose of seeing the Blessed One and the bhikkhusangha
Then to four devas of the Suddhavasa brahma world this thought occurred The Blessed One is living in the Mahavana near the city of Kapilavatthu in the province of the Sakyans with a great retinue of monks all of them arahants and five hundred in number
Devas are frequently assembling there for the purpose of seeing the Blessed One and the bhikkhusangha
It is well if we were also to repair to the place where the Blessed One is and each of us recite a stanza in his presence
Then those devas as quickly as a strong man might stretch out his arm or bend his outstretched arm vanished from the pure abodes and appeared before the Blessed One saluted him and stood beside him
So standing one of the devas recited this stanza in his presence
There is a great assembly in the forest
A host of devas has assembled
We have come to this dhammaassembly to see the invincible sangha
Then another deva recited this stanza in the presence of the Blessed One
The monks in this have collected their thoughts and made their minds upright
The wise guard their senses even as a charioteer holds the reins
Then another deva recited this stanza in the presence of the Blessed One
Having cut off the stake having dug up the crossbar devoid of desire they go their way pure stainless with vision clear and well tamed these young arahants move about like elephants
Then another deva recited this stanza in the presence of the Blessed One
They who go for refuge to the Buddha shall not go to evil state of existence but will quit the human body and fill the ranks of the devas
The Blessed One then addressed the monks Often monks devas from the ten worldsystems foregather to see the Tathagata and the monks the community of bhikkhus
Devas have assembled before the consummate supreme Buddhas of the past devas will appear before the consummate supreme Buddhas of the future as they do assemble now before me
I will tell you monks the names of the host of devas I will reveal the names of the host of devas
Listen pay attention
I will speak Yes Venerable Sir said the monks by way of assent
The Blessed One said this

In measured speech I will give utterance
The terrestrial devas remain in their realm
Those bent on meditation frequent rocky clefts
Well composed they live like solitary lions overcoming the fear that causes hair to stand on end with immaculate minds pure serene and undefiled
Knowing that there were in the forest near the city of Kapilavatthu five hundred and more disciples delighted in the word of the Buddha the Master thereupon addressed them
Monks hosts of devas have assembled
Do know them well And they hearing the word of the Buddha strove ardently
There arose in them knowledge of perceiving the nonhumans
Some saw one hundred some thousand nonhumans and others seventy thousand nonhumans
Some saw one hundred thousand nonhumans others saw countless numbers every quarter being filled with them
Thereupon the seeing One knowing all things through super knowledge addressed the disciples delighted in the word of the Buddha
Monks host of devas have assembled

Those birds who carry away Nagas by force endowed with divine power and twice born with clear eyes have flown into the middle of the forest from the sky  Citra and Supanna are their names
At that time the Naga king were free from fear
The Buddha vouchsafed his protection to the Nagas from the harpies
Entreating one another with gentle words the Nagas and Suppanas took refuge in the Buddha
The Asuras dwelling in the ocean were defeated by Vajirahattha
They are brethren of Vasavassa possessed of iddhi power and are followed by a retinue of attendants
The terrible Kalakanjas the Danaveghasas Vepacitti Sucitti and Paharada  all Asuras have also come with Namuci

When all the Devas headed by Inda and all Brahmas headed by Haritta had come there came the host of Mara
Lo
The folly of Mara the Murky One
'Come on seize them bind them let them all be bound by lust surrounded on every side suffer not anybody to escape'

Mara thus striking the earth with his palm and thereby producing a dreadful sound as when a storm cloud thunders and causes lightning during rainy season sent his black army to the midst of the Devas
Nevertheless unable to bring the Devas under his sway he filled with anger
He recoiled
Then the Seeing One knowing perfectly well what had transpired addressed his disciples who take delight in the word of the Buddha
'Monks the host of Mara have come
Know them' And they hearing the word of the Buddha strove from their defilements
the army of Mara has departed even so much as a hair in them was not affected
All those disciples are victors in the war of passions they are free from fear glorious and renowned among mankind
They live rejoicing with Aryan disciples 
This is one of the most profound discourses in the Pali canon
It gives an extended treatment of the teachings of dependent coarising and notself in an outlined context of how these teachings function in practice
The first part of the discourse takes the factors of dependent coarising in sequence from effect to cause tracing them down to the mutual dependency of nameandform on the one hand and consciousness on the other
In connection with this point it is worth noting that the word great in the title of the discourse may have a double meaning modifying the word discourse  it's a long discourse  and modifying causes referring to the fact that nameandform and consciousness as causal factors can account for everything describable in the cosmos
After tracing the basic sequence of factors in the causal pattern the discourse then reviews their interrelationships showing how they can explain stress and suffering both on the individual and on the social level
The second part of the discourse taking up the teaching of notself shows how dependent coarising gives focus to this teaching in practice
It begins with a section on Delineations of a Self classifying the various ways in which a sense of self might be defined in terms of form
The scheme of analysis introduced in this section  classifying views of the self according to the variables of form and formless finite and infinite already existing naturally developing in the future and alterable through human effort  covers all the theories of the self proposed in the classical Upanisads as well as all theories of self or soul proposed in more recent times
The inclusion of an infinite self in this list gives the lie to the belief that the Buddha's teachings on notself were denying nothing more than a sense of separate or limited self
The discourse points out that even a limitless infinite allembracing sense of self is based on an obsession in the mind that has to be abandoned
The following section on Nondelineations of a Self shows that it is possible for the mind to function without reading a self into experience
The remaining sections focus on ways in which this can be done by treating the sense of self as it relates to different aspects of nameandform
The first of these sections  Assumptions of a Self  focuses on the sense of self as it relates to feeling one of the name factors in nameandform
The next section  Seven Stations of Consciousness  focuses on form formlessness and perception which is another one of the name factors that allows a place for consciousness to land and grow on the macro level in the cycle of death and rebirth
The last section  Eight Emancipations  focuses on form formlessness and perception on the micro level in the practice of meditative absorption
In each of these cases once the sense of attachment and identification with nameandform can be broken the mutual dependency between consciousness and nameandform is broken as well
This brings about total freedom from the limits of the extent to which there are means of designation expression and delineation the extent to which the sphere of discernment extends the extent to which the cycle revolves for the manifesting of this world  ie nameandform together with consciousness This is the release at which the Buddha's teachings are aimed
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was living among the Kurus
Now the Kurus have a town named Kammasadhamma
There Ven
Ananda approached the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One It's amazing lord it's astounding how deep this dependent coarising is and how deep its appearance and yet to me it seems as clear as clear can be
Don't say that Ananda
Don't say that
Deep is this dependent coarising and deep its appearance
It's because of not understanding and not penetrating this Dhamma that this generation is like a tangled skein a knotted ball of string like matted rushes and reeds and does not go beyond transmigration beyond the planes of deprivation woe and bad destinations
If one is asked 'Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for aging and death' one should answer 'There is'
If one is asked 'From what requisite condition do aging and death come' one should say 'Aging and death come from birth as their requisite condition'
If one is asked 'Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for birth' one should answer 'There is'
If one is asked 'From what requisite condition does birth come' one should say 'Birth comes from becoming as its requisite condition'
If one is asked 'Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for becoming' one should answer 'There is'
If one is asked 'From what requisite condition does becoming come' one should say 'Becoming comes from clinging as its requisite condition'
If one is asked 'Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for clinging' one should answer 'There is'
If one is asked 'From what requisite condition does clinging come' one should say 'Clinging comes from craving as its requisite condition'
If one is asked 'Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for craving' one should answer 'There is'
If one is asked 'From what requisite condition does craving come' one should say 'Craving comes from feeling as its requisite condition'
If one is asked 'Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for feeling' one should answer 'There is'
If one is asked 'From what requisite condition does feeling come' one should say 'Feeling comes from contact as its requisite condition'
If one is asked 'Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for contact' one should answer 'There is'
If one is asked 'From what requisite condition does contact come' one should say 'Contact comes from nameandform as its requisite condition'
If one is asked 'Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for nameandform' one should answer 'There is'
If one is asked 'From what requisite condition does nameandform come' one should say 'Nameandform comes from consciousness as its requisite condition'
If one is asked 'Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for consciousness' one should answer 'There is'
If one is asked 'From what requisite condition does consciousness come' one should say 'Consciousness comes from nameandform as its requisite condition'
Thus Ananda from nameandform as a requisite condition comes consciousness
From consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameandform
From nameandform as a requisite condition comes contact
From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling
From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving
From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging
From clinging as a requisite condition comes becoming
From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth
From birth as a requisite condition aging death sorrow lamentation pain distress and despair come into play
Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress
'From birth as a requisite condition come aging and death' Thus it has been said
And this is the way to understand how from birth as a requisite condition come aging and death
If there were no birth at all in any way of anything anywhere  ie of devas in the state of devas of celestials in the state of celestials of spirits in the state of spirits of demons in the state of demons of human beings in the human state of quadrupeds in the state of quadrupeds of birds in the state of birds of snakes in the state of snakes or of any being in its own state  in the utter absence of birth from the cessation of birth would aging and death be discerned
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for aging and death ie birth
'From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth' Thus it has been said
And this is the way to understand how from becoming as a requisite condition comes birth
If there were no becoming at all in any way of anything anywhere  ie sensual becoming form becoming or formless becoming  in the utter absence of becoming from the cessation of becoming would birth be discerned
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for birth ie becoming
'From clinging as a requisite condition comes becoming' Thus it has been said
And this is the way to understand how from clinging as a requisite condition comes becoming
If there were no clinging at all in any way of anything anywhere  ie clinging to sensuality clinging to precepts and practices clinging to views or clinging to doctrines of the self  in the utter absence of clinging from the cessation of clinging would becoming be discerned
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for becoming ie clinging
'From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging' Thus it has been said
And this is the way to understand how from craving as a requisite condition comes clinging
If there were no craving at all in any way of anything anywhere  ie craving for sensuality craving for becoming craving for no becoming  in the utter absence of craving from the cessation of craving would clinging be discerned
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for clinging ie craving
'From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving' Thus it has been said
And this is the way to understand how from feeling as a requisite condition comes craving
If there were no feeling at all in any way of anything anywhere  ie feeling born of contact at the eye feeling born of contact at the ear feeling born of contact at the nose feeling born of contact at the tongue feeling born of contact at the body or feeling born of contact at the intellect  in the utter absence of feeling from the cessation of feeling would craving be discerned
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for craving ie feeling
Now craving is dependent on feeling seeking is dependent on craving acquisition is dependent on seeking ascertainment is dependent on acquisition desire and passion is dependent on ascertainment attachment is dependent on desire and passion possessiveness is dependent on attachment stinginess is dependent on possessiveness defensiveness is dependent on stinginess and because of defensiveness dependent on defensiveness various evil unskillful phenomena come into play the taking up of sticks and knives conflicts quarrels and disputes accusations divisive speech and lies
And this is the way to understand how it is that because of defensiveness various evil unskillful phenomena come into play the taking up of sticks and knives conflicts quarrels and disputes accusations divisive speech and lies
If there were no defensiveness at all in any way of anything anywhere in the utter absence of defensiveness from the cessation of defensiveness would various evil unskillful phenomena  the taking up of sticks and knives conflicts quarrels and disputes accusations divisive speech and lies  come into play
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for the comingintoplay of various evil unskillful phenomena  the taking up of sticks and knives conflicts quarrels and disputes accusations divisive speech and lies  ie defensiveness
'Defensiveness is dependent on stinginess' Thus it has been said
And this is the way to understand how defensiveness is dependent on stinginess
If there were no stinginess at all in any way of anything anywhere in the utter absence of stinginess from the cessation of stinginess would defensiveness be discerned
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for defensiveness ie stinginess
'Seeking is dependent on craving' Thus it has been said
And this is the way to understand how seeking is dependent on craving
If there were no craving at all in any way of anything anywhere  ie craving for sensuality craving for becoming craving for no becoming  in the utter absence of craving from the cessation of craving would seeking be discerned
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for seeking ie craving
Thus Ananda these two phenomena as a duality flow back into one place at feeling
'From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling' Thus it has been said
And this is the way to understand how from contact as a requisite condition comes feeling
If there were no contact at all in any way of anything anywhere  ie contact at the eye contact at the ear contact at the nose contact at the tongue contact at the body or contact at the intellect  in the utter absence of contact from the cessation of contact would feeling be discerned
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for feeling ie contact
'From nameform as a requisite condition comes contact
Thus it has been said
And this is the way to understand how from nameform as a requisite condition comes contact
If the qualities traits themes  indicators by which there is a description of namegroup were all absent would designationcontact with regard to the formgroup be discerned
No lord
If the permutations signs themes and indicators by which there is a description of formgroup were all absent would resistancecontact with regard to the namegroup be discerned
No lord
If the permutations signs themes and indicators by which there is a description of namegroup and formgroup were all absent would designationcontact or resistancecontact be discerned
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for contact ie nameandform
'From consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameandform' Thus it has been said
And this is the way to understand how from consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameandform
If consciousness were not to descend into the mother's womb would nameandform take shape in the womb
No lord
If after descending into the womb consciousness were to depart would nameandform be produced for this world
No lord
If the consciousness of the young boy or girl were to be cut off would nameandform ripen grow and reach maturity
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for nameandform ie consciousness
'From nameandform as a requisite condition comes consciousness' Thus it has been said
And this is the way to understand how from nameandform as a requisite condition comes consciousness
If consciousness were not to gain a foothold in nameandform would a comingintoplay of the origination of birth aging death and stress in the future be discerned
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for consciousness ie nameandform
This is the extent to which there is birth aging death passing away and rearising
This is the extent to which there are means of designation expression and delineation
This is the extent to which the sphere of discernment extends the extent to which the cycle revolves for the manifesting of this world  ie nameandform together with consciousness
To what extent Ananda does one delineate when delineating a self
Either delineating a self possessed of form and finite one delineates that 'My self is possessed of form and finite' Or delineating a self possessed of form and infinite one delineates that 'My self is possessed of form and infinite' Or delineating a self formless and finite one delineates that 'My self is formless and finite' Or delineating a self formless and infinite one delineates that 'My self is formless and infinite'
Now the one who when delineating a self delineates it as possessed of form and finite either delineates it as possessed of form and finite in the present or of such a nature that it will become possessed of form and finite or he believes that 'Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that way' This being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self possessed of form and finite obsesses him
The one who when delineating a self delineates it as possessed of form and infinite either delineates it as possessed of form and infinite in the present or of such a nature that it will become possessed of form and infinite or he believes that 'Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that way' This being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self possessed of form and infinite obsesses him
The one who when delineating a self delineates it as formless and finite either delineates it as formless and finite in the present or of such a nature that it will become formless and finite or he believes that 'Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that way' This being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self formless and finite obsesses him
The one who when delineating a self delineates it as formless and infinite either delineates it as formless and infinite in the present or of such a nature that it will become formless and infinite or he believes that 'Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that way' This being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self formless and infinite obsesses him
To what extent Ananda does one not delineate when not delineating a self
Either not delineating a self possessed of form and finite one does not delineate that 'My self is possessed of form and finite' Or not delineating a self possessed of form and infinite one does not delineate that 'My self is possessed of form and infinite' Or not delineating a self formless and finite one does not delineate that 'My self is formless and finite' Or not delineating a self formless and infinite one does not delineate that 'My self is formless and infinite'
Now the one who when not delineating a self does not delineate it as possessed of form and finite does not delineate it as possessed of form and finite in the present nor does he delineate it as of such a nature that it will become possessed of form and finite nor does he believe that 'Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that way' This being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self possessed of form and finite does not obsess him
The one who when not delineating a self does not delineate it as possessed of form and infinite does not delineate it as possessed of form and infinite in the present nor does he delineate it as of such a nature that it will become possessed of form and infinite nor does he believe that 'Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that way' This being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self possessed of form and infinite does not obsess him
The one who when not delineating a self does not delineate it as formless and finite does not delineate it as formless and finite in the present nor does he delineate it as of such a nature that it will become formless and finite nor does he believe that 'Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that way' This being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self formless and finite does not obsess him
The one who when not delineating a self does not delineate it as formless and infinite does not delineate it as formless and infinite in the present nor does he delineate it as of such a nature that it will become formless and infinite nor does he believe that 'Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that way' This being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self formless and infinite does not obsess him
To what extent Ananda does one assume when assuming a self
Assuming feeling to be the self one assumes that 'Feeling is my self' 'Feeling is not my self My self is oblivious ' 'Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious to feeling but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feeling'
Now one who says 'Feeling is my self' should be addressed as follows 'There are these three feelings my friend  feelings of pleasure feelings of pain and feelings of neither pleasure nor pain
Which of these three feelings do you assume to be the self' At a moment when a feeling of pleasure is sensed no feeling of pain or of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed
Only a feeling of pleasure is sensed at that moment
At a moment when a feeling of pain is sensed no feeling of pleasure or of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed
Only a feeling of pain is sensed at that moment
At a moment when a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed no feeling of pleasure or of pain is sensed
Only a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed at that moment
Now a feeling of pleasure is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessation
A feeling of pain is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessation
A feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessation
Having sensed a feeling of pleasure as 'my self' then with the cessation of one's very own feeling of pleasure 'my self' has perished
Having sensed a feeling of pain as 'my self' then with the cessation of one's very own feeling of pain 'my self' has perished
Having sensed a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain as 'my self' then with the cessation of one's very own feeling of neither pleasure nor pain 'my self' has perished
Thus he assumes assuming in the immediate present a self inconstant entangled in pleasure and pain subject to arising and passing away he who says 'Feeling is my self' Thus in this manner Ananda one does not see fit to assume feeling to be the self
As for the person who says 'Feeling is not the self My self is oblivious' he should be addressed as follows 'My friend where nothing whatsoever is sensed at all would there be the thought I am' No lord
Thus in this manner Ananda one does not see fit to assume that 'Feeling is not my self My self is oblivious'
As for the person who says 'Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feeling' he should be addressed as follows 'My friend should feelings altogether and every way stop without remainder then with feeling completely not existing owing to the cessation of feeling would there be the thought I am' No lord
Thus in this manner Ananda one does not see fit to assume that 'Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feeling'
Now Ananda in as far as a monk does not assume feeling to be the self nor the self as oblivious nor that 'My self feels in that my self is subject to feeling' then not assuming in this way he is not sustained by anything in the world
Unsustained he is not agitated
Unagitated he is totally unbound right within
He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
If anyone were to say with regard to a monk whose mind is thus released that 'The Tathagata exists after death' is his view that would be mistaken that 'The Tathagata does not exist after death' that 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death' that 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death' is his view that would be mistaken
Why
Having directly known the extent of designation and the extent of the objects of designation the extent of expression and the extent of the objects of expression the extent of description and the extent of the objects of description the extent of discernment and the extent of the objects of discernment the extent to which the cycle revolves Having directly known that the monk is released
'The monk released having directly known that does not see does not know is his opinion' that would be mistaken

Ananda there are these seven stations of consciousness and two spheres
Which seven
There are beings with diversity of body and diversity of perception such as human beings some devas and some beings in the lower realms
This is the first station of consciousness
There are beings with diversity of body and singularity of perception such as the devas of the Brahma hosts generated by the first and some beings in the four realms of deprivation
This is the second station of consciousness

There are beings with singularity of body and diversity of perception such as the Radiant Devas
This is the third station of consciousness
There are beings with singularity of body and singularity of perception such as the Beautifully Lustrous Devas
This is the fourth station of consciousness
There are beings whowith the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity 'Infinite space' arrive at the dimension of the infinitude of space
This is the fifth station of consciousness
There are beings who with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space 'Infinite consciousness' arrive at the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
This is the sixth station of consciousness
There are beings who with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness 'There is nothing' arrive at the dimension of nothingness
This is the seventh station of consciousness
The dimension of nonpercipient beings and second the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception

Now as for the first station of consciousness  beings with diversity of body and diversity of perception such as human beings some devas and some beings in the lower realms If one discerns that discerns its origination discerns its passing away discerns its allure discerns its drawbacks discerns the escape from it would it be proper by means of that to take delight there
No lord
Ananda when knowing  as they actually are  the origination passing away allure drawbacks of  and escape from  these seven stations of consciousness and two spheres a monk is released through lack of clinging he is said to be a monk released through discernment
Ananda there are these eight emancipations
Which eight
Possessed of form one sees forms
This is the first emancipation
Not percipient of form internally one sees forms externally
This is the second emancipation
One is intent only on the beautiful
This is the third emancipation
With the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity 'Infinite space' one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space
This is the fourth emancipation
With the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space 'Infinite consciousness' one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
This is the fifth emancipation
With the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness 'There is nothing' one enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness
This is the sixth emancipation
With the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness one enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
This is the seventh emancipation
With the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception one enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling
This is the eighth emancipation
Now when a monk attains these eight emancipations in forward order in reverse order in forward and reverse order when he attains them and emerges from them wherever he wants however he wants and for as long as he wants when through the ending of the mental fermentations he enters and remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease and discernmentrelease having directly known it and realized it in the here and now he is said to be a monk released in both ways
And as for another release in both ways higher or more sublime than this there is none
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Ven
Ananda delighted in the Blessed One's words
Thus I would reconstruct the Pali of the final sentence in this paragraph as Tadabhiññaa vimutto bhikkhu na jaanaati na passati iti saa ditthi tadakallam
This sutta portrays two modes by which the Buddha responded to the controversial issues of his day
The first mode  illustrated by his contribution to the discussion on the ultimate cessation of perception  was to adopt the terms of the discussion but to invest them with his own meanings and then to try to direct the discussion to the practice leading to the cessation of suffering  stress
The second mode  illustrated by his treatment of whether the cosmos is eternal etc
 was to declare the issues as unconducive to awakening and to refuse to take a position on them
Several other suttas  such as MN MN and AN
 portray the Buddha and his disciples adopting the second mode
This sutta is unusual in its extended portrait of the Buddha's adopting the first
Many of the technical terms he uses here  such as the perception of a refined truth the peak of perception the alert stepby step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception the acquisition of a self  are found no where else in the Canon
At the end of the sutta he describes them as the world's designations the world's expressions the world's ways of speaking the world's descriptions with which the Tathagata expresses himself but without grasping at them In other words he picks them up for the purpose at hand and then lets them go
Thus they are not to be regarded as central to his teaching
Instead they should be read as examples of his ability to adapt the language of his interlocutors to his own purposes
For this reason this sutta is best read only after you have read other suttas and are familiar with the more central concepts of the Buddha's teachings
Of particular interest here is the Buddha's treatment of the three acquisitions of a self The first  the gross self  refers to the ordinary everyday sense of identifying with one's body
The latter two  the mindmade acquisition and the formless acquisition  refer to the sense of self that can be developed in meditation
The mindmade acquisition can result from an experience of the mindmade body  the astral body  that constitutes one of the powers that can be developed through concentration practice
The formless acquisition can result from any of the formless states of concentration  such as an experience of infinite space infinite consciousness or nothingness
Although meditators on experiencing these states might assume that they have encountered their true self the Buddha is careful to note that these are acquisitions and that they are no more one's true self than the body is
They are one's acquisition of a self only for the time that one identifies with them
The Buddha goes on to say that he teaches the Dhamma for the sake of abandoning every acquisition of a self such that when you practice it defiling mental qualities will be abandoned bright mental qualities will grow and you will enter  remain in the culmination  abundance of discernment having known  realized it for yourself in the here  now
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Now on that occasion Potthapada the wanderer together with a large following of about wanderers had taken up residence in the debating hall near the Tinduka tree in the singlepavilion park of Queen Mallika
Then the Blessed One early in the morning taking his robes  bowl entered Savatthi for alms
Then the thought occurred to him While it's still too early to go into Savatthi for alms why don't I go to the debating hall near the Tinduka tree in the singlepavilion park of Queen Mallika to see Potthapada the wanderer So he went to the debating hall near the Tinduka tree in the singlepavilion park of Queen Mallika
Now on that occasion Potthapada the wanderer was sitting with his large following of wanderers all making a great noise  racket discussing many kinds of bestial topics of conversation conversation about kings robbers  ministers of state armies alarms  battles food  drink clothing furniture garlands  scents relatives vehicles villages towns cities the countryside women  heroes the gossip of the street  the well tales of the dead tales of diversity the creation of the world  of the sea talk of whether things exist or not
Then Potthapada the wanderer saw the Blessed One coming from afar and on seeing him hushed his following Be quiet good sirs
Don't make any noise
Here comes Gotama the contemplative
He is fond of quietude and speaks in praise of quietude
Maybe if he perceives our group as quiet he will consider it worth his while to come our way So the wanderers fell silent
Then the Blessed One went to Potthapada and Potthapada said to him Come Blessed One
Welcome Blessed One
It's been a long time since the Blessed One has gone out of his way to come here
Sit down Blessed One
This seat has been prepared So the Blessed One sat on the prepared seat
Potthapada taking a lower seat sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him For what topic of conversation are you gathered together here
In the midst of what topic of conversation have you been interrupted
When this was said Potthapada replied Never mind lord about the topic of conversation for which we have gathered here
It won't be difficult for the Blessed One to hear about that later
For the past few days a discussion has arisen among the many sects of brahmans  contemplatives gathered and sitting together in the debating hall concerning the ultimate cessation of perception 'How is there the ultimate cessation of perception' With regard to this some said 'A person's perception arises and ceases without cause without reason
When it arises one is percipient
When it ceases one is not percipient' That's how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception
Then someone else said 'No that's not how it is
Perception is a person's self which comes and goes
When it comes one is percipient
When it goes one is not percipient' That's how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception
Then someone else said 'No that's not how it is for there are brahmans  contemplatives of great power great potency
They draw perception in and out of a person
When they draw it in one is percipient
When they draw it out one is not percipient' That's how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception
Then someone else said 'No that's not how it is for there are devas of great power great potency
They draw perception in and out of a person
When they draw it in one is percipient
When they draw it out one is not percipient' That's how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception
Then the memory of the Blessed One arose within me 'Ah the Blessed One
Ah the One Wellgone  who surely is wellskilled in these matters' The Blessed One is skilled and expert in the ultimate cessation of perception
So what lord is the ultimate cessation of perception
In this regard Potthapada those brahmans  contemplatives who say that a person's perception arises  ceases without cause without reason are wrong from the very start
Why is that
Because a person's perception arises  ceases with a cause with a reason
With training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases
And what is that training
There is the case where a Tathagata appears in the world worthy and rightly selfawakened
This is how a monk is consummate in virtue
Seeing that these five hindrances have been abandoned within him he becomes glad
Glad he becomes enraptured
Enraptured his body grows tranquil
His body tranquil he is sensitive to pleasure
Feeling pleasure his mind becomes concentrated
Quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities the monk enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
His earlier perception of sensuality ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of seclusion
On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of seclusion
And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases
Then with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations the monk enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
His earlier perception of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of seclusion ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of concentration
On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of concentration
And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases
And then with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' His earlier perception of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of concentration ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of equanimity
On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of equanimity
And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases
And then with the abandoning of pleasure and pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress  the monk enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain
His earlier perception of a refined truth of equanimity ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of neither pleasure nor pain
On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of neither pleasure nor pain
And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases
And then with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity 'Infinite space' the monk enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space
His earlier perception of a refined truth of neither pleasure nor pain ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space
On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space
And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases
And then with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space 'Infinite consciousness' the monk enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
His earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases
And then with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness 'There is nothing' enters  remains in the dimension of nothingness
His earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of nothingness
On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of nothingness
And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases

Now when the monk is percipient of himself here then from there to there step by step he touches the peak of perception
As he remains at the peak of perception the thought occurs to him 'Thinking is bad for me
Not thinking is better for me
If I were to think and will this perception of mine would cease and a grosser perception would appear
What if I were neither to think nor to will' So he neither thinks nor wills and as he is neither thinking nor willing that perception ceases and another grosser perception does not appear
He touches cessation
This Potthapada is how there is the alert stepby step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception
Now what do you think Potthapada  have you ever before heard of such an alert stepby step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception
No lord
And here is how I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One 'When the monk is percipient of himself here then from there to there step by step he touches the peak of perception
As he remains at the peak of perception the thought occurs to him Thinking is bad for me
Not thinking is better for me
If I were to think and will this perception of mine would cease and a grosser perception would appear
What if I were neither to think nor to will So he neither thinks nor wills and as he is neither thinking nor willing that perception ceases and another grosser perception does not appear
He touches cessation
This Potthapada is how there is the alert stepby step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception' That's right Potthapada
But lord does the Blessed One describe one peak of perception or many peaks of perception
Potthapada I describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perception
And how does the Blessed One describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perception
In whatever way one touches cessation Potthapada that's the way I describe the peak of perception
That's how I describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perception
Now lord does perception arise first and knowledge after or does knowledge arise first and perception after or do perception  knowledge arise simultaneously
Potthapada perception arises first and knowledge after
And the arising of knowledge comes from the arising of perception
One discerns 'It's in dependence on this that my knowledge has arisen' Through this line of reasoning one can realize how perception arises first and knowledge after and how the arising of knowledge comes from the arising of perception
Now lord is perception a person's self or is perception one thing and self another
What self do you posit Potthapada
I posit a gross self possessed of form made up of the four great existents feeding on physical food
Then Potthapada your self would be gross possessed of form made up of the four great existents feeding on physical food
That being the case then for you perception would be one thing and self another
And it's through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another even as there remains this gross self  possessed of form made up of the four great existents and feeding on food  one perception arises for that person as another perception passes away
It's through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another
Then lord I posit a mindmade self complete in all its parts not inferior in its faculties 
Then Potthapada your self would be mindmade complete in all its parts not inferior in its faculties
That being the case then for you perception would be one thing and self another
And it's through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another even as there remains this mindmade self  complete in all its parts not inferior in its faculties  one perception arises for that person as another perception passes away
It's through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another
Then lord I posit a formless self made of perception
Then Potthapada your self would be formless and made of perception
That being the case then for you perception would be one thing and self another
And it's through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another even as there remains this formless self made of perception one perception arises for that person as another perception passes away
It's through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another
Is it possible for me to know lord whether perception is a person's self or if perception is one thing and self another
Potthapada  having other views other practices other satisfactions other aims other teachers  it's hard for you to know whether perception is a person's self or if perception is one thing and self another
Well then lord if  having other views other practices other satisfactions other aims other teachers  it's hard for me to know whether perception is a person's self or if perception is one thing and self another then is it the case that the cosmos is eternal that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless
Potthapada I haven't expounded that the cosmos is eternal that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless
Then is it the case that the cosmos is not eternal that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless
Potthapada I haven't expounded that the cosmos is not eternal that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless
Then is it the case that the cosmos is finite the cosmos is infinite the soul  the body are the same the soul is one thing and the body another after death a Tathagata exists after death a Tathagata does not exist after death a Tathagata both exists  does not exist after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless
Potthapada I haven't expounded that after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless
But why hasn't the Blessed One expounded these things
Because they are not conducive to the goal are not conducive to the Dhamma are not basic to the holy life
They don't lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
That's why I haven't expounded them
And what has the Blessed One expounded
I have expounded that 'This is stress' 'This is the origination of stress' 'This is the cessation of stress' 'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress'
And why has the Blessed One expounded these things
Because they are conducive to the goal conducive to the Dhamma and basic to the holy life
They lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
That's why I have expounded them
So it is Blessed One
So it is O One Wellgone
Well now it's time for the Blessed One to do as he sees fit
Then the Blessed One got up from his seat and left
Not long after he had left the wanderers with sneering words jeered at Potthapada the wanderer from all sides So whatever Gotama the contemplative says Sir Potthapada rejoices in his every word 'So it is Blessed One
So it is O One Wellgone' But we don't understand Gotama the contemplative as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is infinite or the cosmos is finite or whether after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist
When this was said Potthapada the wanderer replied to the wanderers I too don't understand Gotama the contemplative as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is infinite or the cosmos is finite or whether after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist
But Gotama the contemplative describes a genuine authentic and accurate practice grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the Dhamma
And when a genuine authentic and accurate practice grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the Dhamma is being explained why shouldn't a knowledgeable person such as myself rejoice in the wellspokenness of Gotama the contemplative's wellspoken words
Then two or three days later Citta the elephant trainer's son and Potthapada the wanderer went to the Blessed One
On their arrival Citta bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side while Potthapada the wanderer greeted the Blessed One courteously
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One The other day not long after the Blessed One had left the wanderers with sneering words jeered at me from all sides 'So whatever Gotama the contemplative says Sir Potthapada rejoices in his every word So it is Blessed One
So it is O One Wellgone But we don't understand Gotama the contemplative as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is infinite or the cosmos is finite or whether after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist'
When this was said I replied to the wanderers 'I too don't understand Gotama the contemplative as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is infinite or the cosmos is finite or whether after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist
But Gotama the contemplative describes a genuine authentic and accurate practice grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the Dhamma
And when a genuine authentic and accurate practice grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the Dhamma is being explained why shouldn't a knowledgeable person such as myself rejoice in the wellspokenness of Gotama the contemplative's wellspoken words' Potthapada all those wanderers are blind and have no eyes
You alone among them have eyes
I have taught and declared some teachings to be categorical and some teachings to be noncategorical
And what are the teachings that I have taught and declared to be noncategorical
'The cosmos is eternal' I have taught and declared to be an noncategorical teaching
'The cosmos is not eternal' 'The cosmos is finite' 'The cosmos is infinite' 'The soul  the body are the same' 'The soul is one thing and the body another' 'After death a Tathagata exists' 'After death a Tathagata does not exist' 'After death a Tathagata both exists  does not exist' 'After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist' I have taught and declared to be an noncategorical teaching
And why have I taught and declared these teachings to be noncategorical
Because they are not conducive to the goal are not conducive to the Dhamma are not basic to the holy life
They don't lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
That's why I have taught and declared them to be noncategorical
And what have I taught and declared to be categorical teachings
'This is stress' I have taught and declared to be a categorical teaching
'This is the origination of stress' 'This is the cessation of stress' 'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress' I have taught and declared to be a categorical teaching
And why have I taught and declared these teachings to be categorical
Because they are conducive to the goal conducive to the Dhamma and basic to the holy life
They lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
That's why I have taught and declared them to be categorical
There are some brahmans  contemplatives with a doctrine  view like this 'After death the self is exclusively happy and free from disease' I approached them and asked them 'Is it true that you have a doctrine  view like this After death the self is exclusively happy and free from disease' When asked this they replied 'Yes' So I asked them 'But do you dwell having known or seen an exclusively happy world' When asked this they said 'No' So I asked them 'But have you ever been aware of a self exclusively happy for a day or a night or for half a day or half a night' When asked this they said 'No' So I asked them 'But do you know that This is the path this is the practice for the realization of an exclusively happy world' When asked this they said 'No' So I asked them 'But have you heard the voices of devas reborn in an exclusively happy world saying Practice well my dears
Practice straightforwardly my dears for the realization of an exclusively happy world because it was through such a practice that we ourselves have been reborn in an exclusively happy world' When asked this they said 'No'
So what do you think Potthapada  when this is the case don't the words of those brahmans  contemplatives turn out to be unconvincing
Yes lord
When this is the case the words of those brahmans  contemplatives turn out to be unconvincing
Potthapada it's as if a man were to say 'I'm in love with the most beautiful woman in this country' and other people were to say to him 'Well my good man this most beautiful woman in this country with whom you are in love do you know if she's of the warrior caste the priestly caste the merchant caste or the laborer caste' and when asked this he would say 'No' Then they would say to him 'Well then do you know her name or clan name
Whether she's tall short or of medium height
Whether she's dark fair or ruddyskinned
Do you know what village or town or city she's from' When asked this he would say 'No' Then they would say to him 'So you've never known or seen the woman you're in love with' When asked this he would say 'Yes'
So what do you think Potthapada  when this is the case don't the words of that man turn out to be unconvincing
Yes lord In the same way there are some brahmans  contemplatives with a doctrine  view like this 'After death the self is exclusively happy and free from disease' Don't the words of those brahmans  contemplatives turn out to be unconvincing
Yes lord Potthapada it's as if a man at a crossroads were to build a staircase for ascending to a palace and other people were to say to him 'Well my good man this palace for which you are building a staircase do you know whether it's east west north or south of here
Whether it's high low or in between' and when asked this he would say 'No' Then they would say to him 'So you don't know or see the palace for which you are building a staircase' When asked this he would say 'Yes'
So what do you think Potthapada  when this is the case don't the words of that man turn out to be unconvincing
Yes lord In the same way there are some brahmans  contemplatives with a doctrine  view like this 'After death the self is exclusively happy and free from disease' Don't the words of those brahmans  contemplatives turn out to be unconvincing
Yes lord
When this is the case the words of those brahmans  contemplatives turn out to be unconvincing
Potthapada there are these three acquisitions of a self the gross acquisition of a self the mindmade acquisition of a self and the formless acquisition of a self
And what is the gross acquisition of a self
Possessed of form made up of the four great existents feeding on physical food this is the gross acquisition of a self
And what is the mindmade acquisition of a self
Possessed of form mindmade complete in all its parts not inferior in its faculties this is the mindmade acquisition of a self
And what is the formless acquisition of a self
Formless and made of perception this is the formless acquisition of a self
I teach the Dhamma for the abandoning of the gross acquisition of a self such that when you practice it defiling mental qualities will be abandoned bright mental qualities will grow and you will enter  remain in the culmination  abundance of discernment having known  realized it for yourself in the here  now
If the thought should occur to you that when defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown and one enters  remains in the culmination  abundance of discernment having known  realized it for oneself in the here  now one's abiding is stressfulpainful you should not see it in that way
When defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown and one enters  remains in the culmination  abundance of discernment having known  realized it for oneself in the here  now there is joy rapture serenity mindfulness alertness and a pleasanthappy abiding
I also teach the Dhamma for the abandoning of the mindmade acquisition of a self for the abandoning of the formless acquisition of a self such that when you practice it defiling mental qualities will be abandoned bright mental qualities will grow and you will enter  remain in the culmination  abundance of discernment having known  realized it for yourself in the here  now When defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown and one enters  remains in the culmination  abundance of discernment having known  realized it for oneself in the here  now there is joy rapture serenity mindfulness alertness and a pleasanthappy abiding
In the past I have been asked 'What friend is the gross acquisition of a self for whose abandoning you teach the Dhamma such that when you practice it defiling mental qualities will be abandoned bright mental qualities will grow and you will enter  remain in the culmination  abundance of discernment having known  realized it for yourself in the here  now' When asked this I would answer 'This friend is that gross acquisition of a self for whose abandoning I teach the Dhamma'
In the past I have been asked 'What friend is the mindmade acquisition of a self the formless acquisition of a self for whose abandoning you teach the Dhamma' When asked this I would answer 'This friend is that gross acquisition of a self for whose abandoning I teach the Dhamma'
What do you think Potthapada
When this is the case don't those words turn out to be convincing
Yes lord
When this is the case those words turn out to be convincing
Potthapada it's as if a man at a crossroads were to build a staircase for ascending to a palace and other people were to say to him 'Well my good man this palace for which you are building a staircase do you know whether it's east west north or south of here
Whether it's high low or in between' He would say 'This friends is the palace to which I am building a staircase
The staircase is right under the palace'
So what do you think Potthapada  when this is the case don't the words of that man turn out to be convincing
Yes lord In the same way in the past I have been asked 'What friend is the gross acquisition of a self the mindmade acquisition of a self the formless acquisition of a self for whose abandoning you teach the Dhamma' When asked this I would answer 'This friend is that gross acquisition of a self for whose abandoning I teach the Dhamma'
What do you think Potthapada
When this is the case don't those words turn out to be convincing
Yes lord
When this is the case those words turn out to be convincing
When this was said Citta the elephant trainer's son said to the Blessed One When there is a gross acquisition of a self is it the case then that one's mindmade acquisition of a self and formless acquisition of a self are null  void and only one's gross acquisition of a self is true
And when there is a mindmade acquisition of a self is it the case then that one's gross acquisition of a self and formless acquisition of a self are null  void and only one's mindmade acquisition of a self is true
And when there is a formless acquisition of a self is it the case then that one's gross acquisition of a self and mindmade acquisition of a self are null  void and only one's formless acquisition of a self is true
Citta when there is a gross acquisition of a self it's not classified either as a mindmade acquisition of a self or as a formless acquisition of a self
It's classified just as a gross acquisition of a self
When there is a mindmade acquisition of a self it's not classified either as a gross acquisition of a self or as a formless acquisition of a self
It's classified just as a mindmade acquisition of a self
When there is a formless acquisition of a self it's not classified either as a gross acquisition of a self or as a mindmade acquisition of a self
It is classified just as a formless acquisition of a self
Suppose they were to ask you 'Did you exist in the past
Did you not not exist
Will you exist in the future
Will you not not exist
Do you exist now
Do you not not exist' Thus asked how would you answer
 Thus asked lord I would answer 'I existed in the past
I did not not exist
I will exist in the future
I will not not exist
I exist now
I do not not exist' That's how I would answer
Suppose Citta they were to ask you 'Whatever your past acquisition of a self Is that alone your true acquisition of self while the future  present ones are null  void
Whatever your future acquisition of a self Is that alone your true acquisition of a self while the past  present ones are null  void
Whatever your present acquisition of a self Is that alone your true acquisition of a self while the past  future ones are null  void' Thus asked how would you answer
Thus asked lord I would answer 'Whatever my past acquisition of a self on that occasion that alone was my true acquisition of a self while future  present ones were null  void
Whatever my future acquisition of a self on that occasion that alone will be my true acquisition of a self while the past  present ones will be null  void
Whatever my present acquisition of a self on that occasion that alone is my true acquisition of a self while the past  future ones are null  void
In the same way Citta when there is a gross acquisition of a self it's classified just as a gross acquisition of a self
When there is a mindmade acquisition of a self When there is a formless acquisition of a self it's not classified either as a gross acquisition of a self or as a mindmade acquisition of a self
It's classified just as a formless acquisition of a self
Just as when milk comes from a cow curds from milk butter from curds ghee from butter and the skimmings of ghee from ghee
When there is milk it's not classified as curds butter ghee or skimmings of ghee
It's classified just as milk
When there are curds When there is butter When there is ghee When there are the skimmings of ghee they're not classified as milk curds butter or ghee
They're classified just as the skimmings of ghee
In the same way when there is a gross acquisition of a self it's classified just as a gross acquisition of a self
When there is a mindmade acquisition of a self When there is a formless acquisition of a self it's not classified either as a gross acquisition of a self or as a mindmade acquisition of a self
It's classified just as a formless acquisition of a self
Citta these are the world's designations the world's expressions the world's ways of speaking the world's descriptions with which the Tathagata expresses himself but without grasping to them 
When this was said Potthapada the wanderer said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monks
May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life
But Citta the elephant trainer's son said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monks
Let me obtain the Going Forth in the Blessed One's presence
Let me obtain Acceptance
So Citta the elephant trainer's son obtained the Going Forth in the Blessed One's presence he obtained Acceptance
And not long after his Acceptance  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute  he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now
He knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus Ven
Elephanttrainer's Son became another one of the arahants
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large community of monks  approximately monks in all  and arrived at Salavatika
Now at that time the brahman Lohicca was reigning with feudatory rights over Salavatika  together with its wealth grass timber  grain  through a royal grant bestowed by King Pasenadi Kosala
And at that time an evil viewpoint to this effect had arisen to him Suppose that a brahman or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrine
Having arrived at a skillful doctrine he should not declare it to anyone else for what can one person do for another
It would be just the same as if having cut through an old bond one were to make another new bond
I say that such a thing is an evil greedy deed for what can one person do for another
Then Lohicca heard it said Gotama the contemplative  the son of the Sakyans having gone forth from the Sakyan clan  on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large community of monks  approximately monks in all  has arrived at Salavatika
And of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread 'He is indeed a Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone a knower of the cosmos an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed teacher of human  divine beings awakened blessed
He has made known  having realized it through direct knowledge  this world with its devas maras  brahmas its generations with their contemplatives  brahmans their rulers  common people has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end has expounded the holy life both in its particulars  in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pure
It is good to see such a worthy one' So Lohicca said to Rosika the barber Come dear Rosika
Go to Gotama the contemplative and on arrival ask whether he is free from illness  affliction is carefree strong  living in comfort saying 'The brahman Lohicca Master Gotama asks whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfort' And then say 'May Master Gotama together with the community of monks consent to tomorrow's meal with the brahman Lohicca' Responding As you say sir to the brahman Lohicca Rosika the barber went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowing down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One The brahman Lohicca lord asks whether the Blessed One is free from illness  affliction is carefree strong  living in comfort
And he says 'May the Blessed One together with the community of monks consent to tomorrow's meal with the brahman Lohicca' The Blessed One consented through silence
Then Rosika the barber understanding the Blessed One's consent rose from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One circumambulated him  keeping him to his right  and returned to the brahman Lohicca
On arrival he said to him I have informed the Blessed One of your words 'The brahman Lohicca lord asks whether the Blessed One is free from illness  affliction is carefree strong  living in comfort
And he says May the Blessed One together with the community of monks consent to tomorrow's meal with the brahman Lohicca' And the Blessed One has consented
Then as the night was ending the brahman Lohicca had choice staple  nonstaple foods prepared in his own home and then said to Rosika the barber Come dear Rosika
Go to Gotama the contemplative and on arrival announce the time 'It is time Master Gotama
The meal is ready' Responding As you say sir to the brahman Lohicca Rosika the barber went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowing down to him stood to one side
As he was standing there he announced the time It is time lord
The meal is ready
Then the Blessed One having put on his robes early in the morning carrying his bowl  outer robe went together with a community of monks to Salavatika
Meanwhile Rosika the barber was following right behind the Blessed One and said to him Lord an evil viewpoint to this effect has arisen to the brahman Lohicca 'Suppose that a brahman or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrine
Having arrived at a skillful doctrine he should not declare it to anyone else for what can one person do for another
It would be just the same as if having cut through an old bond one were to make another new bond
I say that such a thing is an evil greedy deed for what can one person do for another' It would be good if the Blessed One would extract the brahman Lohicca from this evil viewpoint
Perhaps that will be Rosika
Perhaps that will be
Then the Blessed One went to the brahman Lohicca's home
On arrival he sat down on a seat made ready
The brahman Lohicca with his own hand served  satisfied the Blessed One  the community of monks with choice staple  nonstaple foods
Then when the Blessed One had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl the brahman Lohicca took a lower seat and sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Lohicca that an evil viewpoint to this effect has arisen to you 'Suppose that a brahman or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrine
Having arrived at a skillful doctrine he should not declare it to anyone else for what can one person do for another
It would be just the same as if having cut through an old bond one were to make another new bond
I say that such a thing is an evil greedy deed for what can one person do for another'
Yes Master Gotama
What do you think Lohicca
Don't you reign over Salavatika
Yes Master Gotama
Now suppose someone were to say 'The brahman Lohicca reigns over Salavatika
He alone should consume the fruits  revenues of Salavatika and not share them with others' Would someone speaking in this way be a creator of obstacles for your subjects or would he not
He would be a creator of obstacles Master Gotama
And being a creator of obstacles would he be sympathetic for their welfare or not
He would not be sympathetic for their welfare Master Gotama
And in one not sympathetic for their welfare would his mind be established in good will for them or in animosity
In animosity Master Gotama
When the mind is established in animosity is there wrong view or right view
Wrong view Master Gotama
Now for one of wrong view Lohicca I tell you there is one of two destinations either hell or the animal womb
What do you think Lohicca
Doesn't King Pasenadi Kosala reign over Kasi  Kosala
Yes Master Gotama
Now suppose someone were to say 'King Pasenadi Kosala reigns over Kasi  Kosala
He alone should consume the fruits  revenues of Kasi  Kosala and not share them with others' Would someone speaking in this way be a creator of obstacles for King Pasenadi's subjects  you  others  or would he not
He would be a creator of obstacles Master Gotama
And being a creator of obstacles would he be sympathetic for their welfare or not
He would not be sympathetic for their welfare Master Gotama
And in one not sympathetic for their welfare would his mind be established in good will for them or in animosity
In animosity Master Gotama
When the mind is established in animosity is there wrong view or right view
Wrong view Master Gotama
Now for one of wrong view Lohicca I tell you there is one of two destinations either hell or the animal womb
So then Lohicca if anyone were to say 'The brahman Lohicca reigns over Salavatika
He alone should consume the fruits  revenues of Salavatika and not share them with others' he speaking in this way would be a creator of obstacles for your subjects
Being a creator of obstacles he would not be sympathetic for their welfare
In one not sympathetic for their welfare the mind would be established in animosity for them
When the mind is established in animosity there is wrong view
For one of wrong view I tell you there is one of two destinations either hell or the animal womb
In the same way if anyone were to say 'Suppose that a brahman or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrine
Having arrived at a skillful doctrine he should not declare it to anyone else for what can one person do for another
It would be just the same as if having cut through an old bond one were to make another new bond
I say that such a thing is an evil greedy deed for what can one person do for another'  he speaking in this way would be a creator of obstacles for those children of good family who coming to the doctrine  discipline revealed by the Tathagata attain the sort of grand distinction where they attain the fruit of streamentry the fruit of oncereturning the fruit of nonreturning the fruit of arahantship and for those who ripen deva wombs for the sake of bringing about the deva state
Being a creator of obstacles he would not be sympathetic for their welfare
In one not sympathetic for their welfare the mind would be established in animosity for them
When the mind is established in animosity there is wrong view
For one of wrong view I tell you there is one of two destinations either hell or the animal womb
And if anyone were to say 'King Pasenadi Kosala reigns over Kasi  Kosala
He alone should consume the fruits  revenues of Kasi  Kosala and not share them with others' he speaking in this way would be a creator of obstacles for King Pasenadi's subjects  you  others
Being a creator of obstacles he would not be sympathetic for their welfare
In one not sympathetic for their welfare the mind would be established in animosity for them
When the mind is established in animosity there is wrong view
For one of wrong view I tell you there is one of two destinations either hell or the animal womb
In the same way if anyone were to say 'Suppose that a brahman or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrine
Having arrived at a skillful doctrine he should not declare it to anyone else for what can one person do for another
It would be just the same as if having cut through an old bond one were to make another new bond
I say that such a thing is an evil greedy deed for what can one person do for another'  he speaking in this way would be a creator of obstacles for those children of good family who coming to the doctrine  discipline revealed by the Tathagata attain the sort of grand distinction where they attain the fruit of streamentry the fruit of oncereturning the fruit of nonreturning the fruit of arahantship and also for those who ripen deva wombs for the sake of bringing about the deva state
Being a creator of obstacles he would not be sympathetic for their welfare
In one not sympathetic for their welfare the mind would be established in animosity for them
When the mind is established in animosity there is wrong view
For one of wrong view I tell you there is one of two destinations either hell or the animal womb
Lohicca there are these three sorts of teacher who are worthy of criticism in the world and when anyone criticizes these sorts of teachers the criticism is true factual righteous  unblameworthy
Which three
There is the case where a certain teacher has not attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth from the home life into homelessness
He not having attained that goal of the contemplative life teaches his disciples 'This is for your welfare
This is for your happiness' His disciples don't listen don't lend ear don't put forth an intent for gnosis
They practice in a way deviating from the teacher's instructions
He should be criticized saying 'You venerable sir have not attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth from the home life into homelessness
Not having attained that goal of the contemplative life you teach your disciples This is for your welfare
This is for your happiness Your disciples don't listen don't lend ear don't put forth an intent for gnosis and practice in a way deviating from the teacher's instructions
It's just as if a man were to pursue who pulls away or to embrace one who turns her back
I say that such a thing is an evil greedy deed for what can one person do for another' This is the first teacher who is worthy of criticism in the world and when anyone criticizes this sort of teacher the criticism is true factual righteous  unblameworthy
Then there is the case where a certain teacher has not attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth from the home life into homelessness
He not having attained that goal of the contemplative life teaches his disciples 'This is for your welfare
This is for your happiness' His disciples listen lend ear put forth an intent for gnosis and practice in a way not deviating from the teacher's instructions
He should be criticized saying 'You venerable sir have not attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth from the home life into homelessness
Not having attained that goal of the contemplative life you teach your disciples This is for your welfare
This is for your happiness Your disciples listen lend ear put forth an intent for gnosis and practice in a way not deviating from the teacher's instructions
It's just as if a man neglecting his own field were to imagine that another's field should be weeded
I say that such a thing is an evil greedy deed for what can one person do for another' This is the second teacher who is worthy of criticism in the world and when anyone criticizes this sort of teacher the criticism is true factual righteous  unblameworthy
Then there is the case where a certain teacher has attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth from the home life into homelessness
He having attained that goal of the contemplative life teaches his disciples 'This is for your welfare
This is for your happiness' His disciples don't listen don't lend ear don't put forth an intent for gnosis
They practice in a way deviating from the teacher's instructions
He should be criticized saying 'You venerable sir have attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth from the home life into homelessness
Having attained that goal of the contemplative life you teach your disciples This is for your welfare
This is for your happiness Your disciples don't listen don't lend ear don't put forth an intent for gnosis and practice in a way deviating from the teacher's instructions
It's just as if having cut through an old bond one were to make another new bond
I say that such a thing is an evil greedy deed for what can one person do for another' This is the third teacher who is worthy of criticism in the world and when anyone criticizes this sort of teacher the criticism is true factual righteous  unblameworthy
When this was said the brahman Lohicca said to the Blessed One But is there Master Gotama any teacher who is not worthy of criticism in the world
There is Lohicca a teacher who is not worthy of criticism in the world
But which teacher Master Gotama is not worthy of criticism in the world
There is the case Lohicca where a Tathagata appears in the world worthy  rightly selfawakened
He teaches the Dhamma admirable in its beginning admirable in its middle admirable in its end
He proclaims the holy life both in its particulars  in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pure
A householder or householder's son hearing the Dhamma gains conviction in the Tathagata and reflects 'Household life is confining a dusty path
The life gone forth is like the open air
It is not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shell
What if I were to shave off my hair  beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness'
So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth large or small leaves his circle of relatives large or small shaves off his hair  beard puts on the ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessness
When he has thus gone forth he lives restrained by the rules of the monastic code seeing danger in the slightest faults
Consummate in his virtue he guards the doors of his senses is possessed of mindfulness  alertness and is content
Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue this noble restraint over the sense faculties this noble mindfulness  alertness and this noble contentment he seeks out a secluded dwelling a wilderness the shade of a tree a mountain a glen a hillside cave a charnel ground a forest grove the open air a heap of straw
After his meal returning from his alms round he sits down crosses his legs holds his body erect and brings mindfulness to the fore
Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness
He cleanses his mind of covetousness
Abandoning ill will  anger he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will sympathetic with the welfare of all living beings
He cleanses his mind of ill will  anger
Abandoning sloth  drowsiness he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth  drowsiness mindful alert percipient of light
He cleanses his mind of sloth  drowsiness
Abandoning restlessness  anxiety he dwells undisturbed his mind inwardly stilled
He cleanses his mind of restlessness  anxiety
Abandoning uncertainty he dwells having crossed over uncertainty with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualities
He cleanses his mind of uncertainty
Suppose that a man taking a loan invests it in his business affairs
His business affairs succeed
He repays his old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining his wife
The thought would occur to him 'Before taking a loan I invested it in my business affairs
Now my business affairs have succeeded
I have repaid my old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining my wife' Because of that he would experience joy  happiness
Now suppose that a man falls sick  in pain  seriously ill
He does not enjoy his meals and there is no strength in his body
As time passes he eventually recovers from that sickness
He enjoys his meals and there is strength in his body
The thought would occur to him 'Before I was sick Now I am recovered from that sickness
I enjoy my meals and there is strength in my body' Because of that he would experience joy  happiness
Now suppose that a man is bound in prison
As time passes he eventually is released from that bondage safe  sound with no loss of property
The thought would occur to him 'Before I was bound in prison
Now I am released from that bondage safe  sound with no loss of my property' Because of that he would experience joy  happiness
Now suppose that a man is a slave subject to others not subject to himself unable to go where he likes
As time passes he eventually is released from that slavery subject to himself not subject to others freed able to go where he likes
The thought would occur to him 'Before I was a slave Now I am released from that slavery subject to myself not subject to others freed able to go where I like' Because of that he would experience joy  happiness
Now suppose that a man carrying money  goods is traveling by a road through desolate country
As time passes he eventually emerges from that desolate country safe  sound with no loss of property
The thought would occur to him 'Before carrying money  goods I was traveling by a road through desolate country
Now I have emerged from that desolate country safe  sound with no loss of my property' Because of that he would experience joy  happiness
In the same way when these five hindrances are not abandoned in himself the monk regards it as a debt a sickness a prison slavery a road through desolate country
But when these five hindrances are abandoned in himself he regards it as unindebtedness good health release from prison freedom a place of security
Seeing that they have been abandoned within him he becomes glad
Glad he becomes enraptured
Enraptured his body grows tranquil
His body tranquil he is sensitive to pleasure
Feeling pleasure his mind becomes concentrated
Quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters and remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal
Just as if a skilled bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together sprinkling it again  again with water so that his ball of bath powder  saturated moistureladen permeated within  without  would nevertheless not drip even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of withdrawal
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal
When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction Lohicca that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher the criticism would be false unfactual unrighteous  blameworthy
Furthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of composure
Just like a lake with springwater welling up from within having no inflow from the east west north or south and with the skies supplying abundant showers time  again so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate  pervade suffuse  fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of composure
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born of composure
When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction Lohicca that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher the criticism would be false unfactual unrighteous  blameworthy
And furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture
Just as in a lotus pond some of the lotuses born  growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated  pervaded suffused  filled with cool water from their roots to their tips and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water even so the monk permeates this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture
When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction Lohicca that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher the criticism would be false unfactual unrighteous  blameworthy
And furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain
He sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness
Just as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awareness
When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction Lohicca that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher the criticism would be false unfactual unrighteous  blameworthy
With his mind thus concentrated purified  bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge  vision
He discerns 'This body of mine is endowed with form composed of the four primary elements born from mother  father nourished with rice  porridge subject to inconstancy rubbing pressing dissolution  dispersion
And this consciousness of mine is supported here and bound up here' Just as if there were a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water  eight faceted well polished clear limpid consummate in all its aspects and going through the middle of it was a blue yellow red white or brown thread  and a man with good eyesight taking it in his hand were to reflect on it thus 'This is a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water eight faceted well polished clear limpid consummate in all its aspects

From this body he creates another body endowed with form made of the mind complete in all its parts not inferior in its faculties
Just as if a man were to draw a reed from its sheath
The thought would occur to him 'This is the sheath this is the reed
The sheath is one thing the reed another but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath' Or as if a man were to draw a sword from its scabbard
The thought would occur to him 'This is the sword this is the scabbard
The sword is one thing the scabbard another but the sword has been drawn out from the scabbard' Or as if a man were to pull a snake out from its slough
The thought would occur to him 'This is the snake this is the slough
The snake is one thing the slough another but the snake has been pulled out from the slough' In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified  bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability the monk directs  inclines it to creating a mindmade body

He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land
Sitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged bird
With his hand he touches  strokes even the sun  moon so mighty  powerful
He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds
Just as a skilled potter or his assistant could craft from wellprepared clay whatever kind of pottery vessel he likes or as a skilled ivorycarver or his assistant could craft from wellprepared ivory any kind of ivorywork he likes or as a skilled goldsmith or his assistant could craft from wellprepared gold any kind of gold article he likes in the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified  bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability  the monk directs  inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds

There is nothing further for this world' When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction Lohicca that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher the criticism would be false unfactual unrighteous  blameworthy
When this was said the brahman Lohicca said to the Blessed One Master Gotama it's as if a man having seized by the hair another man who was falling into the pit of hell were to pull him up  set him on firm ground
In the same way Master Gotama has pulled me up as I was falling into the pit of hell and has set me on firm ground
Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monks
May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life
Samsara literally means wanderingon Many people think of it as the Buddhist name for the place where we currently live  the place we leave when we go to nibbana
But in the early Buddhist texts it's the answer not to the question Where are we but to the question What are we doing Instead of a place it's a process the tendency to keep creating worlds and then moving into them
As one world falls apart you create another one and go there
At the same time you bump into other people who are creating their own worlds too
The play and creativity in the process can sometimes be enjoyable
In fact it would be perfectly innocuous if it didn't entail so much suffering
The worlds we create keep caving in and killing us
Moving into a new world requires effort not only the pains and risks of taking birth but also the hard knocks  mental and physical  that come from going through childhood into adulthood over and over again
The Buddha once asked his monks Which do you think is greater the water in the oceans or the tears you've shed while wandering on His answer the tears
Think of that the next time you gaze at the ocean or play in its waves
In addition to creating suffering for ourselves the worlds we create feed off the worlds of others just as theirs feed off ours
In some cases the feeding may be mutually enjoyable and beneficial but even then the arrangement has to come to an end
More typically it causes harm to at least one side of the relationship often to both
When you think of all the suffering that goes into keeping just one person clothed fed sheltered and healthy  the suffering both for those who have to pay for these requisites as well as those who have to labor or die in their production  you see how exploitative even the most rudimentary process of worldbuilding can be
This is why the Buddha tried to find the way to stop samsaraing
Once he had found it he encouraged others to follow it too
Because samsaraing is something that each of us does each of us has to stop it him or her self alone
If samsara were a place it might seem selfish for one person to look for an escape leaving others behind
But when you realize that it's a process there's nothing selfish about stopping it at all
It's like giving up an addiction or an abusive habit
When you learn the skills needed to stop creating your own worlds of suffering you can share those skills with others so that they can stop creating theirs
At the same time you'll never have to feed off the worlds of others so to that extent you're lightening their load as well
It's true that the Buddha likened the practice for stopping samsara to the act of going from one place to another from this side of a river to the further shore
But the passages where he makes this comparison often end with a paradox the further shore has no here no there no in between From that perspective it's obvious that samsara's parameters of space and time were not the preexisting context in which we wandered
They were the result of our wandering
For someone addicted to worldbuilding the lack of familiar parameters sounds unsettling
But if you're tired of creating incessant unnecessary suffering you might want to give it a try
After all you could always resume building if the lack of here or there turned out to be dull
But of those who have learned how to break the habit no one has ever felt tempted to samsara again
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Nalanda in Pavarika's mango grove
Then Kevatta the householder approached the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord this Nalanda is powerful both prosperous and populous filled with people who have faith in the Blessed One
It would be good if the Blessed One were to direct a monk to display a miracle of psychic power from his superior human state so that Nalanda would to an even greater extent have faith in the Blessed One
When this was said the Blessed One said to Kevatta the householder Kevatta I don't teach the monks in this way 'Come monks display a miracle of psychic power to the lay people clad in white' A second time A third time Kevatta the householder said to the Blessed One I won't argue with the Blessed One but I tell you Lord this Nalanda is powerful both prosperous and populous filled with people who have faith in the Blessed One
It would be good if the Blessed One were to direct a monk to display a miracle of psychic power from his superior human state so that Nalanda would to an even greater extent have faith in the Blessed One
A third time the Blessed One said to Kevatta the householder Kevatta I don't teach the monks in this way 'Come monks display a miracle of psychic power to the lay people clad in white'
Kevatta there are these three miracles that I have declared having directly known and realized them for myself
Which three
The miracle of psychic power the miracle of telepathy and the miracle of instruction
And what is the miracle of psychic power
There is the case where a monk wields manifold psychic powers
Having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one
He appears
He vanishes
He goes unimpeded through walls ramparts and mountains as if through space
He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water
He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land
Sitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged bird
With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon so mighty and powerful
He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds
Then someone who has faith and conviction in him sees him wielding manifold psychic powers exercising influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds
He reports this to someone who has no faith and no conviction telling him 'Isn't it awesome
Isn't it astounding how great the power how great the prowess of this contemplative
Just now I saw him wielding manifold psychic powers exercising influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds'
Then the person without faith without conviction would say to the person with faith and with conviction 'Sir there is a charm called the Gandhari charm by which the monk wielded manifold psychic powers exercising influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds' What do you think Kevatta  isn't that what the man without faith without conviction would say to the man with faith and with conviction
Yes lord that's just what he would say
Seeing this drawback to the miracle of psychic power Kevatta I feel horrified humiliated and disgusted with the miracle of psychic power
And what is the miracle of telepathy
There is the case where a monk reads the minds the mental events the thoughts the ponderings of other beings other individuals 'Such is your thinking here is where your thinking is thus is your mind'
Then someone who has faith and conviction in him sees him reading the minds of other beings He reports this to someone who has no faith and no conviction telling him 'Isn't it awesome
Isn't it astounding how great the power how great the prowess of this contemplative
Just now I saw him reading the minds of other beings'
Then the person without faith without conviction would say to the person with faith and with conviction 'Sir there is a charm called the Manika charm by which the monk read the minds of other beings' What do you think Kevatta  isn't that what the man without faith without conviction would say to the man with faith and with conviction
Yes lord that's just what he would say
Seeing this drawback to the miracle of telepathy Kevatta I feel horrified humiliated and disgusted with the miracle of telepathy
And what is the miracle of instruction
There is the case where a monk gives instruction in this way 'Direct your thought in this way don't direct it in that
Attend to things in this way don't attend to them in that
Let go of this enter and remain in that' This Kevatta is called the miracle of instruction
Furthermore there is the case where a Tathagata appears in the world worthy and rightly selfawakened
He teaches the Dhamma admirable in its beginning admirable in its middle admirable in its end
He proclaims the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pure
A householder or householder's son hearing the Dhamma gains conviction in the Tathagata and reflects 'Household life is confining a dusty path
The life gone forth is like the open air
It is not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shell
What if I were to shave off my hair and beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness'
So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth large or small leaves his circle of relatives large or small shaves off his hair and beard puts on the ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessness
When he has thus gone forth he lives restrained by the rules of the monastic code seeing danger in the slightest faults
Consummate in his virtue he guards the doors of his senses is possessed of mindfulness and alertness and is content
And how is a monk consummate in virtue

A monk thus consummate in virtue sees no danger anywhere from his restraint through virtue
Just as a headanointed noble warrior king who has defeated his enemies sees no danger anywhere from his enemies in the same way the monk thus consummate in virtue sees no danger anywhere from his restraint through virtue
Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless
This is how a monk is consummate in virtue
And how does a monk guard the doors of his senses
On seeing a form with the eye he does not grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him
On hearing a sound with the ear On smelling an odor with the nose On tasting a flavor with the tongue On touching a tactile sensation with the body On cognizing an idea with the intellect he does not grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him
Endowed with this noble restraint over the sense faculties he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless
This is how a monk guards the doors of his senses
And how is a monk possessed of mindfulness and alertness
When going forward and returning he acts with alertness
When looking toward and looking away when bending and extending his limbs when carrying his outer cloak his upper robe and his bowl when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking and remaining silent he acts with alertness
This is how a monk is possessed of mindfulness and alertness
And how is a monk content
Just as a bird wherever it goes flies with its wings as its only burden so too is he content with a set of robes to provide for his body and almsfood to provide for his hunger
Wherever he goes he takes only his barest necessities along
This is how a monk is content
Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue this noble restraint over the sense faculties this noble mindfulness and alertness and this noble contentment he seeks out a secluded dwelling a forest the shade of a tree a mountain a glen a hillside cave a charnel ground a jungle grove the open air a heap of straw
After his meal returning from his alms round he sits down crosses his legs holds his body erect and brings mindfulness to the fore
Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness
He cleanses his mind of covetousness

He cleanses his mind of uncertainty
Suppose that a man taking a loan invests it in his business affairs
His business affairs succeed
He repays his old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining his wife
The thought would occur to him 'Before taking a loan I invested it in my business affairs
Now my business affairs have succeeded
I have repaid my old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining my wife' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness
Now suppose that a man falls sick  in pain and seriously ill
He does not enjoy his meals and there is no strength in his body
As time passes he eventually recovers from that sickness
He enjoys his meals and there is strength in his body
The thought would occur to him 'Before I was sick Now I am recovered from that sickness
I enjoy my meals and there is strength in my body' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness
Now suppose that a man is bound in prison
As time passes he eventually is released from that bondage safe and sound with no loss of property
The thought would occur to him 'Before I was bound in prison
Now I am released from that bondage safe and sound with no loss of my property' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness
Now suppose that a man is a slave subject to others not subject to himself unable to go where he likes
As time passes he eventually is released from that slavery subject to himself not subject to others freed able to go where he likes
The thought would occur to him 'Before I was a slave Now I am released from that slavery subject to myself not subject to others freed able to go where I like' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness
Now suppose that a man carrying money and goods is traveling by a road through desolate country
As time passes he eventually emerges from that desolate country safe and sound with no loss of property
The thought would occur to him 'Before carrying money and goods I was traveling by a road through desolate country
Now I have emerged from that desolate country safe and sound with no loss of my property' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness
In the same way when these five hindrances are not abandoned in himself the monk regards it as a debt a sickness a prison slavery a road through desolate country
But when these five hindrances are abandoned in himself he regards it as unindebtedness good health release from prison freedom a place of security
Seeing that they have been abandoned within him he becomes glad
Glad he becomes enraptured
Enraptured his body grows tranquil
His body tranquil he is sensitive to pleasure
Feeling pleasure his mind becomes concentrated
Quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters and remains in the first jhana rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought and evaluation
He permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal
Just as if a skilled bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together sprinkling it again and again with water so that his ball of bath powder  saturated moistureladen permeated within and without  would nevertheless not drip even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of withdrawal
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal
This too is called the miracle of instruction
Furthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters and remains in the second jhana rapture and pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation  internal assurance
He permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composure
Just like a lake with springwater welling up from within having no inflow from the east west north or south and with the skies supplying abundant showers time and again so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate and pervade suffuse and fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composure
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born of composure
This too is called the miracle of instruction
And furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' He permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture
Just as in a lotus pond some of the lotuses born and growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated and pervaded suffused and filled with cool water from their roots to their tips and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water even so the monk permeates this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture
This too is called the miracle of instruction
And furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure and stress  as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress  he enters and remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neitherpleasure nor stress
He sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness
Just as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awareness
This too is called the miracle of instruction
With his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision
He discerns 'This body of mine is endowed with form composed of the four primary elements born from mother and father nourished with rice and porridge subject to inconstancy rubbing pressing dissolution and dispersion
And this consciousness of mine is supported here and bound up here' Just as if there were a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water  eight faceted well polished clear limpid consummate in all its aspects and going through the middle of it was a blue yellow red white or brown thread  and a man with good eyesight taking it in his hand were to reflect on it thus 'This is a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water eight faceted well polished clear limpid consummate in all its aspects
And this going through the middle of it is a blue yellow red white or brown thread' In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability  the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision
He discerns 'This body of mine is endowed with form composed of the four primary elements born from mother and father nourished with rice and porridge subject to inconstancy rubbing pressing dissolution and dispersion
And this consciousness of mine is supported here and bound up here'
This too is called the miracle of instruction
With his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to creating a mindmade body
From this body he creates another body endowed with form made of the mind complete in all its parts not inferior in its faculties
Just as if a man were to draw a reed from its sheath
The thought would occur to him 'This is the sheath this is the reed
The sheath is one thing the reed another but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath' Or as if a man were to draw a sword from its scabbard
The thought would occur to him 'This is the sword this is the scabbard
The sword is one thing the scabbard another but the sword has been drawn out from the scabbard' Or as if a man were to pull a snake out from its slough
The thought would occur to him 'This is the snake this is the slough
The snake is one thing the slough another but the snake has been pulled out from the slough' In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability the monk directs and inclines it to creating a mindmade body
From this body he creates another body endowed with form made of the mind complete in all its parts not inferior in its faculties
This too is called the miracle of instruction

He wields manifold supranormal powers
Having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one
He appears
He vanishes
He goes unimpeded through walls ramparts and mountains as if through space
He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water
He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land
Sitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged bird
With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon so mighty and powerful
He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds
Just as a skilled potter or his assistant could craft from wellprepared clay whatever kind of pottery vessel he likes or as a skilled ivorycarver or his assistant could craft from wellprepared ivory any kind of ivorywork he likes or as a skilled goldsmith or his assistant could craft from wellprepared gold any kind of gold article he likes in the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability  the monk directs and inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds
This too is called the miracle of instruction
With his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to the divine earelement
He hears  by means of the divine earelement purified and surpassing the human  both kinds of sounds divine and human whether near or far
Just as if a man traveling along a highway were to hear the sounds of kettledrums small drums conchs cymbals and tomtoms
He would know 'That is the sound of kettledrums that is the sound of small drums that is the sound of conchs that is the sound of cymbals and that is the sound of tomtoms' In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability  the monk directs and inclines it to the divine earelement
He hears  by means of the divine earelement purified and surpassing the human  both kinds of sounds divine and human whether near or far
This too is called the miracle of instruction

He discerns a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind
He discerns a released mind as a released mind and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind
Just as if a young woman  or man  fond of ornaments examining the reflection of her own face in a bright mirror or a bowl of clear water would know 'blemished' if it were blemished or 'unblemished' if it were not
In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability  the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge of the awareness of other beings
He knows the awareness of other beings other individuals having encompassed it with his own awareness
He discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion and a mind without passion as a mind without passion a released mind as a released mind and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind

He recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion 'There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose there
There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose here' Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and details
Just as if a man were to go from his home village to another village and then from that village to yet another village and then from that village back to his home village
The thought would occur to him 'I went from my home village to that village over there
There I stood in such a way sat in such a way talked in such a way and remained silent in such a way
From that village I went to that village over there and there I stood in such a way sat in such a way talked in such a way and remained silent in such a way
From that village I came back home' In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability  the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives
He recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and details
This too is called the miracle of instruction
With his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings
He sees  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma 'These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
But these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world' Thus  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma
Just as if there were a tall building in the central square and a man with good eyesight standing on top of it were to see people entering a house leaving it walking along the street and sitting in the central square
The thought would occur to him 'These people are entering a house leaving it walking along the streets and sitting in the central square' In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability  the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings
He sees  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma
This too is called the miracle of instruction
With his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations
He discerns as it has come to be that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are mental fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations' His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentation of sensuality the fermentation of becoming the fermentation of ignorance
With release there is the knowledge 'Released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world' Just as if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen  clear limpid and unsullied  where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells gravel and pebbles and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting and it would occur to him 'This pool of water is clear limpid and unsullied
Here are these shells gravel and pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting' In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability  the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations
He discerns as it has come to be that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are mental fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations' His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentation of sensuality the fermentation of becoming the fermentation of ignorance
With release there is the knowledge 'Released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
This too is called the miracle of instruction
These are the three miracles that I declare Kevatta having directly known and realized them for myself
Once Kevatta this train of thought arose in the awareness of a certain monk in this very community of monks 'Where do these four great elements  the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property  cease without remainder' Then he attained to such a state of concentration that the way leading to the gods appeared in his centered mind
So he approached the gods of the retinue of the Four Great Kings and on arrival asked them 'Friends where do these four great elements  the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property  cease without remainder'
When this was said the gods of the retinue of the Four Great Kings said to the monk 'We also don't know where the four great elements cease without remainder
But there are the Four Great Kings who are higher and more sublime than we
They should know where the four great elements cease without remainder'
So the monk approached the Four Great Kings and on arrival asked them 'Friends where do these four great elements cease without remainder'
When this was said the Four Great Kings said to the monk 'We also don't know where the four great elements cease without remainder
But there are the gods of the Thirtythree who are higher and more sublime than we
They should know'
So the monk approached the gods of the Thirtythree and on arrival asked them 'Friends where do these four great elements cease without remainder'
When this was said the gods of the Thirtythree said to the monk 'We also don't know where the four great elements cease without remainder
But there is Sakka the ruler of the gods who is higher and more sublime than we
He should know '
So the monk approached Sakka the ruler of the gods and on arrival asked him 'Friend where do these four great elements cease without remainder'
When this was said Sakka the ruler of the gods said to the monk 'I also don't know where the four great elements cease without remainder
But there are the Yama gods who are higher and more sublime than They should know'
The Yama gods said 'We also don't know But there is the god named Suyama He should know'
Suyama said 'I also don't know But there is the god named Santusita He should know'
Santusita said 'I also don't know But there are the Nimmanarati gods They should know'
The Nimmanarati gods said 'We also don't know But there is the god named Sunimmita He should know'
Sunimmita said 'I also don't know But there are the Paranimmitavasavatti gods They should know'
The Paranimmitavasavatti gods said 'We also don't know But there is the god named Paranimmita Vasavatti He should know'
So the monk approached the god Vasavatti and on arrival asked him 'Friend where do these four great elements cease without remainder'
When this was said the god Vasavatti said to the monk 'I also don't know where the four great elements cease without remainder
But there are the gods of the retinue of Brahma who are higher and more sublime than They should know where the four great elements cease without remainder'
Then the monk attained to such a state of concentration that the way leading to the gods of the retinue of Brahma appeared in his centered mind
So he approached the gods of the retinue of Brahma and on arrival asked them 'Friends where do these four great elements  the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property  cease without remainder'
When this was said the gods of the retinue of Brahma said to the monk 'We also don't know where the four great elements cease without remainder
But there is Brahma the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Sovereign Lord the Maker Creator Chief Appointer and Ruler Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be
He is higher and more sublime than we
He should know where the four great elements cease without remainder'
'But where friends is the Great Brahma now'
'Monk we also don't know where Brahma is or in what way Brahma is
But when signs appear light shines forth and a radiance appears Brahma will appear
For these are the portents of Brahma's appearance light shines forth and a radiance appears'
Then it was not long before Brahma appeared
So the monk approached the Great Brahma and on arrival said 'Friend where do these four great elements  the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property  cease without remainder'
When this was said the Great Brahma said to the monk 'I monk am Brahma the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Sovereign Lord the Maker Creator Chief Appointer and Ruler Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be'
A second time the monk said to the Great Brahma 'Friend I didn't ask you if you were Brahma the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Sovereign Lord the Maker Creator Chief Appointer and Ruler Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be
I asked you where these four great elements  the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property  cease without remainder'
A second time the Great Brahma said to the monk 'I monk am Brahma the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Sovereign Lord the Maker Creator Chief Appointer and Ruler Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be'
A third time the monk said to the Great Brahma 'Friend I didn't ask you if you were Brahma the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Sovereign Lord the Maker Creator Chief Appointer and Ruler Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be
I asked you where these four great elements  the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property  cease without remainder'
Then the Great Brahma taking the monk by the arm and leading him off to one side said to him 'These gods of the retinue of Brahma believe There is nothing that the Great Brahma does not know
There is nothing that the Great Brahma does not see
There is nothing of which the Great Brahma is unaware
There is nothing that the Great Brahma has not realized That is why I did not say in their presence that I too don't know where the four great elements cease without remainder
So you have acted wrongly acted incorrectly in bypassing the Blessed One in search of an answer to this question elsewhere
Go right back to the Blessed One and on arrival ask him this question
However he answers it you should take it to heart'
Then  just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm  the monk disappeared from the Brahma world and immediately appeared in front of me
Having bowed down to me he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to me 'Lord where do these four great elements  the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property  cease without remainder'
When this was said I said to him 'Once monk some seafaring merchants took a shoresighting bird and set sail in their ship
When they could not see the shore they released the shoresighting bird
It flew to the east south west north straight up and to all the intermediate points of the compass
If it saw the shore in any direction it flew there
If it did not see the shore in any direction it returned right back to the ship
In the same way monk having gone as far as the Brahma world in search of an answer to your question you have come right back to my presence
'Your question should not be phrased in this way Where do these four great elements  the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property  cease without remainder
Instead it should be phrased like this
'And the answer to that is
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Kevatta the householder delighted in the Blessed One's words
The translation of the Mahaparinibbana Sutta which is offered here is a work of collaboration but is based upon a text prepared by Sister Vajira of Germany to whom credit for the initial work must be given
The final revision of the text was done by Mr Francis Story
The notes and references which it is hoped will help in the understanding of the text have been contributed by the Venerable Nyanaponika Mahathera much of the material for them being taken from the Pali Commentary
Every effort has been made to give a faithful rendering of the original Pali
The greater part of the sutta is straight forward narrative but it also includes references to profound aspects of the Dhamma which have to be understood in their precise meaning if the full import of the Buddha's last exhortations is to be conveyed
In the choice which inevitably arises between terminological exactitude and literary form the translators have endeavored to preserve the former with as little sacrifice as possible of the latter
Those who understand the difficulties of Pali translation will appreciate that this is no easy task and will readily overlook the absence of those literary graces which only a freer rendering would have permitted
As in previous translations some repetitions have been omitted and some repetitive passages condensed
 Buddhist Publication Society
In this revised edition of Last Days of the Buddha a number of stylistic changes have been made aimed at improved readability
The word Bhagava untranslated in the original edition has been replaced by the Blessed One several archaic expressions which gave a slightly Biblical flavor to the diction have been replaced by their modern counterparts awkward sentences have been reformulated and greater consistency was aimed at in the rendering of certain terms and expressions
The notes have also been revised in certain respects
The titles of the chapters and sections have been supplied by the translator and editors though the division of the work into six recitation units dates back to the period when the Canon was transmitted orally from one generation to the next
Of the thirtyfour discourses that make up the Digha Nikaya ours the sixteenth is the longest and so altogether maintains the first place where length is concerned
It preserves the principal feature of the Buddhist sutta insofar as it is like others a rehearsal of events as they have been witnessed
On account of its unique composition however it is more than other suttas capable not only of winning the affection of the pious Buddhist as it naturally does but also of attracting the general reader since it is indeed a fine specimen of sacred universal literature
It gives a good general idea of the Buddha's Teaching too even though it hardly offers anything that is not found  and often more extensively dealt with  in other suttas
At the end of his life after almost half a century's ministry the Master had long since taught all that was necessary for attaining the ideal
During the last period his primary concern therefore was to impress on his followers the necessity of unflinchingly putting into practice those very same teachings an appeal that could of course hardly fail in stirring their hearts more than ever before
The Sangha came indeed to witness the greatest event in its history and was keenly aware of it especially since the Master had announced his Parinibbana three months ahead
The impression on the bhikkhus who flocked to him in large numbers as he was pressing northward was tremendous and could not fail to be reflected vividly in the oral account
Because of its particular import and abundance this material was soon formed into one body and so our sutta came to be
In this connection it is hardly possible not to remember gratefully the Venerable Ananda
His share in the preservation of the Master's word is paramount to any other bhikkhu's and his figure is inseparable from our texts
This was to become manifest for all time in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta which is plainly unimaginable without him
For it is Ananda and again Ananda whom the Master addresses having tested for twentyfive years his sure grasp and brilliant memory and also his indefatigable personal devotion
But Ananda too here more than elsewhere by his constant queries worries and amazements becomes without intending it a central figure beside the Master himself which undoubtedly increases the attractiveness of the text
Thus then Ananda gentle and pleasant as his name and yet almost throughout his career incurring the reproach of the brethren was immortalized along with his beloved Master and  as we may add  along with his strange position between praise and blame assuming mystic character in the third chapter
The third chapter almost exclusively is devoted to depicting the circumstances connected with the Master's relinquishment of life which is the dramatic culmination of events
It overwhelmingly drives home the purely metaphysical significance of the Parinibbana or at least ought to do so
For the Buddha neither succumbed to his fatal illness nor did he give way to the appeal of Mara but sovereignly let go of existence at a timely hour just as fortyfive years earlier on becoming fully enlightened he had duly taken upon himself the wearisome task of teaching men
This fact is most thoughtprovoking and consistently leads to the conclusion that by his Parinibbana indeed the Buddha bore the last and highest possible testimony to his Teaching which permits of no lingering inclination to selfpreservation and continuance but on the contrary reaches the highest exultation ending it all
The Master's Parinibbana is therefore the one sorrowful event in the history of Buddhism that turns out in its true meaning to be really the most blissful
Thus have I heard
Once the Blessed One dwelt at Rajagaha on the hill called Vultures' Peak
At that time the king of Magadha Ajatasattu son of the Videhi queen desired to wage war against the Vajjis
He spoke in this fashion These Vajjis powerful and glorious as they are I shall annihilate them I shall make them perish I shall utterly destroy them
And Ajatasattu the king of Magadha addressed his chief minister the brahman Vassakara saying Come brahman go to the Blessed One pay homage in my name at his feet wish him good health strength ease vigour and comfort and speak thus 'O Lord Ajatasattu the king of Magadha desires to wage war against the Vajjis
He has spoken in this fashion These Vajjis powerful and glorious as they are I shall annihilate them I shall make them perish I shall utterly destroy them' And whatever the Blessed One should answer you keep it well in mind and inform me for Tathagatas do not speak falsely
Very well sire said the brahman Vassakara in assent to Ajatasattu king of Magadha
And he ordered a large number of magnificent carriages to be made ready mounted one himself and accompanied by the rest drove out to Rajagaha towards Vultures' Peak
He went by carriage as far as the carriage could go then dismounting he approached the Blessed One on foot
After exchanging courteous greetings with the Blessed One together with many pleasant words he sat down at one side and addressed the Blessed One thus Venerable Gotama Ajatasattu the king of Magadha pays homage at the feet of the Venerable Gotama and wishes him good health strength ease vigour and comfort
He desires to wage war against the Vajjis and he has spoken in this fashion 'These Vajjis powerful and glorious as they are I shall annihilate them I shall make them perish I shall utterly destroy them' At that time the Venerable Ananda was standing behind the Blessed One fanning him and the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda thus What have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis have frequent gatherings and are their meetings well attended
I have heard Lord that this is so
So long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their decline
What have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis assemble and disperse peacefully and attend to their affairs in concord
I have heard Lord that they do
So long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their decline
What have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis neither enact new decrees nor abolish existing ones but proceed in accordance with their ancient constitutions
I have heard Lord that they do
So long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their decline
What have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis show respect honor esteem and veneration towards their elders and think it worthwhile to listen to them
I have heard Lord that they do
So long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their decline
What have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis refrain from abducting women and maidens of good families and from detaining them
I have heard Lord that they refrain from doing so
So long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their decline
What have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis show respect honor esteem and veneration towards their shrines both those within the city and those outside it and do not deprive them of the due offerings as given and made to them formerly
I have heard Lord that they do venerate their shrines and that they do not deprive them of their offerings
So long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their decline
What have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis duly protect and guard the arahats so that those who have not come to the realm yet might do so and those who have already come might live there in peace
I have heard Lord that they do
So long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their decline
And the Blessed One addressed the brahman Vassakara in these words Once brahman I dwelt at Vesali at the Sarandada shrine and there it was that I taught the Vajjis these seven conditions leading to welfare
So long brahman as these endure among the Vajjis and the Vajjis are known for it their growth is to be expected not their decline
Thereupon the brahman Vassakara spoke thus to the Blessed One If the Vajjis Venerable Gotama were endowed with only one or another of these conditions leading to welfare their growth would have to be expected not their decline
What then of all the seven
No harm indeed can be done to the Vajjis in battle by Magadha's king Ajatasattu except through treachery or discord
Well then Venerable Gotama we will take our leave for we have much to perform much work to do
Do as now seems fit to you brahman And the brahman Vassakara the chief minister of Magadha approving of the Blessed One's words and delighted by them rose from his seat and departed
Then soon after Vassakara's departure the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda thus Go now Ananda and assemble in the hall of audience as many bhikkhus as live around Rajagaha
Very well Lord And the Venerable Ananda did as he was requested and informed the Blessed One The community of bhikkhus is assembled Lord
Now let the Blessed One do as he wishes
Thereupon the Blessed One rose from his seat went up to the hall of audience took his appointed seat there and addressed the bhikkhus thus Seven conditions leading to welfare I shall set forth bhikkhus
Listen and pay heed to what I shall say
So be it Lord
The growth of the bhikkhus is to be expected not their decline bhikkhus so long as they assemble frequently and in large numbers meet and disperse peacefully and attend to the affairs of the Sangha in concord so long as they appoint no new rules and do not abolish the existing ones but proceed in accordance with the code of training laid down so long as they show respect honor esteem and veneration towards the elder bhikkhus those of long standing long gone forth the fathers and leaders of the Sangha and think it worthwhile to listen to them so long as they do not come under the power of the craving that leads to fresh becoming so long as they cherish the forest depths for their dwellings so long as they establish themselves in mindfulness so that virtuous brethren of the Order who have not come yet might do so and those already come might live in peace so long bhikkhus as these seven conditions leading to welfare endure among the bhikkhus and the bhikkhus are known for it their growth is to be expected not their decline
Seven further conditions leading to welfare I shall set forth bhikkhus
Listen and pay heed to what I shall say
So be it Lord
The growth of the bhikkhus is to be expected not their decline bhikkhus so long as they do not delight in are not pleased with and are not fond of activities talk sleep and company so long as they do not harbor do not come under the spell of evil desires have no bad friends associates or companions and so long as they do not stop halfway on account of some trifling achievement
So long bhikkhus as these seven conditions leading to welfare endure among the bhikkhus and the bhikkhus are known for it their growth is to be expected not their decline
Seven further conditions leading to welfare I shall set forth bhikkhus
Listen and pay heed to what I shall say
So be it Lord
The growth of the bhikkhus is to be expected not their decline bhikkhus so long as they shall have faith so long as they have moral shame and fear of misconduct are proficient in learning resolute mindful and wise
So long bhikkhus as these seven conditions leading to welfare endure among the bhikkhus and the bhikkhus are known for it their growth is to be expected not their decline
Seven further conditions leading to welfare I shall set forth bhikkhus
Listen and pay heed to what I shall say
So be it Lord
The growth of the bhikkhus is to be expected not their decline bhikkhus so long as they cultivate the seven factors of enlightenment that is mindfulness investigation into phenomena energy bliss tranquillity concentration and equanimity
So long bhikkhus as these seven conditions leading to welfare endure among the bhikkhus and the bhikkhus are known for it their growth is to be expected not their decline
Seven further conditions leading to welfare I shall set forth bhikkhus
Listen and pay heed to what I shall say
So be it Lord
The growth of the bhikkhus is to be expected not their decline bhikkhus so long as they cultivate the perception of impermanence of egolessness of impurity of wretchedness of relinquishment of dispassion and of cessation
So long bhikkhus as these seven conditions leading to welfare endure among the bhikkhus and the bhikkhus are known for it their growth is to be expected not their decline
Six further conditions leading to welfare I shall set forth bhikkhus
Listen and pay heed to what I shall say
So be it Lord
The growth of the bhikkhus is to be expected not their decline bhikkhus so long as they attend on each other with lovingkindness in deed word and thought both openly and in private so long as in respect of what they receive as due offerings even the contents of their alms bowls they do not make use of them without sharing them with virtuous members of the community so long as in company with their brethren they train themselves openly and in private in the rules of conduct which are complete and perfect spotless and pure liberating praised by the wise uninfluenced and favorable to concentration of mind and in company with their brethren preserve openly and in private the insight that is noble and liberating and leads one who acts upon it to the utter destruction of suffering
So long bhikkhus as these six conditions leading to welfare endure among the bhikkhus and the bhikkhus are known for it their growth is to be expected not their decline
And the Blessed One living at Rajagaha at the hill called Vultures' Peak often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus
Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdom
Great becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom
When the Blessed One had stayed at Rajagaha as long as he pleased he addressed the Venerable Ananda thus Come Ananda let us go to Ambalatthika
So be it Lord
And the Blessed One took up his abode at Ambalatthika together with a large community of bhikkhus
At Ambalatthika the Blessed One came to stay in the king's rest house and there too the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus
Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdom
Great becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom
When the Blessed One had stayed at Ambalatthika as long as he pleased he addressed the Venerable Ananda thus Come Ananda let us go to Nalanda
So be it Lord
And the Blessed One took up his abode at Nalanda together with a large community of bhikkhus and came to stay in the mango grove of Pavarika
Then the Venerable Sariputta went to the Blessed One respectfully greeted him sat down at one side and spoke thus to him
This faith Lord I have in the Blessed One that there has not been there will not be nor is there now another recluse or brahman more exalted in Enlightenment than the Blessed One
Lofty indeed is this speech of yours Sariputta and lordly
A bold utterance a veritable sounding of the lion's roar
But how is this Sariputta
Those Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of the past  do you have direct personal knowledge of all those Blessed Ones as to their virtue their meditation their wisdom their abiding and their emancipation 
Not so Lord
Then how is this Sariputta
Those Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of the future  do you have direct personal knowledge of all those Blessed Ones as to their virtue their meditation their wisdom their abiding and their emancipation
Not so Lord
Then how is this Sariputta
Of me who am at present the Arahant the Fully Enlightened One do you have direct personal knowledge as to my virtue my meditation my wisdom my abiding and my emancipation
Not so Lord
Then it is clear Sariputta that you have no such direct personal knowledge of the Arahats the Fully Enlightened Ones of the past the future and the present
How then dare you set forth a speech so lofty and lordly an utterance so bold a veritable sounding of the lion's roar saying 'This faith Lord I have in the Blessed One that there has not been there will not be nor is there now another recluse or brahman more exalted in Enlightenment than the Blessed One'
No such direct personal knowledge indeed is mine Lord of the Arahants the Fully Enlightened Ones of the past the future and the present and yet I have come to know the lawfulness of the Dhamma
Suppose Lord a king's frontier fortress was strongly fortified with strong ramparts and turrets and it had a single gate and there was a gatekeeper intelligent experienced and prudent who would keep out the stranger but allow the friend to enter
As he patrols the path that leads all around the fortress he does not perceive a hole or fissure in the ramparts even big enough to allow a cat to slip through
So he comes to the conclusion 'Whatever grosser living things are to enter or leave this city they will all have to do so just by this gate' In the same way Lord I have come to know the lawfulness of the Dhamma
For Lord all the Blessed Ones Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of the past had abandoned the five hindrances the mental defilements that weaken wisdom had well established their minds in the four foundations of mindfulness had duly cultivated the seven factors of enlightenment and were fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment
And Lord all the Blessed Ones Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of the future will abandon the five hindrances the mental defilements that weaken wisdom will well establish their minds in the four foundations of mindfulness will duly cultivate the seven factors of enlightenment and will be fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment
And the Blessed One too Lord being at present the Arahant the Fully Enlightened One has abandoned the five hindrances the mental defilements that weaken wisdom has well established his mind in the four foundations of mindfulness has duly cultivated the seven factors of enlightenment and is fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment
And also in Nalanda in the mango grove of Pavarika the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus
Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdom
Great becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom
When the Blessed One had stayed at Nalanda as long as he pleased he addressed the Venerable Ananda thus
Come Ananda let us go to Pataligama
So be it Lord
And the Blessed One took up his abode at Pataligama together with a large community of bhikkhus
Then the devotees of Pataligama came to know The Blessed One they say has arrived at Pataligama And they approached the Blessed One respectfully greeted him sat down at one side and addressed him thus May the Blessed One Lord kindly visit our council hall And the Blessed One consented by his silence
Knowing the Blessed One's consent the devotees of Pataligama rose from their seats respectfully saluted him and keeping their right sides towards him departed for the council hall
Then they prepared the council hall by covering the floor all over arranging seats and water and setting out an oil lamp
Having done this they returned to the Blessed One respectfully greeted him and standing at one side announced Lord the council hall is ready with the floor covered all over seats and water prepared and an oil lamp has been set out
Let the Blessed One come Lord at his convenience
And the Blessed One got ready and taking his bowl and robe went to the council hall together with the company of bhikkhus
After rinsing his feet the Blessed One entered the council hall and took his seat close to the middle pillar facing east
The community of bhikkhus after rinsing their feet also entered the council hall and took seats near the western wall facing east so that the Blessed One was before them
And the devotees of Pataligama after rinsing their feet and entering the council hall sat down near the eastern wall facing west so that the Blessed One was in front of them
Thereupon the Blessed One addressed the devotees of Pataligama thus The immoral man householders by falling away from virtue encounters five perils great loss of wealth through heedlessness an evil reputation a timid and troubled demeanor in every society be it that of nobles brahmans householders or ascetics death in bewilderment and at the breaking up of the body after death rebirth in a realm of misery in an unhappy state in the nether world in hell
Five blessings householders accrue to the righteous man through his practice of virtue great increase of wealth through his diligence a favorable reputation a confident deportment without timidity in every society be it that of nobles brahmans householders or ascetics a serene death and at the breaking up of the body after death rebirth in a happy state in a heavenly world
And the Blessed One spent much of the night instructing the devotees of Pataligama in the Dhamma rousing edifying and gladdening them after which he dismissed them saying The night is far advanced householders
You may go at your convenience
So be it Lord And the devotees of Pataligama rose from their seats respectfully saluted the Blessed One and keeping their right sides towards him departed
And the Blessed One soon after their departure retired into privacy
At that time Sunidha and Vassakara the chief ministers of Magadha were building a fortress at Pataligama in defense against the Vajjis
And deities in large numbers counted in thousands had taken possession of sites at Pataligama
In the region where deities of great power prevailed officials of great power were bent on constructing edifices and where deities of medium power and lesser power prevailed officials of medium and lesser power were bent on constructing edifices
And the Blessed One saw with the heavenly eye pure and transcending the faculty of men the deities counted in thousands where they had taken possession of sites in Pataligama
And rising before the night was spent towards dawn the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda thus Who is it Ananda that is erecting a city at Pataligama
Sunidha and Vassakara Lord the chief ministers of Magadha are building a fortress at Pataligama in defence against the Vajjis
It is Ananda as if Sunidha and Vassakara had taken counsel with the gods of the Thirtythree
For I beheld Ananda with the heavenly eye pure and transcending the faculty of men a large number of deities counted in thousands that have taken possession of sites at Pataligama
In the region where deities of great power prevail officials of great power are bent on constructing edifices and where deities of medium and lesser power prevail officials of medium and lesser power are bent on constructing edifices
Truly Ananda as far as the Aryan race extends and trade routes spread this will be the foremost city Pataliputta a tradecenter
But Pataliputta Ananda will be assailed by three perils  fire water and dissension
Then Sunidha and Vassakara went to the Blessed One and after courteous greeting to the Blessed One and exchanging many pleasant words they stood at one side and addressed him thus May the Venerable Gotama please accept our invitation for tomorrow's meal together with the community of bhikkhus And the Blessed One consented by his silence
Knowing the Blessed One's consent Sunidha and Vassakara departed for their own abodes where they had choice food hard and soft prepared
And when it was time they announced to the Blessed One It is time Venerable Gotama the meal is ready
Thereupon the Blessed One got ready in the forenoon and taking bowl and robe he went together with the community of bhikkhus to the abode of Sunidha and Vassakara where he took the seat prepared for him
And Sunidha and Vassakara themselves attended on the community of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha and served them with choice food hard and soft
When the Blessed One had finished his meal and had removed his hand from the bowl they took low seats and sat down at one side
And the Blessed One thanked them with these stanzas
After this the Blessed One rose from his seat and departed
Then Sunidha and Vassakara followed behind the Blessed One step by step saying Through whichever gate the recluse Gotama will depart today that we will name the Gotamagate and the ford by which he will cross the river Ganges shall be named the Gotamaford And so it came to pass where the gate was concerned
But when the Blessed One came to the river Ganges it was full to the brim so that crows could drink from it
And some people went in search of a boat or float while others tied up a raft because they desired to get across
But the Blessed One as quickly as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or draw in his outstretched arm vanished from this side of the river Ganges and came to stand on the yonder side
And the Blessed One saw the people who desired to cross searching for a boat or float while others were binding rafts
And then the Blessed One seeing them thus gave forth the solemn utterance
Now the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to Kotigama
So be it Lord And the Blessed One took up his abode at Kotigama together with a large community of bhikkhus
And the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Bhikkhus it is through not realizing through not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that this long course of birth and death has been passed through and undergone by me as well as by you
What are these four
They are the noble truth of suffering the noble truth of the origin of suffering the noble truth of the cessation of suffering and the noble truth of the way to the cessation of suffering
But now bhikkhus that these have been realized and penetrated cut off is the craving for existence destroyed is that which leads to renewed becoming and there is no fresh becoming
Thus it was said by the Blessed One
And the Happy One the Master further said
And also at Kotigama the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdom
Great becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom
When the Blessed One had stayed at Kotigama as long as he pleased he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to Nadika
So be it Lord And the Blessed One took up his abode in Nadika together with a large community of bhikkhus staying in the Brick House
Then the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One and after greeting him respectfully sat down at one side
And he said to the Blessed One Here in Nadika Lord there have passed away the bhikkhu Salha and the bhikkhuni Nanda
Likewise there have passed away the layman Sudatta and the laywoman Sujata likewise the layman Kakudha Kalinga Nikata Katissabha Tuttha Santuttha Bhadda and Subhadda
What is their destiny Lord
What is their future state
The bhikkhu Salha Ananda through the destruction of the taints in this very lifetime has attained to the taintfree deliverance of mind and deliverance through wisdom having directly known and realized it by himself

The bhikkhuni Nanda Ananda through the destruction of the five lower fetters has arisen spontaneously and will come to final cessation in that very place not liable to return from that world
The layman Sudatta Ananda through the destruction of the three fetters and the lessening of lust hatred and delusion has become a oncereturner and is bound to make an end of suffering after having returned but once more to this world
The laywoman Sujata Ananda through the destruction of the three fetters has become a streamenterer and is safe from falling into the states of misery assured and bound for Enlightenment
The layman Kakudha Ananda through the destruction of the five lower fetters has arisen spontaneously and will come to final cessation in that very place not liable to return from that world
So it is with Kalinga Nikata Katissabha Tuttha Santuttha Bhadda and Subhadda and with more than fifty laymen in Nadika
More than ninety laymen who have passed away in Nadika Ananda through the destruction of the three fetters and the lessening of lust hatred and delusion have become oncereturners and are bound to make an end of suffering after having returned but once more to this world
More than five hundred laymen who have passed away in Nadika Ananda through the complete destruction of the three fetters have become streamenterers and are safe from falling into the states of misery assured and bound for Enlightenment
But truly Ananda it is nothing strange that human beings should die
But if each time it happens you should come to the Tathagata and ask about them in this manner indeed it would be troublesome to him
Therefore Ananda I will give you the teaching called the Mirror of the Dhamma possessing which the noble disciple should he so desire can declare of himself 'There is no more rebirth for me in hell nor as an animal or ghost nor in any realm of woe
A streamenterer am I safe from falling into the states of misery assured am I and bound for Enlightenment' And what Ananda is that teaching called the Mirror of Dhamma possessing which the noble disciple may thus declare of himself
In this case Ananda the noble disciple possesses unwavering faith in the Buddha thus 'The Blessed One is an Arahant the Fully Enlightened One perfect in knowledge and conduct the Happy One the knower of the world the paramount trainer of beings the teacher of gods and men the Enlightened One the Blessed One'
He possesses unwavering faith in the Dhamma thus 'Well propounded by the Blessed One is the Dhamma evident timeless inviting investigation leading to emancipation to be comprehended by the wise each for himself'
He possesses unwavering faith in the Blessed One's Order of Disciples thus 'Well faring is the Blessed One's Order of Disciples righteously wisely and dutifully that is to say the four pairs of men the eight classes of persons
The Blessed One's Order of Disciples is worthy of honor of hospitality of offerings of veneration  the supreme field for meritorious deeds in the world'
And he possesses virtues that are dear to the Noble Ones complete and perfect spotless and pure which are liberating praised by the wise uninfluenced and favorable to concentration of mind
This Ananda is the teaching called the Mirror of the Dhamma whereby the noble disciple may thus know of himself 'There is no more rebirth for me in hell nor as an animal or ghost nor in any realm of woe
A streamenterer am I safe from falling into the states of misery assured am I and bound for Enlightenment' And also in Nadika in the Brick House the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdom
Great becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom
When the Blessed One had stayed in Nadika as long as he pleased he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to Vesali
So be it O Lord And the Blessed One took up his abode in Vesali together with a large community of bhikkhus and stayed in Ambapali's grove
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Mindful should you dwell bhikkhus clearly comprehending thus I exhort you
And how bhikkhus is a bhikkhu mindful
When he dwells contemplating the body in the body earnestly clearly comprehending and mindfully after having overcome desire and sorrow in regard to the world and when he dwells contemplating feelings in feelings the mind in the mind and mental objects in mental objects earnestly clearly comprehending and mindfully after having overcome desire and sorrow in regard to the world then is he said to be mindful
And how bhikkhus does a bhikkhu have clear comprehension
When he remains fully aware of his coming and going his looking forward and his looking away his bending and stretching his wearing of his robe and carrying of his bowl his eating and drinking masticating and savoring his defecating and urinating his walking standing sitting lying down going to sleep or keeping awake his speaking or being silent then is he said to have clear comprehension
Mindful should you dwell bhikkhus clearly comprehending thus I exhort you
Then Ambapali the courtesan came to know The Blessed One they say has arrived at Vesali and is now staying in my Mango Grove And she ordered a large number of magnificent carriages to be made ready mounted one of them herself and accompanied by the rest drove out from Vesali towards her park
She went by carriage as far as the carriage could go then alighted and approaching the Blessed One on foot she respectfully greeted him and sat down at one side
And the Blessed One instructed Ambapali the courtesan in the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened her
Thereafter Ambapali the courtesan spoke to the Blessed One saying May the Blessed One O Lord please accept my invitation for tomorrow's meal together with the community of bhikkhus And by his silence the Blessed One consented
Sure then of the Blessed One's consent Ambapali the courtesan rose from her seat respectfully saluted him and keeping her right side towards him took her departure
Then the Licchavi of Vesali came to know The Blessed One they say has arrived at Vesali and is now staying in Ambapali's grove And they ordered a large number of magnificent carriages to be made ready each mounted one and accompanied by the rest drove out from Vesali
Now of these Licchavis some were in blue with clothing and ornaments all of blue while others were in yellow red and white
And it so happened that Ambapali the courtesan drove up against the young Licchavis axle by axle wheel by wheel and yoke by yoke
Thereupon the Licchavis exclaimed Why do you drive up against us in this fashion Ambapali
Thus it is indeed my princes and not otherwise
For the Blessed One is invited by me for tomorrow's meal together with the community of bhikkhus
Give up the meal Ambapali for a hundred thousand
But she replied Even if you were to give me Vesali sirs together with its tributary lands I would not give up a meal of such importance
Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers in annoyance See friends
We are defeated by this mango lass
We are utterly outdone by this mango lass But they continued on their way to Ambapali's grove
And the Blessed One beheld the Licchavis from afar as they drove up
Then he spoke to the bhikkhus saying Those of you bhikkhus who have not yet seen the Thirtythree gods may behold the assembly of the Licchavis and may gaze on them for they are comparable to the assembly of the Thirtythree gods
Then the Licchavis drove their carriages as far as the carriages could go then alighted and approaching the Blessed One on foot they respectfully greeted him and sat down at one side
The Blessed One instructed the Licchavis in the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened them
Thereafter the Licchavis spoke to the Blessed One saying May the Blessed One O Lord please accept our invitation for tomorrow's meal together with the community of bhikkhus
The invitation for tomorrow's meal Licchavis has been accepted by me from Ambapali the courtesan
Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers in annoyance See friends
We are defeated by this mango lass
We are utterly outdone by this mango lass And then the Licchavis approving of the Blessed One's words and delighted with them rose from their seats respectfully saluted him and keeping their right sides towards him took their departure
Then after the night had passed Ambapali the courtesan had choice food hard and soft prepared in her park and announced it to the Blessed One It is time O Lord the meal is ready Thereupon the Blessed One got ready in the forenoon and taking bowl and robe he went together with the community of bhikkhus to Ambapali's dwelling and there he took the seat prepared for him
And Ambapali herself attended on the community of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha and served them with choice food hard and soft
And when the Blessed One had finished his meal and had removed his hand from his bowl Ambapali the courtesan took a low seat and placing herself at one side spoke to the Blessed One saying This park O Lord I offer to the community of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha And the Blessed One accepted the park
He then instructed Ambapali in the Dhamma and having roused edified and gladdened her he rose from his seat and departed
And also at Vesali in Ambapali's grove the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdom
Great becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom
When the Blessed One had stayed in Ambapali's grove as long as he pleased he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to the village of Beluva
So be it Lord And the Blessed One took up his abode in the village of Beluva together with a large community of bhikkhus
At that time the Blessed One spoke to the bhikkhus saying Go now bhikkhus and seek shelter anywhere in the neighborhood of Vesali where you are welcome among acquaintances and friends and there spend the rainy season
As for me I shall spend the rainy season in this very place in the village of Beluva
So be it O Lord the bhikkhus said
But when the Blessed One had entered upon the rainy season there arose in him a severe illness and sharp and deadly pains came upon him
And the Blessed One endured them mindfully clearly comprehending and unperturbed
Then it occurred to the Blessed One It would not be fitting if I came to my final passing away without addressing those who attended on me without taking leave of the community of bhikkhus
Then let me suppress this illness by strength of will resolve to maintain the life process and live on
And the Blessed One suppressed the illness by strength of will resolved to maintain the life process and lived on
So it came about that the Blessed One's illness was allayed
And the Blessed One recovered from that illness and soon after his recovery he came out from his dwelling place and sat down in the shade of the building on a seat prepared for him
Then the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One respectfully greeted him and sitting down at one side he spoke to the Blessed One saying Fortunate it is for me O Lord to see the Blessed One at ease again
Fortunate it is for me O Lord to see the Blessed One recovered
For truly Lord when I saw the Blessed One's sickness it was as though my own body became weak as a creeper every thing around became dim to me and my senses failed me
Yet Lord I still had some little comfort in the thought that the Blessed One would not come to his final passing away until he had given some last instructions respecting the community of bhikkhus
Thus spoke the Venerable Ananda but the Blessed One answered him saying What more does the community of bhikkhus expect from me Ananda
I have set forth the Dhamma without making any distinction of esoteric and exoteric doctrine there is nothing Ananda with regard to the teachings that the Tathagata holds to the last with the closed fist of a teacher who keeps some things back
Whosoever may think that it is he who should lead the community of bhikkhus or that the community depends upon him it is such a one that would have to give last instructions respecting them
But Ananda the Tathagata has no such idea as that it is he who should lead the community of bhikkhus or that the community depends upon him
So what instructions should he have to give respecting the community of bhikkhus
Now I am frail Ananda old aged far gone in years
This is my eightieth year and my life is spent
Even as an old cart Ananda is held together with much difficulty so the body of the Tathagata is kept going only with supports
It is Ananda only when the Tathagata disregarding external objects with the cessation of certain feelings attains to and abides in the signless concentration of mind that his body is more comfortable
Therefore Ananda be islands unto yourselves refuges unto yourselves seeking no external refuge with the Dhamma as your island the Dhamma as your refuge seeking no other refuge
And how Ananda is a bhikkhu an island unto himself a refuge unto himself seeking no external refuge with the Dhamma as his island the Dhamma as his refuge seeking no other refuge
When he dwells contemplating the body in the body earnestly clearly comprehending and mindfully after having overcome desire and sorrow in regard to the world when he dwells contemplating feelings in feelings the mind in the mind and mental objects in mental objects earnestly clearly comprehending and mindfully after having overcome desire and sorrow in regard to the world then truly he is an island unto himself a refuge unto himself seeking no external refuge having the Dhamma as his island the Dhamma as his refuge seeking no other refuge
Those bhikkhus of mine Ananda who now or after I am gone abide as an island unto themselves as a refuge unto themselves seeking no other refuge having the Dhamma as their island and refuge seeking no other refuge it is they who will become the highest if they have the desire to learn
Then the Blessed One getting ready in the forenoon took bowl and robe and went into Vesali for alms
After the alms round and meal on his return he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Take up a mat Ananda and let us spend the day at the Capala shrine
So be it Lord And the Venerable Ananda took up a mat and followed behind the Blessed One step by step
And the Blessed One went to the Capala shrine and sat down on the seat prepared for him
And when the Venerable Ananda had seated himself at one side after he had respectfully saluted the Blessed One the Lord said to him Pleasant Ananda is Vesali pleasant are the shrines of Udena Gotamaka Sattambaka Bahuputta Sarandada and Capala
And the Blessed One said Whosoever Ananda has developed practiced employed strengthened maintained scrutinized and brought to perfection the four constituents of psychic power could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of it
The Tathagata Ananda has done so
Therefore the Tathagata could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of it
But the Venerable Ananda was unable to grasp the plain suggestion the significant prompting given by the Blessed One
As though his mind was influenced by Mara he did not beseech the Blessed One May the Blessed One remain O Lord
May the Happy One remain O Lord throughout the worldperiod for the welfare and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit well being and happiness of gods and men
And when for a second and a third time the Blessed One repeated his words the Venerable Ananda remained silent
Then the Blessed One said to the Venerable Ananda Go now Ananda and do as seems fit to you
Even so O Lord And the Venerable Ananda rising from his seat respectfully saluted the Blessed One and keeping his right side towards him took his seat under a tree some distance away
And when the Venerable Ananda had gone away Mara the Evil One approached the Blessed One
And standing at one side he spoke to the Blessed One saying Now O Lord let the Blessed One come to his final passing away let the Happy One utterly pass away
The time has come for the Parinibbana of the Lord
For the Blessed One O Lord spoke these words to me 'I shall not come to my final passing away Evil One until my bhikkhus and bhikkhunis laymen and laywomen have come to be true disciples  wise well disciplined apt and learned preservers of the Dhamma living according to the Dhamma abiding by the appropriate conduct and having learned the Master's word are able to expound it preach it proclaim it establish it reveal it explain it in detail and make it clear until when adverse opinions arise they shall be able to refute them thoroughly and well and to preach this convincing and liberating Dhamma' 
And now O Lord bhikkhus and bhikkhunis laymen and laywomen have become the Blessed One's disciples in just this way
So O Lord let the Blessed One come to his final passing away
The time has come for the Parinibbana of the Lord
For the Blessed One O Lord spoke these words to me 'I shall not come to my final passing away Evil One until this holy life taught by me has become successful prosperous farrenowned popular and widespread until it is well proclaimed among gods and men' And this too has come to pass in just this way
So O Lord let the Blessed One come to his final passing away let the Happy One utterly pass away
The time has come for the Parinibbana of the Lord
When this was said the Blessed One spoke to Mara the Evil One saying Do not trouble yourself Evil One
Before long the Parinibbana of the Tathagata will come about
Three months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass away
And at the Capala shrine the Blessed One thus mindfully and clearly comprehending renounced his will to live on
And upon the Lord's renouncing his will to live on there came a tremendous earthquake dreadful and astonishing and thunder rolled across the heavens
And the Blessed One beheld it with understanding and made this solemn utterance
Then it came to the mind of the Venerable Ananda Marvellous it is indeed and most wonderful
The earth shakes mightily tremendously
Dreadful and astonishing it is how the thunders roll across the heavens
What could be the reason what the cause that so mighty an earthquake should arise
And the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One and respectfully greeting him sat down at one side
Then he spoke to the Blessed One saying Marvellous it is indeed and most wonderful
The earth shakes mightily tremendously
Dreadful and astonishing it is how the thunders roll across the heavens
What could be the reason what the cause that so mighty an earthquake should arise
Then the Blessed One said There are eight reasons Ananda eight causes for a mighty earthquake to arise
What are those eight
This great earth Ananda is established upon liquid the liquid upon the atmosphere and the atmosphere upon space
And when Ananda mighty atmospheric disturbances take place the liquid is agitated
And with the agitation of the liquid tremors of the earth arise
This is the first reason the first cause for the arising of mighty earthquakes
Again Ananda when an ascetic or holy man of great power one who has gained mastery of his mind or a deity who is mighty and potent develops intense concentration on the delimited aspect of the earth element and to a boundless degree on the liquid element he too causes the earth to tremble quiver and shake
This is the second reason the second cause for the arising of mighty earthquakes

Again Ananda when the Bodhisatta departs from the Tusita realm and descends into his mother's womb mindfully and clearly comprehending and when the Bodhisatta comes out from his mother's womb mindfully and clearly comprehending and when the Tathagata becomes fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment when the Tathagata sets rolling the excellent Wheel of the Dhamma when the Tathagata renounces his will to live on and when the Tathagata comes to pass away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains  then too Ananda this great earth trembles quivers and shakes
These Ananda are the eight reasons the eight causes for a great earthquake to arise

Now there are eight kinds of assemblies Ananda that is to say assemblies of nobles brahmans householders ascetics of the Four Great Kings of the Thirtythree gods of Maras and of Brahmas
And I recall Ananda how I have attended each of these eight kinds of assemblies amounting to hundreds
And before seating myself and starting the conversation or the discussion I made my appearance resemble theirs my voice resemble theirs
And so I taught them the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened them
Yet while I was speaking to them thus they did not know me and they would enquire of one another asking 'Who is he that speaks to us
Is it a man or a god'
Then having taught them the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened them I would straightaway vanish
And when I had vanished too they did not know me and they would enquire of one another asking 'Who is he that has vanished
Is it a man or a god'
And such Ananda are the eight kinds of assemblies
Now there are eight fields of mastery Ananda
What are those eight
When one perceiving forms subjectively sees small forms beautiful or ugly external to himself and mastering them is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are  this is the first field of mastery
When one perceiving forms subjectively sees large forms beautiful or ugly external to himself and mastering them is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are  this is the second field of mastery
When one not perceiving forms subjectively sees small forms beautiful or ugly external to himself and mastering them is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are  this is the third field of mastery
When one not perceiving forms subjectively sees large forms beautiful or ugly external to himself and mastering them is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are  this is the fourth field of mastery
When one not perceiving forms subjectively sees forms external to himself that are blue blue in color of a blue luster like the blossoms of flax or like fine Benares muslin which burnished on both sides is blue blue in color of a blue luster  when such a one sees forms external to himself that are blue and mastering them is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are  this is the fifth field of mastery
When one not perceiving forms subjectively sees forms external to himself that are yellow yellow in color of a yellow luster like the Kanikara blossom or like fine Benares muslin which burnished on both sides is yellow yellow in color of a yellow luster  when such a one sees forms external to himself that are yellow and mastering them is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are  this is the sixth field of mastery
When one not perceiving forms subjectively sees forms external to himself that are red red in color of a red luster like the Bandhujivaka blossom or like fine Benares muslin which burnished on both sides is red red in color of a red luster  when such a one sees forms external to himself that are red and mastering them is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are  this is the seventh field of mastery
When one not perceiving forms subjectively sees forms external to himself that are white white in color of a white luster like the morning star or like fine Benares muslin which burnished on both sides is white white in color of a white luster  when such a one sees forms external to himself that are white and mastering them is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are  this is the eighth field of mastery
These Ananda are the eight fields of mastery
Now there are eight liberations Ananda
What are those eight

Oneself having form one perceives forms this is the first liberation
Being unaware of one's own form one perceives forms external to oneself this is the second liberation
Experiencing loveliness one is intent upon it this is the third liberation
By utterly transcending the perceptions of matter by the disappearance of the perceptions of sensereaction and by giving no attention to diversityperceptions one becomes aware of attains to and abides in the sphere of infinite space this is the fourth liberation
By utterly transcending the sphere of infinite space one becomes aware of attains to and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness this is the fifth liberation
By utterly transcending the sphere of infinite consciousness one becomes aware of attains to and abides in the sphere of nothingness this is the sixth liberation
By utterly transcending the sphere of nothingness one attains to and abides in the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception this is the seventh liberation
By utterly transcending the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception one attains to and abides in the cessation of perception and sensation this is the eighth liberation
These Ananda are the eight liberations
There was a time Ananda when I dwelt at Uruvela on the bank of the Nerañjara River at the foot of the goatherds' banyantree soon after my supreme Enlightenment
And Mara the Evil One approached me saying 'Now O Lord let the Blessed One come to his final passing away
Let the Happy One utterly pass away
The time has come for the Parinibbana of the Lord'
Then Ananda I answered Mara the Evil One saying 'I shall not come to my final passing away Evil One until my bhikkhus and bhikkhunis laymen and laywomen have come to be true disciples  wise well disciplined apt and learned preservers of the Dhamma living according to the Dhamma abiding by appropriate conduct and having learned the Master's word are able to expound it preach it proclaim it establish it reveal it explain it in detail and make it clear until when adverse opinions arise they shall be able to refute them thoroughly and well and to preach this convincing and liberating Dhamma
'I shall not come to my final passing away Evil One until this holy life taught by me has become successful prosperous farrenowned popular and widespread until it is well proclaimed among gods and men'
And again today Ananda at the Capala shrine Mara the Evil One approached me saying 'Now O Lord bhikkhus and bhikkhunis laymen and laywomen have come to be true disciples of the Blessed One  wise well disciplined apt and learned preservers of the Dhamma living according to the Dhamma abiding in the appropriate conduct and having learned the Master's word are able to expound it preach it proclaim it establish it reveal it explain it in detail and make it clear and when adverse opinions arise they are now able to refute them thoroughly and well and to preach this convincing and liberating Dhamma
'And now O Lord this holy life taught by the Blessed One has become successful prosperous farrenowned popular and widespread and it is well proclaimed among gods and men
Therefore O Lord let the Blessed One come to his final passing away
Let the Happy One utterly pass away
The time has come for the Parinibbana of the Lord'
And then Ananda I answered Mara the Evil One saying 'Do not trouble yourself Evil One
Before long the Parinibbana of the Tathagata will come about
Three months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass away'
And in this way Ananda today at the Capala shrine the Tathagata has renounced his will to live on
At these words the Venerable Ananda spoke to the Blessed One saying May the Blessed One remain O Lord
May the Happy One remain O Lord throughout the worldperiod for the welfare and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit well being and happiness of gods and men
And the Blessed One answered saying Enough Ananda
Do not entreat the Tathagata for the time is past Ananda for such an entreaty
But for a second and a third time the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One May the Blessed One remain O Lord
May the Happy One remain O Lord throughout the worldperiod for the welfare and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit well being and happiness of gods and men
Then the Blessed One said Do you have faith Ananda in the Enlightenment of the Tathagata And the Venerable Ananda replied Yes O Lord I do
Then how Ananda can you persist against the Tathagata even up to the third time
Then the Venerable Ananda said This O Lord I have heard and learned from the Blessed One himself when the Blessed One said to me 'Whosoever Ananda has developed practiced employed strengthened maintained scrutinized and brought to perfection the four constituents of psychic power could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of it
The Tathagata Ananda has done so
Therefore the Tathagata could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of it' And did you believe it Ananda
Yes O Lord I did
Then Ananda the fault is yours
Herein have you failed inasmuch as you were unable to grasp the plain suggestion the significant prompting given by the Tathagata and you did not then entreat the Tathagata to remain
For if you had done so Ananda twice the Tathagata might have declined but the third time he would have consented
Therefore Ananda the fault is yours herein have you failed
At Rajagaha Ananda when dwelling at Vultures' Peak I spoke to you saying 'Pleasant Ananda is Rajagaha pleasant is Vultures' Peak
Whosoever Ananda has developed Therefore the Tathagata could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of it'
So also at the Banyan Grove at Robbers' Cliff at the Sattapanni Cave on the Vebhara Mountain at the Black Rock of Isigili at the Serpents' Pool in the Cool Forest at the Tapoda Grove at the Bamboo Grove in the Squirrels' Feedingground at Jivaka's Mango Grove and at Small Nook in the Deer Park I spoke to you in the same words saying 'Pleasant Ananda is Rajagaha pleasant are these places
Whosoever Ananda has developed Therefore the Tathagata could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of it'
But you Ananda were unable to grasp the plain suggestion the significant prompting given you by the Tathagata and you did not entreat the Tathagata to remain
For if you had done so Ananda twice the Tathagata might have declined but the third time he would have consented
Therefore Ananda the fault is yours herein you have failed
So also at Vesali Ananda at different times the Tathagata has spoken to you saying 'Pleasant Ananda is Vesali pleasant are the shrines of Udena Gotamaka Sattambaka Bahuputta Sarandada and Capala
Whosoever Ananda has developed Therefore the Tathagata could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of it'
But you Ananda were unable to grasp the plain suggestion the significant prompting given you by the Tathagata and you did not entreat the Tathagata to remain
For if you had done so Ananda twice the Tathagata might have declined but the third time he would have consented
Therefore Ananda the fault is yours herein you have failed
Yet Ananda have I not taught from the very beginning that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change separation and severance
Of that which is born come into being is compounded and subject to decay how can one say 'May it not come to dissolution' There can be no such state of things
And of that Ananda which the Tathagata has finished with that which he has relinquished given up abandoned and rejected  his will to live on  the Tathagata's word has been spoken once for all 'Before long the Parinibbana of the Tathagata will come about
Three months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass away' And that the Tathagata should withdraw his words for the sake of living on  this is an impossibility
So then Ananda let us go to the hall of the Gabled House in the Great Forest And the Venerable Ananda replied So be it Lord
Then the Blessed One with the Venerable Ananda went to the hall of the Gabled House in the Great Forest
And there he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Go now Ananda and assemble in the hall of audience all the bhikkhus who dwell in the neighborhood of Vesali
So be it Lord And the Venerable Ananda gathered all the bhikkhus who dwelt in the neighborhood of Vesali and assembled them in the hall of audience
And then respectfully saluting the Blessed One and standing at one side he said The community of bhikkhus is assembled Lord
Now let the Blessed One do as he wishes
Thereupon the Blessed One entered the hall of audience and taking the seat prepared for him he exhorted the bhikkhus saying Now O bhikkhus I say to you that these teachings of which I have direct knowledge and which I have made known to you  these you should thoroughly learn cultivate develop and frequently practice that the life of purity may be established and may long endure for the welfare and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit well being and happiness of gods and men
And what bhikkhus are these teachings
They are the four foundations of mindfulness the four right efforts the four constituents of psychic power the five faculties the five powers the seven factors of enlightenment and the Noble Eightfold Path
These bhikkhus are the teachings of which I have direct knowledge which I have made known to you and which you should thoroughly learn cultivate develop and frequently practice that the life of purity may be established and may long endure for the welfare and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit well being and happiness of gods and men
Then the Blessed One said to the bhikkhus So bhikkhus I exhort you All compounded things are subject to vanish
Strive with earnestness
The time of the Tathagata's Parinibbana is near
Three months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass away
And having spoken these words the Happy One the Master spoke again saying
Then the Blessed One getting ready in the forenoon took bowl and robe and went into Vesali for alms
After the alms round and meal on his return he looked upon Vesali with the elephant's look and said to the Venerable Ananda This Ananda is the last time that the Tathagata will look upon Vesali
Come Ananda let us go to Bhandagama
So be it O Lord And the Blessed One took up his abode at Bhandagama together with a large community of bhikkhus
And the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Bhikkhus it is through not realizing through not penetrating four principles that this long course of birth and death has been passed through and undergone by me as well as by you
What are those four
They are noble virtue noble concentration noble wisdom and noble emancipation
But now bhikkhus that these have been realized and penetrated cut off is the craving for existence destroyed is that which leads to renewed becoming and there is no fresh becoming
And having spoken these words the Happy One the Master spoke again saying
Virtue concentration wisdom and emancipation unsurpassed 
These are the principles realized by Gotama the renowned
And knowing them he the Buddha to his monks has taught the Dhamma
He the destroyer of suffering the Master the Seer is at peace
And also at Bhandagama the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdom
Great becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom
When the Blessed One had stayed at Bhandagama as long as he pleased he spoke to the Venerable Ananda Come Ananda let us go to Hatthigama
So be it Lord And the Blessed One took up his abode at Hatthigama together with a large community of bhikkhus
And when the Blessed One had stayed at Hatthigama as long as he pleased he took up his abode at Ambagama then at Jambugama
And at each of these places the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdom
Great becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom
And when the Blessed One had stayed at Jambugama as long as he pleased he spoke to the Venerable Ananda Come Ananda let us go to Bhoganagara
So be it Lord And the Blessed One took up his abode at Bhoganagara together with a large community of bhikkhus and stayed in the Ananda shrine
And there the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Now bhikkhus I shall make known to you the four great references
Listen and pay heed to my words And those bhikkhus answered saying
So be it Lord
Then the Blessed One said In this fashion bhikkhus a bhikkhu might speak 'Face to face with the Blessed One brethren I have heard and learned thus This is the Dhamma and the Discipline the Master's Dispensation' or 'In an abode of such and such a name lives a community with elders and a chief
Face to face with that community I have heard and learned thus This is the Dhamma and the Discipline the Master's Dispensation' or 'In an abode of such and such a name live several bhikkhus who are elders who are learned who have accomplished their course who are preservers of the Dhamma the Discipline and the Summaries
Face to face with those elders I have heard and learned thus This is the Dhamma and the Discipline the Master's Dispensation' or 'In an abode of such and such a name lives a single bhikkhu who is an elder who is learned who has accomplished his course who is a preserver of the Dhamma the Discipline and the Summaries
Face to face with that elder I have heard and learned thus This is the Dhamma and the Discipline the Master's Dispensation'
In such a case bhikkhus the declaration of such a bhikkhu is neither to be received with approval nor with scorn
Without approval and without scorn but carefully studying the sentences word by word one should trace them in the Discourses and verify them by the Discipline
If they are neither traceable in the Discourses nor verifiable by the Discipline one must conclude thus 'Certainly this is not the Blessed One's utterance this has been misunderstood by that bhikkhu  or by that community or by those elders or by that elder' In that way bhikkhus you should reject it
But if the sentences concerned are traceable in the Discourses and verifiable by the Discipline then one must conclude thus 'Certainly this is the Blessed One's utterance this has been well understood by that bhikkhu  or by that community or by those elders or by that elder' And in that way bhikkhus you may accept it on the first second third or fourth reference
These bhikkhus are the four great references for you to preserve
And also at Bhoganagara at the Ananda shrine the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdom
Great becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom
When the Blessed One had stayed at Bhoganagara as long as he pleased he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to Pava
So be it Lord And the Blessed One took up his abode at Pava together with a great community of bhikkhus and stayed in the Mango Grove of Cunda who was by family a metalworker
And Cunda the metalworker came to know The Blessed One they say has arrived at Pava and is staying in my Mango Grove And he went to the Blessed One and having respectfully greeted him sat down at one side
And the Blessed One instructed Cunda the metalworker in the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened him
Then Cunda spoke to the Blessed One saying May the Blessed One O Lord please accept my invitation for tomorrow's meal together with the community of bhikkhus And by his silence the Blessed One consented
Sure then of the Blessed One's consent Cunda the metalworker rose from his seat respectfully saluted the Blessed One and keeping his right side towards him took his departure
And Cunda the metalworker after the night had passed had choice food hard and soft prepared in his abode together with a quantity of sukaramaddava and announced it to the Blessed One saying It is time O Lord the meal is ready
Thereupon the Blessed One in the forenoon having got ready took bowl and robe and went with the community of bhikkhus to the house of Cunda and there sat down on the seat prepared for him
And he spoke to Cunda saying With the sukaramaddava you have prepared Cunda you may serve me with the other food hard and soft you may serve the community of bhikkhus
So be it Lord And with the sukaramaddava prepared by him he served the Blessed One and with the other food hard and soft he served the community of bhikkhus
Thereafter the Blessed One spoke to Cunda saying Whatever Cunda is left over of the sukaramaddava bury that in a pit
For I do not see in all this world with its gods Maras and Brahmas among the host of ascetics and brahmans gods and men anyone who could eat it and entirely digest it except the Tathagata alone
And Cunda the metalworker answered the Blessed One saying So be it O LordAnd what remained over of the sukaramaddava he buried in a pit
Then he returned to the Blessed One respectfully greeted him and sat down at one side
And the Blessed One instructed Cunda the metalworker in the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened him
After this he rose from his seat and departed
And soon after the Blessed One had eaten the meal provided by Cunda the metalworker a dire sickness fell upon him even dysentery and he suffered sharp and deadly pains
But the Blessed One endured them mindfully clearly comprehending and unperturbed
Then the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to Kusinara And the Venerable Ananda answered So be it Lord
Now on the way the Blessed One went aside from the highway and stopped at the foot of a tree
And he said to the Venerable Ananda Please fold my upper robe in four Ananda and lay it down
I am weary and want to rest awhile
So be it Lord And the Venerable Ananda folded the robe in four and laid it down
And the Blessed One sat down on the seat prepared for him and said to the Venerable Ananda Please bring me some water Ananda
I am thirsty and want to drink
And the Venerable Ananda answered the Blessed One But just now Lord a great number of carts five hundred carts have passed over and the shallow water has been cut through by the wheels so that it flows turbid and muddy
But the Kakuttha River Lord is quite close by and its waters are clear pleasant cool and translucent
It is easily approachable and delightfully placed
There the Blessed One can quench his thirst and refresh his limbs
But a second time the Blessed One made his request and the Venerable Ananda answered him as before
And then for a third time the Blessed One said Please bring me some water Ananda
I am thirsty and want to drink
Then the Venerable Ananda answered saying So be it Lord And he took the bowl and went to the stream
And the shallow water which had been cut through by the wheels so that it flowed turbid and muddy became clear and settled down pure and pleasant as the Venerable Ananda drew near
Then the Venerable Ananda thought Marvellous and most wonderful indeed is the power and glory of the Tathagata
And he took up water in the bowl and carried it to the Blessed One and said Marvellous and most wonderful indeed is the power and glory of the Tathagata
For this shallow water which had been cut through by the wheels so that it flowed turbid and muddy became clear and settled down pure and pleasant as I drew near
Now let the Blessed One drink the water
Let the Happy One drink And the Blessed One drank the water
Now it so happened that one Pukkusa of the Malla clan who was a disciple of Alara Kalama was passing by on his way from Kusinara to Pava
And when he saw the Blessed One seated at the foot of a tree he approached him respectfully greeted him and sat down at one side
And he spoke to the Blessed One saying Marvellous it is Lord most wonderful it is O Lord the state of calmness wherein abide those who have gone forth from the world
For at one time Lord Alara Kalama was on a journey and he went aside from the highway and sat down by the wayside at the foot of a tree to pass the heat of the day
And it came about Lord that a great number of carts even five hundred carts passed by him one by one
And then Lord a certain man who was following behind that train of carts approached and spoke to him saying 'Did you sir see a great number of carts that passed you by' And Alara Kalama answered him 'I did not see them brother' 'But the noise sir surely you heard' 'I did not hear it brother' Then that man asked him 'Then sir perhaps you slept' 'No brother I was not sleeping' 'Then sir were you conscious' 'I was brother' Then that man said 'Then sir while conscious and awake you still did not see the great number of carts even five hundred carts that passed you by one after another nor heard the noise
Why sir your very robe is covered with their dust' And Alara Kalama replied saying 'So it is brother'
And to that man O Lord came the thought 'Marvellous it is most wonderful indeed it is the state of calmness wherein abide those who have gone forth from the world' And there arose in him great faith in Alara Kalama and he went his way
Now what do you think Pukkusa
What is more difficult to do more difficult to meet with  that a man while conscious and awake should not see a great number of carts even five hundred carts that passed him by one after another nor hear the noise or that one conscious and awake in the midst of a heavy rain with thunder rolling lightning flashing and thunderbolts crashing should neither see it nor hear the noise
What O Lord are five hundred carts  nay six seven eight nine hundred or a thousand or even hundreds of thousands of carts  compared with this
Now one time Pukkusa I was staying at Atuma and had my abode in a barn there
And at that time there was a heavy rain with thunder rolling lightning flashing and thunderbolts crashing
And two farmers who were brothers were killed close to the barn together with four oxen and a great crowd came forth from Atuma to the spot where they were killed
Now at that time Pukkusa I had come out of the barn and was walking up and down in thought before the door
And a certain man from the great crowd approached me respectfully greeted me and stood at one side
And I asked him 'Why brother has this great crowd gathered together' And he answered me 'Just now Lord there was a heavy rain with thunder rolling lightning flashing and thunderbolts crashing
And two farmers who were brothers were killed close by together with four oxen
It is because of this that the great crowd has gathered
But where Lord were you'
'I was here brother' 'Yet Lord did you not see it' 'I did not see it brother' 'But the noise Lord you surely heard' 'I did not hear it brother' Then that man asked me 'Then Lord perhaps you slept' 'No brother I was not sleeping' 'Then Lord you were conscious' 'I was brother' Then that man said 'Then Lord while conscious and awake in the midst of a heavy rain with thunder rolling lightning flashing and thunderbolts crashing you neither saw it nor heard the noise' And I answered him saying 'I did not brother'
And to that man Pukkusa came the thought 'Marvellous it is most wonderful indeed it is the state of calmness wherein abide those who have gone forth from the world' And there arose in him great faith in me and he respectfully saluted me and keeping his right side towards me he went his way
When this had been said Pukkusa of the Malla clan said to the Blessed One The faith Lord that I had in Alara Kalama I now scatter to the mighty wind I let it be carried away as by a flowing stream
Excellent O Lord most excellent O Lord
It is as if Lord one were to set upright what had been overthrown or to reveal what had been hidden or to show the path to one who had gone astray or to light a lamp in the darkness so that those having eyes might see  even so has the Blessed One set forth the Dhamma in many ways
And so O Lord I take my refuge in the Blessed One the Dhamma and the Community of Bhikkhus
May the Blessed One accept me as his disciple one who has taken refuge until the end of life
Then Pukkusa of the Malla clan spoke to a certain man saying Bring me at once friend two sets of goldenhued robes burnished and ready for wear And the man answered him So be it sir
And when the robes were brought Pukkusa of the Malla clan offered them to the Blessed One saying May the Blessed One O Lord out of compassion accept this from me And the Blessed One said Robe me then in one Pukkusa and in the other robe Ananda
So be it Lord And he thereupon robed the Blessed One in one and in the other he robed the Venerable Ananda
And then the Blessed One instructed Pukkusa of the Malla clan in the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened him
And after that Pukkusa rose from his seat respectfully saluted the Blessed One and keeping his right side towards him went his way
And soon after Pukkusa of the Malla clan had departed the Venerable Ananda arranged the set of goldenhued robes burnished and ready for wear about the body of the Blessed One
But when the set of robes was arranged upon the body of the Blessed One it became as though faded and its splendor dimmed
And the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One Marvellous it is O Lord most wonderful indeed it is how clear and radiant the skin of the Tathagata appears
This set of goldenhued robes burnished and ready for wear Lord now that it is arranged upon the body of the Blessed One seems to have become faded its splendor dimmed
It is so Ananda
There are two occasions Ananda when the skin of the Tathagata appears exceedingly clear and radiant
Which are these two
The night Ananda when the Tathagata becomes fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment and the night when the Tathagata comes to his final passing away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains
These Ananda are the two occasions on which the skin of the Tathagata appears exceedingly clear and radiant
And now today in the last watch of this very night Ananda in the Mallas' Sala Grove in the vicinity of Kusinara between two sala trees the Tathagata will come to his Parinibbana
So now Ananda let us go to the Kakuttha River
Then the Blessed One went to the Kakuttha River together with a great community of bhikkhus
And he went down into the water and bathed and drank
And coming forth from the water again he went to the Mango Grove and there spoke to the Venerable Cundaka saying Please fold my upper robe in four Cundaka and lay it down
I am weary and would rest awhile
So be it Lord And Cundaka folded the robe in four and laid it down
And the Blessed One lay down on his right side in the lion's posture resting one foot upon the other and so disposed himself mindfully and clearly comprehending with the time for rising held in mind
And the Venerable Cundaka sat down right in front of the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying It may come to pass Ananda that someone will cause remorse to Cunda the metalworker saying 'It is no gain to you friend Cunda but a loss that it was from you the Tathagata took his last alms meal and then came to his end' Then Ananda the remorse of Cunda should be dispelled after this manner 'It is a gain to you friend Cunda a blessing that the Tathagata took his last alms meal from you and then came to his end
For friend face to face with the Blessed One I have heard and learned There are two offerings of food which are of equal fruition of equal outcome exceeding in grandeur the fruition and result of any other offerings of food
Which two
The one partaken of by the Tathagata before becoming fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment and the one partaken of by the Tathagata before passing into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains
By his deed the worthy Cunda has accumulated merit which makes for long life beauty well being glory heavenly rebirth and sovereignty' Thus Ananda the remorse of Cunda the metalworker should be dispelled
Then the Blessed One understanding that matter breathed forth the solemn utterance
Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us cross to the farther bank of the Hiraññavati and go to the Mallas' Sala Grove in the vicinity of Kusinara
So be it Lord
And the Blessed One together with a large company of bhikkhus went to the further bank of the river Hiraññavati to the Sala Grove of the Mallas in the vicinity of Kusinara
And there he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying
Please Ananda prepare for me a couch between the twin sala trees with the head to the north
I am weary Ananda and want to lie down
So be it Lord And the Venerable Ananda did as the Blessed One asked him to do
Then the Blessed One lay down on his right side in the lion's posture resting one foot upon the other and so disposed himself mindfully and clearly comprehending
At that time the twin sala trees broke out in full bloom though it was not the season of flowering
And the blossoms rained upon the body of the Tathagata and dropped and scattered and were strewn upon it in worship of the Tathagata
And celestial mandarava flowers and heavenly sandalwood powder from the sky rained down upon the body of the Tathagata and dropped and scattered and were strewn upon it in worship of the Tathagata
And the sound of heavenly voices and heavenly instruments made music in the air out of reverence for the Tathagata
And the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Ananda the twin sala trees are in full bloom though it is not the season of flowering
And the blossoms rain upon the body of the Tathagata and drop and scatter and are strewn upon it in worship of the Tathagata
And celestial coral flowers and heavenly sandalwood powder from the sky rain down upon the body of the Tathagata and drop and scatter and are strewn upon it in worship of the Tathagata
And the sound of heavenly voices and heavenly instruments makes music in the air out of reverence for the Tathagata
Yet it is not thus Ananda that the Tathagata is respected venerated esteemed worshipped and honored in the highest degree
But Ananda whatever bhikkhu or bhikkhuni layman or laywoman abides by the Dhamma lives uprightly in the Dhamma walks in the way of the Dhamma it is by such a one that the Tathagata is respected venerated esteemed worshipped and honored in the highest degree
Therefore Ananda thus should you train yourselves 'We shall abide by the Dhamma live uprightly in the Dhamma walk in the way of the Dhamma' At that time the Venerable Upavana was standing before the Blessed One fanning him
And the Blessed One rebuked him saying Move aside bhikkhu do not stand in front of me
And to the Venerable Ananda came the thought This Venerable Upavana has been in attendance on the Blessed One for a long time closely associating with him and serving him
Yet now right at the end the Blessed One rebukes him
What now could be the reason what the cause for the Blessed One to rebuke the Venerable Upavana saying 'Move aside bhikkhu do not stand in front of me'
And the Venerable Ananda told his thought to the Blessed One
The Blessed One said Throughout the tenfold worldsystem Ananda there are hardly any of the deities that have not gathered together to look upon the Tathagata
For a distance of twelve yojanas around the Sala Grove of the Mallas in the vicinity of Kusinara there is not a spot that could be pricked with the tip of a hair that is not filled with powerful deities
And these deities Ananda are complaining 'From afar have we come to look upon the Tathagata
For rare in the world is the arising of Tathagatas Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones
And this day in the last watch of the night the Tathagata's Parinibbana will come about
But this bhikkhu of great powers has placed himself right in front of the Blessed One concealing him so that now at the very end we are prevented from looking upon him' Thus Ananda the deities complain
Of what kind of deities Lord is the Blessed One aware
There are deities Ananda in space and on earth who are earthlyminded with dishevelled hair they weep with uplifted arms they weep flinging themselves on the ground they roll from side to side lamenting 'Too soon has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana
Too soon has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana
Too soon will the Eye of the World vanish from sight'
But those deities who are freed from passion mindful and comprehending reflect in this way 'Impermanent are all compounded things
How could this be otherwise' Formerly Lord on leaving their quarters after the rains the bhikkhus would set forth to see the Tathagata and to us there was the gain and benefit of receiving and associating with those very revered bhikkhus who came to have audience with the Blessed One and to wait upon him
But Lord after the Blessed One has gone we shall no longer have that gain and benefit
There are four places Ananda that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence
What are the four
'Here the Tathagata was born' This Ananda is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence
'Here the Tathagata became fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment' This Ananda is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence
'Here the Tathagata set rolling the unexcelled Wheel of the Dhamma' This Ananda is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence
'Here the Tathagata passed away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains' This Ananda is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence
These Ananda are the four places that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence
And truly there will come to these places Ananda pious bhikkhus and bhikkhunis laymen and laywomen reflecting 'Here the Tathagata was born
Here the Tathagata became fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment
Here the Tathagata set rolling the unexcelled Wheel of the Dhamma
Here the Tathagata passed away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains'
And whoever Ananda should die on such a pilgrimage with his heart established in faith at the breaking up of the body after death will be reborn in a realm of heavenly happiness
Then the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One How Lord should we conduct ourselves towards women
Do not see them Ananda
But Lord if we do see them
Do not speak Ananda
But Lord if they should speak to us
Then Ananda you should establish mindfulness
Then the Venerable Ananda said How should we act Lord respecting the body of the Tathagata
Do not hinder yourselves Ananda to honor the body of the Tathagata
Rather you should strive Ananda and be zealous on your own behalf for your own good
Unflinchingly ardently and resolutely you should apply yourselves to your own good
For there are Ananda wise nobles wise brahmans and wise householders who are devoted to the Tathagata and it is they who will render the honor to the body of the Tathagata
Then the Venerable Ananda said But how Lord should they act respecting the body of the Tathagata
After the same manner Ananda as towards the body of a universal monarch
But how Lord do they act respecting the body of a universal monarch
The body of a universal monarch Ananda is first wrapped round with new linen and then with teased cotton wool and so it is done up to five hundred layers of linen and five hundred of cotton wool
When that is done the body of the universal monarch is placed in an iron oil vessel which is enclosed in another iron vessel a funeral pyre is built of all kinds of perfumed woods and so the body of the universal monarch is burned and at a crossroads a stupa is raised for the universal monarch
So it is done Ananda with the body of a universal monarch
And even Ananda as with the body of a universal monarch so should it be done with the body of the Tathagata and at a crossroads also a stupa should be raised for the Tathagata
And whosoever shall bring to that place garlands or incense or sandalpaste or pay reverence and whose mind becomes calm there  it will be to his well being and happiness for a long time
There are four persons Ananda who are worthy of a stupa
Who are those four
A Tathagata an Arahant a Fully Enlightened One is worthy of a stupa so also is a Paccekabuddha and a disciple of a Tathagata and a universal monarch

And why Ananda is a Tathagata an Arahant a Fully Enlightened One worthy of a stupa
Because Ananda at the thought 'This is the stupa of that Blessed One Arahant Fully Enlightened One' the hearts of many people will be calmed and made happy and so calmed and with their minds established in faith therein at the breaking up of the body after death they will be reborn in a realm of heavenly happiness
And so also at the thought 'This is the stupa of that Paccekabuddha' or 'This is the stupa of a disciple of that Tathagata Arahant Fully Enlightened One' or 'This is the stupa of that righteous monarch who ruled according to Dhamma'  the hearts of many people are calmed and made happy and so calmed and with their minds established in faith therein at the breaking up of the body after death they will be reborn in a realm of heavenly happiness
And it is because of this Ananda that these four persons are worthy of a stupa
Then the Venerable Ananda went into the vihara and leaned against the doorpost and wept I am still but a learner and still have to strive for my own perfection
But alas my Master who was so compassionate towards me is about to pass away
And the Blessed One spoke to the bhikkhus saying Where bhikkhus is Ananda
The Venerable Ananda Lord has gone into the vihara and there stands leaning against the door post and weeping 'I am still but a learner and still have to strive for my own perfection
But alas my Master who was so compassionate towards me is about to pass away' Then the Blessed One asked a certain bhikkhu to bring the Venerable Ananda to him saying Go bhikkhu and say to Ananda 'Friend Ananda the Master calls you' So be it Lord And that bhikkhu went and spoke to the Venerable Ananda as the Blessed One had asked him to
And the Venerable Ananda went to the Blessed One bowed down to him and sat down on one side
Then the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Enough Ananda
Do not grieve do not lament
For have I not taught from the very beginning that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change separation and severance
Of that which is born come into being compounded and subject to decay how can one say 'May it not come to dissolution'
There can be no such state of things
Now for a long time Ananda you have served the Tathagata with lovingkindness in deed word and thought graciously pleasantly with a whole heart and beyond measure
Great good have you gathered Ananda
Now you should put forth energy and soon you too will be free from the taints
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Bhikkhus the Blessed Ones Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of times past also had excellent and devoted attendant bhikkhus such as I have in Ananda
And so also bhikkhus will the Blessed Ones Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of times to come
Capable and judicious is Ananda bhikkhus for he knows the proper time for bhikkhus to have audience with the Tathagata and the time for bhikkhunis the time for laymen and for laywomen the time for kings and for ministers of state the time for teachers of other sects and for their followers
In Ananda bhikkhus are to be found four rare and superlative qualities
What are the four
If bhikkhus a company of bhikkhus should go to see Ananda they become joyful on seeing him and if he then speaks to them of the Dhamma they are made joyful by his discourse and when he becomes silent they are disappointed
So it is also when bhikkhunis laymen or laywomen go to see Ananda they become joyful on seeing him and if he then speaks to them of the Dhamma they are made joyful by his discourse and when he becomes silent they are disappointed
In a universal monarch bhikkhus are to be found four rare and superlative qualities
What are those four
If bhikkhus a company of nobles should go to see the universal monarch they become joyful on seeing him and if he then speaks they are made joyful by his talk and when he becomes silent they are disappointed
So it is also when a company of brahmans of householders or of ascetics goes to see a universal monarch
And in just the same way bhikkhus in Ananda are to be found these four rare and superlative qualities
When this had been said the Venerable Ananda spoke to the Blessed One saying Let it not be Lord that the Blessed One should pass away in this mean place this uncivilized township in the midst of the jungle a mere outpost of the province
There are great cities Lord such as Campa Rajagaha Savatthi Saketa Kosambi and Benares  let the Blessed One have his final passing away in one of those
For in those cities dwell many wealthy nobles and brahmans and householders who are devotees of the Tathagata and they will render due honor to the remains of the Tathagata
Do not say that Ananda
Do not say 'This mean place this uncivilized township in the midst of the jungle a mere outpost of the province' In times long past Ananda there was a king by the name of Maha Sudassana who was a universal monarch a king of righteousness a conqueror of the four quarters of the earth whose realm was established in security and who was endowed with the seven jewels
And that King Maha Sudassana Ananda had his royal residence here at Kusinara which was then called Kusavati and it extended twelve yojanas from east to west and seven from north to south
And mighty Ananda was Kusavati the capital prosperous and well populated much frequented by people and abundantly provided with food
Just as the royal residence of the deities Alakamanda is mighty prosperous and well populated much frequented by deities and abundantly provided with food so was the royal capital of Kusavati
Kusavati Ananda resounded unceasingly day and night with ten sounds  the trumpeting of elephants the neighing of horses the rattling of chariots the beating of drums and tabours music and song cheers the clapping of hands and cries of 'Eat drink and be merry'
Go now Ananda to Kusinara and announce to the Mallas 'Today Vasetthas in the last watch of the night the Tathagata's Parinibbana will take place
Approach O Vasetthas draw near
Do not be remorseful later at the thought In our township it was that the Tathagata's Parinibbana took place but we failed to see him at the end' So be it Lord And the Venerable Ananda prepared himself and taking bowl and robe went with a companion to Kusinara
Now at that time the Mallas had gathered in the council hall for some public business
And the Venerable Ananda approached them and announced Today Vasetthas in the last watch of the night the Tathagata's Parinibbana will take place
Approach Vasetthas draw near
Do not be remorseful later at the thought 'In our township it was that the Tathagata's Parinibbana took place but we failed to see him at the end' When they heard the Venerable Ananda speak these words the Mallas with their sons their wives and the wives of their sons were sorely grieved grieved at heart and afflicted and some with their hair all dishevelled with arms uplifted in despair wept flinging themselves on the ground they rolled from side to side lamenting Too soon has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana
Too soon has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana
Too soon will the Eye of the World vanish from sight
And thus afflicted and filled with grief the Mallas with their sons their wives and the wives of their sons went to the Sala Grove the recreation park of the Mallas to the place where the Venerable Ananda was
And the thought arose in the Venerable Ananda If I were to allow the Mallas of Kusinara to pay reverence to the Blessed One one by one the night will have given place to dawn before they are all presented to him
Therefore let me divide them up according to clan each family in a group and so present them to the Blessed One thus 'The Malla of such and such a name Lord with his wives and children his attendants and his friends pays homage at the feet of the Blessed One' And the Venerable Ananda divided the Mallas up according to clan each family in a group and presented them to the Blessed One
So it was that the Venerable Ananda caused the Mallas of Kusinara to be presented to the Blessed One by clans each family in a group even in the first watch of the night
Now at that time a wandering ascetic named Subhadda was dwelling at Kusinara
And Subhadda the wandering ascetic heard it said Today in the third watch of the night the Parinibbana of the ascetic Gotama will take place
And the thought arose in him I have heard it said by old and venerable wandering ascetics teachers of teachers that the arising of Tathagatas Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones is rare in the world
Yet this very day in the last watch of the night the Parinibbana of the ascetic Gotama will take place
Now there is in me a doubt but to this extent I have faith in the ascetic Gotama that he could so teach me the Dhamma as to remove that doubt
Then the wandering ascetic Subhadda went to the Sala Grove the recreation park of the Mallas and drew near to the Venerable Ananda and told the Venerable Ananda his thought
And he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Friend Ananda it would be good if I could be allowed into the presence of the ascetic Gotama
But the Venerable Ananda answered him saying Enough friend Subhadda
Do not trouble the Tathagata
The Blessed One is weary
Yet a second and a third time the wandering ascetic Subhadda made his request and a second and a third time the Venerable Ananda refused him
And the Blessed One heard the talk between them and he called the Venerable Ananda and said Stop Ananda
Do not refuse Subhadda
Subhadda Ananda may be allowed into the presence of the Tathagata
For whatever he will ask me he will ask for the sake of knowledge and not as an offence
And the answer I give him that he will readily understand
Thereupon the Venerable Ananda said to the wandering ascetic Subhadda Go then friend Subhadda the Blessed One gives you leave
Then the wandering ascetic Subhadda approached the Blessed One and saluted him courteously
And having exchanged with him pleasant and civil greetings the wandering ascetic Subhadda seated himself at one side and addressed the Blessed One saying There are Venerable Gotama ascetics and brahmans who are heads of great companies of disciples who have large retinues who are leaders of schools well known and renowned and held in high esteem by the multitude such teachers as Purana Kassapa Makkhali Gosala Ajita Kesakambali Pakudha Kaccayana Sañjaya Belatthaputta Nigantha Nataputta
Have all of these attained realization as each of them would have it believed or has none of them or is it that some have attained realization and others not
Enough Subhadda
Let it be as it may whether all of them have attained realization as each of them would have it believed or whether none of them has or whether some have attained realization and others not
I will teach you the Dhamma Subhadda listen and heed it well and I will speak
So be it Lord
And the Blessed One spoke saying In whatsoever Dhamma and Discipline Subhadda there is not found the Noble Eightfold Path neither is there found a true ascetic of the first second third or fourth degree of saintliness
But in whatsoever Dhamma and Discipline there is found the Noble Eightfold Path there is found a true ascetic of the first second third and fourth degrees of saintliness
Now in this Dhamma and Discipline Subhadda is found the Noble Eightfold Path and in it alone are also found true ascetics of the first second third and fourth degrees of saintliness
Devoid of true ascetics are the systems of other teachers
But if Subhadda the bhikkhus live righteously the world will not be destitute of arahats
In age but twentynine was I Subhadda
And there is none of the second degree nor of the third degree nor of the fourth degree of saintliness
Devoid of true ascetics are the systems of other teachers
But if Subhadda the bhikkhus live righteously the world will not be destitute of arahats
When this was said the wandering ascetic Subhadda spoke to the Blessed One saying Excellent O Lord most excellent O Lord
It is as if Lord one were to set upright what had been overthrown or to reveal what had been hidden or to show the path to one who had gone astray or to light a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes might see  even so has the Blessed One set forth the Dhamma in many ways
And so O Lord I take my refuge in the Blessed One the Dhamma and the Community of Bhikkhus
May I receive from the Blessed One admission to the Order and also the higher ordination
Whoever Subhadda having been formerly a follower of another creed wishes to receive admission and higher ordination in this Dhamma and Discipline remains on probation for a period of four months
At the end of those four months if the bhikkhus are satisfied with him they grant him admission and higher ordination as a bhikkhu
Yet in this matter I recognize differences of personalities
If O Lord whoever having been formerly a follower of another creed wishes to receive admission and higher ordination in this Dhamma and Discipline remains on probation for a period of four months and at the end of those four months if the bhikkhus are satisfied with him they grant him admission and higher ordination as a bhikkhu  then I will remain on probation for a period of four years
And at the end of those four years if the bhikkhus are satisfied with me let them grant me admission and higher ordination as a bhikkhu
But the Blessed One called the Venerable Ananda and said to him Ananda let Subhadda be given admission into the Order And the Venerable Ananda replied So be it Lord
Then the wandering ascetic Subhadda said to the Venerable Ananda It is a gain to you friend Ananda a blessing that in the presence of the Master himself you have received the sprinkling of ordination as a disciple
So it came about that the wandering ascetic Subhadda in the presence of the Blessed One received admission and higher ordination
And from the time of his ordination the Venerable Subhadda remained alone secluded heedful ardent and resolute
And before long he attained to the goal for which a worthy man goes forth rightly from home to homelessness the supreme goal of the holy life and having by himself realized it with higher knowledge he dwelt therein
He knew Destroyed is birth the higher life is fulfilled nothing more is to be done and beyond this life nothing more remains And the Venerable Subhadda became yet another among the arahats and he was the last disciple converted by the Blessed One himself
Now the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying It may be Ananda that to some among you the thought will come 'Ended is the word of the Master we have a Master no longer' But it should not Ananda be so considered
For that which I have proclaimed and made known as the Dhamma and the Discipline that shall be your Master when I am gone
And Ananda whereas now the bhikkhus address one another as 'friend' let it not be so when I am gone
The senior bhikkhus Ananda may address the junior ones by their name their family name or as 'friend' but the junior bhikkhus should address the senior ones as 'venerable sir' or 'your reverence'
If it is desired Ananda the Sangha may when I am gone abolish the lesser and minor rules
Ananda when I am gone let the higher penalty be imposed upon the bhikkhu Channa
But what Lord is the higher penalty
The bhikkhu Channa Ananda may say what he will but the bhikkhus should neither converse with him nor exhort him nor admonish him
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying It may be bhikkhus that one of you is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha the Dhamma or the Sangha the path or the practice
Then question bhikkhus
Do not be given to remorse later on with the thought 'The Master was with us face to face yet face to face we failed to ask him' But when this was said the bhikkhus were silent
And yet a second and a third time the Blessed One said to them It may be bhikkhus that one of you is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha the Dhamma or the Sangha the path or the practice
Then question bhikkhus
Do not be given to remorse later on with the thought 'The Master was with us face to face yet face to face we failed to ask him' And for a second and a third time the bhikkhus were silent
Then the Blessed One said to them It may be bhikkhus out of respect for the Master that you ask no questions
Then bhikkhus let friend communicate it to friend Yet still the bhikkhus were silent
And the Venerable Ananda spoke to the Blessed One saying Marvellous it is O Lord most wonderful it is
This faith I have in the community of bhikkhus that not even one bhikkhu is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha the Dhamma or the Sangha the path or the practice
Out of faith Ananda you speak thus
But here Ananda the Tathagata knows for certain that among this community of bhikkhus there is not even one bhikkhu who is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha the Dhamma or the Sangha the path or the practice
For Ananda among these five hundred bhikkhus even the lowest is a streamenterer secure from downfall assured and bound for enlightenment
And the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Behold now bhikkhus I exhort you All compounded things are subject to vanish
Strive with earnestness
This was the last word of the Tathagata
And the Blessed One entered the first jhana
Rising from the first jhana he entered the second jhana
Rising from the second jhana he entered the third jhana
Rising from the third jhana he entered the fourth jhana
And rising out of the fourth jhana he entered the sphere of infinite space
Rising from the attainment of the sphere of infinite space he entered the sphere of infinite consciousness
Rising from the attainment of the sphere of infinite consciousness he entered the sphere of nothingness
Rising from the attainment of the sphere of nothingness he entered the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception
And rising out of the attainment of the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception he attained to the cessation of perception and feeling
And the Venerable Ananda spoke to the Venerable Anuruddha saying Venerable Anuruddha the Blessed One has passed away
No friend Ananda the Blessed One has not passed away
He has entered the state of the cessation of perception and feeling
Then the Blessed One rising from the cessation of perception and feeling entered the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception
Rising from the attainment of the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception he entered the sphere of nothingness
Rising from the attainment of the sphere of nothingness he entered the sphere of infinite consciousness
Rising from the attainment of the sphere of infinite consciousness he entered the sphere of infinite space
Rising from the attainment of the sphere of infinite space he entered the fourth jhana
Rising from the fourth jhana he entered the third jhana
Rising from the third jhana he entered the second jhana
Rising from the second jhana he entered the first jhana
Rising from the first jhana he entered the second jhana
Rising from the second jhana he entered the third jhana
Rising from the third jhana he entered the fourth jhana
And rising from the fourth jhana the Blessed One immediately passed away
And when the Blessed One had passed away simultaneously with his Parinibbana there came a tremendous earthquake dreadful and astounding and the thunders rolled across the heavens
And when the Blessed One had passed away simultaneously with his Parinibbana Brahma Sahampati spoke this stanza
And when the Blessed One had passed away simultaneously with his Parinibbana Sakka king of the gods spoke this stanza
And when the Blessed One had passed away simultaneously with his Parinibbana the Venerable Anuruddha spoke this stanza
And when the Blessed One had passed away simultaneously with his Parinibbana the Venerable Ananda spoke this stanza
Then when the Blessed One had passed away some bhikkhus not yet freed from passion lifted up their arms and wept and some flinging themselves on the ground rolled from side to side and wept lamenting Too soon has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana
Too soon has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana
Too soon has the Eye of the World vanished from sight
But the bhikkhus who were freed from passion mindful and clearly comprehending reflected in this way Impermanent are all compounded things
How could this be otherwise
And the Venerable Anuruddha addressed the bhikkhus saying Enough friends
Do not grieve do not lament
For has not the Blessed One declared that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change separation and severance
Of that which is born come into being compounded and subject to decay how can one say 'May it not come to dissolution'
The deities friends are aggrieved
But venerable sir of what deities is the Venerable Anuruddha aware
There are deities friend Ananda in space and on the earth who are earthlyminded with dishevelled hair they weep with uplifted arms they weep flinging themselves on the ground they roll from side to side lamenting 'Too soon has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana
Too soon has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana
Too soon has the Eye of the World vanished from sight' But those deities who are freed from passion mindful and clearly comprehending reflect in this way 'Impermanent are all compounded things
How could this be otherwise' Now the Venerable Anuruddha and the Venerable Ananda spent the rest of the night in talking on the Dhamma
Then the Venerable Anuruddha spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Go now friend Ananda to Kusinara and announce to the Mallas 'The Blessed One Vasetthas has passed away
Do now as seems fitting to you' So be it venerable sir And the Venerable Ananda prepared himself in the forenoon and taking bowl and robe went with a companion into Kusinara
At that time the Mallas of Kusinara had gathered in the council hall to consider that very matter
And the Venerable Ananda approached them and announced The Blessed One Vasetthas has passed away
Do now as seems fitting to you
And when they heard the Venerable Ananda speak these words the Mallas with their sons their wives and the wives of their sons were sorely grieved grieved at heart and afflicted and some with their hair all dishevelled with arms upraised in despair wept flinging themselves on the ground they rolled from side to side lamenting Too soon has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana
Too soon has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana
Too soon has the Eye of the World vanished from sight
Then the Mallas of Kusinara gave orders to their men saying Gather now all the perfumes flowergarlands and musicians even all that are in Kusinara And the Mallas with the perfumes the flowergarlands and the musicians and with five hundred sets of clothing went to the Sala Grove the recreation park of the Mallas and approached the body of the Blessed One
And having approached they paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and erecting canopies and pavilions they spent the day showing respect honor and veneration to the body of the Blessed One
And then the thought came to them Now the day is too far spent for us to cremate the body of the Blessed One
Tomorrow we will do it
And for the second day and a third fourth fifth and sixth day they paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and erecting canopies and pavilions they spent the day showing respect honor and veneration to the body of the Blessed One
But on the seventh day the thought came to them We have paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and have shown respect honor and veneration let us now carry the body of the Blessed One southward to the southern part of the town and beyond and let us there cremate the body of the Blessed One south of the town
And eight Mallas of the foremost families bathed from the crown of their heads and wearing new clothes with the thought We will lift up the body of the Blessed One tried to do so but they could not
Then the Mallas spoke to the Venerable Anuruddha saying What is the cause Venerable Anuruddha what is the reason that these eight Mallas of the foremost families bathed from the crown of their heads and wearing new clothes with the thought 'We will lift up the body of the Blessed One' try to do so but cannot
You Vasetthas have one purpose the deities have another
Then what venerable sir is the purpose of the deities
Your purpose Vasetthas is this 'We have paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and have shown respect honor and veneration let us now carry the body of the Blessed One southward to the southern part of the town and beyond and let us there cremate the body of the Blessed One south of the town' But the purpose of the deities Vasetthas is this 'We have paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with heavenly dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and have shown respect honor and veneration let us now carry the body of the Blessed One northward to the northern part of the town and having carried it through the northern gate let us go through the center of the town and then eastward to the east of the town and having passed through the east gate let us carry it to the cetiya of the Mallas Makutabandhana and there let us cremate the body of the Blessed One' As the deities wish venerable sir so let it be
Thereupon the whole of Kusinara even to the dust heaps and rubbish heaps became covered kneedeep in mandarava flowers
And homage was paid to the body of the Blessed One by the deities as well as the Mallas of Kusinara
With dance song music flowergarlands and perfume both divine and human respect honor and veneration were shown
And they carried the body of the Blessed One northward to the northern part of the town and having carried it through the northern gate they went through the center of the town and then eastward to the east of the town and having passed through the east gate they carried the body of the Blessed One to the cetiya of the Mallas Makutabandhana and there laid it down
Then the Mallas of Kusinara spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying How should we act Venerable Ananda respecting the body of the Tathagata
After the same manner Vasetthas as towards the body of a universal monarch
But how venerable Ananda do they act respecting the body of a universal monarch
The body of a universal monarch Vasetthas is first wrapped round with new linen and then with teased cotton wool
And again it is wrapped round with new linen and again with teased cotton wool and so it is done up to five hundred layers of linen and five hundred of cotton wool
When that is done the body of the universal monarch is placed in an iron oilvessel which is enclosed in another iron vessel and a funeral pyre is built of all kinds of perfumed woods and so the body of the universal monarch is burned
And at a crossroads a stupa is raised for the universal monarch
So it is done Vasetthas with the body of a universal monarch
And even Vasetthas as with the body of a universal monarch so should it be done with the body of the Tathagata and at a crossroads also a stupa should be raised for the Tathagata
And whoever shall bring to that place garlands or incense or sandalwood paste or pay reverence and whose mind becomes calm there  it will be to his well being and happiness for a long time
Then the Mallas gave orders to their men saying Gather now all the teased cotton wool of the Mallas And the Mallas of Kusinara wrapped the body of the Blessed One round with new linen and then with teased cotton wool
And again they wrapped it round with new linen and again with teased cotton wool and so it was done up to five hundred layers of linen and five hundred of cotton wool
When that was done they placed the body of the Blessed One in an iron oilvessel which was enclosed in another iron vessel and they built a funeral pyre of all kinds of perfumed woods and upon it they laid the body of the Blessed One
Now at that time the Venerable Maha Kassapa was journeying from Pava to Kusinara together with a large company of five hundred bhikkhus
And on the way the Venerable Maha Kassapa went aside from the highway and sat down at the foot of a tree
And a certain Ajivaka came by on his way to Pava and he had taken a mandarava flower from Kusinara
And the Venerable Maha Kassapa saw the Ajivaka coming from a distance and as he drew close he spoke to him saying Do you know friend anything of our Master
Yes friend I know
It is now seven days since the ascetic Gotama passed away
From there I have brought this mandarava flower
Thereupon some bhikkhus not yet freed from passion lifted up their arms and wept and some flinging themselves on the ground rolled from side to side and wept lamenting Too soon has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana
Too soon has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana
Too soon has the Eye of the World vanished from sight
Now at that time one Subhadda who had renounced only in his old age was seated in the assembly
And he addressed the bhikkhus saying Enough friends
Do not grieve do not lament
We are well rid of that great ascetic
Too long friends have we been oppressed by his saying 'This is fitting for you that is not fitting for you' Now we shall be able to do as we wish and what we do not wish that we shall not do
But the Venerable Maha Kassapa addressed the bhikkhus saying Enough friends
Do not grieve do not lament
For has not the Blessed One declared that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change separation and severance
Of that which is born come into being compounded and subject to decay how can one say 'May it not come to dissolution'
Now at that time four Mallas of the foremost families bathed from the crown of their heads and wearing new clothes with the thought We will set alight the Blessed One's pyre tried to do so but they could not
And the Mallas spoke to the Venerable Anuruddha saying What is the cause Venerable Anuruddha what is the reason that these four Mallas of the foremost families bathed from the crown of their heads and wearing new clothes with the thought We will set alight the Blessed One's pyre' try to do so but cannot
You Vasetthas have one purpose the deities have another
Then what venerable sir is the purpose of the deities
The purpose of the deities Vasetthas is this 'The Venerable Maha Kassapa is on his way from Pava to Kusinara together with a large company of five hundred bhikkhus
Let not the Blessed One's pyre be set alight until the Venerable Maha Kassapa has paid homage at the feet of the Blessed One' As the deities wish venerable sir so let it be
And the Venerable Maha Kassapa approached the pyre of the Blessed One at the cetiya of the Mallas Makutabandhana in Kusinara
And he arranged his upper robe on one shoulder and with his clasped hands raised in salutation he walked three times round the pyre keeping his right side towards the Blessed One's body and he paid homage at the feet of the Blessed One
And even so did the five hundred bhikkhus
And when homage had been paid by the Venerable Maha Kassapa and the five hundred bhikkhus the pyre of the Blessed One burst into flame by itself
And it came about that when the body of the Blessed One had been burned no ashes or particles were to be seen of what had been skin tissue flesh sinews and fluid only bones remained
Just as when ghee or oil is burned it leaves no particles or ashes behind even so when the body of the Blessed One had been burned no ashes or particles were to be seen of what had been skin tissue flesh sinews and fluid only bones remained
And of the five hundred linen wrappings only two were not consumed the innermost and the outermost
And when the body of the Blessed One had been burned water rained down from heaven and extinguished the pyre of the Blessed One and from the sala trees water came forth and the Mallas of Kusinara brought water scented with many kinds of perfumes and they too extinguished the pyre of the Blessed One
And the Mallas of Kusinara laid the relics of the Blessed One in their council hall and surrounded them with a latticework of spears and encircled them with a fence of bows and there for seven days they paid homage to the relics of the Blessed One with dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and showed respect honor and veneration to the relics of the Blessed One
Then the king of Magadha Ajatasattu son of the Videhi queen came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed away
And he sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara saying The Blessed One was of the warrior caste and I am too
I am worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One
I will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honor
And the Licchavis of Vesali came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed away
And they sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara saying The Blessed One was of the warrior caste and we are too
We are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One
We will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honor
And the Sakyas of Kapilavatthu came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed away
And they sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara saying The Blessed One was the greatest of our clan
We are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One
We will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honor
And the Bulis of Allakappa came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed away
And they sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara saying The Blessed One was of the warrior caste and we are too
We are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One
We will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honor
And the Kolis of Ramagama came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed away
And they sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara saying The Blessed One was of the warrior caste and we are too
We are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One
We will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honor
And the Vethadipa brahman came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed away
And he sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara saying The Blessed One was of the warrior caste and I am a brahman
I am worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One
I will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honor
And the Mallas of Pava came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed away
And they sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara saying The Blessed One was of the warrior caste and we are too
We are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One
We will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honor
But when they heard these words the Mallas of Kusinara addressed the assembly saying The Blessed One has passed away in our township
We shall not part with any portion of the relics of the Blessed One Then the brahman Dona spoke to the assembly saying
So be it brahman
Divide the relics into eight equal portions yourself
And the brahman Dona said to the assembly So be it sirs And he divided justly into eight equal portions the relics of the Blessed One and having done so he addressed the assembly saying Let this urn sirs be given to me
Over this urn I will erect a stupa and in its honor I will hold a festival And the urn was given to the brahman Dona
Then the Moriyas of Pipphalivana came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed away
And they sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara saying The Blessed One was of the warrior caste and we are too
We are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One
We will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honor
There is no portion of the relics of the Blessed One remaining the relics of the Blessed One have been divided
But take from here the ashes And they took from there the ashes
And the king of Magadha Ajatasattu son of the Videhi queen erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Rajagaha and in their honor held a festival
The Licchavis of Vesali erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Vesali and in their honor held a festival
The Sakyas of Kapilavatthu erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Kapilavatthu and in their honor held a festival
The Bulis of Allakappa erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Allakappa and in their honor held a festival
The Kolis of Ramagama erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Ramagama and in their honor held a festival
The Vethadipa brahman erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Vethadipa and in their honor held a festival
The Mallas of Pava erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Pava and in their honor held a festival
The Mallas of Kusinara erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Kusinara and in their honor held a festival
The brahman Dona erected a stupa over the urn and in its honor held a festival
And the Moriyas of Pipphalivana erected a stupa over the ashes at Pipphalivana and in their honor held a festival
So it came about that there were eight stupas for the relics a ninth for the urn and a tenth for the ashes
And thus it was in the days of old
Comy He may stay alive completing the life span pertaining to men at the given time
Kappavasesa 'in excess' ie more or less above the hundred years said to be the normally highest life expectation
Among the numerous meanings of the word kappa there is in fact that of time in general and not only the duration of an aeon but the meaning life span seems to have been ascribed to it only in this passage
Also the meaning in excess for avasesa is unusual
The four constituents of psychic power are concentration due to zeal energy purity of mind and investigation
The commentary to our text gives three alternative explanations the flesh from a single firstborn pig neither too young nor too old which had come to hand naturally ie without intentional killing a preparation of soft boiled rice cooked with the five cowproducts a kind of alchemistic elixir
Dhammapala in his commentary to Udana VIII gives in addition young bamboo shoots trampled by pigs
The goal of Buddhist practice nibbana is said to be totally uncaused and right there is a paradox
If the goal is uncaused how can a path of practice  which is causal by nature  bring it about
This is an ancient question
The Milindapañha a set of dialogues composed near the start of the common era reports an exchange where King Milinda challenges a monk Nagasena with precisely this question
Nagasena replies with an analogy
The path of practice doesn't cause nibbana he says
It simply takes you there just as a road to a mountain doesn't cause the mountain to come into being but simply leads you to where it is
Nagasena's reply though apt didn't really settle the issue within the Buddhist tradition
Over the years many schools of meditation have taught that mental fabrications simply get in the way of a goal that's uncaused and unfabricated
Only by doing nothing at all and thus not fabricating anything in the mind they say will the unfabricated shine forth
This view is based on a very simplistic understanding of fabricated reality seeing causality as linear and totally predictable X causes Y which causes Z and so on with no effects turning around to condition their causes and no possible way of using causality to escape from the causal network
However one of the many things the Buddha discovered in the course of his awakening was that causality is not linear
The experience of the present is shaped both by actions in the present and by actions in the past
Actions in the present shape both the present and the future
The results of past and present actions continually interact
Thus there is always room for new input into the system which gives scope for free will
There is also room for the many feedback loops that make experience so thoroughly complex and that are so intriguingly described in chaos theory
Reality doesn't resemble a simple line or circle
It's more like the bizarre trajectories of a strange attractor or a Mandelbrot set
Because there are many similarities between chaos theory and Buddhist explanations of causality it seems legitimate to explore those similarities to see what light chaos theory can throw on the issue of how a causal path of practice can lead to an uncaused goal
This is not to equate Buddhism with chaos theory or to engage in pseudoscience
It's simply a search for similes to clear up an apparent conflict in the Buddha's teaching
And it so happens that one of the discoveries of nonlinear math  the basis for chaos theory  throws light on just this issue
In the th century the French mathematician JulesHenri Poincar discovered that in any complex physical system there are points he called resonances
If the forces governing the system are described as mathematical equations the resonances are the points where the equations intersect in such a way that one of the members is divided by zero
This of course produces an undefined result which means that if an object within the system strayed into a resonance point it would no longer be defined by the causal network determining the system
It would be set free
In actual practice it's very rare for an object to hit a resonance point
The equations describing the points immediately around a resonance tend to deflect any incoming object from entering the resonance unless the object is on a precise path to the resonance's very heart
Still it doesn't take too much complexity to create resonances  Poincar discovered them while calculating the gravitational interactions among three bodies the earth the sun and the moon
The more complex the system the greater the number of resonances and the greater the likelihood that objects will stray into them
It's no wonder that meteors on a large scale and electrons on a small scale occasionally wander right into a resonance in a gravitational or electronic field and thus to the freedom of total unpredictability
This is why meteors sometimes leave the solar system and why your computer occasionally freezes for no apparent reason
It's also why strange things could happen someday to the beating of your heart
If we were to apply this analogy to the Buddhist path the system we're in is samsara the round of rebirth
Its resonances would be what the texts called nonfashioning the opening to the uncaused nibbana
The wall of resistant forces around the resonances would correspond to pain stress and attachment
To allow yourself to be repelled by stress or deflected by attachment no matter how subtle would be like approaching a resonance but then veering off to another part of the system
But to focus directly on analyzing stress and attachment and deconstructing their causes would be like getting on an undeflected trajectory right into the resonance and finding total undefined freedom
This of course is simply an analogy
But it's a fruitful one for showing that there is nothing illogical in actively mastering the processes of mental fabrication and causality for the sake of going beyond fabrication beyond cause and effect
At the same time it gives a hint as to why a path of total inaction would not lead to the unfabricated
If you simply sit still within the system of causality you'll never get near the resonances where true nonfashioning lies
You'll keep floating around in samsara
But if you take aim at stress and clinging and work to take them apart you'll be able to break through to the point where the present moment gets divided by zero in the mind
As my teacher once said If you can't control your mouth there's no way you can hope to control your mind' This is why right speech is so important in daytoday practice
Right speech explained in negative terms means avoiding four types of harmful speech lies divisive speech harsh speech and idle chatter
Notice the focus on intent this is where the practice of right speech intersects with the training of the mind
Before you speak you focus on why you want to speak
This helps get you in touch with all the machinations taking place in the committee of voices running your mind
If you see any unskillful motives lurking behind the committee's decisions you veto them
As a result you become more aware of yourself more honest with yourself more firm with yourself
You also save yourself from saying things that you'll later regret
In this way you strengthen qualities of mind that will be helpful in meditation at the same time avoiding any potentially painful memories that would get in the way of being attentive to the present moment when the time comes to meditate
In positive terms right speech means speaking in ways that are trustworthy harmonious comforting and worth taking to heart
When you make a practice of these positive forms of right speech your words become a gift to others
In response other people will start listening more to what you say and will be more likely to respond in kind
This gives you a sense of the power of your actions the way you act in the present moment does shape the world of your experience
You don't need to be a victim of past events
For many of us the most difficult part of practicing right speech lies in how we express our sense of humor
Especially here in America we're used to getting laughs with exaggeration sarcasm group stereotypes and pure silliness  all classic examples of wrong speech
If people get used to these sorts of careless humor they stop listening carefully to what we say
In this way we cheapen our own discourse
Actually there's enough irony in the state of the world that we don't need to exaggerate or be sarcastic
The greatest humorists are the ones who simply make us look directly at the way things are
Expressing our humor in ways that are truthful useful and wise may require thought and effort but when we master this sort of wit we find that the effort is well spent
We've sharpened our own minds and have improved our verbal environment
In this way even our jokes become part of our practice an opportunity to develop positive qualities of mind and to offer something of intelligent value to the people around us
So pay close attention to what you say  and to why you say it
When you do you'll discover that an open mouth doesn't have to be a mistake
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Exalted One was travelling along the highway between Rājagaha and Nālandā together with a great company of bhikkhus with about five hundred bhikkhus
At the same time the wanderer Suppiya was also travelling along the highway between Rājagaha and Nālandā together with his pupil the youth Brahmadatta
Along the way the wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha
But his pupil the youth Brahmadatta spoke in many ways in praise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha
Thus these two teacher and pupil followed closely behind the Exalted One and the company of bhikkhus making assertions in direct contradiction to each other
Then the Exalted One together with the company of bhikkhus entered the royal resthouse in the Ambalaṭṭhika garden in order to pass the night
The wanderer Suppiya together with his pupil the youth Brahmadatta also entered the royal resthouse in the Ambalaṭṭhika garden in order to pass the night
There too the wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha while his pupil Brahmadatta spoke in many ways in their praise
Thus these two teacher and pupil dwelt together making assertions in direct contradiction to each other
When dawn broke a number of bhikkhus after rising assembled in the pavilion
As they sat together the following conversation sprang up among them It is wonderful and marvellous friends how the Exalted One he who knows and sees the Worthy One the perfectly enlightened Buddha has so thoroughly penetrated the diversity in the dispositions of beings
For this wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha while his own pupil the youth Brahmadatta spoke in many ways in their praise
These two teacher and pupil followed closely behind the Exalted One and the company of bhikkhus making assertions in direct contradiction to each other
Then the Exalted One realizing the turn their discussion had taken entered the pavilion sat down on the prepared seat and addressed the bhikkhus What kind of discussion were you holding just now bhikkhus
What was the subject of your conversation
The bhikkhus replied When dawn had broken Lord after rising we assembled in the pavilion
As we sat here the following conversation sprang up among us 'It is wonderful and marvellous friends how the Exalted One he who knows and sees the Worthy One the perfectly enlightened Buddha has so thoroughly penetrated the diversity in the dispositions of beings
For this wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha while his own pupil the youth Brahmadatta spoke in many ways in their praise
These two teacher and pupil followed closely behind the Exalted One and the company of bhikkhus making assertions in direct contradiction to each other' This Lord was the conversation we were having when the Exalted One arrived
If bhikkhus others speak in dispraise of me or in dispraise of the Dhamma or in dispraise of the Sangha you should not give way to resentment displeasure or animosity against them in your heart
For if you were to become angry or upset in such a situation you would only be creating an obstacle for yourselves
If you were to become angry or upset when others speak in dispraise of us would you be able to recognize whether their statements are rightly or wrongly spoken
Certainly not Lord
If bhikkhus others speak in dispraise of me or in dispraise of the Dhamma or in dispraise of the Sangha you should unravel what is false and point it out as false saying 'For such and such a reason this is false this is untrue there is no such thing in us this is not found among us'
And if bhikkhus others speak in praise of me or in praise of the Dhamma or in praise of the Sangha you should not give way to jubilation joy and exultation in your heart
For if you were to become jubilant joyful and exultant in such a situation you would only be creating an obstacle for yourselves
If others speak in praise of me or in praise of the Dhamma or in praise of the Sangha you should acknowledge what is fact as fact saying 'For such and such a reason this is a fact this is true there is such a thing in us this is found among us'
It is bhikkhus only to trifling and insignificant matters to the minor details of mere moral virtue that a worldling would refer when speaking in praise of the Tathāgata
And what are those trifling and insignificant matters those minor details of mere moral virtue to which he would refer
'Having abandoned the destruction of life the recluse Gotama abstains from the destruction of life
He has laid aside the rod and the sword and dwells conscientious full of kindness compassionate for the welfare of all living beings' It is in this way bhikkhus that the worldling would speak when speaking in praise of the Tathāgata
Or he might say 'Having abandoned taking what is not given the recluse Gotama abstains from taking what is not given
Accepting and expecting only what is given he dwells in honesty and rectitude of heart'

Rejoicing delighting and exulting in concord he speaks only words that are conducive to concord'

Or he might say 'The recluse Gotama abstains from damaging seed and plant life

These bhikkhus are those trifling and insignificant matters those minor details of mere moral virtue that a worldling would refer to when speaking in praise of the Tathāgata
There are bhikkhus other dhammas deep difficult to see difficult to understand peaceful and sublime beyond the sphere of reasoning subtle comprehensible only to the wise which the Tathāgata having realized for himself with direct knowledge propounds to others and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speak
And what are these dhammas
There are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are speculators about the past who hold settled views about the past and who on eighteen grounds assert various conceptual theorems referring to the past
And owing to what with reference to what do these honorable recluses and brahmins frame their speculations
There are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are eternalists and who on four grounds proclaim the self and the world to be eternal
And owing to what with reference to what do these honorable recluses and brahmins proclaim their views
In the first case bhikkhus some recluse or a brahmin by means of ardor endeavor application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his numerous past lives that is one birth two three four or five births ten twenty thirty forty or fifty births a hundred a thousand or a hundred thousand births many hundreds of births many thousands of births many hundreds of thousands of births
'Then I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such my span of life
Passing away thence I rearose there
There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such my span of life
Passing away thence I rearose here' Thus he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their details
He speaks thus 'The self and the world are eternal barren steadfast as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar
And though these beings roam and wander pass away and rearise yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself
What is the reason
Because I by means of ardor endeavor application diligence and right reflection attain to such a degree of mental concentration that with my mind thus concentrated I recollect my numerous past lives in their modes and their details
For this reason I know this the self and the world are eternal barren steadfast as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar
And though these beings roam and wander pass away and rearise yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself'
This bhikkhus is the first case
In the second case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins eternalists who proclaim the self and the world to be eternal
Herein bhikkhus a certain recluse or brahmin by means of ardor endeavor application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his numerous past lives that is one aeon of worldcontraction and expansion throughout two three four five or ten aeons of worldcontraction and expansion
'Then I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such my span of life
Passing away thence I rearose there
There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such my span of life
Passing away thence I rearose here' Thus he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their details
He speaks thus 'The self and the world are eternal barren steadfast as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar
And though these beings roam and wander pass away and rearise yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself
What is the reason
This bhikkhus is the second case
In the third case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins eternalists who proclaim the self and the world to be eternal
Herein bhikkhus some recluse or brahmin by means of ardor endeavor application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his numerous past lives that is ten aeons of worldcontraction and expansion throughout twenty thirty or forty aeons of worldcontraction and expansion Thus he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their details
He speaks thus 'The self and the world are eternal barren steadfast as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar
And though these beings roam and wander pass away and rearise yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself
What is the reason
This bhikkhus is the third case
In the fourth case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins eternalists who proclaim the self and the world to be eternal
Herein bhikkhus some recluse or brahmin is a rationalist an investigator
He declares his view  hammered out by reason deduced from his investigations following his own flight of thought  thus The self and the world are eternal barren steadfast as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar
And though these beings roam and wander pass away and rearise yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itself'
This bhikkhus is the fourth case
It is on these four grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are eternalists proclaim the self and the world to be eternal
Whatever recluses and brahmins there may be who proclaim the self and the world to be eternal all of them do so on these four grounds or on a certain one of them
Outside of these there is none
This bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands
And he understands 'These standpoints thus assumed and thus misapprehended lead to such a future destination to such a state in the world beyond' He understands as well what transcends this yet even that understanding he does not misapprehend
And because he is free from misapprehension he has realized within himself the state of perfect peace
Having understood as they really are the origin and the passing away of feelings their satisfaction their unsatisfactoriness and the escape from them the Tathāgata bhikkhus is emancipated through nonclinging
These are those dhammas bhikkhus that are deep difficult to see difficult to understand peaceful and sublime beyond the sphere of reasoning subtle comprehensible only to the wise which the Tathāgata having realized for himself with direct knowledge propounds to others and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speak
There are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are eternalists in regard to some things and noneternalists in regard to other things and who on four grounds proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternal
And owing to what with reference to what do these honorable recluses and brahmins proclaim their views
There comes a time bhikkhus when after the lapse of a long period this world contracts
While the world is contracting beings for the most part are reborn in the bhassara Brahmaworld
There they dwell mindmade feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the air abiding in glory
And they continue thus for a long long period of time
But sooner or later bhikkhus after the lapse of a long period there comes a time when this world begins to expand once again
While the world is expanding an empty palace of Brahmā appears
Then a certain being due to the exhaustion of his lifespan or the exhaustion of his merit passes away from the bhassara plane and rearises in the empty palace of Brahmā
There he dwells mind made feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the air abiding in glory
And he continues thus for a long long period of time
Then as a result of dwelling there all alone for so long a time there arises in him dissatisfaction and agitation 'Oh that other beings might come to this place' Just at that moment due to the exhaustion of their lifespan or the exhaustion of their merit certain other beings pass away from the bhassara plane and rearise in the palace of Brahmā in companionship with him
There they dwell mindmade feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the air abiding in glory
And they continue thus for a long long period of time
Thereupon the being who rearose there first thinks to himself 'I am Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Vanquisher the Unvanquished the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord the Maker and Creator the Supreme Being the Ordainer the Almighty the Father of all that are and are to be
And these beings have been created by me
What is the reason
Because first I made the wish Oh that other beings might come to this place And after I made this resolution now these beings have come'
And the beings who rearose there after him also think 'This must be Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Vanquisher the Unvanquished the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord the Maker and Creator the Supreme Being the Ordainer the Almighty the Father of all that are and are to be
And we have been created by him
What is the reason
Because we see that he was here first and we appeared here after him'
Herein bhikkhus the being who rearose there first possesses longer life greater beauty and greater authority than the beings who rearose there after him
Now bhikkhus this comes to pass that a certain being after passing away from that plane takes rebirth in this world
Having come to this world he goes forth from home to homelessness
When he has gone forth by means of ardor endeavor application diligence and right reflection he attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life but none previous to that
He speaks thus 'We were created by him by Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Vanquisher the Unvanquished the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord the Maker and Creator the Supreme Being the Ordainer the Almighty the Father of all that are and are to be
He is permanent stable eternal not subject to change and he will remain the same just like eternity itself
But we who have been created by him and have come to this world are impermanent unstable shortlived doomed to perish'
This bhikkhus is the first case
In the second case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins eternalists in regard to some things and noneternalists in regard to other things proclaiming the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternal
There are bhikkhus certain gods called 'corrupted by play'
These gods spend an excessive time indulging in the delights of laughter and play
As a consequence they become forgetful and when they become forgetful they pass away from that plane
Now bhikkhus this comes to pass that a certain being after passing away from that plane takes rebirth in this world
Having come to this world he goes forth from home to homelessness
When he has gone forth by means of ardor endeavor application diligence and right reflection he attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life but none previous to that
He speaks thus 'Those honorable gods who are not corrupted by play do not spend an excessive time indulging in the delights of laughter and play
As a consequence they do not become forgetful and because they do not become forgetful they do not pass away from that plane
Those gods are permanent stable eternal not subject to change and they will remain the same just like eternity itself
But we were gods corrupted by play
We spent an excessive time indulging in the delights of laughter and play and as a consequence we became forgetful
When we became forgetful we passed away from that plane
Coming to this world now we are impermanent unstable shortlived doomed to perish'
This bhikkhus is the second case
In the third case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins eternalists in regard to some things and noneternalists in regard to other things proclaiming the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternal
There are bhikkhus certain gods called 'corrupted by mind' These gods contemplate one another with excessive envy
As a consequence their minds becomes corrupted by anger towards one another
When their minds are corrupted by anger their bodies and minds become exhausted and consequently they pass away from that plane
Now bhikkhus this comes to pass that a certain being after passing away from that plane takes rebirth in this world
Having come to this world he goes forth from home to homelessness
When he has gone forth by means of ardor endeavor application diligence and right reflection he attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life but none previous to that
He speaks thus 'Those honorable gods who are not corrupted by mind do not contemplate each other with excessive envy
As a result their minds do not become corrupted by anger towards one another their bodies and minds do not become exhausted and they do not pass away from that plane
Those gods are permanent stable not subject to change and they will remain the same just like eternity itself
But we were gods corrupted by mind
We contemplated each other with excessive envy and as a result our minds became corrupted by anger towards one another
When our minds were corrupted by anger our bodies and minds became exhausted and consequently we passed away from that plane
Coming to this world now we are impermanent unstable shortlived doomed to perish'
This bhikkhus is the third case
In the fourth case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins eternalists in regard to some things and noneternalists in regard to other things proclaiming the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternal
Herein bhikkhus recluse or a certain brahmin is a rationalist an investigator
He declares his view  hammered out by reason deduced from his investigations following his own flight of thought  thus 'That which is called the eye the ear the nose the tongue and the body  that self is impermanent unstable noneternal subject to change
But that which is called mind or mentality or consciousness  that self is permanent stable eternal not subject to change and it will remain the same just like eternity itself'
This bhikkhus is the fourth case
It is on these four grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are partialeternalists proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternal
Whatever recluses and brahmins there may be who proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternal all of them do so on these four grounds or on a certain one of them
Outside of these there is none

There are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are extensionists and who on four grounds proclaim the world to be finite or infinite
And owing to what with reference to what do these honorable recluses and brahmins proclaim their views
In the first case bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin by means of ardor endeavor application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he abides perceiving the world as finite
He speaks thus 'The world is finite and bounded
What is the reason
Because I attain to such concentration of mind that I abide perceiving the world as finite
For that reason I know this the world is finite and bounded'
This bhikkhus is the first case
In the second case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins extensionists proclaiming the world to be finite or infinite
Herein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin by means of ardor endeavor application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he abides perceiving the world as infinite
He speaks thus 'The world is infinite and boundless
Those recluses and brahmins who declare the world to be finite and bounded speak falsely
The world is infinite and boundless
What is the reason
Because I attain to such concentration of mind that I abide perceiving the world as infinite
For this reason I know this the world is infinite and boundless'
This bhikkhus is the second case
In the third case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins extensionists proclaiming the world to be finite or infinite
Herein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin by means of ardor endeavor application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he abides perceiving the world as finite in the upward and downward directions but as infinite across
He speaks thus 'The world is both finite and infinite
Those recluses and brahmins who declare the world to be finite and bounded speak falsely and those recluses and brahmins who declare the world to be infinite and boundless also speak falsely
The world is both finite and infinite
For what reason
Because I attain to such concentration of mind that I abide perceiving the world as finite in the upward and downward directions but as infinite across
For this reason I know this the world is both finite and infinite'
This bhikkhus is the third case
In the fourth case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins extensionists proclaiming the world to be finite or infinite
Herein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin is a rationalist an investigator
He declares his view  hammered out by reason deduced from his investigations following his own flight of thought  thus 'The world is neither finite nor infinite
Those recluses and brahmins who declare the world to be finite and bounded those who declare it to be infinite and boundless and those who declare it to be both finite and infinite  all these speak falsely
The world is neither finite nor infinite'
This bhikkhus is the fourth case
It is on these four grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are extensionists proclaim the world to be finite or infinite
Whatever recluses or brahmins there may be who proclaim the world to be finite or infinite all of them do so on these four grounds or on a certain one of them
Outside of these there is none

This bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands and it is concerning these that those who would praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speak
There are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are endless equivocators
When questioned about this or that point on four grounds they resort to evasive statements and to endless equivocation
And owing to what with reference to what do these honorable recluses and brahmins do so
Herein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin does not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesome
He thinks 'I do not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesome
If without understanding I were to declare something to be wholesome or unwholesome my declaration might be false
If my declaration should be false that would distress me and that distress would be an obstacle for me' Therefore out of fear and loathing of making a false statement he does not declare anything to be wholesome or unwholesome
But when he is questioned about this or that point he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation I do not take it thus nor do I take it in that way nor do I take it in some other way
I do not say that it is not nor do I say that it is neither this nor that' This bhikkhus is the first case
In the second case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins endless equivocators resorting to evasive statements and to endless equivocation
Herein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin does not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesome
He thinks 'I do not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesome
If without understanding I were to declare something to be wholesome or unwholesome desire and lust or hatred and aversion might arise in me
Should desire and lust or hated and aversion arise in me that would be clinging on my part
Such clinging would distress me and that distress would be an obstacle for me' Therefore out of fear and loathing of clinging he does not declare anything to be wholesome or unwholesome
But when questioned about this or that point he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation 'I do not take it thus nor do I take it in that way nor do I take it in some other way
I do not say that it is not nor do I say that it is neither this nor that' This bhikkhus is the second case
In the third case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins endless equivocators resorting to evasive statements and to endless equivocation
Herein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin does not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesome
He thinks 'I do not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesome
Now there are recluses and brahmins who are wise clever experienced in controversy who wander about demolishing the views of others with their wisdom
If without understanding I were to declare something to be wholesome or unwholesome they might crossexamine me about my views press me for reasons and refute my statements
If they should do so I might not be able to reply
If I could not reply that would distress me and that distress would be an obstacle for me' Therefore out of fear and loathing of being crossexamined he does not declare anything to be wholesome or unwholesome
But when questioned about this or that point he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation 'I do not take it thus nor do I take it in that way nor do I take it in some other way
I do not say that it is not nor do I say that it is neither this nor that'
This bhikkhus is the third case
In the fourth case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins endless equivocators resorting to evasive statements and to endless equivocation
Herein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin is dull and stupid
Due to his dullness and stupidity when he is questioned about this or that point he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation 'If you ask me whether there is a world beyond  if I thought there is another world I would declare that there is
But I do not take it thus nor do I take it in that way nor do I take it in some other way
I do not say that it is not nor do I say that is neither this nor that'
Similarly when asked any of the following questions he resorts to the same evasive statements and to endless equivocation
This bhikkhus is the fourth case
It is on these four grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are endless equivocators resort to evasive statements and to endless equivocation when questioned about this or that point
Whatever recluses or brahmins there may be who resort to evasive statements and to endless equivocation all of them do so on these four grounds or on a certain one of them
Outside of these there is none

There are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are fortuitous originationists and who on two grounds proclaim the self and the world to originate fortuitously
And owing to what with reference to what do these honorable recluses and brahmins proclaim their views
There are bhikkhus certain gods called 'nonpercipient beings' When perception arises in them those gods pass away from that plane
Now bhikkhus this comes to pass that a certain being after passing away from that plane takes rebirth in this world
Having come to this world he goes forth from home to homelessness
When he has gone forth by means of ardor endeavor application diligence and right reflection he attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects the arising of perception but nothing previous to that
He speaks thus 'The self and the world originate fortuitously
What is the reason
Because previously I did not exist but now I am
Not having been I sprang into being'
This bhikkhus is the first case
In the second case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins fortuitous originationists proclaiming the self and the world to originate fortuitously
Herein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin is a rationalist an investigator
He declares his view  hammered out by reason deduced from his investigations following his own flight of thought  thus 'The self and the world originate fortuitously'
This bhikkhus is the second case
It is on these two grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are fortuitous originationists proclaim the self and the world to originate fortuitously
Whatever recluses or brahmins there may be who proclaim the self and the world to originate fortuitously all of them do so on these two grounds or on a certain one of them
Outside of these there is none

Outside of these there is none
This bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands
And he understands 'These standpoints thus assumed and thus misapprehended lead to such a future destination to such in the world beyond' He understands as well what transcends this yet even that understanding he does not misapprehend
And because he is free from misapprehension he has realized within himself the state of perfect peace
Having understood as they really are the origin and the passing away of feelings their satisfaction their unsatisfactoriness and the escape from them the Tathāgata bhikkhus is emancipated through nonclinging
These are those dhammas bhikkhus that are deep difficult to see difficult to understand peaceful and sublime beyond the sphere of reasoning subtle comprehensible only to the wise which the Tathāgata having realized for himself with direct knowledge propounds to others and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speak

Outside of these there is none

There are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are annihilationists and who on seven grounds proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent being
And owing to what with reference to what do these honorable recluses and brahmins proclaim their views
Herein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin asserts the following doctrine and view 'The self good sir has material form it is composed of the four primary elements and originates from father and mother
Since this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death at this point the self is completely annihilated' In this way some proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent being
To him another says 'There is good sir such a self as you assert
That I do not deny
But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated
For there is good sir another self  divine having material form pertaining to the sense sphere feeding on edible nutriment
That you neither know nor see but I know it and see it
Since this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death at this point the self is completely annihilated' In this way others proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent being
To him another says 'There is good sir such a self as you assert
That I do not deny
But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated
For there is good sir another self  divine having material form mindmade complete in all its limbs and organs not destitute of any faculties
That you neither know nor see but I know it and see it
Since this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death at this point the self is completely annihilated' In this way others proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent being
To him another says 'There is good sir such a self as you assert
That I do not deny
But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated
For there is good sir another self belonging to the base of infinite space the complete surmounting of perceptions of material form by the disappearance of perceptions of resistance by nonattention to perceptions of diversity Space is infinite That you neither know nor see but I know it and see it
Since this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death at this point the self is completely annihilated' In this way others proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent being
To him another says 'There is good sir such a self as you assert
That I do not deny
But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated
For there is good sir another self belonging to the base of infinite consciousness completely surmounting the base of infinite space Consciousness is infinite That you neither know nor see
But I know it and see it
Since this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death  at this point the self is completely annihilated' In this way some proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent being
To him another says 'There is good sir such a self as you assert
That I do not deny
But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated
For there is good sir another self belonging to the base of nothingness completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness There is nothing That you neither know nor see
But I know it and see it
Since this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death  at this point the self is completely annihilated' In this way some proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent being
To him another says 'There is good sir such a self as you assert
That I do not deny
But it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilated
For there is good sir another self belonging to the base of neither perception nor nonperception completely surmounting the base of nothingness This is the peaceful this is the sublime That you neither know nor see
But I know it and see it
Since this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death  at this point the self is completely annihilated' In this way some proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent being
It is on these seven grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are annihilationists proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent being
Whatever recluses or brahmins proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent being all of them do so on these seven grounds or on a certain one of them
Outside of these there is none

There are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who maintain a doctrine of Nibbāna here and now and who on five grounds proclaim Nibbāna here and now for an existent being
And owing to what with reference to what do these honorable recluses and brahmins proclaim their views
Herein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin asserts the following doctrine or view 'When this self good sir furnished and supplied with the five strands of sense pleasures revels in them  at this point the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now' In this way some proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent being
To him another says 'There is good sir such a self as you assert
That I do not deny
But it is not at that point that the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now
What is the reason
Because good sir sense pleasures are impermanent suffering subject to change and through their change and transformation there arise sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
But when the self quite secluded from sense pleasures secluded from unwholesome states enters and abides in the first jhāna which is accompanied by initial and sustained thought and contains the rapture and happiness born of seclusion  at this point good sir the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now' In this way others proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent being
To him another says 'There is good sir such a self as you assert
That I do not deny
But it is not at that point that the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now
What is the reason
Because that jhāna contains initial and sustained thought therefore it is declared to be gross
But when with the subsiding of initial and sustained thought the self enters and abides in the second jhāna which is accompanied by internal confidence and unification of mind is free from initial and sustained thought and contains the rapture and happiness born of concentration  at this point good sir the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now' In this way others proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent being
To him another says 'There is good sir such a self as you assert
That I do not deny
But it is not at that point that the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now
What is the reason
It is declared to be gross because of the mental exhilaration connected with rapture that exists there
But when with the fading away of rapture one abides in equanimity mindful and clearly comprehending and still experiencing happiness with the body enters and abides in the third jhāna so that the ariyans announce He abides happily in equanimity and mindfulness  at this point good sir the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now' In this way some proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent being
To him another says 'There is good sir such a self as you assert
That I do not deny
But it is not at that point that the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now
What is the reason
It is declared to be gross because a mental concern 'Happiness' exists there
But when with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the disappearance of previous joy and grief one enters and abides in the fourth jhāna which is without pleasure and pain and contains purification of mindfulness through equanimity  at this point good sir the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now' In this way some proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent being

The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
This discourse is one of the masterpieces of the Pali canon
At heart it is a comprehensive portrait of the Buddhist path of training illustrating each stage of the training with vivid similes
This portrait is placed in juxtaposition to the Buddhist view of the teachings of rival philosophical teachers of the time showing how the Buddha  in contradistinction to the inflexible partyline approach of his contemporaries  presented his teaching in a way that was pertinent and sensitive to the needs of his listeners
This larger portrait of the intellectual landscape of early Buddhist India is then presented in a moving narrative frame the sad story of King Ajatasattu
Ajatasattu was the son of King Bimbisara of Magadha one of the Buddha's earliest followers
Urged on by Devadatta  the Buddha's cousin who wished to use Ajatasattu's support in his bid to take over the Buddha's position as head of the Sangha  Ajatasattu arranged for his father's death so that he could secure his own position on the throne
As a result of this evil deed he was destined not only to be killed by his own son  Udayibhadda  but also to take immediate rebirth in one of the lowest regions of hell
In this discourse Ajatasattu visits the Buddha in hopes that the latter will bring some peace to his mind
The question he puts to the Buddha shows the limited level of his own understanding so the Buddha patiently describes the steps of the training beginning at a very basic level and gradually moving up as a way of raising the king's spiritual horizons
At the end of the talk Ajatasattu takes refuge in the Triple Gem
Although his earlier deeds were so heavy that this expression of faith could have only limited consequences in the immediate present the Commentary assures us that the king's story would ultimately have a happy ending
After the Buddha's death he sponsored the First Council at which a congress of arahant disciples produced the first standardized account of the Buddha's teachings
As a result of the merit coming from this deed Ajatasattu is destined  after his release from hell  to attain Awakening as a Private Buddha
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Rajagaha in Jivaka Komarabhacca's mango grove with a large community of monks  monks in all
Now at that time  it being the observance day the fullmoon night of the waterlily season the fourth month of the rains  King Ajatasattu of Magadha the son of Queen Videha was sitting on the roof terrace of his palace surrounded by his ministers
Then he felt inspired to exclaim How wonderful is this moonlit night
How beautiful How lovely How inspiring How auspicious is this moonlit night
What brahman or contemplative should we visit tonight who might enlighten and bring peace to our mind
When this was said one of the ministers said to the king Your majesty there is Purana Kassapa the leader of a community the leader of a group the teacher of a group honored and famous esteemed as holy by the mass of people
He is aged long gone forth advanced in years in the last phase of life
Your majesty should visit him
Perhaps if you visited him he would enlighten and bring peace to your mind
When this was said the king remained silent
Then another minister said to the king Your majesty there is Makkhali Gosala Your majesty there is Ajita Kesakambalin Your majesty there is Pakudha Kaccayana Your majesty there is Sañjaya Belatthaputta Your majesty there is Nigantha Nataputta the leader of a community the leader of a group the teacher of a group honored and famous esteemed as holy by the mass of people
He is aged long gone forth advanced in years in the last phase of life
Your majesty should visit him
Perhaps if you visited him he would enlighten and bring peace to your mind
When this was said the king remained silent
All this time Jivaka Komarabhacca was sitting silently not far from the king
So the king said to him Friend Jivaka why are you silent
Your majesty there is the Blessed One worthy and rightly selfawakened staying in my mango grove with a large community of monks  monks in all
Concerning this Blessed One this admirable report has been spread 'Surely the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in clear knowing and conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the cosmos unexcelled trainer of tamable people teacher of beings human and divine awakened blessed' Your majesty should visit him
Perhaps if you visited him he would enlighten and bring peace to your mind
Then in that case friend Jivaka have the riding elephants prepared
Having replied As you say your majesty having had five hundred female elephants prepared as well as the king's personal tusker Jivaka announced to the king Your majesty your riding elephants are prepared
Do what you think it is now time to do
Then the king having had five hundred of his women mounted on the five hundred female elephants  one on each  and having mounted his own personal tusker set out from the capital in full royal state with attendants carrying torches headed for Jivaka Komarabhacca's mango grove
But when the king was not far from the mango grove he was gripped with fear trepidation his hair standing on end
Fearful agitated his hair standing on end he said to Jivaka Komarabhacca Friend Jivaka you aren't deceiving me are you
You aren't betraying me are you
You aren't turning me over to my enemies are you
How can there be such a large community of monks  in all  with no sound of sneezing no sound of coughing no voices at all
Don't be afraid great king
Don't be afraid
I'm not deceiving you or betraying you or turning you over to your enemies
Go forward great king go forward
Those are lamps burning in the pavilion hall
Then the king going as far on his tusker as the ground would permit dismounted and approached the door of the pavilion on foot
On arrival he asked Jivaka Where friend Jivaka is the Blessed One
That is the Blessed One great king sitting against the middle pillar facing east surrounded by the community of monks
Then the king approached the Blessed One and on reaching him stood to one side
As he was standing there  surveying the community of monks sitting in absolute silence as calm as a lake  he felt inspired to exclaim May my son Prince Udayibhadda enjoy the same peace that this community of monks now enjoys
Have you come great king together with your affections
Lord my son Prince Udayibhadda is very dear to me
May he enjoy the same peace that this community of monks now enjoys
Then bowing down to the Blessed One and saluting the community of monks with his hands palmtopalm over his heart he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One I would like to ask the Blessed One about a certain issue if he would give me the opportunity to explain my question
Ask great king whatever you like
Lord there are these common craftsmen elephanttrainers horsetrainers charioteers archers standard bearers camp marshals supply corps officers high royal officers commandos military heroes armorclad warriors leatherclad warriors domestic slaves confectioners barbers bath attendants cooks garlandmakers laundrymen weavers basketmakers potters calculators accountants and any other common craftsmen of a similar sort
They live off the fruits of their crafts visible in the here and now
They give pleasure and refreshment to themselves to their parents wives and children to their friends and colleagues
They put in place an excellent presentation of offerings to brahmans and contemplatives leading to heaven resulting in happiness conducive to a heavenly rebirth
Is it possible lord to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life visible in the here and now
Do you remember great king ever having asked this question of other brahmans and contemplatives
Yes I do
If it isn't troublesome for you how did they answer
No it's not troublesome for me wherever the Blessed One  or someone like the Blessed One  is sitting
Then speak great king
Once lord I approached Purana Kassapa and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies I sat to one side
As I was sitting there I asked him 'Venerable Kassapa there are these common craftsmen They live off the fruits of their crafts visible in the here and now Is it possible venerable sir to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life visible in the here and now'
When this was said Purana Kassapa said to me 'Great king in acting or getting others to act in mutilating or getting others to mutilate in torturing or getting others to torture in inflicting sorrow or in getting others to inflict sorrow in tormenting or getting others to torment in intimidating or getting others to intimidate in taking life taking what is not given breaking into houses plundering wealth committing burglary ambushing highways committing adultery speaking falsehood  one does no evil
If with a razoredged disk one were to turn all the living beings on this earth to a single heap of flesh a single pile of flesh there would be no evil from that cause no coming of evil
Even if one were to go along the right bank of the Ganges killing and getting others to kill mutilating and getting others to mutilate torturing and getting others to torture there would be no evil from that cause no coming of evil
Even if one were to go along the left bank of the Ganges giving and getting others to give making sacrifices and getting others to make sacrifices there would be no merit from that cause no coming of merit
Through generosity selfcontrol restraint and truthful speech there is no merit from that cause no coming of merit'
Thus when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now Purana Kassapa answered with nonaction
Just as if a person when asked about a mango were to answer with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit were to answer with a mango In the same way when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now Purana Kassapa answered with nonaction
The thought occurred to me 'How can anyone like me think of disparaging a brahman or contemplative living in his realm' Yet I neither delighted in Purana Kassapa's words nor did I protest against them
Neither delighting nor protesting I was dissatisfied
Without expressing dissatisfaction without accepting his teaching without adopting it I got up from my seat and left
Another time I approached Makkhali Gosala and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies I sat to one side
As I was sitting there I asked him 'Venerable Gosala there are these common craftsmen They live off the fruits of their crafts visible in the here and now Is it possible venerable sir to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life visible in the here and now'
When this was said Makkhali Gosala said to me 'Great king there is no cause no requisite condition for the defilement of beings
Beings are defiled without cause without requisite condition
There is no cause no requisite condition for the purification of beings
Beings are purified without cause without requisite condition
There is nothing selfcaused nothing othercaused nothing humancaused
There is no strength no effort no human energy no human endeavor
All living beings all life all beings all souls are powerless devoid of strength devoid of effort
Subject to the changes of fate serendipity and nature they are sensitive to pleasure and pain in the six great classes of birth
'There are principle modes of origin
There are kinds of kamma five kinds and three kinds full kamma and half kamma
There are pathways subeons six great classes of birth eight classes of men modes of livelihood kinds of wanderers Nagaabodes faculties hells dustrealms seven spheres of percipient beings seven spheres of nonpercipient beings seven kinds of jointed plants seven kinds of devas seven kinds of human beings seven kinds of demons seven great lakes seven major knots seven minor knots major precipices minor precipices major dreams minor dreams great aeons
Having transmigrated and wandered on through these the wise and the foolish alike will put an end to pain
'Though one might think Through this morality this practice this austerity or this holy life I will ripen unripened kamma and eliminate ripened kamma whenever touched by it  that is impossible
Pleasure and pain are measured out the wanderingon is fixed in its limits
There is no shortening or lengthening no accelerating or decelerating
Just as a ball of string when thrown comes to its end simply by unwinding in the same way having transmigrated and wandered on the wise and the foolish alike will put an end to pain'
Thus when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now Makkhali Gosala answered with purification through wanderingon
Just as if a person when asked about a mango were to answer with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit were to answer with a mango
In the same way when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now Makkhali Gosala answered with purification through wanderingon
The thought occurred to me 'How can anyone like me think of disparaging a brahman or contemplative living in his realm' Yet I neither delighted in Makkhali Gosala's words nor did I protest against them
Neither delighting nor protesting I was dissatisfied
Without expressing dissatisfaction without accepting his teaching without adopting it I got up from my seat and left
Another time I approached Ajita Kesakambalin and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies I sat to one side
As I was sitting there I asked him 'Venerable Ajita there are these common craftsmen They live off the fruits of their crafts visible in the here and now Is it possible venerable sir to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life visible in the here and now'
When this was said Ajita Kesakambalin said to me 'Great king there is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed
There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions
There is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no brahmans or contemplatives who faring rightly and practicing rightly proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselves
A person is a composite of four primary elements
At death the earth returns to and merges with the earthsubstance
The fire returns to and merges with the external firesubstance
The liquid returns to and merges with the external liquidsubstance
The wind returns to and merges with the external windsubstance
The sensefaculties scatter into space
Four men with the bier as the fifth carry the corpse
Its eulogies are sounded only as far as the charnel ground
The bones turn pigeoncolored
The offerings end in ashes
Generosity is taught by idiots
The words of those who speak of existence after death are false empty chatter
With the breakup of the body the wise and the foolish alike are annihilated destroyed
They do not exist after death'
Thus when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now Ajita Kesakambalin answered with annihilation
Just as if a person when asked about a mango were to answer with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit were to answer with a mango
In the same way when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now Ajita Kesakambalin answered with annihilation
The thought occurred to me 'How can anyone like me think of disparaging a brahman or contemplative living in his realm' Yet I neither delighted in Ajita Kesakambalin's words nor did I protest against them
Neither delighting nor protesting I was dissatisfied
Without expressing dissatisfaction without accepting his teaching without adopting it I got up from my seat and left
Another time I approached Pakudha Kaccayana and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies I sat to one side
As I was sitting there I asked him 'Venerable Kaccayana there are these common craftsmen They live off the fruits of their crafts visible in the here and now Is it possible venerable sir to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life visible in the here and now'
When this was said Pakudha Kaccayana said to me 'Great king there are these seven substances  unmade irreducible uncreated without a creator barren stable as a mountainpeak standing firm like a pillar  that do not alter do not change do not interfere with one another are incapable of causing one another pleasure pain or both pleasure and pain
Which seven
The earthsubstance the liquidsubstance the firesubstance the windsubstance pleasure pain and the soul as the seventh
These are the seven substances  unmade irreducible uncreated without a creator barren stable as a mountainpeak standing firm like a pillar  that do not alter do not change do not interfere with one another and are incapable of causing one another pleasure pain or both pleasure and pain
'And among them there is no killer nor one who causes killing no hearer nor one who causes hearing no cognizer nor one who causes cognition
When one cuts off head there is no one taking anyone's life
It is simply between the seven substances that the sword passes'
Thus when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now Pakudha Kaccayana answered with nonrelatedness
Just as if a person when asked about a mango were to answer with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit were to answer with a mango
In the same way when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now Pakudha Kaccayana answered with nonrelatedness
The thought occurred to me 'How can anyone like me think of disparaging a brahman or contemplative living in his realm' Yet I neither delighted in Pakudha Kaccayana's words nor did I protest against them
Neither delighting nor protesting I was dissatisfied
Without expressing dissatisfaction without accepting his teaching without adopting it I got up from my seat and left
Another time I approached Nigantha Nataputta and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies I sat to one side
As I was sitting there I asked him 'Venerable Aggivessana there are these common craftsmen They live off the fruits of their crafts visible in the here and now Is it possible venerable sir to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life visible in the here and now'
When this was said Nigantha Nataputta said to me 'Great king there is the case where the Nigantha  the knotless one  is restrained with the fourfold restraint
And how is the Nigantha restrained with the fourfold restraint
There is the case where the Nigantha is obstructed by all waters conjoined with all waters cleansed with all waters suffused with all waters
This is how the Nigantha is restrained with the fourfold restraint
When the Nigantha  a knotless one  is restrained with such a fourfold restraint he is said to be a Knotless One a son of Nata with his self perfected his self controlled his self established'
Thus when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now Nigantha Nataputta answered with fourfold restraint
Just as if a person when asked about a mango were to answer with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit were to answer with a mango In the same way when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now Nigantha Nataputta answered with fourfold restraint
The thought occurred to me 'How can anyone like me think of disparaging a brahman or contemplative living in his realm' Yet I neither delighted in Nigantha Nataputta's words nor did I protest against them

Another time I approached Sañjaya Belatthaputta and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies I sat to one side
As I was sitting there I asked him 'Venerable Sañjaya there are these common craftsmen They live off the fruits of their crafts visible in the here and now Is it possible venerable sir to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life visible in the here and now'
When this was said Sañjaya Belatthaputta said to me 'If you ask me if there exists another world if I thought that there exists another world would I declare that to you
I don't think so
I don't think in that way
I don't think otherwise
I don't think not
I don't think not not
If you asked me if there isn't another world both is and isn't neither is nor isn't if there are beings who transmigrate if there aren't both are and aren't neither are nor aren't if the Tathagata exists after death doesn't both neither exists nor doesn't exist after death would I declare that to you
I don't think so
I don't think in that way
I don't think otherwise
I don't think not
I don't think not not'
Thus when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now Sañjaya Belatthaputta answered with evasion
Just as if a person when asked about a mango were to answer with a breadfruit or when asked about a breadfruit were to answer with a mango In the same way when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now Sañjaya Belatthaputta answered with evasion
The thought occurred to me 'This  among these brahmans and contemplatives  is the most foolish and confused of all
How can he when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now answer with evasion' Still the thought occurred to me 'How can anyone like me think of disparaging a brahman or contemplative living in his realm' Yet I neither delighted in Sañjaya Belatthaputta's words nor did I protest against them
Neither delighting nor protesting I was dissatisfied
Without expressing dissatisfaction without accepting his teaching without adopting it I got up from my seat and left
So lord I ask the Blessed One as well There are these common craftsmen elephanttrainers horsetrainers charioteers archers standard bearers camp marshals supply corps officers high royal officers commandos military heroes armorclad warriors leatherclad warriors domestic slaves confectioners barbers bath attendants cooks garlandmakers laundrymen weavers basketmakers potters calculators accountants and any other common craftsmen of a similar sort
They live off the fruits of their crafts visible in the here and now
They give pleasure and refreshment to themselves to their parents wives and children to their friends and colleagues
They put in place an excellent presentation of offerings to brahmans and contemplatives leading to heaven resulting in happiness conducive to a heavenly rebirth
Is it possible lord to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life visible in the here and now
Yes it is great king
But first with regard to that I will ask you a counterquestion
Answer however you please
Suppose there were a man of yours your slave your workman rising in the morning before you going to bed in the evening only after you doing whatever you order always acting to please you speaking politely to you always watching for the look on your face
The thought would occur to him 'Isn't it amazing
Isn't it astounding
 the destination the results of meritorious deeds
For this King Ajatasattu is a human being and I too am a human being yet King Ajatasattu enjoys himself supplied and replete with the five strings of sensuality  like a deva as it were  while I am his slave his workman always watching for the look on his face
I too should do meritorious deeds
What if I were to shave off my hair and beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness'
So after some time he shaves off his hair and beard puts on the ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessness
Having thus gone forth he lives restrained in body speech and mind content with the simplest food and shelter delighting in solitude
Then suppose one of your men were to inform you 'You should know your majesty that that man of yours  your slave your workman always watching for the look on your face has gone forth from the household life into homelessness content with the simplest food and shelter delighting in solitude' Would you thus informed say 'Bring that man back to me
Make him again be my slave my workman always watching for the look on my face'
Not at all lord
Rather I am the one who should bow down to him rise up out of respect for him invite him to a seat invite him to accept gifts of robes almsfood lodgings and medicinal requisites for the sick
And I would provide him with righteous safety defense and protection
So what do you think great king
With that being the case is there a visible fruit of the contemplative life or is there not
Yes lord
With that being the case there certainly is a visible fruit of the contemplative life
This great king is the first fruit of the contemplative life visible in the here and now that I point out to you
But is it possible lord to point out yet another fruit of the contemplative life visible in the here and now
Yes it is great king
But first with regard to that I will ask you a counterquestion
Answer however you please
Suppose there were a man of yours a farmer a householder a taxpayer swelling the royal treasury
The thought would occur to him 'Isn't it amazing
Isn't it astounding
 the destination the results of meritorious deeds
For this King Ajatasattu is a human being and I too am a human being yet King Ajatasattu enjoys himself supplied and replete with the five strings of sensuality  like a deva as it were  while I am a farmer a householder a taxpayer swelling the royal treasury
I too should do meritorious deeds
What if I were to shave off my hair and beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness'
So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth large or small leaves his circle of relatives large or small shaves off his hair and beard puts on the ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessness
Having thus gone forth he lives restrained in body speech and mind content with the simplest food and shelter delighting in solitude
Then suppose one of your men were to inform you 'You should know your majesty that that man of yours  the farmer the householder the taxpayer swelling the royal treasury has gone forth from the household life into homelessness content with the simplest food and shelter delighting in solitude' Would you thus informed say 'Bring that man back to me
Make him again be a farmer a householder a taxpayer swelling the royal treasury'
Not at all lord
Rather I am the one who should bow down to him rise up out of respect for him invite him to a seat invite him to accept gifts of robes almsfood lodgings and medicinal requisites for the sick
And I would provide him with righteous safety defense and protection
So what do you think great king
With that being the case is there a visible fruit of the contemplative life or is there not
Yes lord
With that being the case there certainly is a visible fruit of the contemplative life
This great king is the second fruit of the contemplative life visible in the here and now that I point out to you
But is it possible lord to point out yet another fruit of the contemplative life visible in the here and now
Yes it is great king
Listen and pay close attention
I will speak
There is the case great king where a Tathagata appears in the world worthy and rightly selfawakened
He teaches the Dhamma admirable in its beginning admirable in its middle admirable in its end
He proclaims the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pure
A householder or householder's son hearing the Dhamma gains conviction in the Tathagata and reflects 'Household life is confining a dusty path
The life gone forth is like the open air
It is not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shell
What if I were to shave off my hair and beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness'
So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth large or small leaves his circle of relatives large or small shaves off his hair and beard puts on the ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessness
When he has thus gone forth he lives restrained by the rules of the monastic code seeing danger in the slightest faults

This too is part of his virtue
A monk thus consummate in virtue sees no danger anywhere from his restraint through virtue
Just as a headanointed noble warrior king who has defeated his enemies sees no danger anywhere from his enemies in the same way the monk thus consummate in virtue sees no danger anywhere from his restraint through virtue
Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless
This is how a monk is consummate in virtue
And how does a monk guard the doors of his senses
On seeing a form with the eye he does not grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him
On hearing a sound with the ear On smelling an odor with the nose On tasting a flavor with the tongue On touching a tactile sensation with the body On cognizing an idea with the intellect he does not grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him
Endowed with this noble restraint over the sense faculties he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless
This is how a monk guards the doors of his senses
And how is a monk possessed of mindfulness and alertness
When going forward and returning he acts with alertness
When looking toward and looking away when bending and extending his limbs when carrying his outer cloak his upper robe and his bowl when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking and remaining silent he acts with alertness
This is how a monk is possessed of mindfulness and alertness
And how is a monk content
Just as a bird wherever it goes flies with its wings as its only burden so too is he content with a set of robes to provide for his body and almsfood to provide for his hunger
Wherever he goes he takes only his barest necessities along
This is how a monk is content
Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue this noble restraint over the sense faculties this noble mindfulness and alertness and this noble contentment he seeks out a secluded dwelling a forest the shade of a tree a mountain a glen a hillside cave a charnel ground a jungle grove the open air a heap of straw
After his meal returning from his alms round he sits down crosses his legs holds his body erect and brings mindfulness to the fore
Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness
He cleanses his mind of covetousness
Abandoning ill will and anger he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will sympathetic with the welfare of all living beings
He cleanses his mind of ill will and anger
Abandoning sloth and drowsiness he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth and drowsiness mindful alert percipient of light
He cleanses his mind of sloth and drowsiness
Abandoning restlessness and anxiety he dwells undisturbed his mind inwardly stilled
He cleanses his mind of restlessness and anxiety
Abandoning uncertainty he dwells having crossed over uncertainty with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualities
He cleanses his mind of uncertainty
Suppose that a man taking a loan invests it in his business affairs
His business affairs succeed
He repays his old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining his wife
The thought would occur to him 'Before taking a loan I invested it in my business affairs
Now my business affairs have succeeded
I have repaid my old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining my wife' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness
Now suppose that a man falls sick  in pain and seriously ill
He does not enjoy his meals and there is no strength in his body
As time passes he eventually recovers from that sickness
He enjoys his meals and there is strength in his body
The thought would occur to him 'Before I was sick Now I am recovered from that sickness
I enjoy my meals and there is strength in my body' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness
Now suppose that a man is bound in prison
As time passes he eventually is released from that bondage safe and sound with no loss of property
The thought would occur to him 'Before I was bound in prison
Now I am released from that bondage safe and sound with no loss of my property' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness
Now suppose that a man is a slave subject to others not subject to himself unable to go where he likes
As time passes he eventually is released from that slavery subject to himself not subject to others freed able to go where he likes
The thought would occur to him 'Before I was a slave Now I am released from that slavery subject to myself not subject to others freed able to go where I like' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness
Now suppose that a man carrying money and goods is traveling by a road through desolate country
As time passes he eventually emerges from that desolate country safe and sound with no loss of property
The thought would occur to him 'Before carrying money and goods I was traveling by a road through desolate country
Now I have emerged from that desolate country safe and sound with no loss of my property' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness
In the same way when these five hindrances are not abandoned in himself the monk regards it as a debt a sickness a prison slavery a road through desolate country
But when these five hindrances are abandoned in himself he regards it as unindebtedness good health release from prison freedom a place of security
Seeing that they have been abandoned within him he becomes glad
Glad he becomes enraptured
Enraptured his body grows tranquil
His body tranquil he is sensitive to pleasure
Feeling pleasure his mind becomes concentrated
Quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters and remains in the first jhana rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought and evaluation
He permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal
Just as if a skilled bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together sprinkling it again and again with water so that his ball of bath powder  saturated moistureladen permeated within and without  would nevertheless not drip even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of withdrawal
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal
This is a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime
Furthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters and remains in the second jhana rapture and pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation  internal assurance
He permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composure
Just like a lake with springwater welling up from within having no inflow from the east west north or south and with the skies supplying abundant showers time and again so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate and pervade suffuse and fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composure
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born of composure
This too is a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime
And furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' He permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture
Just as in a lotus pond some of the lotuses born and growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated and pervaded suffused and filled with cool water from their roots to their tips and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water even so the monk permeates this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture
This too is a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime
And furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure and stress  as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress  he enters and remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neitherpleasure nor stress
He sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness
Just as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awareness

The sheath is one thing the reed another but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath' Or as if a man were to draw a sword from its scabbard

When this was said King Ajatasattu said to the Blessed One Magnificent lord
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the community of monks
May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life
A transgression has overcome me lord in that I was so foolish so muddleheaded and so unskilled as to kill my father  a righteous man a righteous king  for the sake of sovereign rulership
May the Blessed One please accept this confession of my transgression as such so that I may restrain myself in the future
Yes great king a transgression overcame you in that you were so foolish so muddleheaded and so unskilled as to kill your father  a righteous man a righteous king  for the sake of sovereign rulership
But because you see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with the Dhamma we accept your confession
For it is a cause of growth in the Dhamma  Discipline of the noble ones when seeing a transgression as such one makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma and exercises restraint in the future
When this was said King Ajatasattu said to the Blessed One Well then lord I am now taking leave
Many are my duties many my responsibilities
Then do great king what you think it is now time to do
So King Ajatasattu delighting and rejoicing in the Blessed One's words rose from his seat bowed down to him and  after circumambulating him  left
Not long after King Ajatasattu had left the Blessed One addressed the monks The king is wounded monks
The king is incapacitated
Had he not killed his father  that righteous man that righteous king  the dustless stainless Dhamma eye would have arisen to him as he sat in this very seat
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
Many Westerners when new to Buddhism are struck by the uncanny familiarity of what seem to be its central concepts interconnectedness wholeness egotranscendence
But what they may not realize is that the concepts sound familiar because they are familiar
To a large extent they come not from the Buddha's teachings but from the Dharma gate of Western psychology through which the Buddha's words have been filtered
They draw less from the root sources of the Dharma than from their own hidden roots in Western culture the thought of the German Romantics
The German Romantics may be dead and almost forgotten but their ideas are still very much alive
Their thought has survived because they were the first to tackle the problem of how it feels to grow up in a modern society
Their analysis of the problem together with their proposed solution still rings true
Modern society they saw is dehumanizing in that it denies human beings their wholeness
The specialization of labor leads to feelings of fragmentation and isolation the bureaucratic state to feelings of regimentation and constriction
The only cure for these feelings the Romantics proposed is the creative artistic act
This act integrates the divided self and dissolves its boundaries in an enlarged sense of identity and interconnectedness with other human beings and nature at large
Human beings are most fully human when free to create spontaneously from the heart
The heart's creations are what allow people to connect
Although many Romantics regarded religious institutions and doctrines as dehumanizing some of them turned to religious experience  a direct feeling of oneness with the whole of nature  as a primary source for rehumanization
When psychology and psychotherapy developed as disciplines in the West they absorbed many of the Romantics' ideas and broadcast them into the culture at large
As a result concepts such as integration of the personality selffulfillment and interconnectedness together with the healing powers of wholeness spontaneity playfulness and fluidity have long been part of the air we breathe
So has the idea that religion is a primarily a quest for a feelingexperience and religious doctrines are a creative response to that experience
In addition to influencing psychology these conceptions inspired liberal Christianity and reform Judaism which proposed that traditional doctrines had to be creatively recast to speak to each new generation in order to keep religious experience vital and alive
So it was only natural that when the Dharma came west people interpreted it in line with these conceptions as well
Asian teachers  many of whom had absorbed Romantic ideas through Westernized education before coming here  found they could connect with Western audiences by stressing themes of spontaneity and fluidity in opposition to the bureaucracy of the ego Western students discovered that they could relate to the doctrine of dependent coarising when it was interpreted as a variation on interconnectedness and they could embrace the doctrine of notself as a denial of the separate self in favor of a larger more encompassing identity with the entire cosmos
In fact the Romantic view of religious life has shaped more than just isolated Dharma teachings
It colors the Western view of the purpose of Dharma practice as a whole
Western teachers from all traditions maintain that the aim of Buddhist practice is to gain the creative fluidity that overcomes dualities
As one author has put it the Buddha taught that dissolving the barriers that we erect between ourselves and the world is the best use of our human lives manifests as inquisitiveness as adaptability as humor as playfulness our capacity to relax with not knowing Or as another has said When our identity expands to include everything we find a peace with the dance of the world Adds a third Our job for the rest of our life is to open up into that immensity and to express it
Just as the Chinese had Taoism as their Dharma gate  the homegrown tradition providing concepts that helped them understand the Dharma  we in the West have Romanticism as ours
The Chinese experience with Dharma gates though contains an important lesson that is often overlooked
After three centuries of interest in Buddhist teachings they began to realize that Buddhism and Taoism were asking different questions
As they rooted out these differences they started using Buddhist ideas to question their Taoist presuppositions
This was how Buddhism instead of turning into a drop in the Taoist sea was able to inject something genuinely new into Chinese culture
The question here in the West is whether we will learn from the Chinese example and start using Buddhist ideas to question our Dharma gate to see exactly how far the similarities between the gate and the actual Dharma go
If we don't we run the danger of mistaking the gate for the Dharma itself and of never going through it to the other side
Taken broadly Romanticism and the Dharma view spiritual life in a similar light
Both regard religion as a product of human activity rather than divine intervention
Both regard the essence of religion as experiential and pragmatic and its role as therapeutic aimed at curing the diseases of the human mind
But if you examine the historical roots of both traditions you find that they disagree sharply not only on the nature of religious experience but also on the nature of the mental diseases it can treat and on the nature of what it means to be cured
These differences aren't just historical curiosities
They shape the presuppositions that meditators bring to the practice
Even when fully present the mind carries along its past presuppositions using them to judge which experiences  if any  should be valued
This is one of the implications of the Buddhist doctrine on karma
As long as these presuppositions remain unexamined they hold an unknown power
So to break that power we need to examine the roots of the Buddhist Romanticism  the Dharma as seen through the Romantic gate
And for the examination to jibe with Buddhist ideas of causality we have to look for those roots in two directions into the past for the origin of Romantic ideas and into the present for the conditions that keep Romantic ideas attractive in the here and now
The Romantics took their original inspiration from an unexpected source Kant the wizened old professor whose daily walks were so punctual that his neighbors could set their clocks by him
In his Critique of Judgment he taught that aesthetic creation and feeling were the highest activities of the human mind in that they alone could heal the dichotomies of human experience
Friedrich Schiller perhaps the most influential Romantic philosopher elaborated on this thesis with his notion of the aesthetic play drive as the ultimate expression of human freedom beyond both the compulsions of animal existence and the laws of reason bringing both into integration
Man he said is fully a human being only when he plays
In Schiller's eyes this play drive not only integrated the self but also helped dissolve one's separation from other human beings and the natural environment as a whole
A person with the internal freedom needed for selfintegration would instinctively want others to experience the same freedom as well
This connection explains the Romantic political program of offering help and sympathy for the oppressed of all nations in overthrowing their oppressors
The value of internal unity in their eyes was proven by its ability to create bonds of unity in the world of social and political action
Schiller saw the process of integration as unending perfect unity could never be achieved
A meaningful life was one continually engaged in the process of integration
The path was the goal
It was also totally unpatterned and unconstrained
Given the free nature of the play drive each person's path to integration was individual and unique
Schiller's colleague Friedrich Schleiermacher applied these ideas to religion concluding that it like any other art form was a human creation and that its greatest function lay in healing the splits both within the human personality and in human society at large
He defined the essence of religion as the sensibility and taste for the infinite which begins in the receptive mind state where awareness opens to the infinite
This feeling for the infinite is followed by an act of the creative imagination which articulates that feeling to oneself and others
Because these creative acts  and thus all religious doctrines  are a step removed from the reality of the experience they are constantly open to improvement and change
A few quotations from his essays On Religion will give a sense of Schleiermacher's thought
The individual is not just part of a whole but an exhibition of it
The mind like the universe is creative not just receptive
Whoever has learned to be more than himself knows that he loses little when he loses himself
Rather than align themselves with a belief of personal immortality after death the truly religious would prefer to strive to annihilate their personality and live in the one and in the all
Where is religion chiefly to be sought
Where the living contact of a human being with the world fashions itself as feeling
Truly religious people are tolerant of different translations of this feeling even the hesitation of atheism
Not to have the divine immediately present in one's feelings has always seemed to them more irreligious than such a hesitation
To insist on one particular conception of the divine to be true is far from religion
Schiller and Schleiermacher both had a strong influence on Ralph Waldo Emerson which can easily be seen in the latter's writings
We're sometimes told that Emerson was influenced by Eastern religions but actually his readings in Buddhism and Hinduism simply provided chapter and verse for the lessons he had already learned from the European Romantics
Bring the past into the eyed present and live ever in a new day
With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do
The essence of genius of virtue and of life is what is called Spontaneity or Instinct
Every man knows that to his involuntary perceptions a perfect faith is due
The reason why the world lacks unity is because man is disunited with himself We live in succession in division in parts in particles
Meanwhile within man is the soul of the whole the wise silence the universal beauty to which every part and particle is equally related the eternal One
And this deep power in which we exist and whose beatitude is all accessible to us is not only selfsufficing and perfect in every hour but the act of seeing and the thing seen the seer and the spectacle the subject and the object are one
At present the Romantics and Transcendentalists are rarely read outside of literature or theology classes
Their ideas have lived on in the general culture largely because they were adopted by the discipline of psychology and translated into a vocabulary that was both more scientific and more accessible to the public at large
One of the most crucial translators was William James who gave the psychological study of religion its modern form a century ago in with the publication of The Varieties of Religious Experience
James' broad sympathies extended beyond Western culture to include Buddhism and Hinduism and beyond the acceptable religions of his time to include the Mental Culture movement the th century's version of the New Age
His interest in diversity makes him seem amazingly postmodern
Still James was influenced by the intellectual currents alive in his time which shaped the way he converted his large mass of data into a psychology of religion
Although he spoke as a scientist the current with the deepest influence on his thought was Romanticism
He followed the Romantics in saying that the function of religious experience was to heal the sense of divided self creating a more integrated selfidentity better able to function in society
However to be scientific the psychology of religion must not side for or against any truth claims concerning the content of religious experiences
For instance many religious experiences produce a strong conviction in the oneness of the cosmos as a whole
Although scientific observers should accept the feeling of oneness as a fact they shouldn't take it as proof that the cosmos is indeed one
Instead they should judge each experience by its effects on the personality
James was not disturbed by the many mutually contradictory truthclaims that religious experiences have produced over the centuries
In his eyes different temperaments need different truths as medicine to heal their psychological wounds
Drawing on Methodism to provide two categories for classifying all religious experiences  conversion and sanctification  James gave a Romantic interpretation to both
For the Methodists these categories applied specifically to the soul's relationship to God
Conversion was the turning of the soul to God's will sanctification the attunement of the soul to God's will in all its actions
To apply these categories to other religions James removed the references to God leaving a more Romantic definition conversion unifies the personality sanctification represents the ongoing integration of that unification into daily life
Also James followed the Romantics in judging the effects of both types of experiences in thisworldly terms
Conversion experiences are healthy when they foster healthy sanctification the ability to maintain one's integrity in the rough and tumble of daily life acting as a moral and responsible member of human society
In psychological terms James saw conversion as simply an extreme example of the breakthroughs ordinarily encountered in adolescence
And he agreed with the Romantics that personal integration was a process to be pursued throughout life rather than a goal to be achieved
Other writers who took up the psychology of religion after James devised a more scientific vocabulary to analyze their data
Still they maintained many of the Romantic notions that James had introduced into the field
For example in Modern Man in Search of a Soul Carl Jung agreed that religion's proper role lay in healing of divisions within the personality although he saw the same basic split in everyone the narrow fearful ego vs
the wiser more spacious unconscious
Thus he regarded religion as a primitive form of psychotherapy
In fact he actually lay closer than James to the Romantics in his definition of psychic health
Quoting Schiller's assertion that human beings are most human when they are at play Jung saw the cultivation of spontaneity and fluidity both as a means for integrating the divided personality and as an expression of the healthy personality engaged in the unending process of integration internal and external throughout life
Unlike James Jung saw the integrated personality as lying above the rigid confines of morality
And although he didn't use the term he extolled what Keats called negative capability the ability to deal comfortably with uncertainties and mysteries without trying to impose confining certainties on them
Thus Jung recommended borrowing from religions any teachings that assist the process of integration while rejecting any teachings that would inhibit the spontaneity of the integrated self
In Religions Values and PeakExperiences Abraham Maslow the American father of transpersonal psychology divided religious experiences into the same two categories used by James
But in an attempt to divorce these categories from any particular tradition he named them after the shape they would assume if graphed over time peakexperiences and plateauexperiences
These terms have now entered the common vernacular
Peakexperiences are shortlived feelings of oneness and integration that can come not only in the area of religion but also in sport sex and art
Plateauexperiences exhibit a more stable sense of integration and last much longer
Maslow had little use for traditional interpretations of peak experiences regarding them as cultural overlays that obscured the true nature of the experience
Assuming all peak experiences regardless of cause or context to be basically the same he reduced them to their common psychological features such as feelings of wholeness dichotomytranscendence playfulness and effortlessness
Thus reduced he found they weren't of lasting value unless they could be transformed into plateau experiences
To this end he saw psychotherapy as necessary for their perfection integrating them into a regime of counseling and education that would actualize the full potential of the human being  intellectual physical social sexual  in a society where all areas of life are sacred and plateauexperiences commonplace for all
These three writers on the psychology of religion despite their differences kept Romantic ideas about religion alive in the West by giving them the scientific stamp of approval
Through their influence these ideas have shaped humanistic psychology and  through humanistic psychology  the expectations many Americans bring to the Dharma
However when we compare these expectations with the original principles of the Dharma we find radical differences
The contrast between them is especially strong around the three most central issues of spiritual life What is the essence of religious experience
What is the basic illness that religious experience can cure
And what does it mean to be cured
The nature of religious experience
For humanistic psychology as for the Romantics religious experience is a direct feeling rather than the discovery of objective truths
The essential feeling is a oneness overcoming all inner and outer divisions
These experiences come in two sorts peak experiences in which the sense of oneness breaks through divisions and dualities and plateau experiences where  through training  the sense of oneness creates a healthy sense of self informing all of one's activities in everyday life
However the Dharma as expounded in its earliest records places training in oneness and a healthy sense of self prior to the most dramatic religious experiences
A healthy sense of self is fostered through training in generosity and virtue
A sense of oneness  peak or plateau  is attained in mundane levels of concentration that constitute the path rather than the goal of practice
The ultimate religious experience Awakening is something else entirely
It is described not in terms of feeling but of knowledge skillful mastery of the principles of causality underlying actions and their results followed by direct knowledge of the dimension beyond causality where all suffering stops
The basic spiritual illness
Romantichumanistic psychology states that the root of suffering is a sense of divided self which creates not only inner boundaries  between reason and emotion body and mind ego and shadow  but also outer ones separating us from other people and from nature and the cosmos as a whole
The Dharma however teaches that the essence of suffering is clinging and that the most basic form of clinging is selfidentification regardless of whether one's sense of self is finite or infinite fluid or static unitary or not
The successful spiritual cure
Romantichumanistic psychology maintains that a total final cure is unattainable
Instead the cure is an ongoing process of personal integration
The enlightened person is marked by an enlarged fluid sense of self unencumbered by moral rigidity
Guided primarily by what feels right in the context of interconnectedness one negotiates with ease  like a dancer  the roles and rhythms of life
Having learned the creative answer to the question What is my true identity one is freed from the need for certainties about any of life's other mysteries
The Dharma however teaches that full Awakening achieves a total cure opening to the unconditioned beyond time and space at which point the task is done
The awakened person then follows a path that can't be traced but is incapable of transgressing the basic principles of morality
Such a person realizes that the question What is my true identity was illconceived and knows from direct experience the total release from time and space that will happen at death
When these two traditions are compared pointbypoint it's obvious that  from the perspective of early Buddhism  Romantichumanistic psychology gives only a partial and limited view of the potentials of spiritual practice
This means that Buddhist Romanticism in translating the Dharma into Romantic principles gives only a partial and limited view of what Buddhism has to offer
Now for many people these limitations don't matter because they come to Buddhist Romanticism for reasons rooted more in the present than in the past
Modern society is now even more schizoid than anything the Romantics ever knew
It has made us more and more dependent on wider and wider circles of other people yet keeps most of those dependencies hidden
Our food and clothing come from the store but how they got there or who is responsible for ensuring a continual supply we don't know
When investigative reporters track down the web of connections from field to final product in our hands the bare facts read like an expos
Our sweatshirts for example come from Uzbekistani cotton woven in Iran sewn in South Korea and stored in Kentucky  an unstable web of interdependencies that involve not a little suffering both for the producers and for those pushed out of the production web by cheaper labor
Whether or not we know these details we intuitively sense the fragmentation and uncertainty created by the entire system
Thus many of us feel a need for a sense of wholeness
For those who benefit from the hidden dependencies of modern life a corollary need is a sense of reassurance that interconnectedness is reliable and benign  or if not yet benign that feasible reforms can make it that way
They want to hear that they can safely place their trust in the principle of interconnectedness without fear that it will turn on them or let them down
When Buddhist Romanticism speaks to these needs it opens the gate to areas of Dharma that can help many people find the solace they're looking for
In doing so it augments the work of psychotherapy which may explain why so many psychotherapists have embraced Dharma practice for their own needs and for their patients and why some have become Dharma teachers themselves
However Buddhist Romanticism also helps close the gate to areas of the Dharma that would challenge people in their hope for an ultimate happiness based on interconnectedness
Traditional Dharma calls for renunciation and sacrifice on the grounds that all interconnectedness is essentially unstable and any happiness based on this instability is an invitation to suffering
True happiness has to go beyond interdependence and interconnectedness to the unconditioned
In response the Romantic argument brands these teachings as dualistic either inessential to the religious experience or inadequate expressions of it
Thus it concludes they can safely be ignored
In this way the gate closes off radical areas of the Dharma designed to address levels of suffering remaining even when a sense of wholeness has been mastered
It also closes off two groups of people who would otherwise benefit greatly from Dharma practice
For both of these groups the concepts of Buddhist Romanticism seem Pollyannaish the cure it offers too facile
As a Dharma gate it's more like a door shut in their faces
Like so many other products of modern life the root sources of Buddhist Romanticism have for too long remained hidden
This is why we haven't recognized it for what it is or realized the price we pay in mistaking the part for the whole
Barring major changes in American society Buddhist Romanticism is sure to survive
What's needed is for more windows and doors to throw light onto the radical aspects of the Dharma that Buddhist Romanticism has so far left in the dark
There's an old saying that the road to hell is paved with good intentions but that's not really the case
The road to hell is paved with intentions that are careless lustful or mean
Good intentions  in proportion to their true goodness  tend toward heavens of pleasure
So why do they have such a bad reputation
For three main reasons
One is that not all good intentions are especially skillful
Even though they mean well they can be misguided and inappropriate for the occasion thus resulting in pain and regret
A second reason is that we often misunderstand the quality of our own intentions
We may mistake a mixed intention for a good one for instance and thus get disappointed when it gives mixed results
A third reason is that we easily misread the way intentions yield their results  as when the painful results of a bad intention in the past obscure the results of a good intention in the present and yet we blame our present intention for the pain
All these reasons acting together lead us to become disillusioned with the potential of good intentions
As a result we either grow cynical about them or else simply abandon the care and patience needed to perfect them
One of the Buddha's most penetrating discoveries is that our intentions are the main factors shaping our lives and that they can be mastered as a skill
If we subject them to the same qualities of mindfulness persistence and discernment involved in developing any skill we can perfect them to the point where they will lead to no regrets or damaging results in any given situation ultimately they can lead us to the truest possible happiness
To train our intentions in this way though requires a deep level of selfawareness
Why is that
If you look carefully at the reasons for our disillusionment with good intentions you'll find that they all come down to delusion delusion in how we formulate our intentions delusion in how we perceive our intentions and delusion in how we attend to their results
As the Buddha tells us delusion is one of the three main roots for unskillful mental habits the other two being greed and aversion
These unskillful roots lie entangled with skillful roots  states of mind that are free of greed aversion and delusion  in the soil of the untrained heart
If we can't isolate and dig up the unskillful roots we can never be fully sure of our intentions
Even when a skillful intention seems foremost in the mind the unskillful roots can quickly send up shoots that blind us as to what's actually going on
If we were to sketch this state of affairs the picture would look something like this The straight road to hell is paved with bad intentions some of which may look good to a casual glance
Roads paved with good intentions leading to heavens of pleasure  some of them quite skillful  branch off on either side of the way but all too often they get lost in an underbrush of unskillfulness and we find ourselves back on the road to hell
The Buddha's discovery was that if we nourish the skillful roots they can grow and effectively block the road to hell if we cut away the underbrush of unskillfulness and dig out its roots we can develop our good intentions to higher and higher levels of skill until ultimately they bring us to a happiness totally unlimited beyond any further need for a path
The most basic step in this process is to make sure that we stay off the road to hell
We do this through the practice of generosity and virtue consciously replacing unskillful intentions with more skillful ones
We then refine our intentions even further through meditation digging up the roots of greed aversion and delusion to prevent them from influencing the choices shaping our lives
Greed and anger are sometimes easy to detect but delusion  by its very nature  is obscure
When we're deluded we don't know we're deluded
That's why meditation has to focus on strengthening and quickening our powers of mindfulness and alertness so that we can catch sight of delusion and uproot it before it takes over our minds
The Buddha's most basic meditation instructions for refining intention start not on the cushion but with the activity of daily life
They are contained in a discourse to his young son Rahula and attack the Catch of delusion through two approaches
The first is what the early Buddhist texts call appropriate attention  the ability to ask yourself the right questions questions that cut straight to the causes of pleasure and pain without entangling the mind in needless confusion
The second approach is friendship with admirable people  associating with and learning from people who are virtuous generous and wise
These two factors the Buddha said are the most helpful internal and external aids for a person following the path
In essence the Buddha told Rahula to use his actions as a mirror for reflecting the quality of his mind
Each time before he acted  and here acting covers any action in thought word or deed  he was to reflect on the result he expected from the action and ask himself Is this going to lead to harm for myself and others or not If it was going to be harmful he shouldn't do it
If it looked harmless he could go ahead and act
However the Buddha cautioned Rahula he shouldn't blindly trust his expectations
While he was in the process of acting he should ask himself if there were any unexpected bad consequences arising
If there were he should stop
If there weren't he could continue his action to the end
Even then though the job of reflection wasn't finished
He should also notice the actual short and longterm consequences of the action
If an action in word or deed ended up causing harm then he should inform a fellowpractitioner on the path and listen to that person's advice
If the mistaken action was purely an act of the mind then he should develop a sense of shame and disgust toward that kind of thought
In both cases he should resolve never to make the same mistake again
If however the longterm consequences of the original action were harmless he should take joy in being on the right path and continue his training
From this we can see that the essential approach for uncovering delusion is the familiar principle of learning from our own mistakes
The way the Buddha formulates this principle though has important implications for it demands qualities of selfhonesty and maturity in areas where they are normally hard to find our evaluation of our own intentions and of the results of our actions
As children we learn to be dishonest about our intentions simply as a matter of survival I didn't mean to do it I couldn't help it I was just swinging my arm and he got in the wayAfter a while we begin to believe our own excuses and don't like to admit to ourselves when our intentions are less than noble
Thus we get into the habit of not articulating our intentions when faced with a choice of refusing to consider the consequences of our intentions and  in many cases  of denying that we had a choice to begin with
This is how addictive behavior starts and unskillful intentions are given free rein
A similar dynamic surrounds our reactions to the consequences of our actions
We start learning denial at an early age  It wasn't my fault It was already broken when I lay down on it  and then internalize the process as a way of preserving our selfimage to the point where it becomes our second nature to turn a blind eye to the impact of our mistakes
As the Buddha points out the end of suffering requires that we abandon craving and ignorance but if we can't be honest with ourselves about our intentions how can we perceive craving in time to abandon it
If we can't face up to the principle of cause and effect in our actions how will we ever overcome ignorance
Ignorance is caused less by a lack of information than by a lack of selfawareness and selfhonesty
To understand the noble truths requires that we be truthful with ourselves in precisely the areas where selfhonesty is most difficult
It also requires maturity
As we examine our intentions we need to learn how to say no to unskillful motives in a way that's firm enough to keep them in check but not so firm that it drives them underground into subconscious repression
We can learn to see the mind as a committee the fact that unworthy impulses are proposed by members of the committee doesn't mean that we are unworthy
We don't have to assume responsibility for everything that gets brought to the committee floor
Our responsibility lies instead in our power to adopt or veto the motion
At the same time we should be adult enough to admit that our habitual or spontaneous impulses are not always trustworthy  first thought is not always best thought  and that what we feel like doing now may not give results that will be pleasant to feel at a later date
As the Buddha said there are four courses of action that may be open to us at any particular time one that we want to do and will give good results one that we don't want to do and will give bad results one that we want to do but will give bad results and one that we don't want to do but will give good results
The first two are nobrainers
We don't need much intelligence to do the first and avoid the second
The measure of our true intelligence lies in how we handle the last two choices
Examining the results of our actions requires maturity as well a mature realization that selfesteem can't be based on always being right and that there's nothing demeaning or degrading in admitting a mistake
We all come from a state of delusion  even the Buddha was coming from delusion as he sought Awakening  so it's only natural that there will be mistakes
Our human dignity lies in our ability to recognize those mistakes to resolve not to repeat them and to stick to that resolution
This in turn requires that we not be debilitated by feelings of guilt or remorse over our errors
As the Buddha states feelings of guilt can't undo a past error and they can deprive the mind of the strength it needs to keep from repeating old mistakes
This is why he recommends an emotion different from guilt  shame  although his use of the word implies something totally unlike the sense of unworthiness we often associate with the term
Remember that both the Buddha and Rahula were members of the noble warrior class a class with a strong sense of its own honor and dignity
And notice that the Buddha tells Rahula to see his past mistakes not himself as shameful
This implies that it's beneath Rahula's dignity to act in ways that are less than honorable
The fact that he can see his actions as shameful is a sign of his honor  and is also a sign that he'll be able not to repeat them
This sense of honor is what underlies a mature healthy and productive sense of shame
At first glance we might think that continual selfreflection of this sort would add further complications to our lives when they already seem more than complicated enough but in fact the Buddha's instructions are an attempt to strip the questions in our minds down to the most useful essentials
He explicitly warns against taking on too many questions particularly those that lead nowhere and tie us up in knots Who am I
Am I basically a good person
An unworthy person Instead he tells us to focus on our intentions so that we can see how they shape our life and to master the processes of cause and effect so that they can shape our life in increasingly better ways
This is the way every great artist or craftsman develops mastery and skill
The emphasis on the intentions behind our actions and their resulting consequences also carries over from daily life onto the meditation seat providing our meditation with the proper focus
In examining our actions in terms of cause and effect skillful and unskillful we are already beginning to look at experience in line with the two sets of variables that make up the four noble truths the origination of stress the path to the cessation of stress stress and the cessation of stress
The way the Buddha recommended that Rahula judge the results of his actions  both while doing them and after they are done  echoes the insight that formed the heart of his Awakening that intentions have results both in the immediate present and over time
When we look at the present moment from this perspective we find that our experience of the present doesn't just happen Instead it's a product of our involvement  in terms of present intentions the results of present intentions and the results of past intentions  in which present intentions are the most important factor
The more we focus on that involvement the more we can bring it out of the halflight of the subconscious and into the full light of awareness
There we can train our intentions through conscious trial and error to be even more skillful enabling us to lessen our experience of suffering and pain in the present
This is how skillful intentions pave the road to mental health and well being in the ordinary world of our lives
As we work at developing our intentions to even higher levels of skill we find that the most consummate intentions are those that center the mind securely in a clear awareness of the present
As we use them to become more and more familiar with the present we come to see that all present intentions no matter how skillful are inherently burdensome
The only way out of this burden is to allow the unraveling of the intentions that provide the weave for our present experience
This provides an opening to the dimension of unlimited freedom that lies beyond them
That's how skillful intentions pave the road all the way to the edge of nirvana
And from there the path  like that of birds through space  can't be traced
During my first weeks with my teacher Ajaan Fuang I began to realize that he had psychic powers
He never made a show of them but I gradually sensed that he could read my mind and anticipate future events
I became intrigued What else did he know
How did he know it
He must have detected where my thoughts were going for one evening he gently headed me off You know he said the whole aim of our practice is purity of heart
Everything else is just games
That one phrase  purity of heart  more than intrigued me
It reverberated deep down inside
Although I was extremely disillusioned with Christianity I still valued Kierkegaard's dictum Purity of heart is to will one thing
I didn't agree with Kierkegaard as to what that one thing was but I did agree that purity of heart is the most important treasure of life
And here Ajaan Fuang was offering to teach me how to develop it
That's one of the reasons why I stayed with him until he died
His basic definition of purity of heart was simple enough a happiness that will never harm anyone
But a happiness like that is hard to find for ordinary happiness requires that we eat
As the first of the Novice's Questions says What is one
All beings subsist on food This is how the Buddha introduced the topic of causality to young people The primary causal relationship isn't something gentle like light reflecting off mirrors or jewels illuminating jewels
It's feeding
Our bodies need physical food for their wellbeing
Our minds need the food of pleasant sensory contacts intentions and consciousness itself in order to function
If you ever want proof that interconnectedness isn't always something to celebrate just contemplate how the beings of the world feed on one another physically and emotionally
Interbeing is intereating
As Ajaan Suwat my second teacher once said If there were a god who could arrange that by my eating I could make everyone in the world full I'd bow down to that god But that's not how eating works
Ordinarily even wellintentioned people may not see eating as harmful
We're so compelled to eat that we blind ourselves to its larger impact
Our first pleasure after the terror of being born was getting to feed
We did it with our eyes closed and most people keep their eyes closed to the impact of their feeding throughout life
But when you go to a quiet secluded place and start examining your life you begin to see what an enormous issue it is just to keep the body and mind well fed
On the one hand you see the suffering you create for others simply in your need to feed
On the other you see something even more dismaying the emotions that arise within you when you don't feel that your body and mind are getting enough to eat
You realize that as long as your source of physical or mental food is unreliable you're unreliable too
You see why even good people can reach a point where they're capable of murder deceit adultery or theft
Being born with a body means that we're born with a huge bundle of needs that compels and can overwhelm our minds
Fortunately we human beings have the potential to civilize our eating habits by learning to wean ourselves from our passion for the junk food of sights sounds smells etc and look instead for good food within
When we learn to appreciate the joy that comes from generosity honor compassion and trust we see that it's much more fulfilling than the pleasure that comes simply from grabbing what we can for ourselves
We realize that our happiness can't be independent of the happiness of others
We can give one another our belongings our time our love our selves and see it not as a loss but as a mutual gain
Unfortunately these qualities of the heart are conditional for they depend on a tender web of beliefs and feelings  belief in justice and the basic goodness of human nature feelings of trust and affection
When that web breaks as it so easily can the heart can turn vicious
We see this in divorce broken families and society at large
When the security of our food source  the basis of our mental and material wellbeing  gets threatened the finer qualities of the mind can vanish
People who believe in kindness can suddenly seek revenge
Those who espouse nonviolence can suddenly call for war
And those who rule by divisiveness  by making a mockery of compassion prudence and our common humanity  find a willing following for their lawofthejungle agenda
This is why compassion based only on belief or feeling is not enough to guarantee our behavior  and why the practice of training the mind to reach an unconditioned happiness is not a selfish thing
If you value compassion and trust it's an imperative for only an unconditioned happiness can guarantee the purity of your behavior
Independent of space and time it's beyond alteration
No one can threaten its food source for it has no need to feed
When you've had even just a glimpse of this happiness your belief in goodness becomes unshakable
That way other people can totally trust you and you can genuinely trust yourself
You lack for nothing
Purity of heart is to know this one thing
These two are fools
Which two
The one who doesn't see hisher transgression as a transgression and the one who doesn't rightfully pardon another who has confessed hisher transgression
These two are fools
These two are wise
Which two
The one who sees hisher transgression as a transgression and the one who rightfully pardons another who has confessed hisher transgression
These two are wise
It's a cause of growth in the Dhamma and Vinaya of the noble ones when seeing a transgression as such one makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma and exercises restraint in the future
The Buddha succeeded in establishing a religion that has been a genuine force for peace and harmony not only because of the high value he placed on these qualities but also because of the precise instructions he gave on how to achieve them through forgiveness and reconciliation
Central to these instructions is his insight that forgiveness is one thing reconciliation is something else
The Pali word for forgivenesskhamaalso means the earth A mind like the earth is nonreactive and unperturbed
When you forgive me for harming you you decide not to retaliate to seek no revenge
You don't have to like me
You simply unburden yourself of the weight of resentment and cut the cycle of retribution that would otherwise keep us ensnarled in an ugly samsaric wrestling match
This is a gift you can give us both totally on your own without my having to know or understand what you've done
Reconciliation  patisaraniyakamma  means a return to amicability and that requires more than forgiveness
It requires the reestablishing of trust
If I deny responsibility for my actions or maintain that I did no wrong there's no way we can be reconciled
Similarly if I insist that your feelings don't matter or that you have no right to hold me to your standards of right and wrong you won't trust me not to hurt you again
To regain your trust I have to show my respect for you and for our mutual standards of what is and is not acceptable behavior to admit that I hurt you and that I was wrong to do so and to promise to exercise restraint in the future
At the same time you have to inspire my trust too in the respectful way you conduct the process of reconciliation
Only then can our friendship regain a solid footing
Thus there are right and wrong ways of attempting reconciliation those that skillfully meet these requirements for reestablishing trust and those that don't
To encourage right reconciliation among his followers the Buddha formulated detailed methods for achieving it along with a culture of values that encourages putting those methods to use
The methods are contained in the Pali Vinaya's instructions for how monks should confess their offenses to one another how they should seek reconciliation with lay people they have wronged how they should settle protracted disputes and how a full split in the Sangha should be healed
Although directed to monks these instructions embody principles that apply to anyone seeking reconciliation of differences whether personal or political
The first step in every case is an acknowledgement of wrongdoing
When a monk confesses an offense such as having insulted another monk he first admits to having said the insult
Then he agrees that the insult really was an offense
Finally he promises to restrain himself from repeating the offense in the future
A monk seeking reconciliation with a lay person follows a similar pattern with another monk on friendly terms with the lay person acting as mediator
If a dispute has broken the Sangha into factions that have both behaved in unseemly ways then when the factions seek reconciliation they are advised first to clear the air in a procedure called covering over with grass Both sides make a blanket confession of wrongdoing and a promise not to dig up each other's minor offenses
This frees them to focus on the major wrongdoings if any that caused or exacerbated the dispute
To heal a full split in the Sangha the two sides are instructed first to inquire into the root intentions on both sides that led to the split for if those intentions were irredeemably malicious or dishonest reconciliation is impossible
If the group tries to patch things up without getting to the root of the split nothing has really been healed
Only when the root intentions have been shown to be reconcilable and the differences resolved can the Sangha perform the brief ceremony that reestablishes harmony
Pervading these instructions is the realization that genuine reconciliation cannot be based simply on the desire for harmony
It requires a mutual understanding of what actions served to create disharmony and a promise to try to avoid those actions in the future
This in turn requires a clearly articulated agreement about  and commitment to  mutual standards of right and wrong
Even if the parties to a reconciliation agree to disagree their agreement needs to distinguish between right and wrong ways of handling their differences
Yet right and wrong have gotten a bad rap in Western Buddhist circles largely because of the ways in which we have seen right and wrong abused in our own culture  as when one person tries to impose arbitrary standards or meanspirited punishments on others or hypocritically demands that others obey standards that he himself does not
To avoid these abuses some people have recommended living by a nondual vision that transcends attachment to right and wrong
This vision however is open to abuse as well
In communities where it is espoused irresponsible members can use the rhetoric of nonduality and nonattachment to excuse genuinely harmful behavior their victims are left adrift with no commonly accepted standards on which to base their appeals for redress
Even the act of forgiveness is suspect in such a context for what right do the victims have to judge actions as requiring forgiveness or not
All too often the victims are the ones held at fault for imposing their standards on others and not being able to rise above dualistic views
This means that right and wrong have not really been transcended in such a community
They've simply been realigned If you can claim a nondual perspective you're in the right no matter what you've done
If you complain about another person's behavior you're in the wrong
And because this realignment is not openly acknowledged as such it creates an atmosphere of hypocrisy in which genuine reconciliation is impossible
So the solution lies not in abandoning right and wrong but in learning how to use them wisely
Thus the Buddha backed up his methods for reconciliation with a culture of values whereby right and wrong become aids rather than hindrances to reconciliation
To prevent those in the right from abusing their position he counseled that they reflect on themselves before they accuse another of wrongdoing
The checklist of questions he recommended boils down to this Am I free from unreconciled offenses of my own
Am I motivated by kindness rather than vengeance
Am I really clear on our mutual standards Only if they can answer yes to these questions should they bring up the issue
Furthermore the Buddha recommended that they determine to speak only words that are true timely gentle to the point and prompted by kindness
Their motivation should be compassion solicitude for the welfare of all parties involved and the desire to see the wrongdoer rehabilitated together with an overriding desire to hold to fair principles of right and wrong
To encourage a wrongdoer to see reconciliation as a winning rather than a losing proposition the Buddha praised the honest acceptance of blame as an honorable rather than a shameful act not just a means but the means for progress in spiritual practice
As he told his son Rahula the ability to recognize one's mistakes and admit them to others is the essential factor in achieving purity in thought word and deed
Or as he said in the Dhammapada people who recognize their own mistakes and change their ways illumine the world like the moon when freed from a cloud
In addition to providing these incentives for honestly admitting misbehavior the Buddha blocked the paths to denial
Modern sociologists have identified five basic strategies that people use to avoid accepting blame when they've caused harm and it's noteworthy that the Pali teaching on moral responsibility serves to undercut all five
The strategies are to deny responsibility to deny that harm was actually done to deny the worth of the victim to attack the accuser and to claim that they were acting in the service of a higher cause
The Pali responses to these strategies are We are always responsible for our conscious choices
We should always put ourselves in the other person's place
All beings are worthy of respect
We should regard those who point out our faults as if they were pointing out treasure
There are no  repeat no  higher purposes that excuse breaking the basic precepts of ethical behavior
In setting out these standards the Buddha created a context of values that encourages both parties entering into a reconciliation to employ right speech and to engage in the honest responsible selfreflection basic to all Dhamma practice
In this way standards of right and wrong behavior instead of being oppressive or petty engender deep and longlasting trust
In addition to creating the external harmony conducive to Dhamma practice the process of reconciliation thus also becomes an opportunity for inner growth
The Buddha admitted that not all disputes can be reconciled
There are times when one or both parties are unwilling to exercise the honesty and restraint that true reconciliation requires
Even then though forgiveness is still an option
This is why the distinction between reconciliation and forgiveness is so important
It encourages us not to settle for mere forgiveness when the genuine healing of right reconciliation is possible and it allows us to be generous with our forgiveness even when it is not
The Buddha could have concluded his teaching career with some inspiring words on the bliss of nirvana or emptiness but he didn't
He ended with a piece of advice Achieve completion through appamada
Common English translations of through appamada  such as untiringly earnestly with diligence  convey the notion of sustained determined effort
These give the impression that the Buddha's last message was to stick with the practice
Translations of the phrase into various Asian languages though give it a different twist
Sri Lankan commentaries translate appamada as unrelaxed mindfulness Thais interpret it as heedfulness vigilance wariness care
The Canon itself in another context defines appamada as carefully guarding the mind against defiling mental states at the same time strengthening it in terms of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment
In the light of these interpretations the Buddha's final message wasn't simply to persevere
He was saying Don't be complacent
Watch out for danger
Protect the mind's good qualities
Don't get caught with your guard down
These interpretations help make sense of other instances where the Buddha stressed the importance of appamada as when he said that appamada is the path to the Deathless or that all skillful qualities of mind are rooted in appamada converge in appamada and have appamada as the foremost among them
Mere sustained effort can't fill the role of appamada in these passages for effort without wisdom can wreak all sorts of havoc
Vigilance and heedfulness however provide the perspective needed to keep effort on the right track keeping us wary of our potential for causing pointless suffering for ourselves and others and teaching us to trust in our ability  if we take the appropriate care  to bring those sufferings to an end
This combined sense of wariness and trust is based on conviction of the principle of karma that our actions really do make a difference that the difference between causing and not causing suffering really does matter and that the principles of skillful and unskillful action are patterned enough that we really can learn useful lessons from our mistakes
At the same time this combination of wariness and trust is what allows appamada to play such an important role in the practice providing the motivation to get on the path of skillful action in the first place and the inner checks and balances that can keep us on the path all the way to the Deathless
Without a strong sense of trust in the path it's hard to attempt it without a strong sense of the dangers inherent in any conditioned happiness it's easy to fall off
The chief danger of course lies in the mind's creative capacity for selfdeception
But  unlike many other religious figures  the Buddha didn't simply recommend that if we can't trust ourselves we should place our trust in him
Instead he provided ways for us to train ourselves to be trustworthy by investigating the areas where we tend to lie to ourselves most our intentions and the results of our actions
In his first instructions to his son Rahula he told Rahula to reflect on his intentions before acting on them and to carry through with them only if he saw that his intended action would cause no harm
While acting he should reflect on the immediate results of his actions if they were causing any unintended harm he should stop
After acting he should reflect on the longterm results of his actions
If he saw that they actually did cause harm he should resolve never to repeat them
If they didn't he should take joy and continue on the path
These are basic instructions in integrity learning to see where you can and can't trust yourself and  by repeatedly testing yourself against the principle of action and result  making yourself a person you can consistently trust
As you develop this inner integrity it becomes easier to gauge the integrity of any teaching or teacher you encounter for here too the Buddha recommends vigilance testing things through action and result
Gauge teachings by the harm they do or don't create when you put them into practice
Gauge teachers not by their special powers divine authority or enlightened transmission but by the harm they do or don't do through their actions
This pattern of heedful scrutiny applies not only to blatant actions but also to the most subtle workings of the mind your response to sensory stimuli your deepest meditative and nonmeditative experiences
Whatever you're doing  and especially when you don't seem to be doing anything at all  don't be complacent
Look carefully again and again for even the slightest stress or disturbance you might be causing inadvertently and learn how to drop whatever you're doing that's causing it
Keep at this until there's nothing more to be dropped
In this way your sense of appamada helps to ensure that your path goes all the way to the Deathless
To borrow an old analogy if the practice is like a building then appamada is not only the foundation
It also acts as the walls and the roof as well
Sixteen brahman ascetics  students of a teacher named Bavari  approach the Buddha with questions on the goal of his teaching and how to attain it
From their questions it is obvious that some of them at least are quite advanced in their meditation practice
Tradition tells us that the first fifteen of the ascetics attained arahantship immediately after the Buddha answered their questions
As for the sixteenth  Pingiya  the Cula Niddesa tells us that after his questions were answered he attained the Dhamma Eye a term that usually means streamentry
The commentary to the Cula Niddesa however interprets it as meaning that he became a nonreturner
A recurrent image in these dialogues is of life as a raging flood  a flood of birth aging and death sorrow and lamentation stress and suffering
The purpose of spiritual practice is to find a way across the flood to the safety of the far shore
This image explains the frequent reference to finding a way past entanglements  the flotsam and jetsam swept along by the flood that may prevent one's progress and to the desire to be without acquisitions  the unnecessary baggage that could well cause one to sink midstream
There is evidence that these sixteen dialogues were highly regarded right from the very early centuries of the Buddhist tradition
As concise statements of profound teachings particular to Buddhism they sparked an attitude of devotion coupled with the desire to understand their more cryptic passages
Most of the Cula Niddesa a late addition to the Pali canon is devoted to explaining them in detail
Five discourses  one in the Samyutta Nikaya four in the Anguttara  discuss specific verses in the set and a sixth discourse tells of a lay woman who made a practice of rising before dawn to chant the full set of sixteen dialogues
The notes to this translation include material drawn from the Cula Niddesa together with extensive quotations from the five discourses mentioned above
The Buddha wasn't the sort of teacher who simply answered questions
He also taught which questions to ask
He understood the power of questions that they give shape to the holes in your knowledge and force that shape  valid or not  onto the answers you hope will fill up those holes
Even if you use right information to answer a wrong question it can take on the wrong shape
If you then use that answer as a tool you're sure to apply it to the wrong situations and end up with the wrong results
That's why the Buddha was careful to map out a science of questions showing which questions  in what order  lead to freedom and which ones don't
At the same time he gave his talks in a questionandanswer format to make perfectly clear the shape of the questions he was answering
So if you're looking to his teaching for answers and want to get the most out of them you should first be clear about what questions you're bringing to it and check to see if they're in line with the questions the teachings were meant to address
That way your answers won't lead you astray
A case in point is the teaching on notself
Many students interpret this as the Buddha's answer to two of the most frequentlyasked questions in the history of serious thought Who am I and Do I have a true self In the light of these questions the teaching seems to be a noself teaching saying either an unqualified No There is no self or a qualified No no separate self
But the one time the Buddha was asked pointblank if there is a self he refused to answer on the grounds that either a Yes or a No to the question would lead to extreme forms of wrong view that block the path to awakening
A Yes or a qualified No would lead to attachment you'd keep clinging to a sense of self however you defined it
An unqualified No would lead to bewilderment and alienation for you'd feel that your innermost sense of intrinsic worth had been denied
As for the question Who am I the Buddha included it in a list of deadend questions that lead to a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion a writhing a fetter of views
Bound by a fetter of views don't gain freedom from birth aging and death from sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair In other words any attempt to answer either of these questions is unskillful karma blocking the path to true freedom
So if the notself teaching isn't meant to answer these questions what question does it answer
A basic one What is skillful In fact all of the Buddha's teachings are direct or indirect answers to this question
His great insight was that all our knowledge and ignorance all our pleasure and pain come from our actions our karma so the quest for true knowledge and true happiness comes down to a question of skill
In this case the precise question is Is selfidentification skillful And the answer is Only up to a point In the areas where you need a healthy sense of self to act skillfully it's wise to maintain that sense of self
But eventually as skillful behavior becomes second nature and you develop more sensitivity you see that selfidentification even of the most refined sort is harmful and stressful
You have to let it go
So as with any skill there are definite steps along the road to mastery
And because the asking of a question is a type of karma the questions you ask not only have to start with the issue of skill they also have to be skillful  to approach the issue skillfully  themselves
Each step in the Buddha's skill is thus defined by a set of questions that focus your attention and shape your thinking in the most strategic direction
In fact the questions he recommends can be taken as a map to the practice you start out with questions that assume a self and use that assumption to motivate yourself to act more and more skillfully
Only when you reach an appropriate level of skill do the questions turn to deconstruct your sense of self pinpointing the things you identify as your self and showing that they're not really you
When the act of selfidentification runs out of options it stops in midair  and the mind opens to freedom
So if you put the notself teaching in its proper context  this regimen of questions  you'll see that it's not a deadend answer to a deadend question
Instead it's a cuttingedge tool for bringing about liberation
To begin this regimen the Buddha recommends that when you visit a teacher the first questions to ask are these What is skillful
What is unskillful
What if I do it will be for my longterm harm and suffering
Or what if I do it will be for my longterm wellbeing and happiness Although these last two questions bring in the concepts of I and my they aren't the focus of the inquiry
The focus is on doing on developing skill on using your concern for me and my wellbeing to train your actions toward true happiness
The Buddha's answers to these preliminary questions read like a course in wilderness survival
First come the do's and don'ts
A wilderness instructor will tell you If a moose charges you run
If a bear charges you don't The Buddha's corresponding do's and don'ts are ten guidelines dealing with body speech and mind
The guidelines for the body are don't kill don't steal don't engage in illicit sex
For speech don't tell lies don't speak divisively don't speak abusively don't engage in idle chatter
And for the mind abandon greed abandon ill will cultivate right views
These are the Buddha's basic ground rules for the survival of your happiness and many of his teachings simply elaborate on these ten points
But as any wilderness instructor will tell you survival requires more than simple rules of thumb
You have to be alert to the gaps not covered by the rules
You need to learn to use your powers of observation imagination and ingenuity to dig out unskillful habits and develop new habits to fill in the gaps
That way you can live comfortably in the wilderness respectful of the bears and moose and other dangers around you without being overwhelmed by them
The same holds true with the Buddha's skill in addition to following the do's and don'ts you have to learn how to dig out the roots of unskillful behavior so that you can become adept in all areas of your life including the areas where the do's and don'ts don't apply
The roots of unskillful behavior are three greed anger and delusion
Of the three delusion is the most insidious for it blinds you to its very existence
The only way to overcome it is to be relentlessly observant looking at your actions in terms of cause and effect gauging their short and longterm consequences for yourself and others
Again this involves learning to ask the right questions
Each time you're about to act ask yourself This action that I want to do would it lead to selfharm to the harm of others or to both
Is it an unskillful action with painful consequences painful results If you foresee harm don't follow through with it
If not go ahead and act
While acting ask yourself if there are any unexpected bad consequences arising
If there are stop
If there aren't continue with what you're doing
When the action is done look into its actual short and longterm consequences
If an action in word or deed has ended up causing harm inform an experienced fellowpractitioner on the path and listen to that person's advice
If the mistaken action was purely an act of the mind try to develop distaste for that kind of thinking
In both cases resolve never to make the same mistake again and use your ingenuity to make the resolve stick
If however the longterm consequences of the original action were harmless take joy and satisfaction in being on the right path and continue your training
As you stay with this line of questioning it fosters two major results
To begin with you become more sensitive to your actions and respectful of their effects both in the present and over time
Unlike the child who says It was already broken when I stepped on it you're aware of when you break things  physical or mental  and when you don't
At the same time you gain mastery over the patterns of action and effect
You get better and better at handling things without their getting broken
This in turn fosters a healthy sense of self and I based on competence and skill
Your sense of self becomes goodhumored enough to freely admit mistakes mature enough to learn from them quick enough to notice the immediate effects of your actions while patient enough to strive for longterm goals
Confident in its own powers of observation this I also has the humility needed to learn from the experience and advice of others
These two results  sensitivity to the effects of your own actions and a competent sense of self  enable you to settle into a level of mental concentration that's solid and nourishing
You overcome the hindrance of uncertainty as to what's skillful and unskillful and are able to develop the skillful qualities needed to center the mind
As this centered focus develops an interesting thing happens your sensitivity to actions and your sense of self come face to face
You begin to see that self not as a thing but as an activity a process of Imaking and mymaking in which you repeatedly create and recreate your sense of who you are
You also begin to notice that this Imaking even when it produces the most skillful self possible inevitably results in stress
Why
Because any sense of I or mine involves clinging  even when your concentration tunes into a sense of universal self  and all clinging is stressful
So to take the development of skillfulness to its ultimate degree you have to unlearn the habit of Imaking and mymaking
And to do this another set of questions is required
These are the questions that introduce the strategy of notself
The Buddha recommends that you focus on any phenomenon around which you might sense an I or a mine and ask a series of questions starting with Is this constant or inconstant If you identify with your body look at it
You'll see that it grows hungry and thirsty that it's aging destined to grow ill and die
And is anything inconstant easeful or stressful Look at any attempt to find a stable happiness based on the body and you'll see how stressful it is
And is it fitting to regard what's inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
Pursue this line of inquiry inward through layer after layer of physical and mental events until you can zero in on the high command the self that's managing not only the stability of your concentration but also your internal dialogue of questions and answers
Fortified with the sense of stability and calm that come with strong concentration you can start deconstructing that self with no anxiety over what will happen when it's gone
And when the intentions making up that self are deconstructed a strange thing happens
It's as if you had pulled out a strategic thread holding a tapestry together and now the whole thing unravels on its own
Everything that could possibly be clung to falls away
What remains is total absolute freedom  free from time and space from both self and notself for both self and notself are perceptions which that freedom transcends
Even when you've had only a first humbling taste of this freedom you appreciate how adroitly the teaching on notself answers the question of What is skillful And you understand why the Buddha recommends putting the question of Who am I aside
To begin with it wouldn't have taken you to this freedom and could well have stood in freedom's way
Because your I is an activity any attempt to pin it down before you had mastered the processes of activity would have left you pouncing on shadows distracted from the real work at hand
Any attempt to deconstruct your I before it had become healthy and mature would have led to a release neurotic and insecure you'd simply be running away from the messy mismanaged parts of your life
In addition any answer to the question Who am I would be totally inappropriate to describe your newfound freedom for it's a dimension apart where the concepts of I notI am am not do not apply
The only question still concerning you is how to dig out the remaining roots of unskillfulness still latent in the mind
Once they're dug up the Buddha promises nothing stands in the way to full and final freedom
And in that freedom the mind lacks nothing has nothing in excess
There's none of the delusion that would shape the hole of a burning question and none of the greed or aversion that would give it teeth
The only remaining questions are bonus ones how best to take whatever skills you've developed along the way and use them purely for the benefit of the world
And what more could you possibly ask
All phenomena the Buddha once said are rooted in desire
Everything we think say or do  every experience  comes from desire
Even we come from desire
We were reborn into this life because of our desire to be
Consciously or not our desires keep redefining our sense of who we are
Desire is how we take our place in the causal matrix of space and time
The only thing not rooted in desire is nirvana for it's the end of all phenomena and lies even beyond the Buddha's use of the word all But the path that takes you to nirvana is rooted in desire  in skillful desires
The path to liberation pushes the limits of skillful desires to see how far they can go
The notion of a skillful desire may sound strange but a mature mind intuitively pursues the desires it sees as skillful and drops those it perceives as not
Basic in everyone is the desire for happiness
Every other desire is a strategy for attaining that happiness
You want an iPod a sexual partner or an experience of inner peace because you think it will make you happy
Because these secondary desires are strategies they follow a pattern
They spring from an inchoate feeling of lack and limitation they employ your powers of perception to identify the cause of the limitation and they use your powers of creative imagination to conceive a solution to it
But despite their common pattern desires are not monolithic
Each offers a different perception of what's lacking in life together with a different picture of what the solution should be
A desire for a sandwich comes from a perception of physical hunger and proposes to solve it with a Swissonrye
A desire to climb a mountain focuses on a different set of hungers  for accomplishment exhilaration selfmastery  and appeals to a different image of satisfaction
Whatever the desire if the solution actually leads to happiness the desire is skillful
If it doesn't it's not
However what seems to be a skillful desire may lead only to a false or transitory happiness not worth the effort entailed
So wisdom starts as a metadesire to learn how to recognize skillful and unskillful desires for what they actually are
Unskillful desires can create suffering in a variety of ways
Sometimes they aim at the impossible not to grow old or die
Sometimes they focus on possibilities that require distasteful means  such as lying or cheating to get ahead in your job
Or the goal when you get it may not really keep you happy
Even the summit of Everest can be a disappointment
Even when it's not you can't stay there forever
When you leave you're left with nothing but memories which can shift and fade
If you did mean or hurtful things to get there their memory can burn away any pleasure that memories of the summit might hold
In addition desires often pull in opposite directions
Your desire for sex for instance can get in the way of your desire for peace
In fact conflict among desires is what alerts us to how painful desire can be
It's also what has taught each desire how to speak to persuade to argue or bully its way into power
And just because a desire is skillful doesn't mean it's more skillful at arguing its case than the unskillful ones for those can often be the most intransigent the most strident the slickest in having their way
This means that wisdom has to learn how to strategize too to strengthen skillful desires so that less skillful desires will listen to them
That way desires can be trained to work together toward greater happiness
This is how a mature and healthy mind works conducting a dialogue not so much between reason and desire as between responsible desires and irresponsible ones
But even in a mature mind the dialogue often yields compromises that don't really go to the heart snatches of sensual pleasure glimpses of spiritual peace nothing really satisfying and whole
Some people growing impatient with compromise turn a deaf ear to prudent desires and tune into demands for instant gratification  all the sex power and money they can grab
But when the rampage of gratification wears itself out the damage can take lifetimes to set right
Other people try their best to accept the compromise among desires trying to find a measure of peace in not reaching for what they see as impossible
But this peace too depends on a deaf inner ear denying the underlying truth of all desires that a life of endless limitations is intolerable
Both sorts of people share a common assumption that true unlimited happiness lies beyond reach
Their imaginations are so stunted that they can't even conceive of what a true unlimited happiness in this lifetime would be
What made the Buddha special was that he never lowered his expectations
He imagined the ultimate happiness  one so free from limit and lack that it would leave no need for further desire  and then treasured his desire for that happiness as his highest priority
Bringing all his other desires into dialogue with it he explored various strategies until finding one that actually attained that unlimited goal
This strategy became his most basic teaching the four noble truths
Most of us when looking at the four noble truths don't realize that they're all about desire
We're taught that the Buddha gave only one role to desire  as the cause of suffering
Because he says to abandon the cause of suffering it sounds like he's denying any positive role to desire and its constructive companions creativity imagination and hope
This perception though misses two important points
The first is that all four truths speak to the basic dynamic of desire on its own terms perception of lack and limitation the imagination of a solution and a strategy for attaining it
The first truth teaches the basic lack and limitation in our lives  the clinging that constitutes suffering  while the second truth points to the types of desires that lead to clinging desires for sensuality becoming and annihilation
The third truth expands our imagination to encompass the possibility that clinging can be totally overcome
The fourth truth the path to the end of suffering shows how to strategize so as to overcome clinging by abandoning its cause
The second point that's often missed is that the noble truths give two roles to desire depending on whether it's skillful or not
Unskillful desire is the cause of suffering skillful desire forms part of the path to its cessation
Skillful desire undercuts unskillful desire not by repressing it but by producing greater and greater levels of satisfaction and wellbeing so that unskillful desire has no place to stand
This strategy of skillful desire is explicit in the path factor of right effort
What is right effort
There is the case where a monk generates desire endeavors arouses persistence upholds and exerts his intent for the sake of the nonarising of evil unskillful mental qualities that have not yet arisen for the sake of the abandoning of evil unskillful qualities that have arisen for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the maintenance nonconfusion increase plenitude development and culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen
This is called right effort
As this formula shows the crucial elements for replacing unskillful mental qualities with skillful ones are desire persistence and intent
Desire gives the initial impetus and focus for right effort while persistence provides staying power
Intent is the most complex factor of the three
The Pali word here citta also means mind and in this context it means giving your whole mind to the work at hand all your powers of sensitivity intelligence discernment and ingenuity
You don't want your mind to be split on this issue you want all of its powers working together on the same side
These three qualities  desire persistence and intent  underlie every attempt to master a skill
So it's useful in undertaking the path to reflect on how you've used these qualities to master skills in the past
The Buddha made this point in his many similes comparing the person on the path to a master craftsman  a musician carpenter surgeon acrobat cook
As with any skill there are many steps to developing the path but four stand out
The first is to use your ingenuity to fight off the chorus of inner voices trying to dissuade you from making the effort to be skillful in the first place
These voices are like devious lawyers representing strongly entrenched interests all your threatened unskillful desires
You have to be quick and alert in countering their arguments for they can come from all sides sounding honest and wise even though they're not
Here are some of the arguments these voices may propose along with a few effective responses
Trying to manipulate your desires like this is unnatural
Actually you're already manipulating your desires all the time when you choose one desire over another so you might as well learn to do it skillfully
And there are plenty of people out there only too happy to manipulate your desires for you  think of all the advertisements clamoring for your attention  so it's better to put the manipulation in more trustworthy hands your own

Trying to change your desires is an attack on your very self
This argument works only if you give your sense of self  which is really just a grab bag of desires  more solidity than it deserves
You can turn the argument on its head by noting that since your self is a perpetually changing lineup of strategies for happiness you might as well try changing it in a direction more likely to achieve true happiness
To think of skillful and unskillful desires is dualistic and judgmental
You don't want nondualistic mechanics working on your car or nondualistic surgeons operating on your brain
You want people who can tell what's skillful from what's not
If you really value your happiness you'll demand the same discernment in the person most responsible for it yourself
It's too goaloriented
Just accept things as they are in the present
Every desire tells you that things in the present are limited and lacking
You either accept the desire or accept the lack
To accept both at once is to deny that either has any real truth
To try to dwell peacefully in the tension between the two  in a path of no craving to be rid of either  is what the Buddha called limited equanimity and what one Thai forest master called the equanimity of a cow
It's a futile attempt to resist such a divine and mysterious power
Desire seems overwhelming and mysterious simply because we don't know our minds
And where would we be if we kept slapping the term divine or cosmic on forces we didn't understand
Arguing with unskillful desires is too much work
Consider the alternative an endless wandering from one set of limitations to another continually seeking happiness and yet finding it always slipping from your grasp repeatedly taking a stance for one desire one moment and shifting to another desire the next
Right effort at least gives you one steady place to stand
It's not adding a more demanding desire to the chaotic mix it's offering a way to sort out the mess
And the Buddha's path holds open the hope of an unlimited happiness preceded by increasingly refined and reliable levels of happiness all along the path
In short his alternative is actually the one that's more enjoyable and involves less work
Once you've silenced these voices the next step is to take responsibility for your actions and their consequences
This requires being willing to learn from your mistakes
Several years ago a sociologist studied students in a neurosurgery program to see what qualities separated those who succeeded from those who failed
He found ultimately that two questions in his interviews pointed to the crucial difference
He would ask the students Do you ever make mistakes
If so what is the worst mistake you've ever made Those who failed the program would inevitably answer that they rarely made mistakes or else would blame their mistakes on factors beyond their control
Those who succeeded in the program not only admitted to many mistakes but also volunteered information on what they would do not to repeat those mistakes in the future
The Buddha encouraged this same mature attitude in his first instructions to his son Rahula
He told Rahula to focus on his intentions before acting and on the results of his actions both while he was doing them and after they were done
If Rahula saw that his intentions would lead to harm for himself or others he shouldn't act on them
If he saw that his thoughts words or deeds actually produced harm he should stop them and resolve never to repeat them without at the same time falling into remorse
If on the other hand he saw no harmful consequences from his actions he should take joy in his progress on the path and use that joy to nourish his continued practice
Although the Buddha aimed these instructions at a sevenyearold child the pattern they outline informs every level of the practice
The whole path to awakening consists of sticking to the desire always to do the most skillful thing it develops as your sense of skillful gets more refined
If you act on an unskillful desire take responsibility for the consequences using them to educate that desire as to where it went wrong
Although desires can be remarkably stubborn they share a common goal  happiness  and this can form the common ground for an effective dialogue If a desire doesn't really produce happiness it contradicts its reason for being
The best way to make this point is to keep tracing the thread from the desire to its resulting actions and from the actions to their consequences
If the desire aimed at a happiness that caused suffering to others notice how their corresponding desire for happiness leads them to undermine the happiness you sought
If the desire aimed at a happiness based on things that can age grow ill die or leave you notice how that fact sets you up for a fall
Then notice how the distress that comes from acting on this sort of desire is universal
It's not just you
Everyone who has acted is acting or will act on that desire has suffered in the past is suffering right now and will suffer in the future
There's no way around it
Reflecting this way helps to weaken the why me tendency that aggravates suffering and makes you cling fiercely to the desire causing it
It also helps develop two important attitudes that strengthen skillful desires a sense of dismay over the universality of suffering and an attitude of heedfulness to avoid being duped by that particular type of desire again
Unskillful desires don't really give way though until you can show that other less troublesome desires actually can produce greater happiness
This is why the Buddha emphasizes learning how to appreciate the rewards of a virtuous generous life the joy in fostering the happiness of others the solid dignity and selfworth in doing the hard but the right thing
It's also why his path centers on states of blissful refreshing concentration
Accessing this refreshment in your meditation gives you immediate visceral proof that the Buddha was no killjoy
The desires he recommends really do produce a happiness that can give you the strength to keep on choosing the skillful path
That's the next step patiently and persistently sticking with the desire to do the skillful thing in all situations
This isn't a matter of sheer effort
As any good sports coach will tell you hours of practice don't necessarily guarantee results
You have to combine your persistence with intent sensitivity discernment ingenuity
Keep an eye out for how to do things more efficiently
Try to see patterns in what you do
At the same time introduce play and variety into your practice so that the plateaus don't get boring and the downs don't get you down
The Buddha makes similar points in his meditation instructions
Once you've mastered a state of concentration see where it still contains elements of stress
Then look for patterns to that stress what are you doing to cause it
Find ways to gladden the mind when it's down to liberate it from its confinements to steady it when it gets restless
In this way as you learn to enjoy rising to the challenges of meditation you also gain familiarity with subtle patterns of cause and effect in the mind
The fourth step once you've mastered those patterns is to push their limits
Again this isn't simply a matter of increased effort
It's more a rekindling of your imagination to explore the unexpected sidealleys of cause and effect
A famous cellist once said that his most exhilarating concert was one in which he broke a string on his cello and decided to finish the piece he was playing on the remaining strings refingering it on the spot
The most obvious strings in meditation are the specific techniques for fostering stillness and insight but the more interesting ones are the assumptions that underlie the quest for skill lack strategy dialogue your sense of self
Can you learn to do without them
There comes a point in your meditation when the only way for greater happiness is to begin questioning these assumptions
And this leads to some intriguing paradoxes If desire springs from a sense of lack or limitation what happens to desire when it produces a happiness with no lack or limitation at all
What's it like not to need desire
What would happen to your inner dialogue your sense of self
And if desire is how you take your place in space and time what happens to space and time when desire is absent
The Buddha encouraged these queries by describing the awakened person as so undefined and unlimited that he or she couldn't be located in the present life or be described after this life as existing not existing neither or both
This may sound like an abstract and unreachable goal but the Buddha demonstrated its human face in the example of his person
Having pushed past the limits of cause and effect he was still able to function admirably within them in this life happy in even the most difficult circumstances compassionately teaching people of every sort
And there's his testimony that not only monks and nuns but also lay people  even children  had developed their skillful desires to the point where they gained a taste of awakening as well
So imagine that
And listen to any desire that would take you in that direction for that's your path to true happiness
When the Buddha told Ananda that the entirety of the practice lies in having an admirable friend he wasn't saying something warm and reassuring about the compassion of others
He was pointing out three uncomfortable truths  about delusion and trust  that call for clear powers of judgment
The first truth is that you can't really trust yourself to see through your delusion on your own
When you're deluded you don't know you're deluded
You need some trustworthy outside help to point it out to you
This is why when the Buddha advised the Kalamas to know for themselves one of the things he told them to know for themselves was how wise people would judge their behavior
When he advised his son Rahula to examine his own actions as he would his face in a mirror he said that if Rahula saw that his actions had caused any harm he should talk it over with a knowledgeable friend on the path
That way he could learn how to be open with others  and himself  about his mistakes and at the same time tap into the knowledge that his friend had gained
He wouldn't have to keep reinventing the dharma wheel on his own
So if you really want to become skillful in your thoughts words and deeds you need a trustworthy friend or teacher to point out your blind spots
And because those spots are blindest around your unskillful habits the primary duty of a trustworthy friend is to point out your faults  for only when you see your faults can you correct them only when you correct them are you benefiting from your friend's compassion in pointing them out
In passing judgment on your faults an admirable friend is like a trainer
Once when a horse trainer came to see the Buddha the Buddha asked him how he trained his horses
The trainer said that some horses responded to gentle training others to harsh training others required both harsh and gentle training but if a horse didn't respond to either type of training he'd kill the horse to maintain the reputation of his teachers' lineage
Then the trainer asked the Buddha how he trained his students and the Buddha replied In the same way Some students responded to gentle criticism others to harsh criticism others to a mixture of the two but if a student didn't respond to either type of criticism he'd kill the student
This shocked the horse trainer but then the Buddha explained what he meant by killing He wouldn't train the student any further which essentially killed the student's opportunity to grow in the practice
So the first prerequisite in maintaining an admirable friend is being willing to take criticism both gentle and harsh
This is why the Buddha told his disciples not to teach for money for the person paying is the one who determines what's taught and people rarely pay for the criticism they need to hear
But even if the teacher is teaching for free you run into the Buddha's second uncomfortable truth You can't open your heart to just anyone
Our powers of judgment really do have power and because that power can cause longterm help or harm you have to take care in choosing your friend
Don't fall into the easy trap of being judgmental or nonjudgmental  judgmental in trusting your kneejerk likes or dislikes nonjudgmental in trusting that every dharma teacher would be equally beneficial as a guide
Instead be judicious in choosing the person whose judgments you're going to take on as your own
This of course sounds like a Catch You need a good teacher to help develop your powers of judgment but welldeveloped powers of judgment to recognize who a good teacher might be
And even though there's no foolproof way out of the catch  after all you can master a foolproof way and still be a fool  there is a way if you're willing to learn from experience
And fortunately the Buddha advised on how to develop your powers of judgment so that you know what to look for along the way
In fact his recommendations for how to choose an admirable friend are a preliminary exercise in discernment learning how to develop judicious powers of judgment so that you too can become an admirable friend first to yourself and then to the people around you
The first step in being judicious is understanding what it means to judge in a helpful way
Think not of a Supreme Court justice sitting on her bench passing a final verdict of guilt or innocence but of a piano teacher listening to you play
She's not passing a final verdict on your potential as a pianist
Instead she's judging a work in progress listening to your intention for the performance listening to your execution of that intention and then deciding whether it works
If it doesn't she has to figure out if the problem is with the intention or the execution make helpful suggestions and then let you try again
She keeps this up until she's satisfied with your performance
The important principle is that she never directs her judgments at you as a person
Instead she has to stay focused on your actions to keep looking for better ways to raise them to higher and higher standards
At the same time you're learning from her how to judge your own playing thinking more carefully about your intention listening more carefully to your execution developing higher standards for what works and learning to think outside of the box for ways to improve
Most important of all you're learning to focus your judgment on your performance and not on yourself
This way  when there's less you invested in your habits  you're more willing to recognize unskillful habits and to drop them in favor of more skillful ones
Of course when you and your teacher are judging your improvement on a particular piece it's part of a longer process of judging how well the relationship is working
She has to judge over time if you're benefiting from her guidance and so do you
But again neither of you is judging the worth of the other person
She's simply deciding  based on your progress  whether it's worth her while to continue taking you on as a student
You're judging the extent to which her recommendations are actually helping you perform more effectively
If either of you decides to terminate the relationship it shouldn't be because she's a bad teacher or you're a bad student but simply that she's not the teacher for you or you're not the student for her
In the same way when you're evaluating a potential dharma teacher remember that there's no Final Judgment in Buddhism
You want someone who will evaluate your actions as a work in progress and you have to apply the same standard to him or her
And you're not trying to take on the superhuman role of evaluating that person's essential worth
You're simply judging whether his or her actions embody the kinds of skills you'd like to develop and the types of mental qualities  which are also a kind of action  that you'd trust in a trainer or guide
After all the only way we know anything about other people is through their actions so that's as far as our judgments can fairly extend
At the same time though because we're judging whether we want to internalize another person's standards it's not unfair to pass judgment on what they're doing
It's for our own protection
And it's for the sake of our protection that the Buddha recommended looking for two qualities in a teacher wisdom and integrity
To gauge these qualities though takes time and sensitivity which is why the Buddha also advised that you be willing to spend time with the person and try to be really observant of how that person acts
Once when King Pasenadi came to see the Buddha a group of naked ascetics passed nearby
The king went over got down on one knee and offered them homage
Then he returned to the Buddha and asked Are those ascetics worthy of homage The Buddha replied that you could fairly answer that question only after having spent time with them and only if you were really observant
The king praised the Buddha's caution and added Those men are actually my spies
They're on the way back from having scouted out the enemy and soon  after bathing and clothing themselves  they'll be back enjoying themselves with their wives So you can't judge people just by first impressions
The appearance of wisdom is easy to fake
In the past people were impressed by extreme austerities at present the ads for dharma books and retreats show that we're attracted to other surface criteria but the principle is the same
To save time and needless pain in the search however the Buddha noted four early warning signs indicating that potential teachers don't have the wisdom or integrity to merit your trust
The warning signs for untrustworthy wisdom are two
The first is when people show no gratitude for the help they've received  and this applies especially to help from their parents and teachers
People with no gratitude don't appreciate goodness don't value the effort that goes into being helpful and so will probably not put out that effort themselves
The second warning sign is that they don't hold to the principle of karma
They either deny that we have freedom of choice or else teach that one person can clear away another person's bad karma from the past
People of this sort are unlikely to put forth the effort to be genuinely skillful and so are untrustworthy guides
Lack of integrity also has two warning signs
The first is when people feel no shame in telling a deliberate lie
As the Buddha once said There's no evil that such a person might not do The second warning sign is when they don't conduct arguments in a fair and aboveboard manner misrepresenting their opponents pouncing on the other side's minor lapses not acknowledging the valid points the other side has made
People of this sort the Buddha said aren't even worth talking to much less taking on as teachers
As for people who don't display these early warning signs the Buddha gave advice on how to gauge wisdom and integrity in their actions over time
One question he'd have you ask yourself is whether a teacher's actions betray any of the greed anger or delusion that would inspire him to claim knowledge of something he didn't know or to tell another person to do something that was not in that person's best interests
To test for a teacher's wisdom the Buddha advised noticing how a potential teacher responds to questions about what's skillful and not and how well he or she handles adversity
To test for integrity you look for virtue in daytoday activities and purity in the teacher's dealings with others
Does this person make excuses for breaking the precepts bringing them down to his level of behavior rather than lifting his behavior to theirs
Does he take unfair advantage of other people
If so you'd better find another teacher
This however is where the Buddha's third uncomfortable truth comes in You can't be a fair judge of another person's integrity until you've developed some of your own
This is probably the most uncomfortable truth of all for it requires that you accept responsibility for your judgments
If you want to test other people's potential for good guidance you have to pass a few tests yourself
Again it's like listening to a pianist
The better you are as a pianist the better your ability to judge the other person's playing
Fortunately the Buddha also gave guidance on how to develop integrity and it doesn't require that you start out innately good
All it requires is a measure of truthfulness and maturity the realization that your actions make all the difference in your life so you have to take care in how you act the willingness to admit your mistakes both to yourself and to others and the willingness to learn from your mistakes so you don't keep repeating them
As the Buddha taught Rahula before you act in thought word or deed look at the results you expect from your action
If it's going to harm you or anyone else don't do it
If you don't foresee any harm go ahead and act
While you're acting check to see if you're causing any unforeseen harm
If you are stop
If not continue until you're done
After you're done look at the longterm results of your action
If it caused any harm talk it over with someone else on the path develop a sense of shame around the mistake and resolve not to repeat it
If it caused no harm take joy in the fact and keep on training
As you train yourself in this way you learn four important principles about exercising judgment in a healthy way
First you're judging your actions not yourself
If you can learn to separate your sense of self from your actions you tend to be more willing to admit your mistakes to yourself and less defensive when other people point them out to you
This principle also applies to the sense of shame the Buddha recommends you feel toward your mistakes
It's directed not at you but at the action  the sort of shame felt by a person of high selfesteem who's realized she's done something beneath her and doesn't want to do it again
Shame of this sort is not debilitating
It simply helps you remember the lesson you've learned
This relates to the second important principle about healthy judgment that it requires mindfulness in the original meaning of the term keeping something in mind
Mindfulness of this sort is essential in developing your judgment for it helps you remember the lessons you've learned over time as to what works and what doesn't
Because we often try our best to forget our mistakes we have to train our mindfulness repeatedly to remember the lessons we learned from those mistakes so that we don't have to keep learning them over and over again
Sometimes you hear mindfulness defined as a nonjudging state of mind but that's not how the Buddha understood it
He often compared mindfulness to a gatekeeper in the way it helps you judge what should and shouldn't be done
So mindfulness actually plays an essential role in developing your powers of judgment
As you keep trying to apply the lessons you've learned you discover the third principle about healthy judgment that the lessons you learn from your mistakes if you act on them really do make a difference
The present moment is not so arbitrarily new that lessons from yesterday are useless today
You may keep finding new subtleties in how to apply past lessons but the general outlines of how suffering is caused and how it can be ended always remain the same
The fourth principle is that you learn how to benefit from the judgments of others
When you've chosen a person to confide in you want to be open to that person's criticisms but you also want to put his or her suggestions for improvement to the test
As the Buddha told his aunt Gotami you can test genuine dharma by seeing the results it gives when put it into action
If it leads to such admirable qualities as being dispassionate modest content energetic and unburdensome it's the genuine thing
The person who teaches you this dharma has passed at least that test for being a genuine friend
And you're learning more and more how to judge for yourself
Some people might object that it's selfish to focus on finding friends you can benefit from and inhumane to keep testing people to see if they fit the bill
But that's missing the point
The benefits that come from this sort of friendship don't end with you and in testing your friend you're also testing yourself
As you assimilate the qualities of an admirable friend you become the sort of person who can offer admirable friendship to others
Again it's like practicing under a good piano teacher
As you improve as a pianist you're not the only one who can enjoy your playing
The better you get the more joy you bring to others
The better you understand the process of playing the more effectively you can teach anyone who sincerely wants to learn from you
This is how teaching lineages of high caliber get established for the benefit of the world
So when you look for an admirable friend you're tapping into a long lineage of admirable friends stretching back to the Buddha and helping it to extend into the future
Joining this lineage may require accepting some uncomfortable truths such as the need to learn from criticism and to take responsibility for your actions
But if you're up for the challenge you learn to take this human power of judgment  which when untrained can so easily cause harm  and train it for the greater good
Many people tell us that the Buddha taught two different types of meditation  mindfulness meditation and concentration meditation
Mindfulness meditation they say is the direct path while concentration practice is the scenic route that you take at your own risk because it's very easy to get caught there and you may never get out
But when you actually look at what the Buddha taught he never separates these two practices
They are both parts of a single whole
Every time he explains mindfulness and its place in the path he makes it clear that the purpose of mindfulness practice is to lead the mind into a state of Right Concentration  to get the mind to settle down and to find a place where it can really feel stable at home where it can look at things steadily and see them for what they are
Part of the two practices issue centers on how we understand the word jhana which is a synonym for Right Concentration
Many of us have heard that jhana is a very intense trancelike state that requires intense staring and shutting out the rest of the world
It sounds nothing like mindfulness at all
But if you look in the Canon where the Buddha describes jhana that's not the kind of state he's talking about
To be in jhana is to be absorbed very pleasurably in the sense of the whole body altogether
A very broad sense of awareness fills the entire body
One of the images the Buddha used to describe this state is that of a person kneading water into dough so that the water permeates throughout the flour
Another is a lake in which a cool spring comes welling up and suffuses the entire lake
Now when you're with the body as a whole you're very much in the present moment
You're right there all the time
As the Buddha says the fourth jhana  in which the body is filled with bright awareness  is the point where mindfulness and equanimity become pure
So there should be no problem in combining mindfulness practice with the wholebody awareness that gets very settled and still
In fact the Buddha himself combines them in his description of the first four steps of breath meditation being aware of long breathing being aware of short breathing being aware of the whole body as you breathe in and breathe out and then calming the sensation of the breath within the body
This as the texts tell us is basic mindfulness practice
It's also a basic concentration practice
You're getting into the first jhana  Right Concentration  right there at the same time that you're practicing Right Mindfulness
To see how Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration help each other in the practice we can look at the three stages of mindfulness practice given in the Foundations of Mindfulness Sutta
Take the body as an example
The first stage is to keep focused on the body in and of itself putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world
What this means is taking the body as a body without thinking about it in terms of what it means or what it can do in the world
It could be either good or bad looking
It could be strong or weak
It could be agile or clumsy  all the issues we tend to worry about when we think about ourselves
The Buddha says to put those issues aside
Just be with the body in and of itself sitting right here
You close your eyes  what do you have
There's the sensation of bodiness that you're sitting with
That's your frame of reference
Try to stay with it
Keep bringing the mind back to this sense of the body until it gets the message and begins to settle down
In the beginning of the practice you find the mind going out to grasp this or that so you note it enough to tell it to let go return to the body and hold on there
Then it goes out to grasp something else so you tell it to let go come back and latch onto the body again
Eventually though you reach a point where you can actually grasp hold of the breath and you don't let go okay
You keep holding onto it
From that point on whatever else that happens to come into your awareness is like something coming up and brushing the back of your hand
You don't have to note it
You stay with the body as your basic frame of reference
Other things come and go you're aware of them but you don't drop the breath and go grasping after them
This is when you really have established the body as a solid frame of reference
As you do this you develop three qualities of mind
One is mindfulness
The term mindfulness means being able to remember to keep something in mind
In the case of establishing the body as a frame of reference it means being able to remember where you're supposed to be  with the body  and you don't let yourself forget
The second quality alertness means being aware of what is actually going on in the present
Are you with the body
Are you with the breath
Is the breath comfortable
Simply notice what's actually happening in the present moment
We tend to confuse mindfulness with alertness but actually they are two separate things mindfulness means being able to remember where you want to keep your awareness alertness means being aware of what's actually happening
The third quality ardency means two things
One if you realize that the mind has wandered off you bring it right back
Immediately
You don't let it wander around sniffing the flowers
Two when the mind is with its proper frame of reference ardency means trying to be as sensitive as possible to what's going on  not just drifting in the present moment but really trying to penetrate more and more into the subtle details of what's actually happening with the breath or the mind
When you have these three qualities focused on the body in and of itself you can't help but settle down and get really comfortable with the body in the present moment
That's when you're ready for the second stage in the practice which is described as being aware of the phenomenon of origination and the phenomenon of passing away
This is a stage where you're trying to understand cause and effect as they happen in the present
In terms of concentration practice once you've got the mind to settle down you want to understand the interaction of cause and effect in the process of concentration so that you can get it to settle down more solidly for longer periods of time in all sorts of situations on the cushion and off
To do this you have to learn about how things arise and pass away in the mind not by simply watching them but by actually getting involved in their arising and passing away
You can see this in the Buddha's instructions for dealing with the hindrances
In the first stage he says to be aware of the hindrances as they come and go
Some people think that this is an exercise in choiceless awareness where you don't try to will the mind in any direction where you simply sit and watch willynilly whatever comes into the mind
In actual practice though the mind isn't yet ready for that
What you need at this stage is a fixed point of reference for evaluating the events in the mind just as when you're trying to gauge the motion of clouds through the sky You need to choose a fixed point  like a roof gable or a light pole  at which to stare so that you can get a sense of which direction and how fast the clouds are moving
The same with the coming and going of sensual desire ill will etc in the mind You have to try to maintain a fixed reference point for the mind  like the breath  if you want to be really sensitive to when there are hindrances in the mind  getting in the way of your reference point  and when there are not
Suppose that anger is interfering with your concentration
Instead of getting involved in the anger you try simply to be aware of when it's there and when it's not
You look at the anger as an event in and of itself  as it comes as it goes
But you don't stop there
The next step  as you're still working at focusing on the breath  is recognizing how anger can be made to go away
Sometimes simply watching it is enough to make it go away sometimes it's not and you have to deal with it in other ways such as arguing with the reasoning behind the anger or reminding yourself of the drawbacks of anger
In the course of dealing with it you have to get your hands dirty
You've got to try and figure out why the anger is coming why it's going how you can get it out of there because you realize that it's an unskillful state
And this requires that you improvise
Experiment
You've got to chase your ego and impatience out of the way so that you can have the space to make mistakes and learn from them so that you can develop a skill in dealing with the anger
It's not just a question of hating the anger and trying to push it away or of loving the anger and welcoming it
These approaches may give results in the short run but in the long run they're not especially skillful
What's called for here is the ability to see what the anger is composed of how can you take it apart
One technique I like to use  when anger is present and you're in a situation where you don't immediately have to react to people  is simply to ask yourself in a goodnatured way Okay why are you angry Listen to what the mind has to say
Then pursue the matter But why are you angry at that
 Of course I'm angry
After all Well why are you angry at that If you keep this up the mind will eventually admit to something stupid like the assumption that people shouldn't be that way  even though they blatantly are that way  or that people should act in line with your standards or whatever the mind is so embarrassed about that it tries to hide from you
But finally if you keep probing it'll fess up
You gain a lot of understanding of the anger that way and this can really weaken its power over you
In terms of the positive qualities like mindfulness serenity and concentration it's a similar sort of thing
First you're aware of when they're there and when they're not and then you realize that when they're there it's much nicer than when they're not
So you try to figure out how they come how they go
You do this by consciously trying to maintain that state of mindfulness and concentration
If you're really observant  and this is what it's all about being observant  you begin to see that there are skillful ways of maintaining the state without getting all tied up in failure or success in doing it without letting the desire for a settled state of mind actually get in the way of the mind's settling down
You do want to succeed but you need a balanced attitude toward failure and success so that you can learn from them
Nobody's keeping score or taking grades
You're here to understand for your own sake
So this process of developing your foundation of mindfulness or developing your frame of reference is not just watching It's more a participation in the process of arising and passing away  actually playing with the process  so that you can learn from experience how cause and effect work in the mind
Once when I was in college I wrote home complaining about the food and my mother sent me a Julia Child cookbook
In the book was a section on dealing with eggs in which she said that the sign of a really good cook is knowing eggs
And so I took an egg out
You can watch an egg  you can learn certain things just by watching it but you don't learn very much
To learn about eggs you have to put them in a pan and try to make something out of them
If you do this long enough you begin to understand that there are variations in eggs and there are certain ways that they react to heat and ways that they react to oil or butter or whatever
And so by actually working with the egg and trying to make something out of it you really come to understand eggs
It's similar with clay you really don't know clay until you become a potter and actually try to make something out of the clay
And it's the same with the mind unless you actually try to make something out of the mind try to get a mental state going and keep it going you don't really know your own mind
You don't know the processes of cause and effect within the mind
There has to be a factor of actual participation in the process
That way you can understand it
This all comes down to being observant and developing a skill
The essence of developing a skill means two things
One you're aware of a situation as it is given and two you're aware of what you put into it
When the Buddha talks about causation he says that every situation is shaped from two directions  the causes coming in from the past and the causes you're putting into the present
You need to be sensitive to both
If you aren't sensitive to what you're putting into a situation you'll never develop any kind of skill
As you're aware of what you're doing you also look at the results
If something isn't right you go back and change what you've done  keeping at this until you get the results you want
And in the process you learn a great deal from the clay the eggs or whatever you're trying to deal with skillfully
The same holds true with the mind
Of course you could learn something about the mind by trying to get it into any sort of a state but for the purpose of developing really penetrating insight a state of stable balanced mindful concentration is the best kind of souffl or pot you want to make with the mind
The factors of pleasure ease and sometimes even rapture that arise when the mind really settles down help you stay comfortably in the present moment with a low center of gravity
Once the mind is firmly settled there you have something to look at for a long period of time so that you can see what it's made up of
In the typical unbalanced state of the mind things are appearing and disappearing too fast for you to notice them clearly
But as the Buddha notes when you get really skilled at jhana you can step back a bit and really see what you've got
You can see say where there's an element of attachment where there's an element of stress or even where there's inconstancy within your balanced state
This is where you begin to gain insight as you see the natural cleavage lines among the different factors of the mind and in particular the cleavage line between awareness and the objects of awareness
Another advantage to this mindful concentrated state is that as you feel more and more at home in it you begin to realize that it's possible to have happiness and pleasure in life without depending on things outside of yourself  people relationships approval from others or any of the issues that come from being part of the world
This realization helps pry loose your attachments to things outside
Some people are afraid of getting attached to a state of calm but actually it's very important that you get attached here so that you begin to settle down and begin to undo your other attachments
Only when this attachment to calm is the only one left do you begin work on loosening it up as well
Still another reason why solid concentration is necessary for insight is that when discernment comes to the mind the basic lesson it will teach you is that you've been stupid
You've held onto things even though deep down inside you should have known better
Now try telling that to people when they're hungry and tired
They'll come right back with You're stupid too and that's the end of the discussion
Nothing gets accomplished
But if you talk to someone who has had a full meal and feels rested you can broach all kinds of topics without risking a fight
It's the same with the mind
When it has been well fed with the rapture and ease coming from concentration it's ready to learn
It can accept your criticisms without feeling threatened or abused
So
This is the role that concentration practice plays in this second stage of mindfulness practice It gives you something to play with a skill to develop so you can begin to understand the factors of cause and effect within the mind
You begin to see the mind as just a flux of causes with their effects coming back at you
Your ideas are part of this flux of cause and effect your emotions your sense of who you are
This insight begins to loosen your attachments to the whole process
What finally happens is that the mind reaches a third level of mindfulness practice where the mind comes to a state of perfect equilibrium  where you've developed this state of concentration this state of equilibrium to the point where you don't have to put anything more into it
In the Foundations of Mindfulness Sutta this is described as simply being aware  if you are using the body as your frame of reference being aware that There is a body just enough for knowledge and mindfulness without being attached to anything in the world
Other texts call this the state of nonfashioning The mind reaches the point where you begin to realize that all causal processes in the mind  including the processes of concentration and insight  are like tar babies
If you like them you get stuck if you don't like them you get stuck
So what are you going to do
You have to get to the point where you're not really contributing anything more to the present moment
You unravel your participation in it
That's when things open up in the mind
Many people want to jump right in and begin at this level of not adding anything to the present moment but it doesn't work that way
You can't be sensitive to the subtle things the mind is habitually adding to the present until you've consciously tried to alter what you're adding
As you get more and more skilled you get more sensitive to the subtle things you didn't realize you were doing
You reach a point of disenchantment where you realize that the most skillful way of dealing with the present is to strip away all levels of participation that cause even the slightest bit of stress in the mind
You start dismantling the levels of participation that you learned in the second stage of the practice to the point where things reach equilibrium on their own where there's letting go and release
So it's important to realize that there are these three stages to mindfulness practice and to understand the role that deliberate concentration practice plays in taking you through the first two
Without aiming at Right Concentration you can't develop the skills needed for understanding the mind  for it's in the process of mastering the skill of mindful concentration that true insight arises
Just as you don't really understand a herd of cattle until you've successfully herded them  learning from all your failures along the way  you can't get a sense of all the causeandeffect currents running through the mind until you've learned from your failures and successes in getting them to gather in a state of concentrated mindfulness and mindful concentration
And only when you've really understood and mastered these currents  the currents of craving that cause suffering and stress and the currents of mindfulness and concentration that form the Path  can you let them go and find freedom from them
We all know what happens when a fire goes out
The flames die down and the fire is gone for good
So when we first learn that the name for the goal of Buddhist practice nibbana literally means the extinguishing of a fire it's hard to imagine a deadlier image for a spiritual goal utter annihilation
It turns out though that this reading of the concept is a mistake in translation not so much of a word as of an image
What did an extinguished fire represent to the Indians of the Buddha's day
Anything but annihilation
According to the ancient Brahmans when a fire was extinguished it went into a state of latency
Rather than ceasing to exist it became dormant and in that state  unbound from any particular fuel  it became diffused throughout the cosmos
When the Buddha used the image to explain nibbana to the Indian Brahmans of his day he bypassed the question of whether an extinguished fire continues to exist or not and focused instead on the impossibility of defining a fire that doesn't burn thus his statement that the person who has gone totally out can't be described
However when teaching his own disciples the Buddha used nibbana more as an image of freedom
Apparently all Indians at the time saw burning fire as agitated dependent and trapped both clinging and being stuck to its fuel as it burned
To ignite a fire one had to seize it
When fire let go of its fuel it was freed released from its agitation dependence and entrapment  calm and unconfined
This is why Pali poetry repeatedly uses the image of extinguished fire as a metaphor for freedom
In fact this metaphor is part of a pattern of fire imagery that involves two other related terms as well
Upadana or clinging also refers to the sustenance a fire takes from its fuel
Khandha means not only one of the five heaps that define all conditioned experience but also the trunk of a tree
Just as fire goes out when it stops clinging and taking sustenance from wood so the mind is freed when it stops clinging to the khandhas
Thus the image underlying nibbana is one of freedom
The Pali commentaries support this point by tracing the word nibbana to its verbal root which means unbinding What kind of unbinding
The texts describe two levels
One is the unbinding in this lifetime symbolized by a fire that has gone out but whose embers are still warm
This stands for the enlightened arahant who is conscious of sights and sounds sensitive to pleasure and pain but freed from passion aversion and delusion
The second level of unbinding symbolized by a fire so totally out that its embers have grown cold is what the arahant experiences after this life
All input from the senses cools away and heshe is totally freed from even the subtlest stresses and limitations of existence in space and time
The Buddha insists that this level is indescribable even in terms of existence or nonexistence because words work only for things that have limits
All he really says about it  apart from images and metaphors  is that one can have foretastes of the experience in this lifetime and that it's the ultimate happiness something truly worth knowing
So the next time you watch a fire going out see it not as a case of annihilation but as a lesson in how freedom is to be found in letting go
If you're born into an Asian Buddhist family the first thing your parents will teach you about Buddhism is not a philosophical tenet but a gesture of respect how to place your hands in añjali palmtopalm over your heart when you encounter a Buddha image a monk or a nun
Obviously the gesture will be mechanical at first
Over time though you'll learn the respectful attitude that goes with it
If you're quick to pick it up your parents will consider it a sign of intelligence for respect is basic to any ability to learn
As you get older they may teach you the symbolism of the gesture that your hands form a lotus bud representing your heart which you are holding out to be trained in how to become wise
Ultimately as you grow more familiar with the fruits of Buddhist practice your parents hope that your respect will turn into reverence and veneration
In this way they give a quick answer to the old Western question of which side of Buddhism  the philosophy or the religion  comes first
In their eyes the religious attitude of respect is needed for any philosophical understanding to grow
And as far as they're concerned there's no conflict between the two
In fact they're mutually reinforcing
This stands in marked contrast to the typical Western attitude which sees an essential discrepancy between Buddhism's religious and philosophical sides
The philosophy seems so rational placing such a high value on selfreliance
The insight at the heart of the Buddha's awakening was so abstract  a principle of causality
There seems no inherent reason for a philosophy with such an abstract beginning to have produced a devotionalism intense enough to rival anything found in the theistic religions
Yet if we look at what the Pali canon has to say about devotionalism  the attitude it expresses with the cluster of words respect deference reverence homage and veneration  we find not only that its theory of respect is rooted in the central insight of the Buddha's awakening  the causal principle called thisthat conditionality  but also that respect is required to learn and master this causal principle in the first place
On the surface it may seem strange to relate a theory of causality to the issue of respect but the two are intimately entwined
Respect is the attitude you develop toward the things that matter in life
Theories of causality tell you if anything really matters and if so what matters and how
If you believe that a supreme being will grant you happiness you'll naturally show respect and reverence for that being
If you assume happiness to be entirely selfwilled your greatest respect will be reserved for your own willfulness
As for the how If you view true happiness as totally impossible totally predetermined or totally random respect is unnecessary for it makes no difference in the outcome of your life
But if you see true happiness as possible and its causes as precarious contingent and dependent on your attitude you'll naturally show them the care and respect needed to keep them healthy and strong
This is reflected in the way the canon treats the issue of respect
It details the varied ways in which lay people of the Buddha's time showed respect to the Buddha and the monastic Sangha and the more standardized ways in which the members of the Sangha showed respect to the Buddha and to one another
Especially interesting is the protocol of respect for the Dhamma
Buddhist monks and nuns are forbidden from teaching the Dhamma to anyone who shows disrespect and the Buddha himself is said to have refused to teach his first sermon to the five brethren until they stopped treating him as a mere equal
This protocol of course may have been a cultural accident something picked up willynilly from the society of the Buddha's time but there are passages in the canon suggesting otherwise
Buddhism was one of the samana movements in ancient India which claimed to follow truths of nature rather than mainstream cultural norms
These movements were very free in choosing what to adopt from prevailing customs
Buddhist descriptions of other samana movements often criticized them for being disrespectful not only to outsiders but also among themselves
Students are shown being disrespectful to their teachers  their group meetings raucous noisy and out of control
All of this is then contrasted with the way Buddhists conduct their meetings in mutual courtesy and respect
This suggests that the Buddhists were free to reject the common customs of respect but made a conscious choice not to
This choice is based on their insight into respect as a prerequisite for learning
It's easier to learn from someone you respect than from someone you don't
Respect opens the mind and loosens preconceived opinions to make room for new knowledge and skills
At the same time people who value their knowledge feel more inclined to teach it to someone who shows respect than to someone who doesn't
However the type of learning the Buddha emphasizes is not simply the acquisition of information
It's a skill leading to total release from suffering and stress
And this is where the issue of respect connects with causality for the Buddhist theory of causality centers on the question of how it's possible to learn a skill
As cybernetics theory shows learning in general is possible only where there is feedback learning a skill requires the further ability to monitor feedback and choose how to use it to modify behavior
The Buddha's discoveries in causality explain the how and the what that allow for these factors
The how he expressed as a causal formula the what as an analysis of action the factors that shape it together with the range of results it can give
The causal formula simply put states that each moment is composed of three things results from past actions present actions and the immediate results of present actions
Although this principle seems simple its consequences are very complex
Every act you perform has repercussions in the present moment that also reverberate into the future
Depending on the intensity of the act those reverberations can last for a very short or a very long time
Thus every conditioned experience is shaped by the combined effects of past actions coming from a wide range over time together with the effects of present acts
Causality over time places certain limitations on each moment
The present is not a clean slate for it's partially shaped by influences from the past
Immediate causality in the present however makes room for free will
Not everything is determined by the past
At any moment you can insert new input into the process and nudge your life in a new direction
Still there's not so much room for free will that causality becomes arbitrary
Every this put into the system produces a particular type of that
Events follow discernible patterns that can be mastered
The what that keeps this process in motion is the factor allowing for feedback and the monitoring of feedback
The central element in that what is intention which the Buddha identified as the essence of action or kamma
Intention in turn is shaped by acts of attention which ask questions about perceptions and create views from those questions
Because you can attend to the results of your intentions there is an internal feedback loop allowing you to learn
Because attention can ask questions it can monitor that feedback to determine how best to put it to use
And because your intentions  guided by views and offering new input into the present  can then reshape your experience your ability to learn can make a difference you can change your behavior and reap the results of your improved skills in terms of greater and greater happiness
How far can that happiness go
In the course of his Awakening the Buddha discovered that the pursuit of skillfulness can ultimately lead beyond time and space beyond the realm of conditionality and rebirth
From this discovery he identified four types of kamma the first three giving pleasant painful or mixed results in the round of rebirth and the fourth leading beyond all kamma to the end of rebirth
In other words the principle of causality works so that actions can either continue the round or bring it to an end
Because even the highest pleasure within the round is inconstant and undependable he taught that the most worthy course of action is the fourth kind of kamma  the type that led to his Awakening  to put an end to kamma once and for all
The skill needed for this form of kamma comes from coordinating the factors of attention and intention so that they lead first to pleasant results within the round of rebirth and then  on the transcendent level  to total release from suffering and stress
This in turn requires certain attitudes toward the principle of causality operating in human life
And this is where the quality of respect becomes essential for without the proper respect for three things  yourself the principle of causality operating in your life and other people's insights into that principle  you won't be able to muster the resolve needed to master that principle and to see how far your potential for skillfulness can go
Respect for yourself in the context of thisthat conditionality means two things
 Because the fourth kind of kamma is possible you can respect your desire for unconditional happiness and don't have to regard it as an unrealistic ideal
 Because of the importance of intention and attention in shaping your experience you can respect your ability to develop the skills needed to understand and master causal reality to the point of attaining true happiness
But respect for yourself goes even further than that
Not only can you respect your desire for true happiness and your ability to attain it you must respect these things if you don't want to fall under the sway of the many religious and secular forces within society and yourself that would pull you in other directions
Although most religious cultures assume true happiness to be possible they don't see human skillfulness as capable of bringing it about
By and large they place their hopes for happiness in higher powers
As for secular cultures they don't believe that unconditional happiness is possible at all
They teach us to strive for happiness dependent on conditions and to turn a blind eye to the limitations inherent in any happiness coming from money power relationships possessions or a sentimental sense of community
They often scoff at higher values and smile when religious idols fall or religious aspirants show feet of clay
These secular attitudes foster our own unskillful qualities our desire to take whatever pleasures come easily and our impatience with anyone who would tell us that we're capable of better and more
But both the secular and the common religious attitudes teach us to underestimate the powers of our own skillful mind states
Qualities like mindfulness concentration and discernment when they first arise in the mind seem unremarkable  small and tender like maple seedlings growing in the midst of weeds
If we don't watch for them or accord them any special respect the weeds will strangle them or we ourselves will tread them underfoot
As a result we'll never get to know how much shade they can provide
If however we develop strong respect for our own ability to attain true happiness two important moral qualities take charge of our minds and watch out for our good qualities concern for the suffering we'll experience if we don't try our best to develop skillfulness and shame at the thought of aiming lower than at the highest possible happiness
Shame may seem a strange adjunct to selfrespect but when both are healthy they go together
You need selfrespect to recognize when a course of action is beneath you and that you'd be ashamed to follow it
You need to feel shame for your mistakes in order to keep your selfrespect from turning into stubborn pride
This is where the second aspect of respect  respect for the principle of causality  comes in
Thisthat conditionality is not a freeform process
Each unskillful this is connected to an unpleasant that
You can't twist the connection to lead to pleasant results or use your own preferences to design a customized path to release from causal experience
Selfrespect thus has to accommodate a respect for the way causes actually produce effects
Traditionally this respect is expressed in terms of the quality the Buddha stressed in his very last words heedfulness
To be heedful means having a strong sense that if you're careless in your intentions you'll suffer
If you truly love yourself you have to pay close attention to the way reality really works and act accordingly
Not everything you think or feel is worthy of respect
Even the Buddha himself didn't design Buddhism or the principle of thisthat conditionality
He discovered them
Instead of viewing reality in line with his preferences he reordered his preferences to make the most of what he learned by watching  with scrupulous care and honesty  his actions and their actual effects
This point is reflected in his discourse to the Kalamas
Although this discourse is often cited as the Buddha's carte blanche for following your own sense of right and wrong it actually says something very different Don't simply follow traditions but don't simply follow your own preferences either
If you see through watching your own actions and their results that following a certain mental state leads to harm and suffering you should abandon it and resolve never to follow it again
This is a rigorous standard which requires putting the Dhamma ahead of your own preconceived preferences
And it requires that you be very heedful of any tendency to reverse that priority and put your preferences first
In other words you can't simply indulge in the pleasure or resist the pain coming from your own actions
You have to learn from both pleasure and pain to show them respect as events in a causal chain to see what they have to teach you
This is why the Buddha called dukkha  pain stress and suffering  a noble truth and why he termed the pleasure arising from the concentrated mind a noble truth as well
These aspects of immediate experience contain lessons that can take the mind to the noble attainments
The discourse to the Kalamas however doesn't stop with immediate experience
It goes further and states that when observing the processes of cause and effect in your actions you should also confirm your observations with the teachings of the wise
This third aspect of respect  respect for the insights of others  is also based on the pattern of thisthat conditionality
Because causes are sometimes separated from their effects by great expanses of time it's easy to lose sight of some important connections
At the same time your chief obstacle to discernment  delusion  is the mental quality you have the hardest time detecting in yourself
When you're deluded you don't know you're deluded
So the wise approach is to show respect to the insights of others in the event that their insights may help you see through your own ignorance
After all intention and attention are immediately present to their awareness as well
Their insights may be just what you need to cut through the obstacles you've created for yourself through your own acts of ignorance
The Buddhist teachings on respect for other people point in two directions
First the obvious one respect for those ahead of you on the path
As the Buddha once said friendship with admirable people is the whole of the holy life for their words and examples will help get you on the path to release
This doesn't mean that you need to obey their teachings or accept them unthinkingly
You simply owe it to yourself to give them a respectful hearing and their teachings an honest try
Even  especially  when their advice is unpleasant you should treat it with respect
As Dhammapada states
At the same time when you show respect for those who have mastered the path you're also showing respect for qualities you want to develop in yourself
And when such people see that you respect the good qualities both in them and in yourself they'll feel more inclined to share their wisdom with you and more careful about sharing only their best
This is why the Buddhist tradition places such an emphasis on not only feeling respect but also showing it
If you can't force yourself to show respect to others in ways they'll recognize there's a resistance in your mind
They in turn will doubt your willingness to learn
This is why the monastic discipline places so much emphasis on the etiquette of respect to be shown to teachers and senior monastics
The teachings on respect however go in another direction as well
Buddhist monks and nuns are not allowed to show disrespect for anyone who criticizes them regardless of whether or not that person is awakened or the criticism wellfounded
Critics of this sort may not deserve the level of respect due to teachers but they do deserve common courtesy
Even unawakened people may have observed valuable bits and pieces of the truth
If you open yourself to criticism you may get to hear worthwhile insights that a wall of disrespect would have repelled
Buddhist literature  from the earliest days up to the present  abounds with stories of people who gained Awakening after hearing a chance word or song from an unlikely source
A person with the proper attitude of respect can learn from anything  and the ability to put anything to a good use is the mark of true discernment
Perhaps the most delicate skill with regard to respect is learning how to balance all three aspects of respect for yourself for the truth of causality and for the insight of others
This balance is essential to any skill
If you want to become a potter for example you have to learn not only from your teacher but also from your own actions and powers of observation and from the clay itself
Then you have to weigh all of these factors together to achieve mastery on your own
If in your pursuit of the Buddhist path your selfrespect outweighs your respect for the truth of causality or the insights of others you'll find it hard to take criticism or to laugh at your own foolishness
This will make it impossible for you to learn
If on the other hand your respect for your teachers outweighs your selfrespect or your respect for the truth you can open yourself to charlatans and close yourself to the truth that the canon says is to be seen by the wise for themselves
The parallels between the role of respect in Buddhist practice and in manual skills explains why many Buddhist teachers require their students to master a manual skill as a prerequisite or a part of their meditation
A person with no manual skills will have little intuitive understanding of how to balance respect
What sets the Buddha's apart from other skills though is the level of total freedom it produces
And the difference between that freedom and its alternative  endless rounds of suffering through birth after birth death after death  is so extreme that we can easily understand why people committed to the pursuit of that freedom show it a level of respect that's also extreme
Even more understandable is the absolute level of respect for that freedom shown by those who have attained it
They bow down to all their inner and outer teachers with the sincerest most heartfelt gratitude
To see them bow down in this way is an inspiring sight
So when Buddhist parents teach their children to show respect for the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha they aren't teaching them a habit that will later have to be unlearned
Of course the child will need to discover how best to understand and make use of that respect but at least the parents have helped open the door for the child to learn from its own powers of observation to learn from the truth and to learn from the insights of others
And when that door  when the mind  is opened to what truly deserves respect all things noble and good can come in
What exactly is vipassana
Almost any book on early Buddhist meditation will tell you that the Buddha taught two types of meditation samatha and vipassana
Samatha which means tranquillity is said to be a method fostering strong states of mental absorption called jhana
Vipassana  literally clearseeing but more often translated as insight meditation  is said to be a method using a modicum of tranquillity to foster momenttomoment mindfulness of the inconstancy of events as they are directly experienced in the present
This mindfulness creates a sense of dispassion toward all events thus leading the mind to release from suffering
These two methods are quite separate we're told and of the two vipassana is the distinctive Buddhist contribution to meditative science
Other systems of practice predating the Buddha also taught samatha but the Buddha was the first to discover and teach vipassana
Although some Buddhist meditators may practice samatha meditation before turning to vipassana samatha practice is not really necessary for the pursuit of Awakening
As a meditative tool the vipassana method is sufficient for attaining the goal
Or so we're told
But if you look directly at the Pali discourses  the earliest extant sources for our knowledge of the Buddha's teachings  you'll find that although they do use the word samatha to mean tranquillity and vipassana to mean clearseeing they otherwise confirm none of the received wisdom about these terms
Only rarely do they make use of the word vipassana  a sharp contrast to their frequent use of the word jhana
When they depict the Buddha telling his disciples to go meditate they never quote him as saying go do vipassana but always go do jhana And they never equate the word vipassana with any mindfulness techniques
In the few instances where they do mention vipassana they almost always pair it with samatha  not as two alternative methods but as two qualities of mind that a person may gain or be endowed with and that should be developed together
One simile for instance compares samatha and vipassana to a swift pair of messengers who enter the citadel of the body via the noble eightfold path and present their accurate report  Unbinding or nibbana  to the consciousness acting as the citadel's commander
Another passage recommends that anyone who wishes to put an end to mental defilement should  in addition to perfecting the principles of moral behavior and cultivating seclusion  be committed to samatha and endowed with vipassana
This last statement is unremarkable in itself but the same discourse also gives the same advice to anyone who wants to master the jhanas be committed to samatha and endowed with vipassana
This suggests that in the eyes of those who assembled the Pali discourses samatha jhana and vipassana were all part of a single path
Samatha and vipassana were used together to master jhana and then  based on jhana  were developed even further to give rise to the end of mental defilement and to bring release from suffering
This is a reading that finds support in other discourses as well
There's a passage for instance describing three ways in which samatha and vipassana can work together to lead to the knowledge of Awakening either samatha precedes vipassana vipassana precedes samatha or they develop in tandem
The wording suggests an image of two oxen pulling a cart one is placed before the other or they are yoked sidebyside
Another passage indicates that if samatha precedes vipassana  or vipassana samatha  one's practice is in a state of imbalance and needs to be rectified
A meditator who has attained a measure of samatha but no vipassana into events based on heightened discernment should question a fellow meditator who has attained vipassana How should fabrications be regarded
How should they be investigated
How should they be viewed with insight and then develop vipassana in line with that person's instructions
The verbs in these questions  regarding investigating seeing  indicate that there's more to the process of developing vipassana than a simple mindfulness technique
In fact as we will see below these verbs apply instead to a process of skillful questioning called appropriate attention
The opposite case  a meditator endowed with a measure of vipassana into events based on heightened discernment but no samatha  should question someone who has attained samatha How should the mind be steadied
How should it be made to settle down
How should it be unified
How should it be concentrated and then follow that person's instructions so as to develop samatha
The verbs used here give the impression that samatha in this context means jhana for they correspond to the verbal formula  the mind becomes steady settles down grows unified and concentrated  that the Pali discourses use repeatedly to describe the attainment of jhana
This impression is reinforced when we note that in every case where the discourses are explicit about the levels of concentration needed for insight to be liberating those levels are the jhanas
Once the meditator is endowed with both samatha and vipassana heshe should make an effort to establish those very same skillful qualities to a higher degree for the ending of the mental fermentations This corresponds to the path of samatha and vipassana developing in tandem
A passage in MN describes how this can happen
One knows and sees as they actually are the six sense media their objects consciousness at each medium contact at each medium and whatever is experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain based on that contact
One maintains this awareness in such a way as to stay uninfatuated by any of these things unattached unconfused focused on their drawbacks abandoning any craving for them this would count as vipassana
At the same time  abandoning physical and mental disturbances torments and distresses  one experiences ease in body and mind this would count as samatha
This practice not only develops samatha and vipassana in tandem but also brings the Wings to Awakening  which include the attainment of jhana  to the culmination of their development
So the proper path is one in which vipassana and samatha are brought into balance each supporting and acting as a check on the other
Vipassana helps keep tranquillity from becoming stagnant and dull
Samatha helps prevent the manifestations of aversion  such as nausea dizziness disorientation and even total blanking out  that can occur when the mind is trapped against its will in the present moment
From this description it's obvious that samatha and vipassana are not separate paths of practice but instead are complementary ways of relating to the present moment samatha provides a sense of ease in the present vipassana a cleareyed view of events as they actually occur in and of themselves
It's also obvious why the two qualities need to function together in mastering jhana
As the standard instructions on breath meditation indicate such a mastery involves three things gladdening concentrating and liberating the mind
Gladdening means finding a sense of refreshment and satisfaction in the present
Concentrating means keeping the mind focused on its object while liberating means freeing the mind from the grosser factors making up a lower stage of concentration so as to attain a higher stage
The first two activities are functions of samatha while the last is a function of vipassana
All three must function together
If for example there is concentration and gladdening with no letting go the mind wouldn't be able to refine its concentration at all
The factors that have to be abandoned in raising the mind from stage x to stage y belong to the set of factors that got the mind to x in the first place
Without the ability clearly to see mental events in the present there would be no way skillfully to release the mind from precisely the right factors that tie it to a lower state of concentration and act as disturbances to a higher one
If on the other hand there is simply a letting go of those factors without an appreciation of or steadiness in the stillness that remains the mind would drop out of jhana altogether
Thus samatha and vipassana must work together to bring the mind to right concentration in a masterful way
The question arises if vipassana functions in the mastery of jhana and jhana is not exclusive to Buddhists then what is Buddhist about vipassana
The answer is that vipassana per se is not exclusively Buddhist
What is distinctly Buddhist is the extent to which both samatha and vipassana are developed and the way they are developed  ie the line of questioning used to foster them and the way they are combined with an arsenal of meditative tools to bring the mind to total release
In MN the Buddha advises a monk who has mastered jhana to further develop samatha and vipassana so as to master six cognitive skills the most important of them being that through the ending of the mental fermentations one remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease and discernmentrelease having known and made them manifest for oneself right in the here and now This is a description of the Buddhist goal
Some commentators have asserted that this release is totally a function of vipassana but there are discourses that indicate otherwise
Note that release is twofold awarenessrelease and discernmentrelease
awarenessrelease occurs when a meditator becomes totally dispassionate toward passion this is the ultimate function of samatha
Discernmentrelease occurs when there is dispassion for ignorance this is the ultimate function of vipassana
Thus both samatha and vipassana are involved in the twofold nature of this release
The Sabbasava Sutta states that one's release can be fermentationfree only if one knows and sees in terms of appropriate attention
As the discourse shows appropriate attention means asking the proper questions about phenomena regarding them not in terms of selfother or beingnonbeing but in terms of the four noble truths
In other words instead of asking Do I exist
Don't I exist
What am I one asks about an experience Is this stress
The origination of stress
The cessation of stress
The path leading to the cessation of stress Because each of these categories entails a duty the answer to these questions determines a course of action stress should be comprehended its origination abandoned its cessation realized and the path to its cessation developed
Samatha and vipassana belong to the category of the path and so should be developed
To develop them one must apply appropriate attention to the task of comprehending stress which is comprised of the five clingingaggregates  clinging to physical form feeling perception mental fabrications and consciousness
Applying appropriate attention to these aggregates means viewing them in terms of their drawbacks as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness notself
A list of questions distinctive to the Buddha aids in this approach Is this aggregate constant or inconstant And is anything inconstant easeful or stressful And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
These questions are applied to every instance of the five aggregates whether past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near In other words the meditator asks these questions of all experiences in the cosmos of the six sense media
This line of questioning is part of a strategy leading to a level of knowledge called knowing and seeing things as they actually are where things are understood in terms of a fivefold perspective their arising their passing away their drawbacks their allure and the escape from them  the escape here lying in dispassion
Some commentators have suggested that in practice this fivefold perspective can be gained simply by focusing on the arising and passing away of these aggregates in the present moment if one's focus is relentless enough it will lead naturally to a knowledge of drawbacks allure and escape sufficient for total release
The texts however don't support this reading and practical experience would seem to back them up
As MN points out individual meditators will discover that in some cases they can develop dispassion for a particular cause of stress simply by watching it with equanimity but in other cases they will need to make a conscious exertion to develop the dispassion that will provide an escape
The discourse is vague  perhaps deliberately so  as to which approach will work where
This is something each meditator must test for him or herself in practice
The Sabbasava Sutta expands on this point by listing seven approaches to take in developing dispassion
Vipassana as a quality of mind is related to all seven but most directly with the first seeing ie seeing events in terms of the four noble truths and the duties appropriate to them
The remaining six approaches cover ways of carrying out those duties restraining the mind from focusing on sense data that would provoke unskillful states of mind reflecting on the appropriate reasons for using the requisites of food clothing shelter and medicine tolerating painful sensations avoiding obvious dangers and inappropriate companions destroying thoughts of sensual desire ill will harmfulness and other unskillful states and developing the seven factors for Awakening mindfulness analysis of qualities persistence rapture serenity concentration and equanimity
Each of these approaches covers a wide subset of approaches
Under destroying for instance one may eliminate an unskillful mental state by replacing it with a skillful one focusing on its drawbacks turning one's attention away from it relaxing the process of thoughtfabrication that formed it or suppressing it with the brute power of one's will
Many similar examples could be drawn from other discourses as well
The overall point is that the ways of the mind are varied and complex
Different fermentations can come bubbling up in different guises and respond to different approaches
One's skill as a meditator lies in mastering a variety of approaches and developing the sensitivity to know which approach will work best in which situation
On a more basic level however one needs strong motivation to master these skills in the first place
Because appropriate attention requires abandoning dichotomies that are so basic to the thought patterns of all people  beingnot being and menot me  meditators need strong reasons for adopting it
This is why the Sabbasava Sutta insists that anyone developing appropriate attention must first must hold the noble ones in high regard
In other words one must see that those who have followed the path are truly exemplary
One must also be wellversed in their teaching and discipline
According to MN being wellversed in their teaching begins with having conviction in their teachings about karma and rebirth which provide intellectual and emotional context for adopting the four noble truths as the basic categories of experience
Being wellversed in the discipline of the noble ones would include in addition to observing the precepts having some skill in the seven approaches mentioned above for abandoning the fermentations
Without this sort of background meditators might bring the wrong attitudes and questions to the practice of watching arising and passing away in the present moment
For instance they might be looking for a true self and end up identifying  consciously or unconsciously  with the vast open sense of awareness that embraces all change from which it all seems to come and to which it all seems to return
Or they might long for a sense of connectedness with the vast interplay of the universe convinced that  as all things are changing  any desire for changelessness is neurotic and lifedenying
For people with agendas like these the simple experience of events arising and passing away in the present won't lead to fivefold knowledge of things as they are
They'll resist recognizing that the ideas they hold to are a fermentation of views or that the experiences of calm that seem to verify those ideas are simply a fermentation in the form of a state of being
As a result they won't be willing to apply the four noble truths to those ideas and experiences
Only a person willing to see those fermentations as such and convinced of the need to transcend them will be in a position to apply the principles of appropriate attention to them and thus get beyond them
So to answer the question with which we began Vipassana is not a meditation technique
It's a quality of mind  the ability to see events clearly in the present moment
Although mindfulness is helpful in fostering vipassana it's not enough for developing vipassana to the point of total release
Other techniques and approaches are needed as well
In particular vipassana needs to be teamed with samatha  the ability to settle the mind comfortably in the present  so as to master the attainment of strong states of absorption or jhana
Based on this mastery samatha and vipassana are then applied to a skillful program of questioning called appropriate attention directed at all experience exploring events not in terms of menot me or beingnot being but in terms of the four noble truths
The meditator pursues this program until it leads to a fivefold understanding of all events in terms of their arising their passing away their drawbacks their allure and the escape from them
Only then can the mind taste release
This program for developing vipassana and samatha in turn needs the support of many other attitudes mental qualities and techniques of practice
This was why the Buddha taught it as part of a still larger program including respect for the noble ones mastery of all seven approaches for abandoning the mental fermentations and all eight factors of the noble path
To take a reductionist approach to the practice can produce only reduced results for meditation is a skill like carpentry requiring a mastery of many tools in response to many different needs
To limit oneself to only one approach in meditation would be like trying to build a house when one's motivation is uncertain and one's tool box contains nothing but hammers
The two crucial aspects of the Buddha's Awakening are the what and the how what he awakened to and how he did it
His awakening is special in that the two aspects come together
He awakened to the fact that there is an undying happiness and that it can be attained through human effort
The human effort involved in this process ultimately focuses on the question of understanding the nature of human effort itself  in terms of skillful kamma and dependent coarising  what its powers and limitations are and what kind of right effort can take one beyond its limitations and bring one to the threshold of the Deathless
As the Buddha described the Awakening experience in one of his discourses first there is the knowledge of the regularity of the Dhamma  which in this context means dependent coarising  then there is the knowledge of nibbana
In other passages he describes the three stages that led to insight into dependent coarising knowledge of his own previous lifetimes knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of all living beings and finally insight into the four Noble Truths
The first two forms of knowledge were not new with the Buddha
They have been reported by other seers throughout history although the Buddha's insight into the second knowledge had a special twist He saw that beings are reborn according to the ethical quality of their thoughts words and deeds and that this quality is essentially a factor of the mind
The quality of one's views and intentions determines the experienced result of one's actions
This insight had a double impact on his mind
On the one hand it made him realize the futility of the round of rebirth  that even the best efforts aimed at winning pleasure and fulfillment within the round could have only temporary effects
On the other hand his realization of the importance of the mind in determining the round is what led him to focus directly on his own mind in the present to see how the processes in the mind that kept the round going could be disbanded
This was how he gained insight into the four noble truths and dependent coarising  seeing how the aggregates that made up his person were also the impelling factors in the round of experience and the world at large and how the whole show could be brought to cessation
With its cessation there remained the experience of the unconditioned which he also termed nibbana consciousness without surface or feature the Deathless
When we address the question of how other enlightenment experiences recorded in world history relate to the Buddha's we have to keep in mind the Buddha's own dictum First there is the knowledge of dependent coarising then there is the knowledge of nibbana
Without the first  which includes not only an understanding of kamma but also of how kamma leads to the understanding itself  any realization no matter how calm or boundless that does not result from these sorts of understanding cannot count as an Awakening in the Buddhist sense
True Awakening necessarily involves both ethics and insight into causality
As for what the Buddha's Awakening means for us now four points stand out
 The role that kamma plays in the Awakening is empowering
It means that what each of us does says and thinks does matter  this in opposition to the sense of futility that can come from reading say world history geology or astronomy and realizing the fleeting nature of the entire human enterprise
The Awakening lets us see that the choices we make in each moment of our lives have consequences
We are not strangers in a strange land
We have formed and are continuing to form the world we experience
The fact that we are empowered also means that we are responsible for our experiences
This helps us to face the events we encounter in life with greater equanimity for we know that we had a hand in creating them and yet at the same time we can avoid any debilitating sense of guilt because with each new choice we can always make a fresh start
 The Awakening also tells us that good and bad are not mere social conventions but are built into the mechanics of how the world is constructed
We may be free to design our lives but we are not free to change the underlying rules that determine what good and bad actions are and how the process of kamma works itself out
Thus cultural relativism  even though it may have paved the way for many of us to leave our earlier religious orientations and enter the Buddhist fold  has no place once we are within that fold
There are certain ways of acting that are inherently unskillful and we are fools if we insist on our right to behave in those ways
 As the Buddha says at one point in describing his Awakening Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent and resolute In other words he gained liberating knowledge through qualities that we can all develop heedfulness ardency resolution
If we are willing to face the implications of this fact we realize that the Buddha's Awakening is a challenge to our entire set of values
The fact that the Unconditioned can be attained forces us to reevaluate any other goals we may set for ourselves whatever worlds we want to create in our lives
On an obvious level it points out the spiritual poverty of a life devoted to wealth status or sensual pursuits but it also forces us to take a hard look at other more worthwhile goals that our culture and its subcultures tend to exalt such as social acceptance meaningful relationships stewardship of the planet etc
These too will inevitably lead to suffering
The interdependence of all things cannot be for any truly sensitive mind a source of security or comfort
If the Unconditioned is available and it is the only trustworthy happiness around it only makes sense that we invest our efforts and whatever mental and spiritual resources we have in its direction
 Even for those who are not ready to make that kind of investment the Awakening assures us that happiness comes from developing qualities within ourselves that we can be proud of such as kindness sensitivity equanimity mindfulness conviction determination and discernment
Again this is a very different message from the one we pick up from the world telling us that in order to gain happiness we have to develop qualities we can't take any genuine pride in aggressiveness selfaggrandizement dishonesty etc
Just this much can give an entirely new orientation to our lives and our ideas of what is worthwhile investment of our time and efforts
The news of the Buddha's Awakening sets the standards for judging the culture we were brought up in and not the other way around
This is not a question of choosing Asian culture over American
The Buddha's Awakening challenged many of the presuppositions of Indian culture in his day and even in socalled Buddhist countries the true practice of the Buddha's teachings is always countercultural
It's a question of evaluating our normal concerns  conditioned by time space and the limitations of aging illness and death  against the possibility of a timeless spaceless limitless happiness
All cultures are tied up in the limited conditioned side of things while the Buddha's Awakening points beyond all cultures
It offers the challenge of the Deathless that his contemporaries found liberating and that we if we are willing to accept the challenge may find liberating ourselves
How can I ever repay you for your teaching
Good meditation teachers often hear this question from their students and the best answer I know for it is one that my teacher Ajaan Fuang gave every time 
By being intent on practicing 
Each time he gave this answer I was struck by how noble and gracious it was
And it wasn't just a formality
He never tried to find opportunities to pressure his students for donations
Even when our monastery was poor he never acted poor never tried to take advantage of their gratitude and trust
This was a refreshing change from some of my previous experiences with runofthemill village and city monks who were quick to drop hints about their need for donations from even stray or casual visitors

Eventually I learned that Ajaan Fuang's behavior is common throughout the Forest Tradition
It's based on a passage in the Pali Canon where the Buddha on his deathbed states that the highest homage to him is not material homage but the homage of practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma
In other words the best way to repay a teacher is to take the Dhamma to heart and to practice it in a way that fulfills his or her compassionate purpose in teaching it
I was proud to be part of a tradition where the inner wealth of this noble idea was actually lived  where as Ajaan Fuang often put it we weren't reduced to hirelings and the act of teaching the Dhamma was purely a gift

So I was saddened when on my return to America I had my first encounters with the dana talk the talk on giving and generosity that often comes at the end of a retreat
The context of the talk  and often the content  makes clear that it's not a disinterested exercise
It's aimed at generating gifts for the teacher or the organization sponsoring the retreat and it places the burden of responsibility on the retreatants to ensure that future retreats can occur
The language of the talk is often smooth and encouraging but when contrasted with Ajaan Fuang's answer I found the sheer fact of the talk illmannered and demeaning
If the organizers and teachers really trusted the retreatants' goodheartedness they wouldn't be giving the talk at all
To make matters worse the typical dana talk  along with its companion the meditationcenter fundraising letter  often cites the example of how monks and nuns are supported in Asia as justification for how dana is treated here in the West
But they're taking as their example the worst of the monks and not the best
I understand the reasoning behind the talk
Lay teachers here aspire to the ideal of teaching for free but they still need to eat
And unlike the monastics of Asia they don't have a longstanding tradition of dana to fall back on
So the dana talk was devised as a means for establishing a culture of dana in a Western context
But as so often is the case when new customs are devised for Western Buddhism the question is whether the dana talk skillfully translates Buddhist principles into the Western context or seriously distorts them
The best way to answer this question is to take a close look at those principles in their original context

It's well known that dana lies at the beginning of Buddhist practice
Dana quite literally has kept the Dhamma alive
If it weren't for the Indian tradition of giving to mendicants the Buddha would never have had the opportunity to explore and find the path to Awakening
The monastic sangha wouldn't have had the time and opportunity to follow his way
Dana is the first teaching in the graduated discourse the list of topics the Buddha used to lead listeners stepbystep to an appreciation of the four noble truths and often from there to their own first taste of Awakening
When stating the basic principles of karma he would begin with the statement There is what is given
What's less well known is that in making this statement the Buddha was not dealing in obvious truths or generic platitudes for the topic of giving was actually controversial in his time
For centuries the brahmans of India had been extolling the virtue of giving  as long as the gifts were given to them
Not only that gifts to brahmans were obligatory
People of other castes if they didn't concede to the brahmans' demands for gifts were neglecting their most essential social duty
By ignoring their duties in the present life such people and their relatives would suffer hardship both now and after death
As might be expected this attitude produced a backlash
Several of the samana or contemplative movements of the Buddha's time countered the brahmans' claims by asserting that there was no virtue in giving at all
Their arguments fell into two camps
One camp claimed that giving carried no virtue because there was no afterlife
A person was nothing more than physical elements that at death returned to their respective spheres
That was it
Giving thus provided no longterm results
The other camp stated that there was no such thing as giving for everything in the universe has been determined by fate
If a donor gives something to another person it's not really a gift for the donor has no choice or free will in the matter
Fate was simply working itself out
So when the Buddha in his introduction to the teaching on karma began by saying that there is what is given he was repudiating both camps
Giving does give results both now and on into the future and it is the result of the donor's free choice
However in contrast to the brahmans the Buddha took the principle of freedom one step further
When asked where a gift should be given he stated simply Wherever the mind feels inspired In other words  aside from repaying one's debt to one's parents  there is no obligation to give
This means that the choice to give is an act of true freedom and thus the perfect place to start the path to total release
This is why the Buddha adopted dana as the context for practicing and teaching the Dhamma
But  to maintain the twin principles of freedom and fruitfulness in giving  he created a culture of dana that embodied particularly Buddhist ideals
To begin with he defined dana not simply as material gifts
The practice of the precepts he said was also a type of dana  the gift of universal safety protecting all beings from the harm of one's unskillful actions  as was the act of teaching the Dhamma
This meant that lavish giving was not just the prerogative of the rich
Secondly he formulated a code of conduct to produce an attitude toward giving that would benefit both the donors and the recipients keeping the practice of giving both fruitful and free

We tend not to associate codes of conduct with the word freedom but that's because we forget that freedom too needs protection especially from the attitude that wants to be free in its choices but feels insecure when others are free in theirs
The Buddha's codes of conduct are voluntary  he never coerced anyone into practicing his teachings  but once they are adopted they require the cooperation of both sides to keep them effective and strong
These codes are best understood in terms of the six factors that the Buddha said exemplified the ideal gift 
The donor before giving is glad while giving hisher mind is inspired and after giving is gratified
These are the three factors of the donor
The recipients are free of passion or are practicing for the subduing of passion free of aversion or practicing for the subduing of aversion and free of delusion or practicing for the subduing of delusion
These are the three factors of the recipients
Although this passage seems to suggest that each side is responsible only for the factors on its side the Buddha's larger etiquette for generosity shows that the responsibility for all six factors  and in particular the three factors of the donor  is shared
And this shared responsibility flourishes best in an atmosphere of mutual trust
For the donors this means that if they want to feel glad inspired and gratified at their gift they should not see the gift as payment for personal services rendered by individual monks or nuns
That would turn the gift into wages and deprive it of its emotional power
Instead they'd be wise to look for trustworthy recipients people who are training  or have trained  their minds to be cleaned and undefiled
They should also give their gift in a respectful way so that the act of giving will reinforce the gladness that inspired it and will inspire the recipient to value their gift

The responsibilities of the recipients however are even more stringent
To ensure that the donor feels glad before giving monks and nuns are forbidden from pressuring the donor in any way
Except when ill or in situations where the donor has invited them to ask they cannot ask for anything beyond the barest emergency necessities
They are not even allowed to give hints about what they'd like to receive
When asked where a prospective gift should be given they are told to follow the Buddha's example and say Give wherever your gift would be used or would be wellcared for or would last long or wherever your mind feels inspired This conveys a sense of trust in the donor's discernment  which in itself is a gift that gladdens the donor's mind
To ensure that a donor feels inspired while giving a gift the monks and nuns are enjoined to receive gifts attentively and with an attitude of respect
To ensure that the donor feels gratified afterward they should live frugally care for the gift and make sure it is used in an appropriate way
In other words they should show that the donor's trust in them is well placed
And of course they must work on subduing their greed anger and delusion
In fact this is a primary motivation for trying to attain arahantship so that the gifts given to one will bear the donors great fruit
By sharing these responsibilities in an atmosphere of trust both sides protect the freedom of the donor
They also foster the conditions that will enable not only the practice of generosity but also the entire practice of Dhamma to flourish and grow

The principles of freedom and fruitfulness also govern the code the Buddha formulated specifically for protecting the gift of Dhamma
Here again the responsibilities are shared
To ensure that the teacher is glad inspired and gratified in teaching the listeners are advised to listen with respect to try to understand the teaching and  once they're convinced that it's genuinely wise  to sincerely put it into practice so as to gain the desired results
Like a monk or nun receiving a material gift the recipient of the gift of Dhamma has the simple responsibility of treating the gift well

The teacher meanwhile must make sure not to regard the act of teaching as a repayment of a debt
After all monks and nuns repay their debt to their lay donors by trying to rid their minds of greed aversion and delusion
They are in no way obligated to teach which means that the act of teaching is a gift free and clear
In addition the Buddha insisted that the Dhamma be taught without expectation of material reward
When he was once offered a teacher's fee for his teaching he refused to accept it and told the donor to throw it away
He also established the precedent that when a monastic teaches the rewards of generosity the teaching is given after a gift has been given not before so that the stain of hinting won't sully what's said
All of these principles assume a high level of nobility and restraint on both sides of the equation which is why people tried to find ways around them even while the Buddha was alive
The origin stories to the monastic discipline  the tales portraying the misbehavior that led the Buddha to formulate rules for the monks and nuns  often tell of monastics whose gift of Dhamma came with strings attached and of lay people who gladly pulled those strings to get what they wanted out of the monastics personal favors served with an ingratiating smile
The Buddha's steady persistence in formulating rules to cut these strings shows how determined he was that the principle of Dhamma as a genuinely free gift not be an idle ideal
He wanted it to influence the way people actually behaved
He never gave an extended explanation of why the act of teaching should always be a gift but he did state in general terms that when his code of conduct became corrupt over time that would corrupt the Dhamma as well
And in the case of the etiquette of generosity this principle has been borne out frequently throughout Buddhist history

A primary example is recorded in the Apadanas which scholars believe were added to the Canon after King Asoka's time
The Apadanas discuss the rewards of giving in a way that shows how eager the monks composing them were to receive lavish gifts
They promise that even a small gift will bear fruit as guaranteed arahantship many eons in the future and that the path from now to then will always be filled with pleasure and prestige
Attainments of special distinction though require special donations
Some of these donations bear a symbolic resemblance to the desired distinction  a gift of lighted lamps for instance presages clairvoyance  but the preferred gift of distinction was a week's worth of lavish meals for an entire monastery or at least for the monks who teach

It's obvious that the monks who composed the Apadanas were giving free rein to their greed and were eager to tell their listeners what their listeners wanted to hear
The fact that these texts were recorded for posterity shows that the listeners in fact were pleased
Thus the teachers and their students acting in collusion skewed the culture of dana in the direction of their defilements
In so doing they distorted the Dhamma as well
If giftgiving guarantees Awakening it supplants the noble eightfold path with the onefold path of the gift
If the road to Awakening is always prestigious and joyful the concept of right effort disappears
Yet once these ideas were introduced into the Buddhist tradition they gained the stamp of authority and have affected Buddhist practice ever since
Throughout Buddhist Asia people tend to give gifts with an eye to their symbolic promise of future reward and the list of gifts extolled in the Apadanas reads like a catalog of the gifts placed on altars throughout Buddhist Asia even today
Which goes to show that once the culture of dana gets distorted it can distort the practice of Dhamma as a whole for many centuries
So if we're serious about bringing the culture of dana to the West we should be very careful to ensure that our efforts honor the principles that make dana a genuinely Buddhist practice
This means no longer using the tactics of modern fundraising to encourage generosity among retreatants or Buddhists in general
It also means rethinking the dana talk for on many counts it fails the test
In pressuring retreatants to give to teachers it doesn't lead to gladness before giving and instead sounds like a plea for a tip at the end of a meal
The frequent efforts to pull on the retreatants' heartstrings as a path to their purse strings betray a lack of trust in their thoughtfulness and leave a bad taste
And the entire way dana is handled for teachers doesn't escape the fact that it's payment for services rendered
Whether teachers think about this consciously or not it pressures them subtly to tell their listeners what they think their listeners want to hear
The Dhamma can't help but suffer as a result
The ideal solution would be to provide a framework whereby serious Dhamma practitioners could be supported whether or not they taught
That way the act of teaching would be a genuine gift
In the meantime though a step in the direction of a genuine culture of dana would be to declare a moratorium on all dana talks at the end of retreats and on references to the Buddhist tradition of dana in fundraising appeals so as to give the word time to recover its dignity

On retreats dana could be discussed in a general way in the context of the many Dhamma talks given on how best to integrate Dhamma practice in daily life
At the end of the retreat a basket could be left out for donations with a note that the teacher hasn't been paid to teach the retreat
That's all
No appeals for mercy
No flashcards
Sensitive retreatants will be able to put two and two together and will feel glad inspired and gratified that they were trusted to do the math for themselves
One of the first stumbling blocks that Westerners often encounter when they learn about Buddhism is the teaching on anatta often translated as noself
This teaching is a stumbling block for two reasons
First the idea of there being no self doesn't fit well with other Buddhist teachings such as the doctrine of kamma and rebirth If there's no self what experiences the results of kamma and takes rebirth
Second it doesn't fit well with our own JudeoChristian background which assumes the existence of an eternal soul or self as a basic presupposition If there's no self what's the purpose of a spiritual life
Many books try to answer these questions but if you look at the Pali canon  the earliest extant record of the Buddha's teachings  you won't find them addressed at all
In fact the one place where the Buddha was asked pointblank whether or not there was a self he refused to answer
When later asked why he said that to hold either that there is a self or that there is no self is to fall into extreme forms of wrong view that make the path of Buddhist practice impossible
Thus the question should be put aside
To understand what his silence on this question says about the meaning of anatta we first have to look at his teachings on how questions should be asked and answered and how to interpret his answers
The Buddha divided all questions into four classes those that deserve a categorical answer those that deserve an analytical answer defining and qualifying the terms of the question those that deserve a counterquestion putting the ball back in the questioner's court and those that deserve to be put aside
The last class of question consists of those that don't lead to the end of suffering and stress
The first duty of a teacher when asked a question is to figure out which class the question belongs to and then to respond in the appropriate way
You don't for example say yes or no to a question that should be put aside
If you are the person asking the question and you get an answer you should then determine how far the answer should be interpreted
The Buddha said that there are two types of people who misrepresent him those who draw inferences from statements that shouldn't have inferences drawn from them and those who don't draw inferences from those that should
These are the basic ground rules for interpreting the Buddha's teachings but if we look at the way most writers treat the anatta doctrine we find these ground rules ignored
Some writers try to qualify the noself interpretation by saying that the Buddha denied the existence of an eternal self or a separate self but this is to give an analytical answer to a question that the Buddha showed should be put aside
Others try to draw inferences from the few statements in the discourse that seem to imply that there is no self but it seems safe to assume that if one forces those statements to give an answer to a question that should be put aside one is drawing inferences where they shouldn't be drawn
So instead of answering no to the question of whether or not there is a self  interconnected or separate eternal or not  the Buddha felt that the question was misguided to begin with
Why
No matter how you define the line between self and other the notion of self involves an element of selfidentification and clinging and thus suffering and stress
This holds as much for an interconnected self which recognizes no other as it does for a separate self
If one identifies with all of nature one is pained by every felled tree
It also holds for an entirely other universe in which the sense of alienation and futility would become so debilitating as to make the quest for happiness  one's own or that of others  impossible
For these reasons the Buddha advised paying no attention to such questions as Do I exist or Don't I exist for however you answer them they lead to suffering and stress
To avoid the suffering implicit in questions of self and other he offered an alternative way of dividing up experience the four Noble Truths of stress its cause its cessation and the path to its cessation
Rather than viewing these truths as pertaining to self or other he said one should recognize them simply for what they are in and of themselves as they are directly experienced and then perform the duty appropriate to each
Stress should be comprehended its cause abandoned its cessation realized and the path to its cessation developed
These duties form the context in which the anatta doctrine is best understood
If you develop the path of virtue concentration and discernment to a state of calm wellbeing and use that calm state to look at experience in terms of the Noble Truths the questions that occur to the mind are not Is there a self
What is my self but rather Am I suffering stress because I'm holding onto this particular phenomenon
Is it really me myself or mine
If it's stressful but not really me or mine why hold on These last questions merit straightforward answers as they then help you to comprehend stress and to chip away at the attachment and clinging  the residual sense of selfidentification  that cause it until ultimately all traces of selfidentification are gone and all that's left is limitless freedom
In this sense the anatta teaching is not a doctrine of noself but a notself strategy for shedding suffering by letting go of its cause leading to the highest undying happiness
At that point questions of self noself and notself fall aside
Once there's the experience of such total freedom where would there be any concern about what's experiencing it or whether or not it's a self
What does it mean to be mindful of the breath
Something very simple to keep the breath in mind
Keep remembering the breath each time you breathe in each time you breathe out
The British scholar who coined the term mindfulness to translate the Pali word sati was probably influenced by the Anglican prayer to be ever mindful of the needs of othersin other words to always keep their needs in mind
But even though the word mindful was probably drawn from a Christian context the Buddha himself defined sati as the ability to remember illustrating its function in meditation practice with the four satipatthanas or establishings of mindfulness
And what is the faculty of sati
There is the case where a monk a disciple of the noble ones is mindful highly meticulous remembering  able to call to mind even things that were done  said long ago
He remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelings in  of themselves the mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
The full discussion of the satipatthanas starts with instructions to be ever mindful of the breath
Directions such as bring bare attention to the breath or accept the breath or whatever else modern teachers tell us that mindfulness is supposed to do are actually functions for other qualities in the mind
They're not automatically a part of sati but you should bring them along wherever they're appropriate
One quality that's always appropriate in establishing mindfulness is being watchful or alert
The Pali word for alertness sampajañña is another term that's often misunderstood
It doesn't mean being choicelessly aware of the present or comprehending the present
Examples in the Canon shows that sampajañña means being aware of what you're doing in the movements of the body the movements in the mind
After all if you're going to gain insight into how you're causing suffering your primary focus always has to be on what you're actually doing
This is why mindfulness and alertness should always be paired as you meditate
In the Satipatthana Sutta they're combined with a third quality ardency
Ardency means being intent on what you're doing trying your best to do it skillfully
This doesn't mean that you have to keep straining and sweating all the time just that you're continuous in developing skillful habits and abandoning unskillful ones
Remember in the eight factors of the path to freedom right mindfulness grows out of right effort
Right effort is the effort to be skillful
Mindfulness helps that effort along by reminding you to stick with it so that you don't let it drop
All three of these qualities get their focus from what the Buddha called yoniso manasikara appropriate attention
Notice That's appropriate attention not bare attention
The Buddha discovered that the way you attend to things is determined by what you see as important the questions you bring to the practice the problems you want the practice to solve
No act of attention is ever bare
If there were no problems in life you could open yourself up choicelessly to whatever came along
But the fact is there is a big problem smack dab in the middle of everything you do the suffering that comes from acting in ignorance
This is why the Buddha doesn't tell you to view each moment with a beginner's eyes
You've got to keep the issue of suffering and its end always in mind
Otherwise inappropriate attention will get in the way focusing on questions like Who am I Do I have a selfquestions that deal in terms of being and identity
Those questions the Buddha said lead you into a thicket of views and leave you stuck on the thorns
The questions that lead to freedom focus on comprehending suffering letting go of the cause of suffering and developing the path to the end of suffering
Your desire for answers to these questions is what makes you alert to your actionsyour thoughts words and deedsand ardent to perform them skillfully
Mindfulness is what keeps the perspective of appropriate attention in mind
Modern psychological research has shown that attention comes in discrete moments
You can be attentive to something for only a very short period of time and then you have to remind yourself moment after moment to return to it if you want to keep on being attentive
In other words continuous attentionthe type that can observe things over timehas to be stitched together from short intervals
This is what mindfulness is for
It keeps the object of your attention and the purpose of your attention in mind
Popular books on meditation though offer a lot of other definitions for mindfulness a lot of other duties it's supposed to fulfillso many that the poor word gets totally stretched out of shape
In some cases it even gets defined as Awakening as in the phrase A moment of mindfulness is a moment of Awakeningsomething the Buddha would never say because mindfulness is conditioned and nirvana is not
These are not just minor matters for nitpicking scholars to argue over
If you don't see the differences among the qualities you're bringing to your meditation they glom together making it hard for real insight to arise
If you decide that one of the factors on the path to Awakening is Awakening itself it's like reaching the middle of a road and then falling asleep right there
You never get to the end of the road and in the meantime you're bound to get run over by aging illness and death
So you need to get your directions straight and that requires among other things knowing precisely what mindfulness is and what it's not
I've heard mindfulness defined as affectionate attention or compassionate attention but affection and compassion aren't the same as mindfulness
They're separate things
If you bring them to your meditation be clear about the fact that they're acting in addition to mindfulness because skill in meditation requires seeing when qualities like compassion are helpful and when they're not
As the Buddha says there are times when affection is a cause for suffering so you have to watch out
Sometimes mindfulness is defined as appreciating the moment for all the little pleasures it can offer the taste of a raisin the feel of a cup of tea in your hands
In the Buddha's vocabulary this appreciation is called contentment
Contentment is useful when you're experiencing physical hardship but it's not always useful in the area of the mind
In fact the Buddha once said that the secret to his Awakening was that he didn't allow himself to rest content with whatever attainment he had reached
He kept reaching for something higher until there was nowhere higher to reach
So contentment has to know its time and place
Mindfulness if it's not glommed together with contentment can help keep that fact in mind
Some teachers define mindfulness as nonreactivity or radical acceptance If you look for these words in the Buddha's vocabulary the closest you'll find are equanimity and patience
Equanimity means learning to put aside your preferences so that you can watch what's actually there
Patience is the ability not to get worked up over the things you don't like to stick with difficult situations even when they don't resolve as quickly as you want them to
But in establishing mindfulness you stay with unpleasant things not just to accept them but to watch and understand them
Once you've clearly seen that a particular quality like aversion or lust is harmful for the mind you can't stay patient or equanimous about it
You have to make whatever effort is needed to get rid of it and to nourish skillful qualities in its place by bringing in other factors of the path right resolve and right effort
Mindfulness after all is part of a larger path mapped out by appropriate attention
You have to keep remembering to bring the larger map to bear on everything you do
For instance right now you're trying to keep the breath in mind because you see that concentration as a factor of the path is something you need to develop and mindfulness of the breath is a good way to do it
The breath is also a good standpoint from which you can directly observe what's happening in the mind to see which qualities of mind are giving good results and which ones aren't
Meditation involves lots of mental qualities and you have to be clear about what they are where they're separate and what each one of them can do
That way when things are out of balance you can identify what's missing and can foster whatever is needed to make up the lack
If you're feeling flustered and irritated try to bring in a little gentleness and contentment
When you're lazy rev up your sense of the dangers of being unskillful and complacent
It's not just a matter of piling on more and more mindfulness
You've got to add other qualities as well
First you're mindful enough to stitch things together to keep the basic issues of your meditation in mind and to observe things over time
Then you try to noticethat's alertnessto see what else to stir into the pot
It's like cooking
When you don't like the taste of the soup you're fixing you don't just add more and more salt
Sometimes you add onion sometimes garlic sometimes oreganowhatever you sense is needed
Just keep in mind the fact that you've got a whole spice shelf to work with
And remember that your cooking has a purpose
In the map of the path right mindfulness isn't the end point
It's supposed to lead to right concentration
We're often told that mindfulness and concentration are two separate forms of meditation but the Buddha never made a clear division between the two
In his teachings mindfulness shades into concentration concentration forms the basis for even better mindfulness
The four establishings of mindfulness are also the themes of concentration
The highest level of concentration is where mindfulness becomes pure
As Ajaan Lee a Thai Forest master once noted mindfulness combined with ardency turns into the concentration factor called vitakka or directed thought where you keep your thoughts consistently focused on one thing
Alertness combined with ardency turns into another concentration factor vicara or evaluation You evaluate what's going on with the breath
Is it comfortable
If it is stick with it
If it's not what can you do to make it more comfortable
Try making it a little bit longer a little bit shorter deeper more shallow faster slower
See what happens
When you've found a way of breathing that nourishes a sense of fullness and refreshment you can spread that fullness throughout the body
Learn how to relate to the breath in a way that nourishes a good energy flow throughout the body
When things feel refreshing like this you can easily settle down
You may have picked up the idea that you should never fiddle with the breath that you should just take it as it comes
Yet meditation isn't just a passive process of being nonjudgmentally present with whatever's there and not changing it at all
Mindfulness keeps stitching things together over time but it also keeps in mind the idea that there's a path to develop and getting the mind to settle down is a skillful part of that path
This is why evaluationjudging the best way to maximize the pleasure of the breathis essential to the practice
In other words you don't abandon your powers of judgment as you develop mindfulness
You simply train them to be less judgmental and more judicious so that they yield tangible results
When the breath gets really full and refreshing throughout the body you can drop the evaluation and simply be one with the breath
This sense of oneness is also sometimes called mindfulness in a literal sense mindfullness a sense of oneness pervading the entire range of your awareness
You're at one with whatever you focus on at one with whatever you do
There's no separate you at all
This is the type of mindfulness that's easy to confuse with Awakening because it can seem so liberating but in the Buddha's vocabulary it's neither mindfulness nor Awakening
It's cetaso ekodibhava unification of awarenessa factor of concentration present in every level from the second jhana up through the infinitude of consciousness
So it's not even the ultimate in concentration much less Awakening
Which means that there's still more to do
This is where mindfulness alertness and ardency keep digging away
Mindfulness reminds you that no matter how wonderful this sense of oneness you still haven't solved the problem of suffering
Alertness tries to focus on what the mind is still doing in that state of onenesswhat subterranean choices you're making to keep that sense of oneness going what subtle levels of stress those choices are causingwhile ardency tries to find a way to drop even those subtle choices so as to be rid of that stress
So even this sense of oneness is a means to a higher end
You bring the mind to a solid state of oneness so as to drop your normal ways of dividing up experience into me vs
notme but you don't stop there
You then take that oneness and keep subjecting it to all the factors of right mindfulness
That's when really valuable things begin to separate out on their own
Ajaan Lee uses the image of ore in a rock
Staying with the sense of oneness is like being content simply with the knowledge that there's tin silver and gold in your rock If that's all you do you'll never get any use from them
But if you heat the rock to the melting points for the different metals they'll separate out on their own
Liberating insight comes from testing experimenting
This is how we learn about the world to begin with
If we weren't active creatures we'd have no understanding of the world at all
Things would pass by pass by and we wouldn't know how they were connected because we'd have no way of influencing them to see which effects came from changing which causes
It's because we act in the world that we understand the world
The same holds true with the mind
You can't just sit around hoping that a single mental qualitymindfulness acceptance contentment onenessis going to do all the work
If you want to learn about the potentials of the mind you have to be willing to playwith sensations in the body with qualities in the mind
That's when you come to understand cause and effect
And that requires all your powers of intelligenceand this doesn't mean just book intelligence
It means your ability to notice what you're doing to read the results of what you've done and to figure out ingenious ways of doing things that cause less and less suffering and stress street smarts for the noble path
Mindfulness allows you to see these connections because it keeps reminding you always to stay with these issues to stay with the causes until you see their effects
But mindfulness alone can't do all the work
You can't fix the soup simply by dumping more pepper into it
You add other ingredients as they're needed
This is why it's best not to load the word mindfulness with too many meanings or to assign it too many functions
Otherwise you can't clearly discern when a quality like contentment is useful and when it's not when you need to bring things to oneness and when you need to take things apart
So keep the spices on your shelf clearly labeled and learn through practice which spice is good for which purpose
Only then can you develop your full potential as a cook
He showed me the brightness of the world
That's how my teacher Ajaan Fuang once characterized his debt to his teacher Ajaan Lee
His words took me by surprise
I had only recently come to study with him still fresh from a school where I had learned that serious Buddhists took a negative pessimistic view of the world
Yet here was a man who had given his life to the practice of the Buddha's teachings speaking of the world's brightness
Of course by brightness he wasn't referring to the joys of the arts food travel sports family life or any of the other sections of the Sunday newspaper
He was talking about a deeper happiness that comes from within
As I came to know him I gained a sense of how deeply happy he was
He may have been skeptical about a lot of human pretenses but I would never describe him as negative or pessimistic
Realistic would be closer to the truth
Yet for a long time I couldn't shake the sense of paradox I felt over how the pessimism of the Buddhist texts could find embodiment in such a solidly happy person
Only when I began to look directly at the early texts did I realize that what I thought was a paradox was actually an irony  the irony of how Buddhism which gives such a positive view of a human being's potential for finding true happiness could be branded in the West as negative and pessimistic
You've probably heard the rumor that Life is suffering is Buddhism's first principle the Buddha's first noble truth
It's a rumor with good credentials spread by wellrespected academics and Dharma teachers alike but a rumor nonetheless
The truth about the noble truths is far more interesting
The Buddha taught four truths  not one  about life There is suffering there is a cause for suffering there is an end of suffering and there is a path of practice that puts an end to suffering
These truths taken as a whole are far from pessimistic
They're a practical problemsolving approach  the way a doctor approaches an illness or a mechanic a faulty engine
You identify a problem and look for its cause
You then put an end to the problem by eliminating the cause
What's special about the Buddha's approach is that the problem he attacks is the whole of human suffering and the solution he offers is something human beings can do for themselves
Just as a doctor with a surefire cure for measles isn't afraid of measles the Buddha isn't afraid of any aspect of human suffering
And having experienced a happiness totally unconditional he's not afraid to point out the suffering and stress inherent in places where most of us would rather not see it  in the conditioned pleasures we cling to
He teaches us not to deny that suffering and stress or to run away from it but to stand still and face up to it to examine it carefully
That way  by understanding it  we can ferret out its cause and put an end to it
Totally
How confident can you get
A fair number of writers have pointed out the basic confidence inherent in the four noble truths and yet the rumor of Buddhism's pessimism persists
I wonder why
One possible explanation is that in coming to Buddhism we subconsciously expect it to address issues that have a long history in our own culture
By starting out with suffering as his first truth the Buddha seems to be offering his position on a question with a long history in the West is the world basically good or bad
According to Genesis this was the first question that occurred to God after he had finished his creation had he done a good job
He then looked at the world and saw that it was good
Ever since then people in the West have sided with or against God on his answer but in doing so they have affirmed that the question was worth asking to begin with
When Theravada  the only form of Buddhism to take on Christianity when Europe colonized Asia  was looking for ways to head off what it saw as the missionary menace Buddhists who had received their education from the missionaries assumed that the question was valid and pressed the first noble truth into service as a refutation of the Christian God look at how miserable life is they said and it's hard to accept God's verdict on his handiwork
This debating strategy may have scored a few points at the time and it's easy to find Buddhist apologists who  still living in the colonial past  keep trying to score the same points
The real issue though is whether the Buddha intended his first noble truth to answer God's question in the first place and  more importantly  whether we're getting the most out of the first noble truth if we see it in that light
It's hard to imagine what you could accomplish by saying that life is suffering
You'd have to spend your time arguing with people who see more than just suffering in life
The Buddha himself says as much in one of his discourses
A brahman named Longnails comes to him and announces that he doesn't approve of anything
This would have been a perfect time for the Buddha if he had wanted to chime in with the truth that life is suffering
Instead he attacks the whole notion of taking a stand on whether life is worthy of approval
There are three possible answers to this question he says nothing is worthy of approval everything is and some things are and some things aren't
If you take any of these three positions you end up arguing with the people who take either of the other two positions
And where does that get you
The Buddha then teaches Longnails to look at his body and feelings as instances of the first noble truth they're stressful inconstant and don't deserve to be clung to as self
Longnails follows the Buddha's instructions and in letting go of his attachment to body and feelings gains his first glimpse of the Deathless of what it's like to be totally free from suffering
The point of this story is that trying to answer God's question passing judgment on the world is a waste of time
And it offers a better use for the first noble truth looking at things not in terms of world or life but simply identifying suffering so that you can comprehend it let it go and attain release
Rather than asking us to make a blanket judgment  which in effect would be asking us to be blind partisans  the first noble truth asks us to look and see precisely where the problem of suffering lies
Other discourses show that the problem isn't with body and feelings in and of themselves
They themselves aren't suffering
The suffering lies in clinging to them
In his definition of the first noble truth the Buddha summarizes all types of suffering under the phrase the five aggregates of clinging clinging to physical form feelings perceptions thought constructs and consciousness
However when the five aggregates are free from clinging he tells us they lead to longterm benefit and happiness
So the first noble truth simply put is that clinging is suffering
It's because of clinging that physical pain becomes mental pain
It's because of clinging that aging illness and death cause mental distress
The paradox here is that in clinging to things we don't trap them or get them under our control
Instead we trap ourselves
When we realize our captivity we naturally search for a way out
And this is where it's so important that the first noble truth not say that Life is suffering If life were suffering where would we look for an end to suffering
We'd be left with nothing but death and annihilation
But when the actual truth is that clinging is suffering we simply have to look for the clinging and eliminate its causes
This process takes time though because we can't simply tell the mind not to cling
It's like a disobedient child if you force it to let go while you're looking it'll search for a blind spot where you can't see it and will start to cling there
In fact the mind's major blind spot  ignorance  is the prime cause that gives rise to clinging's proximate cause craving
So as the fourth noble truth the Buddha recommends a path of practice to get rid of the blind spot
The path has eight factors right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration
In a more abbreviated form the Buddha's term for the practice is abandoning and developing abandoning activities that hinder awareness and developing qualities that expand its clarity and range
The abandoning  in which you refrain from unskillful thoughts words and deeds inspired by craving  is obviously an antidote to clinging
The developing though plays a more paradoxical role for you have to hold to the skillful qualities of mindfulness concentration and discernment that foster awareness until they're fully mature
Only then can you let them go
It's like climbing a ladder to get on a roof you grab hold of a higher rung so that you can let go of a lower rung and then grab onto a rung still higher
As the rungs get further off the ground your view gets more expansive and you can see precisely where the mind's clingings are
You get a sharper sense of which parts of experience belong to which noble truth and what should be done with them the parts that are suffering should be comprehended the parts that cause suffering should be abandoned the parts that form the path to the end of suffering should be further developed and the parts that belong to the end of suffering should be verified
This helps you get higher and higher on the ladder until you find yourself securely on the roof
That's when you can finally let go of the ladder and be totally free
So the real question we face is not God's question passing judgment on how skillfully he created life or the world
It's our question how skillfully are we handling the raw stuff of life
Are we clinging in ways that serve only to continue the round of suffering or are we learning to hold to the ladderlike qualities that will eliminate craving and ignorance so that we can grow up and not have to cling
If we negotiate life armed with all four noble truths realizing that life contains both suffering and an end to suffering there's hope hope that we'll be able to sort out which parts of life belong to which truth hope that someday in this life we'll discover the brightness at the point where we can agree with the Buddha Oh
Yes
This is the end of suffering and stress
Karma is one of those words we don't translate
Its basic meaning is simple enough  action  but because of the weight the Buddha's teachings give to the role of action the Sanskrit word karma packs in so many implications that the English word action can't carry all its luggage
This is why we've simply airlifted the original word into our vocabulary
But when we try unpacking the connotations the word carries now that it has arrived in everyday usage we find that most of its luggage has gotten mixed up in transit
In the eyes of most Americans karma functions like fate  bad fate at that an inexplicable unchangeable force coming out of our past for which we are somehow vaguely responsible and powerless to fight
I guess it's just my karma I've heard people sigh when bad fortune strikes with such force that they see no alternative to resigned acceptance
The fatalism implicit in this statement is one reason why so many of us are repelled by the concept of karma for it sounds like the kind of callous mythmaking that can justify almost any kind of suffering or injustice in the status quo If he's poor it's because of his karma If she's been raped it's because of her karma From this it seems a short step to saying that he or she deserves to suffer and so doesn't deserve our help
This misperception comes from the fact that the Buddhist concept of karma came to the West at the same time as nonBuddhist concepts and so ended up with some of their luggage
Although many Asian concepts of karma are fatalistic the early Buddhist concept was not fatalistic at all
In fact if we look closely at early Buddhist ideas of karma we'll find that they give even less importance to myths about the past than most modern Americans do
For the early Buddhists karma was nonlinear and complex
Other Indian schools believed that karma operated in a simple straight line with actions from the past influencing the present and present actions influencing the future
As a result they saw little room for free will
Buddhists however saw that karma acts in multiple feedback loops with the present moment being shaped both by past and by present actions present actions shape not only the future but also the present
Furthermore present actions need not be determined by past actions
In other words there is free will although its range is somewhat dictated by the past
The nature of this freedom is symbolized in an image used by the early Buddhists flowing water
Sometimes the flow from the past is so strong that little can be done except to stand fast but there are also times when the flow is gentle enough to be diverted in almost any direction
So instead of promoting resigned powerlessness the early Buddhist notion of karma focused on the liberating potential of what the mind is doing with every moment
Who you are  what you come from  is not anywhere near as important as the mind's motives for what it is doing right now
Even though the past may account for many of the inequalities we see in life our measure as human beings is not the hand we've been dealt for that hand can change at any moment
We take our own measure by how well we play the hand we've got
If you're suffering you try not to continue the unskillful mental habits that would keep that particular karmic feedback going
If you see that other people are suffering and you're in a position to help you focus not on their karmic past but your karmic opportunity in the present Someday you may find yourself in the same predicament that they're in now so here's your opportunity to act in the way you'd like them to act toward you when that day comes
This belief that one's dignity is measured not by one's past but by one's present actions flew right in the face of the Indian traditions of castebased hierarchies and explains why early Buddhists had such a field day poking fun at the pretensions and mythology of the brahmans
As the Buddha pointed out a brahman could be a superior person not because he came out of a brahman womb but only if he acted with truly skillful intentions
We read the early Buddhist attacks on the caste system and aside from their antiracist implications they often strike us as quaint
What we fail to realize is that they strike right at the heart of our myths about our own past our obsession with defining who we are in terms of where we come from  our race ethnic heritage gender socioeconomic background sexual preference  our modern tribes
We put inordinate amounts of energy into creating and maintaining the mythology of our tribe so that we can take vicarious pride in our tribe's good name
Even when we become Buddhists the tribe comes first
We demand a Buddhism that honors our myths
From the standpoint of karma though where we come from is old karma over which we have no control
What we are is a nebulous concept at best  and pernicious at worst when we use it to find excuses for acting on unskillful motives
The worth of a tribe lies only in the skillful actions of its individual members
Even when those good people belong to our tribe their good karma is theirs not ours
And of course every tribe has its bad members which means that the mythology of the tribe is a fragile thing
To hang onto anything fragile requires a large investment of passion aversion and delusion leading inevitably to more unskillful actions on into the future
So the Buddhist teachings on karma far from being a quaint relic from the past are a direct challenge to a basic thrust  and basic flaw  in our culture
Only when we abandon our obsession with finding vicarious pride in our tribal past and can take actual pride in the motives that underlie our present actions can we say that the word karma in its Buddhist sense has recovered its luggage
And when we open the luggage we'll find that it's brought us a gift the gift we give ourselves and one another when we drop our myths about who we are and can instead be honest about what we're doing with each moment  at the same time making the effort to do it right
Many people who don't know much about old Buddhist texts often know one passage from the Pali Canon the part of the Kalama Sutta stating that old texts can't be trusted
Quotes from this passage come in many shapes and sizes
Some of them are short sound bites like the message that was rubberstamped on the envelope of a letter I once received
 The Buddha
There's also the desktop wallpaper
 The Buddha
Even scholarly citations of the sutta give the same message
Here's the entire quote from the sutta in a recent book
 The Buddha
Taken together these quotes justify our tendency to pick what we like from the old texts and throw the rest away
No need to understand the larger context of the dhamma they teach the Buddha seems to be saying
You're better off rolling your own
But if you look at the entire passage in the Kalama Sutta you discover that these quotes give only part of the picture
The Buddha's skepticism toward reliable authorities extends inside as well as out
Notice the words in bold face the ones that usually get dropped from the quote or sloughed over when they're included
When the Buddha says that you can't go by logical deduction inference or analogies he's saying that you can't always trust your sense of reason
When he says that you can't go by agreement through pondering views or by probability he's saying that you can't always trust your common sense
And of course you can't always trust teachers scriptures or traditions
So where can you place your trust
You have to put things to the test in your own thoughts words and deeds to see what actually leads to suffering and what leads to its end
When you know for yourselves that 'These dhammas are unskillful these dhammas are blameworthy these dhammas are criticized by the wise these dhammas when adopted  carried out lead to harm  to suffering'  then you should abandon them
When you know for yourselves that 'These dhammas are skillful these dhammas are blameless these dhammas are praised by the wise these dhammas when adopted  carried out lead to welfare  to happiness'  then you should enter  remain in them
The word dhamma in these passages means three things in one teaching mental quality and action
Teachings are naturally related to the mind states and actions they inspire so they should be judged by the results they give when put into action
True dhamma is what works in leading to genuine wellbeing
False dhamma is what doesn't
But even when judging the results of your own actions you can't simply take your own ideas of what works as a trustworthy standard
After all you can easily side with your greed aversion or delusion setting your standards too low
So to check against this tendency the Buddha recommends that you also take into consideration the views of the wise for you'll never grow until you allow your standards to be challenged by theirs
Now if you're expecting quick access to a totally reliable authority this may sound like a catch If you're not wise enough to trust your own judgment how can you recognize who's really wise
But it's not a catch
It's simply the way we have to operate when developing any kind of skill  your appreciation of good carpentry for example grows as you master carpentry yourself  and the Buddha is making the point that this is how to approach the dhamma as a skill to be mastered
As with any skill your inner sensitivity and assurance as to who's truly wise in the skill grows only through your willingness to learn
In giving advice on how to learn this skill the Buddha is speaking not with the authority of your creator who can tell you what you have to believe but with the authority of an expert in his field one who knows from experience what does and doesn't work
If you want to learn from him you're wise to accept his observations on how it's best done
The first thing to recognize is that there are others who have mastered the skill before you and that they have some important things to teach
Among the things they'll teach you of course is what they've learned from the wise before them going back to the Buddha
Some of this knowledge can be passed on in words but in a list of the qualities to look for in the wise  and to learn from them  the Buddha shows that there's more to wisdom than just words
A person worthy of respect he says at AN should have a sense of seven things the dhamma its meaning oneself enough the right time and place social gatherings and how to judge individual people
What's striking about this list is that only the first two qualities deal with verbal knowledge
Having a sense of the dhamma means knowing what the Buddha did and didn't say having a sense of meaning means knowing how to explain the dhamma's difficult concepts and ideas the general principles that express its values and the basic techniques for implementing them
These are things we can pick up from dhamma talks and books
But the Buddha didn't teach a onesizefitsallineverysituation technique
Even his seemingly abstract principles are meant for particular stages in the training
Notself for example is useful in some instances and harmful in others
This is why the Buddha added the last five members of the list the sensitivities that turn the techniques and principles into genuine skills
Having a sense of oneself means knowing your strengths and weaknesses in terms of conviction virtue learning generosity discernment and quickwittedness
In other words you know which qualities are important to focus on and can assess objectively where you still have more work to do
Having a sense of enough applies primarily to your use of the requisites of life  food clothing shelter and medicine  but it can also apply to intangibles such as when you need less desire effort concentration or thinking in your practice and when you need more
Having a sense of time means knowing when to listen when to memorize what you've heard when to ask questions and when to go off into seclusion and practice on your own
Having a sense of social gatherings means knowing how to speak and behave with people from different backgrounds and classes of society
Having a sense of individuals means knowing how to judge which people are worthy of emulation in their pursuit of the dhamma and which ones are not
Even though we can talk about these last five qualities we can't embody them through words
They're habits and the only way to pick up good habits is by being around good examples people who've already been trained to embody these qualities in the way they live
This is why the Buddha  in trying to establish the dhamma for future generations  didn't just leave a body of teachings
He also set up the monastic sangha and organized it to carry on the tradition of all seven of these qualities his habits as well as his words
To ensure that the standard of the dhamma would last over time he first made it clear that he didn't want anyone tampering with his teachings
Monks these two slander the Tathagata
Which two
One who explains what was not said or spoken by the Tathagata as said or spoken by the Tathagata
And one who explains what was said or spoken by the Tathagata as not said or spoken by the Tathagata
These are the two who slander the Tathagata
It's easy to understand why the Buddha phrased this so strongly
He had chosen his words with great care and wanted the same level of care in those who quoted him
Fidelity in his eyes was an act of compassion
He intended his words to be taken as a standard for what was and wasn't dhamma  anything consistent with his words was to be accepted as dhamma anything inconsistent to be rejected as not  so it's only natural that he'd warn his followers not to muddy the standard
Otherwise later generations would have no trustworthy guide in their search to end suffering
So in addition to establishing principles for determining what he did and didn't teach he also set up protocols for how the sangha should settle disagreements on this issue when they arose
To ensure that the meaning of the dhamma would be passed on he established the principle that teachers should be open to questioning
He didn't want them to engage in what he called bombast empty words the work of poets the work of outsiders artful in sound artful in expression He encouraged his students to focus on teaching the end of suffering and to encourage their students to dissect those teachings to make their meaning clear
Understanding occurs best when there's an opportunity for an open dialogue in good faith
To transmit the habits of the dhamma the Buddha designed the ideal teacherstudent relationship on the model of an apprenticeship
You live with the teacher for a minimum of five years attending to the teacher's needs as a way of observing  and being observed by  the teacher in all sorts of situations
To allow for the fact that your sense of judgment develops over time the Buddha didn't force you to commit to a teacher for life
You look for someone who as far as you can see has integrity but if you sense with time that integrity is lacking you're free to look for a new teacher
At the same time the Buddha realized that not everyone would have the time or inclination to undergo this apprenticeship so he arranged a division of labor
The monks and nuns who had passed through apprenticeship were to live not in cloisters but in places where lay people would be free to come and learn from the fruits of their training
So it's obvious that the Buddha didn't have a casual or cavalier attitude toward the preservation of his words and habits
Knowing the difficulties he'd encountered in discovering the dhamma he didn't trust us  with our greed aversion and delusion  to discover it on our own
He knew we'd need help
Although he foresaw that his teachings would someday disappear he didn't simply resign himself to change or trust that it would always work out for the best
He established a wide range of safeguards to ensure that reliable words and models of behavior would survive as long as possible
But in the cutandpaste Buddhism developing around us in the West many of these safeguards have been dropped
In particular the idea of apprenticeship  so central in mastering the habits of the dhamma as a skill  is almost totally lacking
Dhamma principles are reduced to vague generalities and the techniques for testing them are stripped to a bare assemblyline minimum
We reassure ourselves that the changes we've made in Buddhism are all for the best  that Buddhism has always adapted itself to every culture it enters and we can trust it to adapt wisely to the West
But this treats Buddhism as if it were a conscious agent  a wise amoebic force that knows how to adapt to its environment in order to survive
Actually Buddhism isn't an agent and it doesn't adapt
It gets adapted  sometimes by people who know what they're doing sometimes by people who don't
Just because a particular adaptation survives and prevails doesn't mean that it's genuine dhamma
It may simply appeal to the desires and fears of its target audience
Certainly we in the West are easy targets for the idea that the Buddha wants us to cut and paste his dhamma as we like
Many of us have been burned by religious authorities and we don't want to risk getting burned again
There's also our cultural pride We like to think that we can see more clearly than Asian Buddhist what's of genuine value in their traditions and what's simply cultural baggage  as if we didn't have cultural baggage of our own
And how do we know what's just baggage
A beatup old suitcase might contain your jewelry and keys
So is a designer dhamma what we really want
As the Buddha noted one of the natural reactions to suffering is to search for someone who can give good advice on how to put an end to it
When offered the choice wouldn't you prefer reliable guidance on how to end your suffering rather than a doityourself kit with vague instructions and no guarantees
Or are there those who would benefit if you bought the kit
People sometimes argue that in our diverse postmodern world we need a postmodern Buddhism in which no one's interpretation can be criticized as wrong
But that's trading the possibility of total freedom from suffering for something much less freedom from criticism
And it ignores the other side of the postmodernist equation that our perceived wants can be overwhelmingly shaped by the interests of institutions who want something out of us
One of the common ruses of privatization is to offer us less dress it up as more so that we'll pay more for it
Is that what's happening here
The Buddha wasn't so nave as to think that we can always know what's in our own best interest
He saw long before the postmoderns that there's plenty to mistrust both in old texts and in our own preconceptions about what seems reasonable
Yet he did the postmoderns one better by offering a solution to this dilemma
It would be a shame if sold on the idea of designing our own dhamma we let his solution die
Avijja the Pali word for ignorance is the opposite of vijja which means not only knowledge but also skill  as in the skills of a doctor or animaltrainer
So when the Buddha focuses on the ignorance that causes stress and suffering saying that people suffer from not knowing the four noble truths he's not simply saying that they lack information or direct knowledge of those truths
He's also saying that they lack skill in handling them
They suffer because they don't know what they're doing
The four truths are stress  which covers everything from the slightest tension to outandout agony the cause of stress the cessation of stress and the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress
When the Buddha first taught these truths he also taught that his full Awakening came from knowing them on three levels identifying them knowing the skill appropriate to each and knowing finally that he had fully mastered the skills
Stress he identified with examples  such things as birth aging illness and death sorrow distress and despair  summarizing it as five clingingaggregates clinging to physical form to feelings of pleasure pain and neither pleasure nor pain to perception to thoughtconstructs and to sensory consciousness
The cause of stress he identified as three kinds of craving craving for sensuality craving to take on an identity in a world of experience and craving for one's identity and world of experience to be destroyed
The cessation of stress he identified as renunciation of and release from those three kinds of craving
And the path to the cessation of stress he identified as right concentration together with seven supporting factors right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort and right mindfulness
These four truths are not simply facts about stress
They are categories for framing your experience so that you can diagnose and cure the problem of stress
Instead of looking at experience in terms of self or other for instance or in terms of what you like and dislike you look at it in terms of where there's stress what's causing it and how to put an end to the cause
Once you can divide the territory of experience in this way you realize that each of these categories is an activity
The word stress may be a noun but the experience of stress is shaped by your intentions
It's something you do
The same holds true with other truths too
Seeing this you can work on perfecting the skill appropriate for each activity
The skill with regard to stress is to comprehend it to the point where you have no more passion aversion or delusion toward doing it
To perfect this skill you also have to abandon the cause of stress to realize its cessation and to develop the path to its cessation
Each of these skills assists the others
For example when states of concentration arise in the mind you don't just watch them arise and pass away
Concentration is part of the path so the appropriate skill is to try to develop it to understand what will make it grow more steady more solid more subtle
In doing this you develop the other factors of the path as well until the doing of your concentration is more like simply being being a luminous awareness being present being nothing being one with emptiness
From that perspective you begin to comprehend levels of stress you never noticed before
As you abandon the cravings causing the grosser levels you become sensitive to subtler ones so you can abandon them too
You see more and more clearly why you've suffered from stress You didn't grasp the connection between the cravings you enjoyed and the stress that burdened you and didn't detect the stress in the activities you enjoyed
Ultimately when you've abandoned the causes for other forms of stress you begin to see that the being of your concentration contains many layers of doing as well  more layers of stress
That's when you can abandon any craving for these activities and full Awakening occurs
The path to this Awakening is necessarily gradual both because the sensitivity it requires takes time to develop and because it involves developing skills that you abandon only when they've done their job
If you abandoned craving for concentration before developing it you'd never get the mind into a position where it could genuinely and fully let go of the subtlest forms of doing
But as your skills converge the Awakening they foster is sudden
The Buddha's image is of the continental shelf off the coast of India a gradual slope followed by a sudden dropoff
After the dropoff no trace of mental stress remains
That's when you know you've mastered your skills
And that's when you really know the four noble truths
Craving for instance is something you experience every day but until you totally abandon it you don't really know it
You can experience stress for years on end but you don't really know stress until you've comprehended it to the point where passion aversion and delusion are gone
And even though all four skills as you're developing them bring a greater sense of awareness and ease you don't really know why they're so important until you've tasted where their full mastery can lead
For even full knowledge of the four noble truths is not an end in and of itself
It's a means to something much greater Nirvana is found at the end of stress but it's much more than that
It's total liberation from all constraints of time or place existence or nonexistence  beyond all activity even the activity of the cessation of stress
As the Buddha once said the knowledge he gained in Awakening was like all the leaves in the forest the knowledge he imparted about the four noble truths was like a handful of leaves
He restricted himself to teaching the handful because that's all he needed to lead his students to their own knowledge of the whole forest
If he were to discuss other aspects of his Awakening it would have served no purpose and actually gotten in the way
So even though full knowledge of the four noble truths  to use another analogy  is just the raft across the river you need to focus full attention on the raft while you're making your way across
Not only does this knowledge get you to full Awakening but it also helps you judge any realizations along the way
