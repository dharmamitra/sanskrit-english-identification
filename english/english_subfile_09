Dates in the original are always given according to the Buddhist EraWe have converted them to the Common Era which began years later eg BEis CETitles and honorifics are important in Thai social interactionI have tried to follow this convention remaining faithful to the original and hope that it does not prove too unwieldyMany people have helped in the realization of this completely new translationThis more thorough translation originated through the energy of Upasika Tan Bee ChunVenBhikkhu aanadhammo put a great deal of work into assisting with the translation and then Jane Band Steve Gin Cornwall England Barry in Australia Khun and Khunying Suripan in Thailand all helped to complete the taskWe ask forgiveness from the venerable author and our readers for any inadequacies or mistakes in the actual translationAny translation must inevitably fall short of the original and in the end it rests with you the reader to complete the translation within yourselfWhether monk nun or lay person from East or West may this life of Dhamma inspire you to enrich your own life through the practice of DhammaMost biographies are written by someone else or when the person in question is already deadThere is the tendency to follow conventional writing sensibilities by eulogising the subject in a way similar to what one hears at the funeral ritesThough one might know that the person had also committed some dark deeds etiquette and decorum dictate what can be recordedGood manners are exhibited in four waysA person is good in few waysWhen asked about him or her one describes them allOnes own bad traits are fewWhen asked about them one describes them allThough ones good traits are many if nobody asks one says nothing and when asked one says littleI am someone who goes directly for the truth and therefore I dont want anyone to write this sort of biography after I am deadI know about myself so it is better that I do the jobAfter my death they can then write as they like about meIf they dislike me this will influence what they relate perhaps they will inflate the trifling cause of their displeasure beyond the truthOn the other hand if they love me they will magnify my good points out of all proportionIn truth I first wrote this Autobiography only for myself to show my appreciation of a life wearing the saffron robeThere was no thought of publication because I would have felt rather ashamed at the idea for an autobiography is selfpromotingEven when people asked to have it printed for me I still wasnt happy with the ideaWhen lay devotees arranged my sixth cycle birthday celebrations on the twentysixth of April they also asked to print and to distribute my Autobiography at that timeI realized that if I didnt agree it would get written after I was dead anywayI therefore quickly finished off the Autobiography that I had been writing so that it was ready for the celebrationMay readers forgive me if my Autobiography sometimes seems too selfcongratulatory and therefore offends against good tasteBut if one doesnt write about what really happened what else can one include Although I have brought this Autobiography uptodate please understand that the essential core has not been changed because the real subject of the book is still hereMy first name is Thate and I had the family name of Reeo rahngI was born at about nine oclock on a Saturday morning AprilIt was the fourth day of the waning moon in the year of the tigerMy birth place was the village of Nah Seedah in the subdistrict of Glahng Yai Bahn Peur District Udornthani ProvinceMy fathers name was Usah and my mothers KrangThey were ordinary ricefarmers and both had grown up as fatherless orphansAfter migrating from different regions they had met and married at the village of Nah SeedahMy father originally came from Darn Sai in Loei Province while my mother was from Muangfahng in the district of Luplaer Uttaradit ProvinceThey established themselves in Nah Seedah Village and continued living there producing ten children in allWhen I was nine I went with all my friends to the village monastery for schooling studying central Thai and the indigenous and traditional Dhamm and Korm alphabets and scriptsThere were many monks and novices at the local village monastery of Nah Seedah and my eldest brother  who had ordained as a monk  was our teacherHe taught following the Mullabot Bapakit the old fashioned reading primer and I studied there for three yearsHowever I was not very good at my lessons for I preferred to play rather than studyIn those days the establishment of government schools had not yet spread throughout the country sideSo while my eldest brother was a monk he had taken the opportunity to go out and travel and gain some wider experienceHe also had a good retentive memory and was able to learn central Thai quickly and on returning could teach usThere were many of us studying under him  monks and novices as well as childrenThe numbers became so large that some people on seeing the situation asked him whether it had already become an official schoolWe not only studied Thai script but also learned some religious chanting and how to read the texts written in the Dhamm and Korm scriptsThese lessons lasted for three years and then I had to leave the monastery because my elder brother withdrew from the monkhoodMost of my classmates also left because no one could take over the job of teachingAlthough I had left the monastery my life continued to be involved mainly with the monks and novicesWhen my brother left the monkhood no monk remained to take on the responsibilities of abbotOccasionally visiting monks would pass through and it was my job to act as liaison between these monks and the villagersI regularly offered my services in the morning I went to present them with their food in the evening it was the fetching and filtering of their water and then gathering flowers for the monks to use in their devotional offeringsIt was my job quickly to inform the village about how many monks had come and make sure that there was enough food to go roundI conscientiously and unfailing took on these duties for a full six yearsMy parents gave me their full support and encouragement and urged me on in my services to the monksMy undertaking of these duties caused my parents to show me even more love and affectionNevertheless whenever I was slow or tardy they would always make sure that I was put rightIt was not just my parents who considered that I was successfully serving the monks for all the villagers seemed to have a special affection and warmth for meThis was evident whenever business affecting the monks or the monastery came up for then they would always seek me outAbout this time I began thinking with increasing interest about good and evil about virtuous and base deedsWhenever any doubts or questions came up I would always make sure to ask my fatherConsequently he started to take more interest in meAt night when he was free he liked to explain about things  about the ways of the world and about DhammaI can still remember some of his instructionsHe taught me Having been born a son dont be the son of a family cremated in the same cemeteryThis means that a son should go and seek experience and knowledge away from his home villageOne has to die but one shouldnt lie down and die in ones birth placeThis advice really appealed to me because my character already inclined in this directionI asked him If two people go and make merit through good deeds and generosity and one is ordained as a monk while the other isnt which one of them would gain the greater meritHe replied that if a monk does this much merit and he exhibited his thumb he will gain this much result  lifting up two fistfuls in emphasisWhereas he continued the nonordained person might make this much  two fistfuls  merit but he would only receive one thumbs worthAlthough I probably didnt then fully understand his explanation I still felt completely satisfied after hearing and seeing it throughThis might have been because my character already naturally inclined towards the monastic lifeI still remembered an occasion from my early days in the monastery when I went with my elder brother to visit another monasteryThere was a novice there whose demeanour and behavior were exemplaryHe made such a strong impression on me he was so inspiring and admirable that I felt a special sympathy towards himI found myself following his every movement whether he was walking or sitting or going about his various dutiesThe more I gazed after him the stronger my faith and feeling grewOn returning to our monastery I couldnt get his image out of my mindI could think of only one thing Oh when can I ordain and become a novice like himThis was my continual preoccupationAt this point there is something that I feel must relateIt concerns the life story of my parentsThis is something very special for me because I recall their love and kindness towards me with such immense gratitudeParticularly so concerning the time they spent teaching me about various things  especially about morality and religious valuesIt really seems as if they had a special love and concern for meThey also used to tell me about their younger days in quite some detail so much so that listening to their trials and tribulations aroused sadness and a feeling of great pity and compassion for them bothAs I have mentioned before both my father and mother were refugees and fatherless orphansMy father originally lived in the highlands of Darn Sai District in Loei ProvinceHe migrated from there to escape the privations of its handtomouth existence and came down to the more fertile lowlandsPeople had told him that the region around the town of Nongkhai was fertile and abundant in rice and foodThis was in stark contrast to his home region where even though their occupation was the growing of rice they never seemed able to produce enough rice to eatThe countryside there was mostly mountainous with little land available for normal paddy fields so planting supplementary fields up on the mountain slopes was necessaryThis called for the cultivation of large areas to produce sufficient riceMy father told me that because his father was already dead the responsibility for supporting his four brothers and sisters together with his mother had fallen on himTheir fields had extended as far as the eye could seeWhen they paused in their work to have a meal they would not bother putting up any shelter but would eat out under the open skyThis was done because my father was concerned that his younger brothers and sisters after eating their fill would become lazy and want to rest rather than getting on with the workDespite all such effort in years of inadequate rainfall there would not be enough to eatSome families had no rice at all and so were reduced to consuming magor fruits as a substituteThis might have had to keep people going for as long as a month at a timeHe trekked down to the lowlands with his four younger brothers and sisters and their motherThere was sister Boonmah brothers Gunhah and ChiangIn and sister DtaengornThe party expanded when many relatives and other people also elected to goTheir migration involved crossing several high mountain ranges  the Poo Fah and Poo Luang for instance  and dense jungle tractsPeople owning elephants or pack animals could more easily convey their belongings and so had an advantage over those who were forced to carry everything on their shouldersTheir own strength had to serve as their vehicleIt took more than a week to reach the village of Nah NgiewOn arrival they established a temporary camp on the edge of a large lake Nong Pla or Fish Lake in Nong DtaoLater they moved on and made a permanent settlement in the village of Nah Ngiew which is still there to this dayMy mothers side of the family was of the Lao Puan tribeThey had been forced out of Laos by the Thai army in the reign of King Rama III and were released in the region of UttaraditThey later settled down in Muang Fahng Lup Laer District Uttaradit ProvinceMy mother told me that her mother had related the events of the migration down from the town of Chiang Kwahng to herMy grandmother was still too young to walk so the adults put her in a woven bamboo basket that they then suspended from one end of a bamboo carrying pole the other end being balanced with their belongingsIn this way they blazed a trail  penetrating dense jungles fording streams and traversing mountain ranges until they reached Muang FahngWhen my grandmother grew up she married and had two children and these were my mother and her younger brotherAfterwards her husband died and my grandmother was left alone with two childrenAt that time the surrounding regions had become infested with bandits and thieves and the authorities seemed powerless and unable to deal with themUnder such conditions even ordinarily honest people were corrupted and became criminalsAn example of such a person was the man Chiang Tong who had been a member of their migrant groupHe joined the bandits and was constantly leaving home and going out to cause mischiefIn the end he had to flee from the threat of arrest by hiding out around Glahng Yai in Bahn Peur DistrictWhile there he witnessed the goodnaturedness of the local inhabitants and saw their peaceful ways with their abundant and prosperous lifeHe decided to go back to Muang Fahng and report and try to persuade his relatives and friends to move on to Glahng YaiMy mother told me that scores of people decided to join the party that was to journey onThey traveled on foot down through Phetchaboon continuing to Loei Province and stopping to rest at the monastery in Hooay Port VillageIt was there that people came down with smallpox and many diedThe inhabitants of Hooay Port Village showed such good will and kindness in their help towards the needy at this time that several of the party decided to stay on and settle down right thereThose remaining in Chiang Tongs group struggled on down and eventually arrived at Glahng Yai VillageMy grandmother with her younger brother and her two children  this was my mother and her younger brother my uncle  had to remain dependent on older and senior friends in the groupWhen the time arrives for us to experience suffering then odd things can occurIt happened that my grandmothers younger brother met a group of traveling Burmese traders and abruptly decided to go off with themThere had never been any argument or disagreement between them throughout the long journey he simply left and was never heard from againOn arrival at Glahng Yai Village a group separated from the main party and moved on to settle in the village of Nah Bong Poo Pet in the district of PonpisaiOne of my mothers uncles on her fathers side went away with this group leaving my grandmother and her two fatherless children to depend on her elder companionsAfterwards when my mother had grown up she met my father and fell in loveThey were married and settled down to live together in the village of Nah Seedah and produced ten children  as has been mentioned earlierMy grandmother eventually married again this time to the same Chiang Tong who had been their leader on the journeyThey lived out their later years together until misfortune struck a tree branch fell on my grandmothers head and fatally injured herChiang Tong was a person guilty of many wrong doings and kammic retribution soon caught up with himAfter my grandmothers death he again married a woman of the same migrant party but this time his new wife committed suicide by hanging herselfHe realized that he had much evil kamma and so decided to enter a monasteryChiang Tong wore white robes and kept the Eight Precepts of a Buddhist devotee and lived into old age reaching almost a hundred yearsYet he didnt stay in the monastery preferring to live with his grandchildren in their house in the villageHowever when he chanted his daily devotions to the Lord Buddha Dhamma and Sangha his grandchildren would become annoyed at the disturbance and would scold himHe was very old and had nowhere else to go and he was also becoming senile forgetting things such as whether he had eaten or notHis grandchildren became more frustrated and cursed and abused him and not a day passed without them saying they wished he were deadHe returned the abuse and cursed them in endless ways saying he hoped they turned out like himIt was a pitiful state of affairsThose people who have done evil will find that the consequences are liable to catch up with them before they dieLiving amongst base people  those who are unprincipled and lacking in virtue and morality  tends to pass on such evil so that it corrupts most of the people involvedThis suffering of ours has no limitsWe let go of one thing and grasp hold of something elseIt goes on and on and on in this way throughout our lifeThis is why the wise person becomes weary and tired of the suffering inherent in this world and seeks for a way to go beyond itAfter her mother passed away my mother was able to find support from her husband and children for their livelihood was now enough to get by onAlthough they might only have as little as six baht to their name they were not too concernedFood and rice were abundant and money wasnt so necessary in those daysRice farming alone produced enough food to last through the whole year while the cultivation of too large an area meant there would be nowhere  no space left in the granary  to store the extra grainEven farming a modest area still produced a large surplus of paddy riceAfter a time their third son diedMy father had had a particular love for this son and he became so distraught with the loss that he almost went out of his mindThe child had been so loveable and intelligent so wellspoken and articulate so easy to teachHe had been obedient had loved his parents and always listened to their instructionsAlthough there remained six children besides his wife it seemed to my father as if he had lost everythingHe could see only as far as that lone dead child while his despair enveloped everything else in darknessWith time the dark clouds of sorrow gradually dissipated and the light of Dhamma  as found in the Buddhist teachings  began to illuminate his heart allowing him dimly to see the way outHe thought that if he could distance himself from all concerns  by becoming a monk  it might somewhat assuage his griefOne consideration was that he could share the merit gained from such ordination with his dead son and that would certainly enable the son to take rebirth in a happy realmMy father consequently took leave of his wife and children to be ordained and stayed a monk for two Rains RetreatsThis going forth as a monk into the Buddhas religion does not automatically end any of the distress that a person might be feelingSuch suffering arises dependent on internal defilements and we have been accumulating these worldly defilements from the time of our birthThis is something that has been going on for innumerable lives and births so dont even try to disclose and count all those defilementsSomeone lacking in wisdom cant possibly unearth those layers of defilements  laid down and accumulated already beyond counting  and spread them out to seeFor that reason they cant bring about their final eliminationAs the clouds of his sorrow gradually lifted my father realized that he missed his six innocent children and his abandoned wifeThey were fatherless without friends or relatives and this moved him to leave the monkhood and become a householder againThis was good fortune for those of us who still had to take birthMy young sister and I were subsequently born into my parents home born to people who had founded their lives in goodnessI am proud to say that this birth place compares favorably with any other in this world because from birth onwards I was always in contact with virtue and DhammaI was able to grow up and mature in the cool shade of the yellow robe of Buddhism right until todayThe thing that I rejoice in most is that although I didnt support my parents in the normal lay manner I could still sustain and foster their goodwill and kindheartednessThis was achieved by my following the holy life as a monk and by being able to help train their hearts in stages right up to the last days of their livesBoth my parents seemed well pleased with how I had turned out and were not disappointed in having brought me upThis was because I had fulfilled a sons filial obligationsThat is to say I had given them teachings and instruction concerning the practice of morality and virtue which enabled what they already knew to develop progressively higher and higherI am especially happy that I was able to help my father with advice and suggestions about his meditation practice right until his last dayHe was delighted and more than willing to receive my training methods and to put them into practice until he was able clearly to see the results in his own heartEventually he was able to exclaim that throughout all his seventyfive years he had never known such peace and happinessIt gives me enormous joy to have taught my mother right through to her final dayWhen she was breathing her last I was present caring for her helping her to remember DhammaShe was consciously aware and willingly took my counsel to heart so that in her last moments her face became bright and radiantThere is a stanza of the Lord Buddha  if I remember it correctly  where he outlined how a son of good family intent on repaying the kindness and virtue of his father and mother should actIf he were to administer to their every need in the best possible way to a degree difficult to find in the world even if he were to provide them with the treasure of a World Ruling Monarchas an offering  all this would still fall shortIt still could not be considered full recompense for the kindness and excellence of ones parentsThis is because all those things can only offer pleasure and happiness during their lifetimeOnce they have died there is no way they can take such things with themHowever if the son of good family instructs his mother and father who are deficient in morality and virtue to establish themselves in these wholesome and fine qualities or if they are already established therein he encourages and supports their further development then that son can be considered one who has truly repaid his debtThe wealth of the Noble Treasure is priceless and can go with the individual wherever he or she may goTherefore saying that I have managed to practice following all the Lord Buddhas instructions is not incorrectIt is the complete fulfillment of ones obligations even though a proper and formal contract may never have been madeAbout this time in my life  perhaps it was because I was entering my teens or for another reason I dont know  my father showed an extra special interest in meAfter the evening meal around seven oclock he was liable to bring up some topic and illustrate it with examplesHe regularly taught me in this way no matter whether it was concerned with spiritual or worldly mattersSometimes he would question me or ask my opinionFor example he would enquire Do you like girlsAnd when you marry what sort of girl will you marryThis is how it proceededI can still remember my answer I like girls with a fair and light complexion without blemish courteous and well mannered in thought speech and behaviorHer family background wouldnt pose any problemHowever if she came from a good respectable family all the betterWhile asleep one night I had a visionary dreamThere I was with a large group of friends setting out from the house to go and play in the fieldsThis was typical boyish behavior for us in those daysJust then two forest monks appeared walking towards us with alms bowl and krot over their shouldersOn seeing me one of the monks rushed at me and I was so afraid that I fled for my lifeYet all my friends just stood there unconcerned as if nothing untoward was taking placeThe circumstances were such that I had to take the final resort by seeking refuge at home with my parentsYet it wasnt to be for when I ran into the house yelling to mother and father for help both remained impassive and unconcerned as if nothing unusual was going onMeanwhile the forest monk hadnt stopped chasing after me and was close on my heelsI ran into the bedroom and dived under the mosquito netThe monk burst in after me and yanked up the mosquito netThen using a whip he lashed at me with all his strengthI was terrified and so startled that it woke me upWhen I came to my senses I found I was still trembling and was soaked in perspiration from head to toeMy heart throbbed violently and where I had been whipped still stungI really thought that it had all actually happened and even gingerly felt with my hand to checkIt was so vivid that it seemed realI then pulled myself together and mindfully went over what had happenedAfter careful consideration the mind eventually calmed down and my fear went awayThis episode gradually faded from my memory and was forgotten for a long timeIt was only when I was out wandering in the jungle as a forest novicemonk with my meditation teacher that it all came back to meThat visionary dream from the distant past did truly seem to point out future events and to have been correct in every respectAbout this time another incident happened to me  but this was no dream or visionI had been unable to get to sleep until late at night for I was taken up with recalling and reflecting on the great kindness and goodness of my parentsI allowed my thoughts to wander and pondered about them seeing how they had raised and nurtured us ten children with great sacrifice and grinding toil until we reached maturitySoon their children would be grown up and married and have families of their ownThey would all then disperse going their separate waysI reached that thought and felt compelled to consider what my parents situation would then be likeWho was going to provide for and take care of my mother and fatherI was considering all this according to the sensibility of a child without real thought for the futureThis made me feel very sad and despondent grieving for the future destitute condition of my parentsIt moved me so much that I began to sob and the tears soaked my pillowI was in this state for a long time and the more I thought about them the greater my despondencyI made the decision that when I was grown up I would not get married like everyone elseWhen everyone else left home I would take over the responsibility of caring for mother and father all by myself and do it to the best of my abilityMy heart was gladdened and contented after arriving at this resolution and as it was already very late into the night I fell asleepAll dhammas exist here within each of us and the one that knows Dhamma is the heart or mindWhether it knows much or little whether it knows in a course or more refined way depends on ones present competence ones aptitude and maturity and the training each person has receivedThe resolution that I made then came from gratitude and appreciation of the goodness and virtue of my parentsAnother night a similar thing happenedI lay there reflecting on the condition of the ordinary village farmer and their routine working yearThe annual cycle begins during the months of March and April when forest needs to be cleared for new fieldsThe area is burned off the remaining stumps and roots dug out and fences erectedWhen the monsoon rains arrive the various crops have to be prepared and planted out according to whatever is plannedThose families with few or insufficient members would have to decide how to divide their time between the various tasksThere is the general plowing to do and the sowing and preparation of the nurseryrice seedlingsThis entails working and laboring continuously until the rice seedlings are ready for transplantingThere is then the replanting of each young rice plant into the plowed and ready fieldsOf course I am speaking here of a year with good and timely rainA dry year means wasted time and effort with deprivation and lossIt is mainly the housewifes task to have previously organized adequate suppliesThis would include for example rice chilipeppers salt pickled fish and tobaccoThen when everyone gets down to work in the fields there is no need to be concerned about finding provisionsNormally with favorable rainfall they will complete the rice planting by August or it might extend into SeptemberWith that done everyone turns to gathering food reserves to be put away ready for harvest timeBesides this there is fishing gear to be repaired and readied for use in the coming dry seasonAs the monks come to the end of their Rains Retreat the villagers will usually begin harvesting the paddy riceHowever prior to this they must first harvest any hill riceThroughout the harvesting season there is still the added labor of picking the other crops and vegetables as they ripen in their fieldsThere may be chilipeppers cotton and beansIn those days when the paddy crop was abundant the harvesting might not be completely finished much before late JanuaryThen came the job of transporting the threshed rice to the storage granaries that might go on into FebruaryEven when harvesting was taking place during the day at night the bamboo strips to bind the rice sheaves had to be fashionedWith the harvest over there would then be firewood to find for boiling up the sugar cane to obtain the syrupAbout the boiling up of the sugar caneThe daily process began in the early afternoon with entry into the sugar cane plantationSufficient cane had to be cut ready for the next mornings boilingThe cut cane was carried out of the fields and carted off  if one owned a cart  and stacked at the boiling shedGetting up at first light one had to go and press the juice out of the cane and this would go on late into the morningInadequate help would bring delay so that someone would have to go off and prepare the mealWith the sugar cane all pressed everyone could come together for a communal mealAfter that they would all separate and go about their respective duties leaving one person to watch over the cauldron of boiling sugar cane juiceSome farmers had so much sugar cane that they didnt finish processing it until MarchBy then it was time to start clearing the forest to make fields once moreWell thenWhat was it on that night that led me to go over all this in such detailAll the different phases of the adults working yearWhat was I afterIt saddened me so feeling for and sympathizing with the sort of life we are born into deficient in opportunity or free timeAfter our birth there seems only to be actions and deeds to be doneIndividual distinctions only appear because of disparate duties and difference in rank or statusThe future leads on into a continuing doing unless that is one is asleep or deadThis way of thinking went directly against my juvenile views and perception of realityI was intoxicated with the idea that this world is so much funRemember in those days children didnt have to go to school nor did they have any responsibilities to worry aboutAfter having eaten there was only playing around and looking for fun with my friendsIf sometimes we had to go and take the cattle or buffalos out to graze we could also turn that into funOn that night I clearly perceived all the suffering involved in being born into this world as a human beingI saw it for myself right there in my own heart previously never having given it any consideration at allThis time however my perception was only about seeing the suffering inherent in the struggle to fill ones stomach with seeing that each day offered no free time no break in the processI could not see what I had to do to surmount and go beyond such sufferingThat lack of understanding shows that it cannot be considered the Noble Truth of Suffering for it is only concerned with the ordinary mundane truth of sufferingIt was during this period that our part of the country became infested with brigands and cattle rustlersThese gangsters took over the whole region and even tenyearold children and women engaged in the thievingThe authorities were impotent and so the villagers had to look after themselvesEach household kept a whole pack of guard dogs and at night everyone had to take it in turns to stand guardWhenever cattle were stolen the owner would have to go and pay an absurdly overpriced ransom for their returnThe stouthearted would go out after the thieves and hunt them down like wild animalsThere would then be some peace and respiteThe authorities seemed to approve and even actively encourage such retaliationI was still only small but I also had some big ideas about being famousI did not want to become renowned as thief or robber but rather as the hero who conquered them so I set my mind on one thing What can I do to make myself invulnerable to all weaponsI could then go out and crush these hordes of brigands wiping them all outAt this time I was also helping to look after a very talkative and boastful monk  excuse me but that is the description he deservesHis place of origin was the village of Muang Kai which is where the district of Varnornnivart borders on Bueng Kahn DistrictHe shrewdly must have guessed my innermost thoughts because before long he was suggesting After the Rains Retreat why dont you come back with me to my home villageI have there every sort of thingIf you want charms arcane herbs the whole range of accessories that give invulnerability I have them allI was delighted with thisSo as soon as the Rains Retreat ended three older youths  my elder brother and two of his friends  with myself as a much younger fourth accompanied this monk back to his home villageWe discovered on reaching our destination that the monk had really duped us into escorting him back homeNone of the villagers in that area had any respect for him because he had already ordained and disrobed numerous timesThe last news I heard of him was that he had disrobed yet again had got married and that both husband and wife were smoking opiumThe two bigger youths who had gone with us still pleaded with him to learn about and obtain the various special thingsBut he was always evasive and beat around the bush and looked for excuses to extricate himselfWe discovered the truth when we spoke to the other monks in that monastery for really he didnt have anything remarkable or rare his only accomplishment being that of bragging and talking bigOur group stayed with him for about ten days before taking leave to return home with our hopes all unrealizedEvery day while we had been staying with him he had urged us to go out to find eels for him to eatHe really loved eels although he didnt like any other type of fishIt took us three days to walk homeI felt particularly humiliated and ashamedOn leaving home I had resolved to seek out and learn the occult knowledge of invulnerability so that by my return I would be secure against any weapon belonging to anyoneWhen I reached home my friends found every possible opportunity to make fun of me and this made me feel even more humiliatedHowever the experience did have its positive side for I became disillusioned with the whole thing and lost my foolish credulity in charms and magical powersFrom that day forward right up to the present whenever anyone comes in and talks of their wondrous properties my mind remains wholly indifferentWhen I later became a novice my friends had tried to persuade me to go and study about such thingsThey were even willing to pay the customary teachers fee and sponsor the whole venture but I would not change my mindI consider myself particularly fortunate on this account I had been born into a family of good moral conduct and virtuous behavior I had been taught and prepared through living in a monastery with monks  who could be truly regarded as good monksWhenever external conditions and surroundings coerced and pressured my mind forcing it to turn towards what was low and base it seemed that things never turned out as my base desires would have itIf they had who knows what might have happened to mePerhaps one can say that my good kamma and past merit guided and protected meThat long journey was the first time in my life that I had gone away from homeWe were all staying at Muang Kai Village when the news first came through about the outbreak of World War It was all anyone ever spoke about when they came to visit the monasteryI became so homesick that I cried every daySome days I couldnt get to sleep until late into the night because of my constant pining for my parentsWhen I arrived home again I resumed my practice of serving the monks in the monastery as I had always doneHowever I didnt always sleep at the monastery and had the duty of bursar or steward to the monks being the intermediary and liaison between them and the villagersThis worked out very wellAll the villagers seemed increasingly to appreciate my efforts because I had become adept and competentAnother consideration in their growing interest in me might have been that I was also entering adolescenceThey would give me jobs to do and simultaneously tease meI had been going regularly to the monastery throughout an extended period of about six years and had become closely acquainted with the monks and novicesHowever on no occasion did any of the monks teach me about keeping the Five or Eight PreceptsStrange as it may seem this is quite understandable because the Sangha or Community of monks of that time was seriously deficient in learningIn VenAjahn Singh Khantayaagamo and VenAjahn Kham  disciples of the Venerable Meditation Master Ajahn Mun Bhuuridatta Thera  were out walking tudongThey were the first forest monks to reach the village of Nah SeedahAlthough there were monks resident in the local monastery they still came and asked to stay with usIt almost seemed to me as if they had aimed specifically at coming to see my father and meWe attended on them with deep reverence and faith because we saw that their way of practice was different from other groups of meditation monksIn particular the visiting monks taught me about their various obligations and dutiesFor example I learned the dos and donts in offering things to a monk and about meditation using the mantra word Buddho as an object of preliminary recitationMy mind was able to converge in samadhi to the point where I lost all desire to speak with anyoneThis was where I first experienced the flavor of meditations peace and stillnessIts something Ive never forgottenLater when I was a novice studying with many others I would slip out  unknown to anyone  into the cool and quiet of the night to meditate aloneThe venerable monks stayed with us for a little more than two monthsAt first they were also intending to spend the Rains Retreat but a previous malarial infection flared up againTherefore just before the start of the Rains Retreat they left to stay at an abandoned monastery in the village of Nah Bong Nahm Mong Subdistrict in the district of Tah Bor and I was able to go with themThe monks were ill with malaria throughout the three months of the Rains RetreatIn spite of his illness VenAjahn Singh would still kindly use some of his free time to teach me reading and writing with occasional training in religious mattersTowards the end of the Rains Retreat something came up in his mind  I dont know quite what  for he said that after the Retreat he would have to return to his home village and asked if I would go with himThe journey will be long and tough he addedMy answer was an immediate Venerable Sir I will go with youA few days before the end of the Rains Retreat I asked his permission to go home to take leave of my parentsBoth of the monks seemed pleased with the idea that I would be going with them and they quickly organized some flowers incense and candles for me to go and offer to my parentsThis is the traditional way of asking forgiveness and blessingOn the evening of that night after seeking forgiveness and a blessing from my parents I continued around and asked the same of all the family elders and the older people in the villageWhomever I went to see would weep with sorrow as if I were going off to my deathI became a bit sentimental and could not hold back my own tearsAt daybreak my mother and aunt set out with me to where the Venerable Ajahn was staying and we all spent the night thereIt was Pavarana the last day of the Rains Retreat and early the following morning after the meal the Venerable Ajahn led us off on our journeyOnce again my aunt and the villagers gathered there and shed some tears togetherIt was perhaps unprecedented for a boy of that region and my age to venture away from home on such a long journeyIt also meant being cut off from my relatives and friends who would have offered comfort and warmthNot only that it seems that I may well have been the first boy to venture off  without any worries or regrets  following after forest meditation monksWe set off walking from Tah Bor wading through water and mud steadily pressing on through the forest and passing across the rice fieldsWhenever one of the monks became feverish with malaria he would climb up to rest in a field shelter or else under a tree that was shady and dry out of the mudAt day break the venerable monks would still make the effort to go out on alms round and they were able to feed me tooWe walked for three days before reaching the provincial town of Udornthani staying at Wat Majjhimavat for ten nights before setting off again on our journeyWe took the road to Khon Kaen Province and passed through the present provinces of Mahasarakam Roiet and YasotornThis journey of ours  the two of us with the Venerable Ajahn  took just over a month before reaching Nong Korn Village of Hua Dtaphan Subdistrict in the district of Amnart CharoenThis was the village where the Venerable Ajahns mother livedHe stayed there for about three months so that he could teach and help her in spiritual mattersWhile staying in Nong Korn Village VenAjahn Singh sent me to ask for novice ordination with the Venerable Upajjhaaya Looee from the monastery in Keng Yai Village who would act as my PreceptorI was about to enter my eighteenth yearAt this time I was becoming somewhat more proficient in my reading and had been going through the TrailokavithanThis book describes the future degeneration and destruction of the world of the satthantara kappa timeReading this moved me to deep sadness and my eyes were filled with tears for many a dayAt meal times I had no appetite because my heart was lost in thoughts of the approaching degeneration and the calamity awaiting human beings and all creaturesIt was as if all this would be unfolding before my eyes within just a few daysVenerable Ajahn Singh took me to stay at Wat Sutatnarahm in Ubon townIt was a monastery where he himself had once livedI now entered the monastery school at Wat Seetong to continue with my Thai Language studiesHaving settled me there and with the Rains Retreat being over VenAjahn Singh turned back to his forest wanderingHe returned by way of Sakhon Nakorn Province because a group of monks led by the Venerable Ajahn Mun was wandering in that regionThe night before VenAjahn Singh set out he called a meeting of the monks and novices and informed us of his intentionsOn hearing this news I felt such an enormous reluctance to be parted from him that I began to sob  right there in the middle of that large gatheringFeeling selfconscious and embarrassed in front of my friends I beat a hasty retreat and hurried outside to reestablish some mindfulness and try to compose myselfI remembered the occasion in the time of the Lord Buddha when the Venerable Ananda wept on learning that the Lord Buddha was soon finally to pass awayBy reflecting on this it somewhat assuaged my own hearts grief and I could go back into the meetingThe Venerable Ajahn had meanwhile been teaching on various themesAt the same time as learning Thai I had to allocate time for memorizing Pali chanting and studying the General Dhamma Studies CourseI was very conscious that in spite of being so much older than the other students keeping up with them would be difficultI was going through the third grade of the course but couldnt sit the final examination because the Ecclesiastical Head Monk of that Region had made a rule that one had to be more than twenty years oldIt therefore wasnt until my third year there that I could take the examination and was able to pass it that same yearMy memorizing of the Pali texts continued and I was learning by heart the Paatimokkha RuleI applied myself to this because of my regard and admiration for the monastic disciplineMy Thai language studies only extended to the completion of the primary education courseOn leaving the Thai language school I turned my full attention to studying PaliHowever in that year of my studies it so happened that VenMahaa Pin Paññaabalo  who was the younger brother of VenAjahn Singh  came back from BangkokHe initiated a course in Nak Dhamm Toh Grade Two which was the first of its kind in that administrative region of the NortheastI therefore also enrolled for that course but I was never able to finish it nor indeed the Pali because VenAjahn Singh returned to spend the Rains Retreat at Wat SutatnarahmAfter the Rains Retreat  and before I could take my examinations  he led VenAjahn Mahaa Pin and me off on tudongIt was the novice Thate who became the millionaireHere I am talking about the time when the government thought up the idea of creating one new millionaire every year in ThailandThey thus brought out an annual lottery with a first prize of fifty or sixty thousand bahtIn those days this was considered a fortune large enough for a Thai millionaireIt was all done so that we Thais would not feel humiliated before other richer countriesOne night it so happened that Novice Thate was unable to sleep because he had just won first prize in the lotteryIt was time to set about finding the site to build himself a grand and extensive three story mansionThis residence would be furnished to the most modern designs and be in the center of the commercial districtThe employees and assistants would have to fill the shelves with every imaginable kind of merchandiseHe would be at ease in body and mind without a worry in the world and spend his time lounging on a sofa making eyes at the attractive young women who would come in to shopWhoever chanced a glance in his direction and smiled would receive a happy smile backThroughout his life of eighteen to nineteen years he had never known greater happinessHe had indeed attained the rank of millionaire  just as the government had wishedYet then within the blink of an eye with all the things still fresh and new aniccaa or impermanence intrudesAh impermanenceAll abruptly breaks down and disappears from his heart and thats something he regrets so muchNovice Thate comes to his senses and he realizes that it is already late into the night It should already be time for sleep  Hey what is thisNot only has the lottery yet to take place but I havent even bought a ticketHow come Ive already become a millionaireI must be going crazyThat night he felt an unspeakable degree of mortification and shameIf any knowledgeable persons were to know about these fantasies what would they sayHe finally fell asleep and awoke at dawn with guilty feelings from the night before and never told anyone about this occurrenceAnyone can become this sort of millionaire  not just Novice ThateI described him as a millionaire only in the sense that in his minds eye he could imagine possession of an abundance of property and wealthStill at least he was content with the amount that his imagination producedThis is much better than those people already possessing material wealth who fantasize about getting even moreThey are forever dissatisfied with what they already have and thereby are always discontented and troubledOf what benefit is all that wealth to such peopleWealthy or poor the real question lies with whether one is happy or notIt is certainly not the case that the more one possesses the better it isThe Lord Buddha thus taught that contentment with what one actually has is a resource and wealth of great valueI went forth as a monk through my faith in the Lord Buddhas Teaching  the Dhamma and the Vinaya DisciplineThen I sincerely followed the way of practice clearly seeing the truth that he had indicatedThe Lord Buddha once pointed out a money bag to Venerable Ananda and explained that it was something poisonousHe added that it was not only poisonous to monks and nuns who involve themselves with it but also to lay people who do not know how to handle it correctlyFor lay people however it is a necessity something that has to be used for their condition and way of life is quite different from that of a monk or nunTaking this further anyone in possession of great wealth but unable to deal with it properly is in the same position as someone holding a firebrandThe fire will inevitably burn down from the ignited end to scorch the hand that grasps itI was a novice for five years before becoming a monk and having spent such a long time in a monastery gave me a considerable advantage over the other newly ordained monksI was on old hand so to speak and knew very well how the monastery workedIt gave me a head start over those who were given bhikkhu ordination with meFor instance I already knew the chanting and could recite the PatimokkhaOn the th of May atAM I went forth as a monk in the ordination boundary of Wat SutatI was approaching twentytwo years of ageMy Preceptor was the Venerable Phra Maharat with Venerable Maha Pin Paññaabalo acting as the Announcing AjahnThis was the year that my teacher the Venerable Ajahn Singh Khantayaagamo led a party of six  four monks and two novices  to spend the Rains Retreat at Wat SutatIt was the first time that a community of forest meditation monks stayed the Rains Retreat in the provincial town of UbonVenerable Ajahn Singh came back to spend the Rains Retreat in Ubon because he learned that his younger brother Venerable Maha Pin had arrived back there from BangkokVenAjahn Singhs plan was to take his brother out wandering for meditation in the jungleBefore VenMaha Pin had gone to Bangkok he had promised VenAjahn Mun that he would first go and study and then come back to take up the way of practiceVenAjahn Singh had been delighted to hear that his younger brother had returned and thus came to spend the Rains Retreat at Wat SutatnarahmFollowing the end of the Rains Retreat and the Kathina season VenAjahn Singh led a large group of us walking on tudongThose of us new to tudong apart from VenMaha Pin and myself were VenKam Phooay VenTorn and two novicesThere were twelve of us all togetherI had been living at Wat Sutat in Ubon separated from family and close friends for a full six yearsWhile I was living there various people left their sons and grandsons under my careFour boys lived with me as my disciples of whom two were ordained as novicesThey had been with me ever since my own novice days right through to my ordination as a monkWe had developed a fatherson relationship and so when it came time to separate they all began to weep thinking how much they were going to miss meI too was almost unable to hold back my tearsHowever being their teacher it would have looked bad if I cried in front of them so I gritted my teeth and suppressed my sorrow not letting my true feelings showEven so I found my voice hoarse with emotionAt the time those feelings hadnt seemed too overpowering but later after we had left they seeped in and made me feel dull and listless for a remarkably long timeWhether I was walking standing sitting or lying down even while talking or eating my heart was preoccupied in gloom and sadness longing for my disciplesHow will they manageWhat will they eatWill they have enough to eat or have to go withoutWho will teach themOr perhaps someone would come along to bully and boss them aboutThis was the first time in my life that I had ever experienced such depressionI therefore had to think through and reflect on my situation These boys are neither my children nor my grandchildren they arent blood relatives they only came to rely and depend on meI guided and instructed them to the best of my abilityWhy is it that I miss and pine about them so much At this point I pondered what it must be like for people with a wife and children of their ownThereIf these disciples had been my own sons my own flesh and blood how much greater would have been my griefI now perceived the drawback and danger in such longing and yearning and this realization permeated right through to my heartThis understanding has never been lostHuman beings are really no different from young monkeys that cannot live alone separated from their motherThis caused me to become overwhelming fearful of sentimental attachmentSuch yearning and longing lead to suffering both when one is united and when separatedWhat can we do to gain freedomOur party of twelve  eight monks and four novices  with VenAjahn Singh leading made our way out of Ubon town during NovemberWe walked steadily on never staying anywhere along the way for more than a single night until we arrived at the village of Hua DtaphanWe rested there for quite some time before moving on to stay at Hua Ngoo Village where we readied our requisites before continuing our wanderings through the forestOur walking on tudong this time did not offer much solitude and seclusion because of the large number in our partyNevertheless it did give a fair taste of the experience of walking and wandering through forests and jungleFor instance one night we arranged our resting places with krot umbrellas and mosquito nets in placeAfter we had chanted our evening puja a storm broke on us with gale force winds and pouring rainTo lie down or even to sit became impossible as the area started to floodWe quickly gathered up our gear and fled thinking to ask for shelter in the nearby village monasteryBesides everything else we couldnt find the right path into the village which meant we had to circle back and forth close to the village perimeter for many hoursWhen we eventually reached the village monastery we found that it was already occupied by sleeping lay peopleThese were the six traveling salesmen who had been walking with us for part of the journeyWhen they had previously spotted the mass of dark storm clouds building up on the horizon they had announced that they were going to stay in the village rather than sleeping outThey now helped to arrange whatever sleeping places could be found for usWith the sleeping places arranged we hurried back to escort the VenAjahn in with those seven or eight of our companions who had remained outside with himReaching the monastery and sorting out our things we could then lie down and try to get some sleepThe hut though was absolutely soaked through and there were no mats or pillows available because it was an abandoned monasteryYet our exhaustion enabled us to gain some brief sleep even if everything was wet throughAt daybreak we went out on alms round to the village and received nothing more than plain cooked rice and a banana eachAfter the meal we continued our journeyThe VenAjahn led us straight through dense jungles towards the provincial towns of Roiet and KalasinWe passed through Dong Ling and emerged in the district of Sahassakan near Koomphavapee District of Udornthani ProvinceHowever we didnt actually enter the main town but stayed to the west in the village of Chiang PinWe went there to await the arrival from Bangkok of the Ecclesiastical Head of that Region or Chao Kana MontonThe Chao Kana Monton instructed our party to come and wait upon him in Udorn at this time with the aim of bringing VenMaha Pin to take up residence in UdornThis was because Udorn town didnt yet have any monks of the Dhammayut CommunityHowever things didnt turn out that wayWhen the Chao Kana Monton arrived from Bangkok it was learned that Phraya Rachanukoon had requested VenMahaa Joom Bandhulo to accompany him to Udorn so that he could take up residence at Wat Bodhisomphorn thereWe all went to pay our respects to the Chao Kana Monton as soon as he arrived and found that there had been another change of plansHe now wanted to send VenMaha Pin to stay in the province of Sakhon Nakorn and to have me stay with VenMaha Joom in UdornHis reasons being that there werent any suitable monks in UdornAlso he thought that as I was a local and already had some academic training I should stay and help see to the administrative business of the monksI instead requested that he allow me to go off to practice meditation to honor his authority and dignityFor meditation monks were few and far between whereas scholastic and administrative monks were numerous and wouldnt be difficult to findHe gave his permission and recommended that I should stay and assist VenMaha PinAfter these matters had all been settled VenAjahn Singh led our group off to pay respects to Venerable Ajahn Mun who was staying at Kor Village in the district of Bahn PeurVenerable Ajahn Sao also happened to be there at that timeSo it came about that I was able to meet both Venerable Ajahns and pay my respects to them for the first time in my lifeThat evening VenAjahn Mun wholeheartedly bestowed on us a Dhamma talk to mark the occasion of seeing us for the first timeThis was especially so when he saw VenMaha PinIt was VenMaha Pin who had previously committed himself  after listening to Dhamma talks by VenAjahn Mun and VenAjahn Singh while in Ubon  to return and practice after studying academically in BangkokAs for me VenAjahn Mun probably only knew as much about me as VenAjahn Singh had passed on to himThat night after the Dhamma talk was over VenAjahn Mun spoke more informally with us about DhammaHe concluded the discussion by forecasting something about the various abilities and qualities of VenMaha Pin and myselfThis made me feel extremely uncomfortable and abashed for I was right there in the midst of the monks and was not only newly ordained but I couldnt see in myself anything special enough to interest the VenAjahn MunIn fact I had begun to feel very selfconscious from the moment we entered the monastery area in the early part of the evening  although I dont know how the others felt about itI had looked over the place and noted the way the monks lived similarly with the novices and right through to the lay people in the monasteryHow could they all be so well mannered and orderlyEach seemed to be going about their personal duties and routine tasksThen came the predictions about VenMaha Pin and when he moved on to me it doubled my embarrassmentVenerable Maha Pin himself probably didnt feel much at all apart from some introspective checking of his abilities with what VenAjahn Mun had predictedThe next morning after the meal VenAjahn Singh led our party off again on the trail to the village of Nah SeedahWe stayed there for four nights before retracing our steps back to spend another night with VenAjahn MunThen we walked back to Udorn and carried on to Sakhon Nakorn in line with what we had agreed with the Chao Kana MontonHowever subsequent events didnt work out as the Chao Kana Monton had planned because VenMaha Pin became ill and couldnt take up the duties entrusted to himTherefore for that years Rains Retreat the VenAjahn Singh took our group of monks off to stay at the forest monastery of Nong Laht VillageThis action made the Chao Kana Monton highly displeased with us so we had to send VenBoon who had completed the General Dhamma Studies Course to stay in Sakhon NakornBefore entering the Rains Retreat I found an excellent Dhamma companion in a monk by the name of Venerable Glom from Loei ProvinceWe had twice gone up to the cave Tam Puang on Poo Lek mountain to develop meditation togetherThe first time we went up for four nights and the second time for six nightsThe village headman named Ornsee   arranged for someone to climb up to offer us food on a regular basisI will always remember his kindness and goodwillVenAjahn Mun had remarked that this particular village headman was intelligent and astute about everything  from his quickwitted speech to his work and social involvements in the communityHe always seemed able to keep abreast of affairsWhen it came to monks his talents were remarkable for he was immediately and competently able to arrange whatever a monk might need with nothing more than the barest hint by the monkThe two of us were thus supplied with all four suitable things supportive of meditation practice and so were able to push strongly forwardThe more we meditated the more we felt grateful to the headman and the villagers for all their goodwillOur daily meal consisted of one ball of glutinous rice about the size of a baelfruit with some dried chili powderThis was enough to sustain us in our meditation practice without any harmful effectsReducing food intake while increasing meditation exertion brings lightness to the body clarity to the mindfulness and makes samadhi less difficultI meditated with great diligence and my mindfulness improved and became more firmly establishedWhile living in the cave I trained my mindfulness to give it a constancy throughout the day and nightI refused to allow any lapse when my mind might heedlessly wander away following after external objectsMindfulness became steadily and exclusively established in the body and mindI even made sure that however my mind had been established before going to sleep it would return to the same state on awakeningAlthough sometimes there was still a bit of absentmindedness during the mealIncreasing my exertion also raised my appreciation for the villagers goodwill  it seemed to follow like the shadow its subjectI was very much aware that being a monk my existence rested in the hands of the villagers and I therefore continued my meditation practice to repay my debt to themI became certain that my meditation efforts during this time completely fulfilled the obligations of my indebtednessAs the Rains Retreat approached we went down to stay with VenAjahn Singh in the monastery of Nong Lart VillageAs I was still a newly ordained monk during this Rains Retreat I didnt have to take on any responsibilitiesApart that is from attending to the needs of the senior monk and applying myself to the meditation practiceThe Venerable Ajahn gave us special consideration in thisThroughout the Rains Retreat I further developed my meditation practice following the scheme that I had observed while out on the mountainOn top of that I added some yoga techniques as an experimentBy this I mean progressively reducing my daily food intake from seventy small lumps of sticky rice down to three mouthfulsThen I gradually increased again to thirty mouthfuls before cutting back down to five mouthfulsEach sequence of this would take some three or four days and I continued like this throughout the Rains RetreatAlthough the longest period was when I ate only fifteen mouthfuls of food a day and then it was only vegetarian foodMy build is naturally quite slim and so when that became quite emaciated the villagers started to noticeEveryone who saw me asked what was wrong but I had the will power and the spirit to carry on as normal with my duties and meditation practiceAs soon as the Rains Retreat was over I resumed eating some meat and fish againBut OhHow foul they now smelledWe human beings consume their meat and make it into our own fleshIts just as if we snatch away and steal something foul and then eat itThis is why the devas and other heavenly beings wont come close to humans  its our offensive smellYet human beings themselves seem to find no difficulty in embracing and admiring these corpses of oursAfter the Rains Retreat I went up onto the mountain once more but this time accompanied by VenAjahn Singh himselfWe had stayed up there for nine days when he became ill and asked me to go down and bring back the rest of our party of monksWhen we saw that taking care of him there wouldnt be convenient we all moved down to nurse him in the forest area of Nong BooaVenAjahn Mun sent a message at that time requesting that I go and meet him in the district of Tah BorI complied with those instructions and took my leave of VenAjahn Singh and as it happened met up with VenAjahn Mun and VenAjahn Sao along the wayThey had received an invitation from Wat Bodhisomphorn in the town of UdornthaniIt was at this time that Grandmother Noi came to take part in the consecration ceremony for the laying down of the boundary stones of Wat BodhisomphornThis was her first meeting with VenAjahn MunShe had been able to listen to one of his sermons and her faith in him beganI was able to stay there with VenAjahn Mun for many days before we both set out for Tah BorDuring this Rains Retreat I resided near the village of Nah Chang Nam and not far from Tah Bor where VenAjahn Mun was stayingVenerable Ajahn Oon and I conscientiously made the effort to go regularly to see him and listen to his Dhamma talksThis Rains Retreat I was again without any responsibilities except continuing with my own meditation practiceAll other tasks such as receiving any guests I had handed over to VenAjahn OonPreviously he had been a teacher in the Mahaanikaya and a monk there for nine years having only recently transferred to the Dhammayut NikayaDuring this Rains Retreat a sad event concerning VenAjahn Tah took placeHe was one of the more senior monks and I think I am right in saying he was also VenAjahn Muns very first discipleI think he had been a monk for about sixteen or seventeen yearsOriginally he had gone to undertake studies in Bangkok but was unable to complete themHe had heard of VenAjahn Muns good reputation from the frequent extolling by VenChao Khun Phra Upali and therefore left Bangkok to follow VenAjahn MunThis year VenAjahn Tah had gone with VenAjahn Khan to spend the Rains Retreat in the Pah Bing Cave in Loei ProvinceWhile there he had become unbalanced and had fled in the middle of the Retreat to see Venerable Ajahn MunVenAjahn Tah said that he had committed the worst possible breach of the Monastic Discipline and that his distress was so intense that it felt as if his yellow robes were on fireWhen a thorough inquiry into the circumstances and events in question was made there was evidently no truth in the matter at allIt was just his own exaggerated doubts and anxieties over some trivial incidents that had thrown him into turmoilOne of VenAjahn Tahs tribulations concerned what had occurred some time previously when he had gone to develop his meditation near the village of Pone SawangHis samadhi had become strong and this had brought great brightness to the mindAny Dhamma issue that he brought up for investigation seemed to be totally cleared up and then the heart would converge to onepointednessThis made him believe that I have come to the end of the Holy LifeHe later announced this claim in the midst of the community of monksAfterwards when that bright condition of mind faded he began to suspect that he was guilty of boasting about obtaining supernormal states and had thus broken the monks discipline in the worst possible wayAlthough people explained to him that there was definitely no offence because he had made his claim through mistaken assumptions and misinterpretations he wouldnt believe themIn fact this guiltridden anxiety had already caused him many years of distress but he had previously endured itHowever with the arrival of this Rains Retreat it had become unbearable and he thought the only way left for him was to disrobeVenAjahn Mun was unable to cure him and so had to let him go sending him to stay with VenAjahn SaoUnfortunately the following year VenAjahn Sao could no longer restrain him and the final result was that he did indeed disrobeAfter that he completely vanished as if into thin air and no one has heard news of him right up to the presentWitnessing all this really made my heart sink and I felt downhearted and saddenedI reflected that if such a senior longpracticed monk could still become mentally unstable what about meWhat could I do to avoid such unbalanceThese thoughts made me so apprehensive and fearful for my own wellbeing that I revealed my anxieties to VenAjahn MunHe told me Thats rightYou have to be careful of yourselfDont stay too far away from a competent and knowledgeable teacherWhen something comes up then hurry to confer and consult with himAfter the Rains Retreat had ended VenAjahn Mun and his party set out to walk down towards Sakhon NakornI had been thinking of my mother and so I returned home in order to assist herI think I was successful in this respect for I recommended that she observe the Eight Precepts and dress in whiteOn this occasion my aunt uncle and my elder brother were also all inspired with faith and determined to keep the Eight Precepts and wear whiteThis was especially so with my elder brother for he left his wife and a newly born son of only a few months to ordain as a monkI had them leave their village and follow the senior monks so that they could become better acquainted with Dhamma companions and receive training from many different meditation teachersI followed along later with my brother and uncle catching up with them at the village of Plah Lo Phannah Nikom District where VenAjahn Singh had spent the Rains RetreatHe led our group on to establish a temporary base near the village of Ahgaht AmnoyNot long after our arrival there VenAjahn Mun came to join us and he had me go on with him to set up a base near the village of Sahm PongLiving in close association with such senior monks was very good for meIt forces one to be mindful and alert at all timesOne day the novice who regularly attended on VenAjahn Mun was absent so I took over his dutiesOne of these included going to sleep on the veranda of VenAjahn Muns hutVenerable Ajahn Mun was usually awake and starting to meditate at three oclock every morningOn waking he would immediately reach for a box of matches to light a candle and they would make a slight rattling noiseI felt obliged to be up before him each morning so that I could be quick enough to go into his room and attend to his needsAfter sleeping there and doing this for many nights VenAjahn Mun obviously began to think that it was unusual because he asked me Venerable Thate dont you ever sleepI replied that I certainly didThe climate in Sahm Pong did not seem to agree with my health and constitutionAlthough I still had quite a good appetite I seemed to lack energy and my body continually ached and was stiff and sore all overMy meditation exertion however never falteredAfter the meal I would go into the jungle to find a secluded spot to develop calm in solitude throughout the dayDuring the night time I would walk in meditation and then go up to listen to VenAjahn Muns Dhamma talk that lasted from eight until ten oclockIf a large gathering of monks was present his Dhamma talk might not finish until midnight or two oclock in the morningVenAjahn Mun always made sure that he kept up this way of teaching and training and it continually inspired his circle of dedicated disciples to be zealous in their meditation practiceAfter Venerable Ajahn Mun left that place VenAjahn Sao took over for three yearsI learned later that many monks who stayed on there had diedOne was VenAjahn Bhoomee who died there only to recoverAt the approach of the Rains Retreat I made my way back to the district of Ahgaht Amnoy and stayed just north of the town in a cremation groundMeanwhile VenAjahn Singh was spending the Rains Retreat to the south of that same district townMy elder brother my uncle mother and aunt with a nun from Pon Sawang Village all stayed together for the Rains RetreatI was the sole monk although there was a novice by the name of Chuen who was from Tah BorMy uncle died nearing the start of the Retreat which left just six of usDuring this time there was an outbreak of smallpox among the townspeopleAlmost all of them scattered and fled into the surrounding fields and forests to escape the infectionEven the resident monks of the local monastery followed the same route as the lay people leaving virtually nobody behind who could offer alms for us to eatThis occurred because the residents of Ahgaht Amnoy had never experienced an epidemic of smallpox beforeIt was a town of more than a thousand households and only as few as five people had contracted smallpoxHowever those who became infected pretended to be healthy to escape detection and by the time they were found out the disease was already well advancedThe procedure for anyone found with symptoms was to move them away into the forestThey were quarantined there in a small bamboo hut built for them while food was sent out for them to eatIt was indeed a happy chance that VenAjahn Singh had some knowledge of forest herbsHe was thereby able to bring out some medicinal herbs to use in treating the disease and could tell the townspeople not to cast their sick away in the jungleThe result was that only a few people actually diedWhen news reached the authorities they came and inoculated everyoneWe were remarkably fortunate that the townspeople retained their deep respect for meditation monksThis meant that although the town had been completely abandoned they would still stealthily come back in at four or five oclock in the morning to prepare rice to put into the monks bowlsWhen we went on alms round they would come out to offer food and then rush off back into the forestI would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks and appreciation for the generosity of the townspeople of Ahgaht AmnoySuch merit and goodwill go beyond life itself for they form a true refuge for the suffering people of this world and the nextWhen we suffer if we cant rely on our virtue and past good deeds what can we depend uponThe people of Ahgaht Amnoy were more afraid of smallpox than the tigers of the surrounding jungleEven neighbours and relatives wouldnt speak to each otherI asked them when they would start talking together again and they told me it would still be quite some time after the end of the Rains Retreat in January or FebruaryDuring this Rains Retreat I often went to listen to VenAjahn Singhs Dhamma talksThis meant that I had to walk through Ahgaht Amnoy town and then on for a farther three kilometresI received a Dhamma talk from VenAjahn Singh that really shook me upPerhaps he was making a show of it to unsettle me or was it just that he didnt understand my true characterIts difficult to sayHe said that I had an obstinate and unyielding sort of character that I was stubborn and unwilling to accept anyone elseWhile he was saying this I focussed my mind to check out how it was within my heartI really did have the utmost respect and reverence for VenAjahn Singh and therefore was always ready to receive his teachings and instructionsYet why did he say such things about meStill what he said about me  my not easily acquiescing to others  was certainly trueI had always been that sort of person finding anything that seemed illogical or unreasonable difficult to acceptMy own opinions were subjected to the same careful checking and if they didnt measure up or lacked foundation I would be absolutely intractable in not accepting themThats how I wasI sat there listening to Venerable Ajahn Singhs Dhamma talk and also examining the state of my own mindIt caused an audacious boldness to spring up like pouring fuel on a fire to put it outI seemed to glide on the way back to the monastery feeling so light because my mind was fully engaged on that pointThat night I redoubled my efforts in meditation thinking thatHere I amIve been trying with my meditation practice as far as thisAnd yet why is it that I cant identify the defilements that must definitely be present right there in my heart while another person can turn around and know about them before meThis is really humiliatingVenAjahn Singh is a human being born of mother and father nourished by mothers milk and weaned through spoon feedingJust like me and yet he can perceive the defilements within me better than I can myselfHere today if I cant fathom out my own defilements then I should die in the attemptWhen I actually got down to my meditation practice nothing in particular seemed to happenI did however examine VenAjahn Singhs assessments and the way he had used them  as he was supposed to  in giving his Dhamma talk and concluded Even if Im not as he seems to think I am I can but continue to purify myself for in the end no one else can know better than I can myselfWith that my heart became tranquil and unperturbedMy accelerated exertions brought upset to the bodily humors making me feel that I should lie down and restHowever I couldnt really get to sleep for as I started to doze off I experienced what the country folk call a peeumEveryone knows about this phenomenon so there is no need to describe it fully hereThe important question remained whether or not the pee or spirit of the pee um actually existsThat night I was able to search out the truth in many waysAt first it felt as if some huge looming black form came forward and seated itself on my chest so that I couldnt breatheMy heart nearly gave out in the struggle to regain consciousnessSome people assert that the spirits of all the creatures that one killed reside in ones thumbsResting the hands on ones chest during sleep therefore allows the spirits to come out and suffocate oneSo I now removed my hands from my chest and stretched them down by my sidesNevertheless it came back and suffocated me again Hey whats happening hereCould it possibly be because Im sleeping on my back I turned over and lay on my side to see what would happen and the suffocating sensation came on againThis time the suffocating pressure was such that it felt as if I would smother and dieI therefore turned to focus on the condition of those about to dieThe first time I directed mindfulness so that it was keeping closely aware of the mind following it to know what happens at deathMindfulness stayed with the heart right up to the final moment when only the barest awareness remainedA feeling was present that to release that faint degree of awareness would be deathAt this point the question became whether it would be better for me to let go and allow death to take placeI felt that my heart was currently quite pure and that if I were to let go I wouldnt lose because of itAlthough there also remained a delicate feeling that expressed the thought that rather than letting go and die by remaining alive I could continue to be of benefit to other peopleIf it were all to finish here with my death then it could only be to my own purely personal advantageAlso people wouldnt know the full circumstances and causes of this deathIf thats the case its certainly better not to let myself die I therefore attempted to wiggle and move my hands and feet until I came aroundThe second time it happened I saw no bodily form but rather an enormous dark mass that loomed over meI knew now for certain that it wasnt a ghostThe cause seemed more connected with the elemental winds driving upwardsAfter trying to move my hands and feet it all cleared upWhen it happened for a third time it seemed less intense than beforeIt was more of a drowsy state and I just determined to get upFor all my readers in this situation notice your state when you regain consciousnessThere should be a heavyheaded dullness and lassitude presentAt this point if you dont take any medicine to balance these winds before going back to sleep it will happen againIn my own case Ive always found that the best and only cure is by smelling borneol crystalsAt this same period I tried to uncover and understand the condition that exists during the state of sleepAs a rule we are never aware of the actual moment of falling asleepIts only upon waking that we come to know that we fell asleepBefore we fall asleep there will be the state of tiredness weakness and drowsy dullness of body and mindThe chains of thinking processes become shorter and eventually all awareness of thoughtobjects is released and we quickly enter what they call sleepWhen we bring in mindfulness to focus on the current condition of that final moment before sleep we will find that there is only the barest awareness leftIts almost impossible to fix on it while no mentalobjects are left at allOnly the most delicate mindfulness remains present to follow and watch the current condition of the mind arising in that momentIt is like when the mind drops into bhavangaIf at this point we dont wish to allow sleep to take over an effort has to be made to look out for a single mental or emotional objectThis can then be subjected and held to and taken up for thoughtprocessingAs a result the mind will brighten up and be refreshed free from all fatigue and drowsinessIt will also have the beneficial effect equal to having slept for four or five hoursOn the other hand if we wish to sleep this is achieved by letting go of that final remaining trace of mindfulness and sleep will come with ease and comfortThis way is especially good because one only sleeps for a very short period so there is no wasting of timeIt wont last for more than five or ten minutesIf you have actually established and focussed mindfulness as I have been explaining you can rest assured that you wont be asleep for more than five minutesIf rather than going to sleep you just want to rest body and mind go and find a suitably quiet and peaceful place to rest inIt can either be somewhere completely secluded or among other peopleLie down stretch out relax and be comfortable without tensing any part of the bodyThen settle the mind on a single object in that condition of letting goLet it just remain alone in emptiness for a while and on getting up you will feel in all respects as if you had been sleeping for four or five hoursThis word sleepIn truth the mind doesnt sleepIt is rather that the body rests without having to make any movementsEven those who enter the high state of meditation called the attainment of cessation cant be said to have gone into a state of sleepThis is really the state where the meditator supervises the heart with mindfulness to fix it on one mental objectThat object steadily becomes ever more refined  as does mindfulness and the heart  until all feelings and thoughts completely cease due to the strength of the meditators skilled practiceMindfulness no longer has anything to do and so fades out completelyAlthough bodily breathing continues it has become so subtle and refined that one can hardly say whether it exists or notIn fact it does exist but it no longer appears to move through the noseOne can compare it to an external breeze that while present is not enough to manifest in the stirring and fluttering of leavesNo one could then assert that no windbreath exists for if there is no windbreath theres no air and then all livingbreathing beings in this world would be deadThe Lord Buddha called this entering the attainment of cessation for at this point the nervous system of the six sense doors will not receive any contactThis however is different from the state of sleepWhen asleep something may very well impinge on the senses so that one immediately wakes upThe attainment of cessation requires sufficient practice and preparation of heart so that it becomes competent and skilledAfter attaining this state many wondrous things can occurIts not possible to hurt the meditator who has entered into this state  even if someone set him on fire it would never touch himOn the other hand after entering Nibbana the body can indeed disintegrateThe meditator can withdraw from the attainment of cessation through the power of a previously made determinationWhen they reach the determined time the breath will gently start to become progressively coarser and coarser until all the bodily functions have reverted to their previously normal stateAttainment of cessation is not Nibbana but a state of absorptionThis is because absorption lacks the rightview wisdom that can investigate the root causes of the defilements such as those of the Sense Sphere and the Finematerial SphereThis is rather the domain of insightknowledge and rightknowledge and realization of the PathAll the absorptions are only instruments of encouragement and support that smooth the Way and enhance energyThus before the Lord Buddhas Final Passing Away he entered and progressed up through the various levels of absorptionHe then returned to the Fourth Absorption which forms the foundation for insight and entered Nibbana from thereThat was between the Sense Sphere and the Finematerial Sphere for that forms the base for the supramundane dhammaThe question might arise here SoWhy is this old monk going on about the attainment of cessation about Nibbana and states of absorptionHas he reached and realized these states or not The doubter might answer himself with Cant one say that this is really a matter of boasting about attaining to supramundane statesIn truth anyone who attains to the cessation of perception and feeling or to Path Fruit and Nibbana or to the absorption of the attainment of cessation does not make the assumption that I have reached entered or reside in such a stateThere is simply a proficiency with the necessary skillful means that leads to and connects with themJust when the meditator is about to enter such a state any remaining assumptions and suppositions about I will bring him up shortOtherwise the average sort of person everywhere intelligent and knowledgeable about the Teachings and the Discipline they could all go off together and attain to the Path and Fruit and Nibbana to the absorption of the attainment of cessationThe whole town the whole country would all be doing the sameAt the moment of realizing such states there is no hope of making up assumptions and formulations about themOnly after transcending those conditions can one recollect and systematically check back over their successive stages and developmentOnce having worked it out one will then be able to formulate and set out all aspects of these statesIts not always necessary for the person who explains about these things to have actually reached those levelsWhen the Teachings have been set down and their essential meaning established one has to explain about it to the best of ones own understandingSometimes this will be done correctly and sometimes it will be mistakenIf things had not been worked out in this way how could the Teachings of the Lord Buddha have endured and continued down to the present dayPeople listen yet even though they all may be listening to the same theme to the same points many will understand in quite different ways from different anglesFurthermore those meditators who have attained to exactly the same stage via an identical technique will still find that their individual skill and ingenuity are quite differentThis is why the Dhamma that one sees by and for oneself is so wondrous and amazing and why its so difficult to achieveSo why do you come along finding fault and only condemning meIts simply not fairPlease excuse this digression into the nether realmsNow let us return to my autobiographyWith the end of the Rains Retreat VenAjahn Singh led our party to the village of Sahm PongIt was the customary practice for us all to gather and pay our respects to the VenAjahn MunOn our way there I related to VenAjahn Singh all my recent experiences and thoughts about the peeum and sleepHe made no response at all remaining quite silentWhen we arrived however he proceeded to relate this matter to VenAjahn MunAt that moment I was sitting a little apart from them so I dont know what he said about my experiences  I couldnt hearI thought that probably it was all considered inconsequential and beside the point not being connected with the practice of the Noble PathHe therefore didnt pursue it any further as he might have done with other issuesAlmost one hundred monks and novices gathered to pay their respects to the Venerable Elders and Senior Ajahns and it was considered quite an event for those timesAfter it was over VenAjahn Mun had me with one other monk and a novice accompany him to the village of Kah Non DaengThis was where the VenAjahn Oon VenAjahn Goo and VenAjahn Fan had spent the Rains RetreatWe stayed there for three days and VenAjahn Mun related to the group about my practice with sleeping and notsleepingEveryone remained silent without commentThis was particularly so with VenAjahn Oon who previously had discussed this very topic with me when I was still unable to do itDuring the time that VenAjahn Mun resided at the forest monastery of Sahm Pong he would give daily Dhamma talksIf anyone was feeling despondent or irresolute or someone had fallen ill he directed his talk like thisSo then it isnt fear of death that you have but a desire to die many times As soon as VenAjahn Mun departed no one was left in the monastery to continue to give Dhamma talksThe morale and strength of heart of his disciples thereby drained away and no one was able to carry on living thereThe air at that monastery was particularly inhospitable and it was plagued with malarial feverEveryone with poor health or weak constitution would be struck down with feverThe whole resident community of monks eventually followed along behind usThey said that it was so bad that they couldnt continue to live there any longer and that the air of Sahm Pong monastery was so heavy and oppressive that it made them feel drowsy and lethargic all day longWhen this group of monks caught up with us again VenAjahn Mun made an observation about our ranging farther afield through secluded places so that we could spread the Dhamma even more widelyHe continued by pointing out that we had already traveled throughout much of the three or four provinces of this regionThese were Sakhon Nakorn Udornthani Nongkhai and LoeiHe queried us about which provinces would be best to head forThe majority were for going down towards Ubon ProvinceBut VenAjahn Mun himself was not really satisfied with this suggestion because suitable jungle mountains and caves were hard to find in that regionHowever if there was a consensus for going there then he wouldnt objectHaving come to this collective decision we made ready to set off traveling in small groupsIt was necessary for me to accompany my mother on her journey back home and so I was not able to go with VenAjahn MunIt was on this trip that VenAjahn Mun and his party encountered major upheavalsThere were both good and bad results from thisThe good side was an increase in the number of forest monasteries for Kammatthana forest monks which up to then had not existed at allThis was the occasion when forest monks for the first time permanently settled Ubon ProvinceFrom that time forward it has continued to spread out until today there are monasteries with Dhammayut monks in virtually every districtThe negative side was the deterioration in the quality of the monks practiceIn fact the decline this time was unprecedented until VenAjahn Mun was finally obliged to turn away from the community there and leave for Chiang Mai ProvinceI returned to spend the Rains Retreat for a second time at Nah Chang Nam VillageMeanwhile my elder brother went for the Rains to Nah Seedah Village with our fatherAfter the Retreat had ended I took my brother and we went to develop our meditation practice in the cave called Phra Nah Phak HorkSometime after this my brother went back down to find Venerable Ajahn Sao who had spent the Rains Retreat in Nakorn Panom ProvinceIt was after this Rains Retreat that my brother went forth as a monk at Wat Srii ThepI brought my father to come and stay with me in the Phra Nah Phak Hork CaveIt was the first time in the eleven years since his ordination into white robes that he had come to spend the Rains Retreat with meFurthermore I had never stayed for the Rains so close to my home village as I did that yearI consider that it was an especially fortunate year for it gave me the opportunity to support my father in the way of Dhamma practiceHe developed his meditation to the best of his ability and achieved excellent resultsSo much so that he was forced to exclaim that it was the first time since his birth that he had begun to experience deeply the flavor of DhammaHe could sit in meditation for as long as three or four hours at a timeI was delighted to have fulfilled my aspirations by being of aid and assistance to himYet when circumstances come together and the time is ripe untoward things can come upon usThat is to say my father fell illHis children and grandchildren saw only the hardship of his situation  when intense pain came during the night time who would look after himFor there were only the two of us father and son staying up in the caveSo the family came and carried him off down to the village so that they could attend to him thereHe refused however to go back to stay in the village monastery where he had been beforeInstead he had them set him up in his shack in the middle of the rice fieldsI often went down to encourage his constant attention towards DhammaThat was the year when something quite miraculous arose connected with my fatherThe rice seedlings in the villagers fields of that whole area were in very poor condition despite the moderately good rainfallAll the stems had turned a reddish color with the startling exception of those in the patch surrounding my fathers shackThese were a lush green and were so remarkable that the village people began to say that Father White Robe would not survive the yearAnd this indeed proved to be the caseOn that particular day I had gone to instruct my fatherI had reminded him of Dhamma and offered him strategies to use in his meditation and investigations until he seemed quite pleased and contentedHe still seemed quite strong and fit so at the approach of night I made my way back up to the Nah Phak Hork CaveHe passed away in the middle of that night possessed of mindfulness and a peaceful state of mind right up to the final breathAt dawn they came to get me and I arranged that his funeral and cremation rites were properly completed that same dayHe passed away in August at the age of seventyseven having been ordained a white robe devotee for eleven yearsI had been living by myself in the cave before my father came to join me and after his death I found myself alone againTo have the opportunity for this sort of solitude is rare and I determined in my heart to make the most of it In the same way as someone offers flowers in reverence to the Buddha  may my life may the flesh and blood of this body may the tasks and duties I undertake may they all become my offering and puuja to the Triple GemThus resolved I got down to intensifying my meditation practice with strength and determinationI established and set mindfulness within the heart not allowing any thoughts or imaginings to be directed outsideEverything was to remain wholly within an inner calm and stillness all day and all nightThe setting of mindfulness before sleep should be the same on awakeningSometimes it even happened that although I was asleep and aware of the fact I was unable to get upIt took some effort on my part to move the body and by that come back to waking consciousness againMy own understanding at that time was that the stilled onepointed heart didnt allow thoughts to careen away externally and so would definitely be able to transcend every bit of sufferingI thought that wisdoms only function was to purge the outwanderings of the heart and return it to a state of stillnessI therefore did not try to use wisdom in an examination of for example the body and sense impressions and so failed to come to an understanding about body and heartThese are still interrelated and interdependent and whenever any material or mental object comes into contact in whatever way there must inevitably be disturbanceThis causes the stilled and settled mind to be shaken up and agitated following the influence of the defilementsI applied myself to walking meditation until my feet were split and bloodyThen I came down with a fever that persisted throughout the Rains Retreat but I wasnt going to slacken off my meditation effortsI had once read accounts of some Eldermonks in times gone by who had walked in meditation until their feet had split and brokenHowever I had found this quite hard to believeI had supposed that the use here of this particular verb broken suggested that their feet had been pounding down and striking against some hard object which is what caused the abrasionsWalking with circumspection along a smooth and level meditation path  what was there to knock againstActually the same Pali word is used to render both broken and worn through or perforatedA monk is described as sick through several causes arising from kamma from season from bile disorders from clashing with external things and arising from striving in meditationIt was only then that I realized that my meditation exertions performed with a mind of such zealous energy were lacking in wisdomYet there I was living alone without a competent Dhamma companion to give me adviceTo be only bold and daring in ones striving while the heart lags behind in wisdom is not so goodThis was what caused my feverWhen the Rains Retreat was over I retraced my steps and went to find my brother and the VenAjahn Sao in Nakorn PanomI went because I had been separated from all my Dhamma companions and meditation teachers for more than two yearsEver since VenAjahn Sao and VenAjahn Mun and company had left Tah Bor District I had been the sole monk of our group to remain in the areaAt that time Luang Dtah Mun of Kor Village had come to spend the Rains Retreat at Nah Seedah the village where I was bornHe was the sort of character that liked to travel around disputing with less knowledgeable monksHe would challenge them with his supposed mastery of the religion and was ready to debate with anyone and beat them hollowEven all those forest meditation monks he said when they see me coming they duck awayJust look for yourself none of them can cope and they have all fled through their fear of meThe only one left now is this Mister Thate but in a few days hell be on his way tooAfter continually hearing things like this nobody could be bothered to speak to him anymoreIf they did try they couldnt get a word in edgeways for he always had to be the only one to get it rightIt was during that Rains Retreat that a dispute arose between him and the monks in the monastery of Glahng Yai VillageThese monks surreptitiously approached me with an invitation to come down from the cave to clear up and settle the conflictAs soon as I arrived he reversed his position and dropped the quarrelYet he repeated this kind of dispute and prevarication so often that all the local monks were totally disgusted with himPerhaps one can use the Southern Thai phrase he had gone crazy for fame and celebrityThey no longer bothered getting involved with him for any discussion was becoming clearly pointlessThen came the final day of the Rains Retreat the Pavarana DayThis is a traditional time for ceremonial offerings so they went and invited Luang Dtah Mun to come and join in the sermongivingLikewise they came and invited me although they didnt mention that to himBy the time I got to the village there wasnt a person to be seen for they were all already waiting for me at the village monasteryThis was unusual for on a normal day when they knew I was coming all the villagers tended to come out and wait lining both sides of the roadSome people would even call out and make quite a commotion so that I became reluctant to walk through Glahng Yai VillageWhen Luang Dtah Muns sermon was over I convened a meeting of all the gathered monks to discuss the points he had brought upHe had said that chanting our praise to the Buddha by starting with Araham is wrong that as we ourselves were not arahants we couldnt pay reverence to themHe gave his logic and reasons for this and said that one must begin the recitation with Namo and then continue with Namo Arahato Sammaa SambuddhassaI pointed out to him that this formula pays homage to Arahato in just the same way so perhaps Luang Dtah Mun  following his own logic  is already an arahant and enlightenedIt was at this point that Luang Dtah Mun exploded with anger and said If I wasnt an arahant I certainly wouldnt carry on being a monk like this and would have disrobed and gone home to sleep with my wife His language continued with more crudities and was offensive to everyone listeningI therefore came back and questioned what gauge he used in his assumptions about his own arahantshipHe answered that to look at the earth was the measuring standardI replied that anyone could perceive the earth even grazing cattle bent their heads and looked at the earth from morn till night  that must make them all arahantsThis Luang Dtah has boasted of having attained to supernormal states As soon as I had said this he was shocked and struck dumb unable to say anything at allI went on to refer to many issuesI announced for instance that if it was true that he had continually disputed with and challenged the local monks and the forest meditation monks he should speak out nowBut he absolutely refused to speakBy this time it was almost evening and the monks were preparing for the Pavarana CeremonyLuang Dtah Mun went into the Uposatha Hall to join in the ceremony but the monks refused to allow him to take part and he therefore had to return to Nah Seedah Village aloneOn that day most of the village had come to the monastery and nobody had been left behind to watch over the housesEven the district headman who had never previously set foot in a monastery came that dayAfter that he continued with regular attendance for the rest of his lifeI didnt immediately return to the cave that evening but went to sleep at the village monastery in Nah SeedahLuang Dtah Mun came to see me panting and gasping for breath almost unable to put words togetherHe was sulking and felt so slighted that he was going to flee that very nightHe said he was too ashamed and embarrassed to face people and had to leaveI requested him to think again and at least stay until the morning saying that I had no ill will towards him and had only been speaking according to truth and reasonBut he couldnt sleep all night and at the crack of dawn went off to see the District Chief Monk and requested permission to disrobeAlthough it had been only one day the news of what had happened had already spreadThe Chief Monk already knew about it and therefore told him that permission was not needed and for him just to go ahead and disrobeHe then went to the village of Kor to ask permission from his former Dhamma Studies teacher but he too knew about the situation and likewise told him that permission wasnt necessary and to go ahead and take the robes offFinally he did disrobe and quietly locked himself away in his former wifes bedroomIt was many days before he dared show his face againIve included these rather ancillary episodes in this autobiography to make it more comprehensiveAfter relating those more tangential stories I now want to get back to essential mattersLuang Dteea Tong In was originally from Korat Province of the village of Koke Jor HorHe moved to run a business in Tah Bor where he became a prosperous and prominent merchant well known throughout the areaHe and his wife were both pious Buddhists and the people of Tah Bor came to know about the keeping of the lay precepts through his influenceLuang Dteea Tong In donated an orchard to establish a monastery and named it Wat Ambavan  the Mango Grove Monastery  which incorporated both their names his wifes being Am and his InBoth eventually ordained as monk and whiterobed nun for four or five yearsLater he became ill with some disease that caused his body to swell up and this confined him to bedEach year Luang Dteea Tong Ins children would gather to make merit and offer gifts to enhance his recoveryIt so happened that they invited me to participate in the ceremony even though I had never set eyes on him beforeAt that time I had five Rains as a monk and he had seven making him senior to me by two yearsLuang Dteea Tong In told me that his condition made him feel as if he were already deadI replied when the persons dead thats goodHe went on to say that he was not concerned about anything that he had set his heart solely on the Four Paths Four Fruits and One NibbanaI told him that if such aspirations were still present he certainly couldnt yet be dead for deadmen didnt have any desiresAt this he was taken aback and responded by asking If Im not to have any aspirations what would you have me doI told him to meditate using Buddho as his only object of attentionBy this time I noticed that downstairs was already full of monks so I quickly completed my part of the ceremony and went down allowing the monks from other monasteries to carry on with the proceedingsEarly the following morning someone came to invite me to go and see Luang Dteea who had something that he wanted to tell meI said just to wait a few moments for as soon as I had eaten my meal I would be on my wayOn arriving there he swiftly related to me his wonderful experienceAjahn I really had a strange experience last nightThe roosters normally crow cockadoodledoo but last night it wasnt like that at allInstead they said yourmindisonepointed yourmindis onepointedsounds can manifest in such a wayAjahn he added before the gecko lizards always cried gecko gecko but last night they said yourealreadyold yourealreadyold I reassured him that that was correct and that he should now be determined to further develop his meditation by making the heart well established and steady throughout the day and nightHe should not allow any distractedness or carelessness to arise and he would then be ready and prepared for deathSome days later a lay man came to request that I immediately go and see Luang Dteea for he was about to disrobeI was shockedWhat on earth could this be aboutWhy ever would he want to disrobe just as he was becoming proficient in meditationI told the layman to ask him to wait and not to disrobe right away that as soon as my meal was finished I would go and see himHis hut had two sets of balustrades and so when I arrived there I opened the outer gate and entered while one of the boys helping to nurse him opened the next gate for meHis hearing my approach proved enough to dispel all his misgivings as if they were plucked awayLuang Dteea explained to me what had happenedHe said I related to my daughter all my various meditation experiences just as I had told them to youThen it hit me  Oh no I am guilty of the worst sort of offence by boasting of supernormal attainments to herI became so anxious and distressed by this that I thought I would have to disrobeBut as soon as I heard the sound of your arrival all that agitation evaporatedSo I wont be disrobing nowI explained to Luang Dteea that it certainly wasnt a case of claiming supernormal attainments for he had not acted from a desire for praise or gain or fameHe had spoken to exchange Dhamma understanding and therefore there was no offenceLater I started to think back to my meditation teachers and became concerned about my long  two year  absence from themSo I took my leave of him and went off to Nakorn Panom to visit VenAjahn SaoVenAjahn Sao generally did not give formal Dhamma sermons and when he did it would be more in the way of a Dhamma consultationMy going to stay with him that year meant that there would be another monk available to assist himVenAjahn Toom was already resident there so the two of us could contribute our energy in assisting VenAjahn Sao in teaching and instructing the lay communityIt was this year when I begged VenAjahn Sao to consent to have his photograph taken as a mementoAt first he did not want to but I pleaded and gave him reasons so that eventually he did acquiesceI pointed out how essential it would be for his disciples and those of future generations always to have an opportunity to focus on him and pay their respectsPreviously he would have had nothing to do with that sort of thing so this was indeed quite a unique happeningEven so I was concerned that he would change his mind and so I had to act quicklyI therefore crossed over the River Mekong into Laos to bring back a photographer to take the pictureI was delighted at having been able to photograph VenAjahn Sao and I gave copies to VenChao Khun Dhammachedi and Phra Khru SiilasambanThe photograph of VenAjahn Sao that I arranged at this time appears to have been the only one ever takenVenAjahn Mun was much the sameHe always refused to allow photographs to be taken of him for mementos or keepsakesI had frequently beseeched him to do so but he would reply that the money would be better spent buying some cakes for the dogsYet when I persisted with my pleas and pointed out my reasons he finally relentedThis was to be for the benefit of the following generations who would now have a picture of him to pay reverence and respect toAfter the Rains Retreat VenAjahn Sao went wandering ranging over on the other side of the River Mekong and going to stay in the Som Poi CaveThis was the cave where he and VenAjahn Mun had gone off together when they first went forth in search of solitudeIt was a large cavern with a whole series of chambers and many interconnecting passagesThere was also a special cabinet for holding the Pali Scriptures but it was bare of booksI followed him there but by the time I arrived he had already left going on to stay in another caveThis was the Tigers Cave which was quite far away along torturously winding paths through circuitous labyrinthine double ranges of mountainsA tigress had come and given birth to her cubs below the cave where VenAjahn Sao was livingThat is why they called it the Tigers CaveAbout forty metres above there was an elongated cavern extending right through the mountain to the far sideThe local villagers said that it needed the lighting of five successive dtaitorches before one emerged at the other endVenAjahn Sao lived in the mouth of this cave with a couple of monks and novicesThere was also an old man who had accompanied them so that he could attend on VenAjahn SaoThis old man used to light a fire at the entrance to the cave where he sleptIn the middle of one night he heard a loud wailing sound but couldnt see anything when he got up to lookThis puzzled him so at dawn he walked around to inspect the spot from where the sound had comeHe came across paw prints  a tiger had been standing thereIt had probably wanted to enter the cave but on seeing a person lying there had gone backBoth side walls of this cave were completely smooth making it look something like the interior of a railway carriageWater dripped down from stalactites into a pool deeper inside the cave and the monks could collect this for drinkingThere was no need to filter it because it didnt contain any living creaturesOne monk took me in to survey the inner reaches of the cave and our inspection lasted as long as it took half a wax candle to burn downIt was really pleasant without any feeling of oppressive stuffinessThe nearest village was about a kilometer awayI stayed there with the VenAjahn Sao for two nights before walking backI heard news that during World War II a company of Japanese soldiers had established a hidden camp inside these cavesWhen the Americans received intelligence reports about this they went in and bombed the cavesA bomb landed on the cave entrance sealing it off and causing the many Japanese inside to perishNo one has ever gone and excavated the siteHow tragic that is  we have so devalued and wasted human lifeAs the Rains Retreat was approaching VenAjahn Sao sent me to reside for the Rains at the village of Nah Sai while VenAjahn Poomee went to stay near Nah Kee Rin VillageThis was in response to invitations from the lay devotees in both these placesDuring this Rains Retreat my health was not at all good but I refused to become discouraged or lax in my meditation exertionsI was so resolved that I would willingly have sacrificed my life as an offering to the Triple GemIt made me reflect upon the threats and hazards that might lie ahead for both me and for Buddhism overallWould the order of monks I belong to be able to continue throughoutThere might be political disorder or perhaps enemy forces would invade the countryI might end up conscripted into the army and if not that then the nation could be enslaved under foreign dominationHow could I remain a monk under such circumstancesEven if I could carry on conditions wouldnt be conducive to the practice of Dhamma and the monks RuleSo what was I to doFurthermore although we now have many competent meditation teachers when old age sickness and death have taken their toll who then will be guide and leader to the group of monks on this path of Dhamma practiceThe radiant light of the Lord Buddhas Dhamma can only become increasingly dimSuch ponderings filled me with sadness and depression so that I felt sorry for both myself and the future state of BuddhismIt seemed as if such a state of affairs was just around the corner just a couple of days awayThe more I thought of it the more lonely and despondent I feltHaving arrived at this junction I turned my thoughts to my present situationThe current state of national and political affairs was still good and stableMeditation Masters were still present and I had already received much training and instruction from themHaving such an opportunity I felt I must hurry and accelerate my meditation practiceEventually I would be able to understand the Lord Buddhas teachings and come to selfrelianceWhatever the future might then bring whatever obstacles might arise either for me personally or for the general state of Buddhism I wouldnt lose outAs soon as I had come up with this skillful approach my heart became resolute and ardent in its meditation exertionDuring the Rains Retreat although I could not actually sit in meditation due to my illness and had to concentrate more on using walking meditation as the main posture it didnt affect my earnestnessAfter the Rains Retreat came news that VenAjahn Singhs group together with Venerable Maha Pin had returned from Ubon and had gone on to Khon KaenAs I wished to go and pay my respects to both of them I took leave of VenAjahn Sao and set outThis was the same year that the government issued a proclamation officially prohibiting spirit worship and other animist and occult beliefsIt urged people instead to take refuge in the Triple GemThe provincial authorities had accordingly mobilized VenAjahn Singh and his group of monks to help in taming the demons and spiritsWhen I arrived I found that I too became somewhat involved in thisI had organized the villagers of Phra Kreur Village in the relocating of their monastery from the bank of the village stream to a small rise in the fields on the edge of the Bahn Aew Mong LakeAfterwards VenAjahn Maha Pin came to join me in spending the Rains Retreat thereThe other senior monks resident there for the Rains included VenAjahn Poomee VenAjahn Gong Mah myself and VenAjahn Maha Pin as the headmonkThroughout this Rains Retreat I regularly helped VenAjahn Maha Pin by taking on some teaching responsibilities and sometimes receiving visitorsEvery Observance Day all the monks novices and visiting lay people would apply themselves to the development of their meditation as best they could in line with their individual abilitiesOne has to say that they did achieve very satisfactory resultsSome lay people meditated and came to see many different and diverse things so that they became absorbed in the meditation and forgot all about their homes and familiesAfter the Rains Retreat VenAjahn Poomee and his party of monks together with me took our leave of VenAjahn Maha PinWe went off in search of seclusion in the direction of Jote Nong Bua Bahn Village in the district of Kantaravichai of Mahasarakam ProvinceAt first we were invited to stay next to the school of Nong Waeng VillageWhile there we could give some Dhamma talks and instruction to the populace until the lay devotees from Jote Nong Bua Bahn Village came and requested us to return to their villageEventually the site at Nong Waeng became a permanent monasteryThis time when we returned to Jote Nong Bua Bahn Village we set ourselves up in some dense jungle by the side of the Dtork Paen LakeDuring this period numerous people came for training in meditation including many white robed nuns and lay men keeping Eight PreceptsSome of these people achieved quite astonishing results in their meditationThey would sit in meditation in the monastery and know that back in the village their children or grandchildren had been bickering and abusing each otherThose who could meditate would succeed marvellouslyThere were also some who couldnt meditate and only took the Precepts because that was what their friends had doneOne day one monk saw a vision when he was meditatingIt concerned a certain young nun who seemed to approach wishing to touch his feetI sent for the nun in question and instructed her about the need to perceive the harm in all sensuality because it was what would become a cause for sufferingI pointed out that physical form is the basis for innumerable attachmentsThis eventually enabled the nun to accept and understand the situation yet she certainly must have wondered how I knew about itAt the approach of the Rains Retreat VenAjahn Singh directed that I go and spend the Rains in Phon DistrictVenAjahn Poomee was to take over from where I was staying by Dtork Paen LakeVenerable Gate my elder brother came to stay with me during this Rains RetreatThe teaching and instruction of lay people continued as normal while my personal meditation practice and that of the resident monks and novices kept up a steady paceAn extraordinary incident did occur however concerning a woman sorceressShe had ten or more disciples and she traveled around making a living by attending to the sickI advised her to forsake her spiritworship and to come and firmly establish herself in the Triple GemHer belief in spirits I pointed out is based in wrong view and lacks virtue and merit whereas going for refuge to the Triple Gem really is something of merit and wholesomenessA person can then also be counted as a devotee with right view in the Buddhist TeachingsShe replied that what she had was good and that when some spirit mediumistically possessed her she could be directed to find buried treasure or enabled to leap into a clump of thorny bamboo without being gashedI responded that that might be all very well for believers but spirits had never taught their devotees to abandon evil and cultivate good or to keep the PreceptsThe only instructions they ever gave were for the person to make them an offering of the head of a pig or a chicken or duckAfter having prompted this animal sacrifice they didnt even eat itOne has to kill the animal oneself and offer it to the spirits and when they dont come and eat it then one has to eat it oneselfThe spirits will not have to accept the responsibility and the evil consequences of such killing it will all come back on the one who killsIn what way are these spirits supposed to help usAfter the Lord Buddha had finally passed away he wasnt reborn as a spiritHe bequeathed his Teachings that taught people to relinquish evil and cultivate what is good for that is both for their own benefit and for the benefit of othersThe Sangha conveys those Teachings to us all according to the path laid down by the BuddhaWe have thus been able to know what is wholesome or unwholesome what is virtuous or harmful right up to these present timesThe teaching of spirits is not like thatThe sorceress made up her mind and agreed to abandon her spirit worship and dedicate herself to the Triple GemThat night she put the teaching I had given her into practice and obtained marvellous resultsThat is before going to bed she chanted her devotions to the Triple Gem and then sat in meditationShe then saw two spiritchildren a girl and a boyThey were swinging on the hand rail of the rice mill pounder at the bottom of the stairs leading up to her houseThey didnt say or do anything at allThis vision was as vivid as if it were happening before her very eyes but they were actually closed in meditationShe then became convinced that the spirits could no longer come and take possession of her and that the protecting virtue and power of the Triple Gem was indeed greatHer husband was also a medicine man and was so devoted to his own powers that he refused to acknowledge and raise his hands in añjali to Buddhist monksBefore entering a monastery he would raise high his foot insteadBy strictly following his teachers rules he did indeed become invulnerableOne could slash or stab or hit him without being able to inflict any injury on himThat same night however he was unable to get to sleepWhenever he started to doze off he would be startled awake and become fearful as if something threatening was nearConsequently in the morning he asked his wife whether she had received anything special when she had gone to see the Ajahn because he hadnt been able to sleep all night longHis wife confirmed that the Ajahn had indeed given her something special and that she would take her husband to see him tooFinally both these old folk gave up their sorcery and took refuge in the Triple GemSuch were the events of that Rains RetreatThe forest meditation monks who were disciples of the VenAjahn Mun had never ventured near the province of Nakorn RajasimaThey had heard reports that the people there were fierce and cruel and had therefore always held back through concern that it wouldnt be safeThen Somdet Phra Maha Virawong when he still had the ecclesiastical rank of Phra Dhammapamok requested VenAjahn Singh and VenAjahn Maha Pin to go therePolice Major Luang Charn Nikom commander of the second company of the Korat town police force found inspiration and faith in the monksHe donated a plot of land on which to establish a forest monastery beside the rail head at KoratIn consequence VenAjahn Singh called his disciples living in Khon Kaen to come downI walked down with this group of monks and we stayed in Luang Charns orchardI organized the monks in building temporary shelters because VenAjahn Singh was away in Bangkok and hadnt yet returnedWhen he arrived I went and helped VenAjahn Maha Pin to construct a place for the monks to stay in a cremation groundThis was the second site and I ended up spending that years Rains Retreat thereThis becameMany senior monks were resident there for that Rains Retreat VenAjahn Fan VenAjahn Poomee VenAjahn Louei VenAjahn Gong Mah and myselfVenerable Ajahn Maha Pin was the head monkThroughout this Rains Retreat VenAjahn Fan and I were responsible for assisting VenAjahn Maha Pin in receiving visitors and giving sermons and instruction to the laityThis was the first time that any forest monasteries for meditation monks had been established in KoratIn fact two were set up in that one yearThis was also the year when historic changes took place in Thailand with the ending of the Absolute Monarchy and its replacement by democracyAfter the Rains Retreat I left with a party of monks who were out seeking secluded places in the direction of Gra Tok District and Ging ChehWe came back through Gra Tok District again and I supervised the building of a preliminary monastery at Dorn Dtee Klee with the help of the District Officer Khun AmnartBut before it could be completed it became necessary for me to return to spend the Rains Retreat in Tah Bor in Nongkhai ProvinceI afterwards heard that VenAjahn Singh had sent VenAjahn Lee to spend the Rains Retreat at Gra Tok District in place of meThe weather had been incredibly hot when I was organizing the building of shelters and meditation huts at Wat Pah Salawan in KoratI dont like hot weather but I had gritted my teeth and endured persevering in my meditation without let upI had trained my mindfulness so well that there was stillness and calm throughout day and nightSometimes it would converge and enter the bhavanga and totally disappear for many hoursThis however is certainly not the way that allows wisdom to be bornI had been trying to correct this tendency for a long time both by my own efforts and by asking others for helpIt had never previously succeeded but this time I found a way out for myselfThis was by being ready to apprehend the heart when it was right at the point of convergence into bhavangaAt that moment the condition of awareness becomes unmindful and there is the inclination towards indulgence in the pleasure of the tranquillity and happinessWhen mindfulness fades the mind will converge into bhavangaThe thing to do is to apprehend it right at the point when it is fading towards indulgence in that refined tranquillityCatch it there and swiftly set mindfulness on to a coarser object and focus and examine it more externallyThe problem will be immediately solved by not allowing the heart to converge towards that tranquillity and pleasurePutting it simply forestall the hearts convergence and totally focus ones examination on just one place the physical bodyI had been subject to this state of affairs since I first went off into the forests to meditate and it was only at this time that I could cure myselfIf one reckons it all up that is more than ten years of practice to come to such understandingEven so when sense objects impinged on my mind it could still become agitatedWhat about those people who have no experience of the hearts peace and happiness how will they make out when sense objects intrudeI had some doubts about the DhammaVinaya thinking thatThe purity of the Path Fruit and Nibbana  which form the culmination and ultimate goal of Buddhism  probably can no longer be attainedAll that is presumably left now is the level of attainment to cessation which is still a mundane state Nevertheless I still carried my meditation forward despite the mindbending hot weatherOne day my mind converged in an extraordinary way  it totally converged into bright radiance being there aloneThere was a clear and precise clarity of knowing illuminating brilliantly that one pointWhen I turned to examine or focus on any theme or aspect of Dhamma  all my wavering and doubts about DhammaVinaya seemed to disappearIt was as if I had already reached the ultimate point of all dhammasI didnt however concern myself with that issue but fully resolved to know how to cleanse the heart to complete purityHaving already progressed as far as this what was there to do now how was I to proceedWhen I had the opportunity to ask advice from VenAjahn Singh he recommended that I concentrate my contemplation much more on the unbeautiful loathsome aspects of the physical bodyHe told me to focus there until I could see its rotting away and decay and the final disintegration into the four elementsI broke in with my misgivings Surely when the mind has already let go of form and only name remains isnt going back to bodily form too coarse an object of contemplation Well at that point he really made a loud noise charging that already I was boasting of reaching supernormal attainmentsThe truth is that I had never  right from the very beginning of my meditation practice  been skilled in examining the loathsomeness of the bodyThats the truthIn my meditation practice I had always gone straight to focussing on the heartI had deduced that because the defilements arise in the heart if the heart doesnt venture outwards into disturbance but remains well set in a peaceful state all the things of the world are left in their purityMy interrupting by voicing these doubts brought forth a very loud reaction from VenAjahn Singh such a response showing the true expression of his characterSo what was I to doI stayed quiet and kept my selfsatisfied feelings to myself pondering the reasons why his views didnt fit in with my own opinionsIn this matter it became obvious that only VenAjahn Mun remained for me to consult and depend onAfter a while VenAjahn Singh softened his voice and he turned and asked me what I now thoughtI stood my ground and said that I still didnt agreeI insisted respectfully that he shouldnt take the idea that I had been bragging of supernormal attainments seriouslyI genuinely submitted my deep veneration for my teachers with a pure heartThe reason I had come forward to open up my true feeling and express such an opinion was because I was totally at a loss about the way to go onI explained that this was the first time that I had experienced such a condition of mind and that I didnt know if it were right or wrong or whether it needed rectification or how to proceed with itI said with due respect that I didnt harbor any resentment towards my teacher and that if he had any further suggestion as to skillful means with which to resolve my uncertainties then out of kindness and compassion to please throw it all at meVenAjahn Singh then soothed and comforted me advising me to proceed slowly but surely as that was the way if things were to developWell that day my heart certainly felt as if it had totally lost everything upon which it could dependIt was as if all ties and attachment to the group were goneOne of VenAjahn Singhs wishes had been that the group of monks not split upHe wanted us all to help each other in spreading Buddhism in that provinceHowever I had long desired  ever since I had joined up with the others while staying in Khon Kaen  to separate myself and go off to seek some solitudeThis was because I was well aware that my meditation efforts and the necessary skillful techniques were still weak and ineffectiveI had continually tried to detach myself but always in ways that would not give the impression to my teacher or companions that I didnt like themI had not however succeeded in thisIt was on this occasion after the Rains Retreat that I got my chanceIt was during this Rains Retreat that I readied myself to go and seek out VenAjahn Mun in Chiang Mai ProvinceThroughout this period I was developing my meditation with the same techniques and methods that I had used while staying at Wat Pah Salawan in KoratAlthough I firmly held VenAjahn Mun in mind as the inspiration for my meditation efforts my heart didnt seem as refined as it once had beenAfter the end of the Rains Retreat I mentioned to VenOrnsee my intention to go to Chiang Mai Province following VenAjahn MunI asked him if he would like to go with me and that if he would then we should lay down certain principlesThere should be no grumbling about hardships encountered along the way for example difficulties with the journey food or shelterIf either of us were eventually to fall ill then we would help each other to the best of our ability  together to the endIf one of us became homesick for family or friends  for example for our parents  there should be no abetting or helping the other to go backWe must be resolved to face death wherever and however it cameI told VenOrnsee that if he accepted and agreed to abide by these three principles then he could goHowever if he didnt feel able to follow them he certainly shouldnt even think of goingGoing against this would only be the cause for his later regret and that might cause me anguish tooHe said that he was happy with the arrangement and asked to go alongThere was also a white robed layman who asked to travel with usWe embarked from Vientiane by motorizedboat going upstream towards Nakorn Luang Phra BahngSometimes we spent the night in riverside villages and sometimes we camped out on river sand banksIt took three nights and four days to reach Nakorn Luang Phra BahngOn the trip up we admired the beautiful natural scenery on both banks of the Mekong RiverThat together with the refreshing coolness of the local climate aroused a sense of solitude and isolation filling us with great happinessThis was enhanced by so few fellow passengers  and they had all gone to sleepOnly the skipper and some of his deck hands were aboutThe landscape though empty of villages was encompassed with vast stretches of virgin jungle with rocky outcrops jutting out over the riverOccasionally animals such as monkeys and langurs would make spectacular leaps as they playfully chased each other through the treesWhenever the boat came closer to the bank they would all crowd together in troops and gaze down scrutinizing usNowadays such scenes are difficult to find but just recalling them still evokes in me a feeling of solitudeOn arrival at Nakorn Luang Phra Bahng we sought permission to stay at Wat Mai the newly built monastery close to the royal palace of the KingThis is where they enshrine the Phra Bahng  so greatly revered and cherished by the citizens of Nakorn Luang Phra BahngThis also happened to be the day when the Queen came to ceremonially dedicate the restored plinth of the Phra BahngWe therefore counted ourselves fortunate witnesses of these customs and meritmaking ceremonies of the citizens of Nakorn Luang Phra BahngHowever I wont go into further detail about them hereAfter the celebrations were over we took leave of the abbot and went across to stay at Wat Nong SagaawThis was situated on a high hill on the opposite bank of the Mekong River directly across from Nakorn Luang Phra BahngWe stayed there to await the boat that would take us upriver to the district of Chiang Saen in Chiang Rai Province of ThailandAfter waiting there for four nights we embarked again and the journey took another four nightsThe journey upriver to Chiang Saen was thus of equal length to the previous stretch up from VientianeWe rested in Chiang Saen for four or five nights before setting out overland for Chiang Rai and LampangIn Lampang we stayed in the garden for visitors to Phra Bart Dtark Phah by the entrance way leading up to the mountain shrineThe chee pakao accompanying us fell ill while we were thereHe had no fever but felt exhausted and weak and his urine was thick and reddish like water that has been used to rinse meatWe were far from any doctors and so had to resort to the Lord Buddhas medicine and depend on ourselvesSo we told him to drink his own urine even though it appeared so clearly reddishHe drank it straight after urination while it was still warmIt worked wondersWithin less than ten days he was back to normalAfter his recovery we set out walking for about the first thirty five kilometres and then continued sometimes on foot and sometimes catching a vehicle until we reached Lampoon and finally Chiang MaiWhen we arrived at Wat Chedi Luang in Chiang Mai we enquired about VenAjahn Mun but didnt find out muchWorse than that some of the monks there even referred to him with dismissive contemptMay I ask here for the indulgence of my readers for what I am about to relate concerns the risky encounters of a monks lifeYou may be able to find in it some sort of significanceIt makes me feel awkward and embarrassed but to leave it out would make this autobiography incompleteOnce when we were stopping over at Wat Chedi Luang in Chiang Mai I felt very fit and healthy  never before had my health been so goodI assume it was because of the cool climate which I have always found agreeableAnyway I went and had my photograph taken as a mementoTwo days later I went back to the shop myself to collect the printsJust as I was picking up the photographs to examine them a woman  Im not sure what sort of person she was  walked up behind meShe asked  in a very familiar manner  for one of the photos and her suggestive behavior seemed flirtatious and provocativeHearing her speak in such a way gave me a fright for I had only just arrived in town and didnt know anyoneAs soon as I had looked and taken in the situation I made a completely negative response and she hid her face turned away and fledHearing such remarks and seeing such behavior came as a very big Dhamma lessonIt made me reflect in a wider way on my previous experiences with women for I had already encountered similar behavior from women many timesYet I had never shown any interest because I was determined to live my life as a monk in the DhammaVinaya of the Lord Buddha  viewing women only as a danger to the brahmacariya holy lifeThis latest incident then brought up all the previous episodes that had arisen during my lifeFor instance there was once a woman whom I respected as a pious personShe wasnt so young anymore eitherI instructed her about meditation in the same way that I taught other peopleLater she came and told me that whenever she came near to me it felt as if her heart were relieved of its sadnessSometimes when a large group of monks came to see me she would still come and sit there with us for lengthy periodsAt that point I realized what she was up toI tried to teach her to remedy this by meditation but without successI then used more intimidating forceful language in an attempt to make her angry with me but also to no availOne day around dusk she dashed up into my hutShe wouldnt heed anything I said to forbid it and once up in my hut listlessly sat down and wouldnt speakI called for her relatives to come and pull her away and that made her furiousIn the morning while I was walking meditation she strode straight towards me and stopped not far awayShe started screaming at me saying Why do you teach meditation like thisYou teach people to go crazyIt doesnt matter who the meditation teacher is none of them will escape from lustThen she turned her back and went awayIt was a sight that made me feel very uneasyHer relatives took her to a hospital where the doctor examined her and could find nothing wrongFrom there she went to live in a center for whiterobed nuns with whom she already had close connectionsThree months went by and she returned to see meShe had by then realized for herself the mistake and error she had made and came to confess that she had misconstrued the situation having thought that I had some magnetic charm that had made her fall in love with meShe then asked for my forgiveness and that was the end of the first affairThe second incident occurred a long time laterI was giving guidance and teachings to lay Buddhists in various places in the rural areasIt all came from a sense of kindness and good intentions with sincere concern and I managed to ignore any hardship that this caused me personallyI would sometimes still be teaching late into the night  I could manage to go on until midnight or even as late as three in the morningI particularly felt sympathy for those young women present who were still without ties or obligationsI wanted them to see the stress involved with their gender to see that if they kept the precept of chastity purely after death they would be reborn in a higher realm or in a male body for that would allow them to ordain as a novice or monkThis rather naive and silly opinion of mine was a general one towards all women not for any individual in particularIt was this compassion that became my charismatic charm without me being aware of itTo explain I had become so popular and respected by so many people that a lot of them  women and men old and young  came and ordained with me in the forestSome of them obtained wonderful results in their meditation evident to themselves and the other members of the groupThose people who couldnt meditate however would instead find opportunity to increase their defilementsOne day I had to go off on some business and a nun came up and asked to accompany me on the journeyI wouldnt allow it and set outAfter this the nun fell into a state of stupefied confusion and wouldnt utter a wordWhenever anyone asked her something her only response would be a smileWhen I returned after many days away and saw her condition I tried using forceful language to make her indignant and thereby shake her out of her brooding fixation but she just kept on smilingI tried using some Buddhist techniques to help bring her out of it but it was no use so I had someone take her back to stay with her relativesAt that time it didnt strike me as very significant and I just thought that these incidents arose solely from sexual desireAfterwards I continued to train the local Buddhist laity in virtue and Dhamma with my efforts being founded on kindness and motivated by a sincere wish for their welfareI had to pass through many similar minor incidents that might have endangered my following of the brahmacariyaHowever I neither paid them much attention nor thought anything untoward could happen and I feel rather abashed about such incidents so Ill ask not to go on about themHowever I will say something about an incident that was the most horrifying close call in my life of brahmacariyaIt happened back when I was newly ordainedSometimes if I had spare time I would go with a boy usually in the evening to visit my lay supportersOn one such evening I went up into a house to call on one of the lay supportersShe came out and closed the door behind usThat gave me quite a frightAt that time she was alone with her young childAnyway we began conversing about various things in the way that people who have regard for each other doOne thing she always seemed to ask me about was whether I wished to disrobeBeing both a straightforward sort of person and naturally shy I would always just say No and quickly go on to talk about religious topicsThis time was no differentShe asked the usual question but then continued to talk about her pastShe spoke about the time before her marriage when a monk had fallen in love with her but they hadnt marriedThe marriage to her present husband was an arranged affair both families having thought it a good matchTheir living together wasnt much more than that and she didnt know how much longer they would last togetherI just sat listening assuming that she was confiding in me like this because we were close friends and that she had no ulterior motiveYet her behavior did seem strange in the way she was gradually drawing herself closer to me always edging in closer and closerLight from the dtaitorch began to flicker and was about to go out so I told her to trim it but she just smiled and did nothingI began to feel uneasy and felt the innerheat from some desire that was arising mixed with a strong fear of wrongdoing and of being discoveredEven to this day I find that moment difficult to explainIt was as if I was totally stupefiedAs far as I could make out she must have been feeling it as strongly if not more so  her facial expression seemed bereft of all mindfulnessShe couldnt stand it anymore and went out to get some water to drink and splash on her face and then came back into the roomThis was repeated many times and on reentering she would always sit herself even closer to meMeanwhile my disquiet grew and I felt completely befuddledThat made me irritable so I told her I was leaving to go back to the monasteryHowever it wasnt that easy for when I turned to get the boy who had accompanied me he was sound asleep slumped up against the wallShe pleaded with me to stay the night there in the house and return to the monastery in the morningThat increased my feeling of stupefaction together with an incredible attack of bashfulnessI told her to wake up the boy and when I asked her a second time she compliedWhen the boy was awake we both climbed down the house stairsAs I left I still felt befuddled and extremely ashamed of myselfI was also afraid that my monastic brothers and teachers would get to know what had happenedWe arrived back at the monastery about midnight but I lay sleepless right through till dawn reflecting on what had happened and whyI had somehow escaped those perilous circumstances in a miraculous wayThat young woman stimulated all the remembered incidents from the past that Ive been relating here a stranger who asked for my photograph that dayShe certainly gave me the equivalent of a powerful sermon to which to listenAh so these are the wiles and ways of women still lost in intoxication with the worldly realm of sensual desire Therefore may I here again offer her my great thanks for her lessonThe incident involving her was quite straightforward but the latter two affairs happened because I overlooked the nature of worldly ways or some might say it was because of my naive foolishnessYet I am willing to be an innocent simpleton about that sort of thing for that is why I was willing to forfeit such a life and go forth as a monkI went forth in the radical way of one truly being willing to offer his life in homage to the Buddhas TeachingsIf however I hadnt been such a simpleton and if my merit and good kamma hadnt been so supportive and if I had been reluctant to offer my life for Buddhism  I would probably have long ago become crows baitRecollecting my escapes from such frightening situations caused an immense feeling of exhilaration and satisfaction to arise in my heart so much so that my body was quivering for days afterwardsLater whenever I was to mention these episodes those same feelings would arise in me and such a reaction persisted for almost twenty yearsI find it very embarrassing and I dont want bluntly to declare that women pose a threat to the brahmacariya  after all my mother was a woman and the Buddhist Teachings under whose cool shade I take shelter is still primarily dependent on the dedicated support of womenIn the Buddhas time the lay woman the Lady Visakha was widely renowned as one of the preeminent devotees of the Buddhas TeachingNevertheless when the Buddha cautioned his close disciples to be circumspect about their life of brahmacariya for the most part he would warn them to remain vigilant concerning the opposite sexTake for example one of the final sayings of the Lord BuddhaHe was replying to Venerable Anandas questions about how a monk should conduct himself with a woman after the Lord Buddha had finally passed away into Nibbana Not to see or hear them is good and safe while if there is contact then dont become too close or chat with them while if it becomes necessary to speak with them make sure that you take care and restrain your mindFor women who would train their hearts to a purity that transcends all suffering they should contemplate the dangers of the opposite sex the male which forms their object of desireBy seeing the fault and harm in this they will also come to dispassionAs with the Elder Upalavanna Bhikkhunii who once declared something to the effect that I have seen the harm of all sensual desiresWhenever sensual desire besets someones heart it obscures and blinds them  a father then becomes capable even of sleeping with his own daughterTo summarize acute danger to the brahmacariya holy life comes most seriously from worldly sensualityHowever this cant exclusively be about one gender because all humans and animals born into this realm of sensuality come to birth through both sexes through father and motherWhatever we do therefore there can be no escape from contact with the opposite sexAny person wishing to go beyond all sensuality must first pick out that very sensuality as something fundamental and as an object of deliberationThis applies especially to the opposite sex who make up the material form on which one hangs the signs of sexual desireLust and sexual desire are mental qualities that exist in everyones heart and when they arise one feels the need to fix on a physical form as a target and object for grasping hold ofThe physical form fixed upon is inclined in every way to be able to respond to that lustful desire and passionIt can do this for example through bodily form sexual characteristics complexion shape and appearance deportment decorum and speechThe opposite sex or any object stimulating sensual pleasure can thus be turned into something that promotes the conditions necessary for a person to discern the harm of all sensualityWe will then see them as great facilitators in liberating ourselves from the sensual realmIf that wasnt the case all the Dhammavinaya the Lord Buddhas ordinances and the way of practice of forest meditation monks  including all the various ways and faculties of wisdom  would be totally worthless and of no benefitAll people  whether they are ordained or lay  having been born into this sensual realm are obliged to defy this sort of threat and dangerEven if they dont possess the latest armaments there is always the weapon that their parents fashioned for them their basic constitution so that they can handle itThe person who wont stand up and fight has totally wasted the life to which he was bornHowever the strategy and tactics employed by the recluse and the lay person will differ in that the recluse battles for victory while the lay person battles against defeatWhile the person who does not try at all is already rotting away while still aliveI have been discussing all this for the benefit of those who are ordained and who must safeguard their brahmacariya holy lifeIt is this that forms the basis for the future continuity of the Lord Buddhas TeachingWhile women may be the greatest danger to the monks holy life they are also equally of the greatest benefit and good to the TeachingWomen furnished the form from which the Lord Buddha and all the Noble Disciples came to be born and they also offered the object of contemplation through which was born their Dhamma realizationWhen I think about those monks who transgress the Discipline in the most offensive of ways by involving themselves in things that are regarded as worldly sensuality namely sexual desire and moneyWhat can one say about such monks who are supposed to have already forsaken all that when they went forth to ordainEven a lay person still completely immersed in the five strands of worldly pleasure would be considered base and sordid if they exhibited such behavior among morally principled peopleI have already led my readers away cutting through a forest of potent dangers until they must be tired outSo now Ill return to the account of my search for VenAjahn MunWe stayed at Wat Chedi Luang in Chiang Mai town for two or three nights and then took leave of the abbot to continue our journey in search of VenAjahn MunAfter fruitless enquiries at the various small monasteries where he had once stayed we decided to make absolutely sure and go farther afield beyond ThailandWe crossed into Burma going via the towns of Muang Hahng Muang Dtuan Mork Mai and Rahng Kruer heading on up to the Phah Hang Hoong Cliffs that are close to Muang Pan on the River SalwinBut our hopes were disappointed as there wasnt the slightest sign that he had been that wayThe cold weather then proved too much for us and after spending two nights with the Palong hill tribes people we came down off the mountainsSuch cold  right in the middle of the March and April Hot SeasonWe were forced to huddle for warmth around a fire throughout the day and nightWhat would it have been like in the actual Cold Season or during a particularly cold yearVenAjahn Mun disappeared into the jungle because of what occurred when the VenChao Khun Phra Upaligunuupamahjahn felt that he didnt have much longer to liveVenChao Khun Phra Upali saw there was a need for a suitable senior monk to take charge of Wat Chedi Luang and because of his already great respect for VenAjahn Mun he was inclined to hand over responsibility for the administration of that monastery to himVenAjahn Mun preferred peace and quietHe did not wish to get involved in such matters but in order to respond to VenChao Khun Phra Upalis purpose he did go and reside there for one Rains RetreatAfter the Retreat he took his leave and disappeared into the jungleVenChao Khun Phra Upali had already passed away in Bangkok during that same Rains RetreatFor the next two years there had been no news of VenAjahn MunThat left the two of us VenOrnsee and myself to seek him out and our wanderings through the forests and mountains were all aimed at thisAs long as we stayed within Thailand we felt at home with the various hardships we always had to put up but as soon as we crossed over the frontier our frustrations and hardships increased a thousandfoldFor example there were different cultural traditions and customs and the language barrierAlthough we were all supposed to be Buddhist the customs were sometimes very different from what we were familiar with and sometimes they didnt seem even in line with the DhammaVinaya that the Lord Buddha had set downIt was very trying and bothersome for us as we were their visitors and guestsThis was especially so when we were with the various hill tribe villages that were particularly poor and undevelopedAnd the paths and trailsIn some places we were forced to follow the streams up into mountain valleys otherwise there were walks along the edge of precipicesOn the descent from one such climb I slipped on some rocks and fell badly gashing my kneesI forced myself to hobble on until we reached the village of Pong Pah Khaem on the ThaiBurmese BorderWe then went to stay in the Plong Cave where I could nurse my wounds and recuperate for ten daysWhile traveling in Burma we had seen many admirable featuresThe people there liked peace and quiet and they were generous and openheartedThere were no thieves or crooks and no domestic animals  no poultry or pigs  because they wouldnt kill animalsTheir diet was basically vegetables seasoned with chili salt beans and sesameOnce in a long while some dried fish would be brought up from Cambodia for them to sampleI later heard that after the Second World War Field Marshall Por compelled these people to raise domestic animals that caused them much distressI really appreciated their sincere good will and religious faith and their peaceful and orderly way of lifeWe would hear no disturbing noise at night even though village houses might adjoin the monasterys fenceIt was just as if there was no village there at allWhen the wound in my knee had healed well enough for me to walk the two of us set out across the mountains of the Morn Ahng Kahng rangeWe trekked through them all day without reaching the hill tribe village for this mountain was indeed extremely highIt had taken us until midday to reach the summit and then the descent proved so steep that darkness overtook us as we reached the mountains footWe carried on walking and about half way along the trail we heard the roar of a tiger not far away from usI was almost frightened to death by the idea of a tiger being so close but I didnt let on to my friend  he had been born and raised in an agriculturally developed area and so didnt know the sound of a tigerIf I had told him I knew I would instantly draw him into my state of trepidationGoing beyond the range of the tigers roar we lost the trail and so were forced to find a place to spend the night in the jungleI was so afraid of the tiger that I lay sleepless throughout the nightThere was a heavy dew and it was extremely cold yet my friend lay there snoring loudly all nightWhile I was terrified with the thought that the tiger might hear him and we would be killed  he blissfully slept through it allAt the crack of dawn we packed our things still soaking wet from the dew and set off againOn the way I told him that the noise he had heard the previous evening that sounded like the yelping of a dying dog was in fact a tigerIt was the roar a tiger makes just after having consumed a full meal expressing its high spiritsWe carried on walking and by around eight oclock in the morning we had reached a village where we could go on alms roundAfter eating our meal we set off again and reached the Dtap Dtow Cave where we stayed for a time to recover our strengthFeeling refreshed we then resumed our journey heading in the direction of Phrao DistrictNext something unbelievable occurred  yet it happenedOn that day after having our meal we were leaving the Dtap Dtow Cave when a barkingdeer darted out from beside two houses and across our pathThese houses had been built in the middle of an open grassy field close to the gate of the cavemonasteryThe barking deer then strolled leisurely almost lazily in front of us but we didnt take any notice of it thinking that this was its territory and we were just passing throughWe continued through the rest of the village and were cutting across the fields to join the start of the main trail when more barkingdeer appearedA pair male and female that were among the village herd of water buffalo spotted us coming along and darted out in front of us again and again we paid them no noticeHowever not long after that we found that although we had started along the right footpath we had somehow wandered away from itHow was it possible that we could have mistaken our way and ended up on an old neglected trail leading into a side valleyFor about ten hours we were forced to pick our way along the rocky stream bed for the steep mountain slopes rising on both sides forced the path down off the bankAs the climb progressed it became so narrow and the jungle so thick that no sunlight could penetrateWe didnt stop for rests not even to have a drink of waterWhen exhaustion began to set in I proposed to my companion that we retrace our steps and pick up the main path but he would not agreeI thought that the head of the stream we were following must be the main drainage source for the surrounding more lightly forested ridges  just like the streams back in my home region of the NortheastIt certainly did not turn out like that for when we finally reached the source we found a sheer cliff face confronted usThere were tracks of large deer and the wallowing holes of wild boarAs there was no longer any path forward we had to turn back and almost straightaway I misstepped on a rock and fell so that it deeply gashed the sole of my footNight was approaching so I used my shouldercloth to bind the wound and we decided to scale the steep side slopes that were mostly of screeWell it was quite a scramble for wherever one placed a foot it would slip and slideWe reached the summit around seven oclock in the evening and saw a rather indistinct footpath winding its way along the summit ridge lineWe were glad of the path because it probably meant we were near a villageSuddenly nearby peeppeep  a stag startled by the light of our candle lanterns had cried out and stamped the ground in alarmThis startled us so much that my heart seemed to miss beatsOn recovering our composure we realized that  AhIts only the sound of a deerLooking in the direction of the noise we could make out its white chest and knew then that it was just a stagAfterwards it let out another cry and jumped down from the ridge of the mountain and disappearedAfter seeing the flattened sleeping place of this wild deer so close to the path it became obvious that we were still a long way from human habitationAs it was already late we decided to spend the night there and so we each arranged a place to our liking in the thick grassy undergrowthYet all night long we were unable to get any sleepThe wind was too strong to hang the mosquito nets from our krots while on the ground it wasnt just termites attacking us for swarms of ants also came attracted by the blood from my wound and the sweat of our bodiesWe had to wrap cloths around our eyes to prevent the ants from getting in to drink from our tearsAs soon as it was light we rose and looked back down on the way we had comeFar below we could see the paddy fields as tiny squaresWe oriented ourselves and estimated that if we continued straight onwards along the present path we would probably meet up again with the trail that we had lostSo we cut across jungle and more open forest following our line of marchHow my foot was hurtingPushing on across the more open rocky pebbly ground was almost unbearable but I gritted my teeth for we had to press on as we were still a long way from any villageAfter quite some time we did indeed strike the hoped for trailWalking along the trail we eventually reached a village not much before nine oclock in the morningWe arrived with feelings of some relief and could slip our requisites from our shoulders by the side of a landing stage of a stream beside the housesA moment or two later someone came out to see us and we related the whole course of eventsWe thought to ask straight out for something to eat but were afraid this was something blameworthySo instead we tried to explain indirectly by mentioning that we had not yet eaten anything and that as I had an injured foot going on an alms round wouldnt be possibleIf we were to wait there would we be able to obtain anything to eatShe said we would and as she went back into the house we assumed that she would bring some food for us to eatWe both therefore went to bathe ourselves in the streamWhen I had finished washing the pain in my foot grew so excruciating that I couldnt walk on it at allDuring the previous night it hadnt been at all painful and even that mornings walk had been bearable so why should it now suddenly hurt so much that I couldnt even stand upVenerable Ornsee my companion through all this suffering felt faint and dizzy and couldnt stand up himselfAll we could do was to wait for her to bring us something to eat  but there was no sign of thatHunger and fatigue now surged in on usFortunately I had some herbal medicine for dizziness with me in my shoulder bag and so was able to attend to Venerable Ornsee but it was well after ten oclock in the morning before he could get upI suggested then that he go and ask what was happeningHe only managed to find two young boys minding the house and discovered that all the adults had gone to work in the jungleThis village had only two houses and everyone made their living by cutting the young banana leaves and drying and smoothing them for sale as cheroot or cigarette papersWhen Venerable Ornsee informed me of the situation I had him go and bring the two boys to see me and I asked them if they would exchange cooked rice for some matches  we had no other possessionsEach of us had a couple of boxes of matches and in exchange we got two baskets of sticky rice two dishes of chili and fermented soya bean paste with two small bunches of steamed vegetablesWe had our meal and how good it tastedAfter the meal was over the pain in my foot grew much worse so much so that my whole leg was inflamed and throbbingI endured this until just after three oclock in the afternoon when we moved onI hobbled along for about three kilometres before we reached another village where we stayed for eleven nightsWe rested and recovered our strength and I was able to attend to my woundFrom there we climbed over a Karen settled mountain coming down into the district of Phrao in Chiang Mai at Manora VillageThat evening we received some good newsSomeone came and told us that VenAjahn Mun was staying in the Pah Miang of Maer Pung and that VenAjahn Sahn was at the entrance to the trail going up to Khork Kham CaveWe were delighted and thought that this time our aspirations would be fulfilledAfter the meal we gathered our things and set out arriving just as night was falling at the Khork Kham Cave where VenAjahn Sahn was stayingWe spent the night with him discussing Dhamma and talking about this and that as was suitableThe next morning after the meal he put us on the right path and Venerable Ornsee and I took our leave and set offWe arrived at VenAjahn Muns place at about four oclock in the afternoonHe was engaged in walking meditation but when he saw us coming he immediately recognized us and called out our namesHe halted his walking meditation and went over to sit in his hermitageWe began to slip our things down from our shoulders and place them on the ground outside but he wouldnt have it and insisted that we put them on the veranda of his hermitageDoing so we entered and bowed our respects to himVenAjahn Mun opened by enquiring after our wellbeingI then respectfully explained to him the reason its become necessary for me to seek the Venerable Ajahn out this time is that I need your help in sorting out my meditationI have already learned a lot from others in our group but Im convinced that the Venerable Ajahn is the only one who can resolve it all for meI then proceeded to detail my meditation practice and experiences to him starting from my very first endeavors right up to those experiences that I had related to VenAjahn Singh in KoratThis led him to describe how he had previously instructed his disciples in effect suggesting how I should assess the group of disciples whom he had taughtAny monk who follows my way of practice until he becomes skilled and firmly established in it should progress well and will at least hold his own and succeedIf a monk doesnt proceed along this way he wont last long and will eventually regress or disrobeEven for myself should I be burdened with many responsibilities and involvements with the group of monks then my meditation development cant be consistently developedMy focussed investigation into the body wouldnt be refined nor would the heart become clear and lucidIn your investigating never allow the mind to desert the body for anywhere elseWhether or not it appears to be clearing and becoming more lucid dont retreat from fixing your investigation thereYou can examine the bodys loathsomeness or view it as made up from elements or examine it to see it as aggregates or by way of the Three CharacteristicsAny of these methods can be usedBut you really must fix your investigations within these including all the four bodily posturesYet this isnt to say that after looking you can stop with that  regardless of whether it is seen clearly or not just continue with the investigationWhen any of these aspects are fully and lucidly seen in ones heart all other exterior things will clearly manifest there tooHe also told me not to allow the mind to enter the bhavangaAs soon as VenAjahn Mun had finished speaking I made a resolution in my heart From that moment I would start again and learn a new way of practiceRight or wrong I would follow his instructions and let him be the only one to guide me and make the final decisionsOne can say that from that day forward my mindfulness was solely directed towards investigating the bodyThroughout the day and night I was now viewing it as loathsome as made up of the four elements and as a mass of sufferingI intensified my practice without let up or negligence for six months   without wearying of itAs a consequence my heart received calmness and peace and a new understanding aroseAll things of this world are merely the four elementsBut we make assumptions about them and then go and fall into delusion about our own suppositionsThat is why there has to be so much trouble and distress with all these thingsThis new understanding gave great solidity and firmness to my heart which was very different from how it had beenI became confident that I was now going along the right path but did not inform VenAjahn Mun about this because the firm belief in my new understanding convinced me that I could do that any timeThe weather was so extremely cold that year that we had to sleep by the side of a fireAlthough I got a splinter of wood in my hand no blood flowed because it was so coldAfter the Rains Retreat VenAjahn Mun went down to stay near the village of Toong MakhaoThe two of us Venerable Ornsee and myself stayed on up there but we swapped placesI went down to stay where VenAjahn Mun and VenOrnsee had spent the Retreat while VenOrnsee came up to my place on the mountainIn the middle of one night a tiger approached and sat watching over VenOrnsee who was lying asleep beside the fireWhen the fire died down and he began to feel cold he stood up to stoke it up again at which point the tiger growled and sprang off into the jungleBeing born among the fields he wasnt familiar with the sounds of the jungle tiger and I didnt enlighten him being concerned that he would become frightenedSometime later VenAjahn Mun sent a letter telling us to come down to see himWe went to help him with some task for ten days and  what happenedAhAll my meditation schemes that had seemed so lucid and obvious before were no longer so clearI was now seeing people as the people that arise from conventional suppositionsWhen the task was completed VenAjahn Waen and I requested permission from VenAjahn Mun to go off wandering in search of solitude againVenerable Ornsee stayed behind to attend on VenAjahn MunWe set off on our journey and after about twelve kilometres turned off into the forest for some seclusionDuring the night I heard the roar of a tiger from a nearby mountain top and this helped to concentrate my mind in seclusionI called up the virtues and qualities of the Lord Buddha as my meditation object and from this arose knowledge of a strange and marvellous nature in different ways never imagined or experienced beforeWe stayed there for two nights before continuing on to meet with VenAjahn Sahn in the district of PhraoI didnt stay long with him however because of my yearning for solitudeSo taking leave of him I climbed up the mountain to where the Mooser hill tribes lived and continued with my meditation exertions there for nine daysI thought that by going to live with the Mooser and not having a language in common I would be able totally to commit myself to meditation practiceI knew quite well that they were generoushearted so that they would certainly give me enough food to eatI exerted myself in meditation to the extreme limit of my ability until a misguided and distorted view aroseThere is no Lord Buddha no SanghaThere is only the DhammaThis is because the Lord Buddha or in other words the Prince Siddhatthakumaara only became the Lord Buddha through knowing the DhammaEven the Lord Buddha himself was only ruupadhamma and naamadhammaThe Sangha is the same for they all whether enlightened noble disciples or unenlightened ordinary disciples are sustained by DhammaTheir physical form is but ruupadhamma and naamadhammaThis was my rock certain opinionI was absolutely convinced it was trueBut I did review what the authorized version had to say about it and found well that they didnt agree with my opinionsI was unable to settle these two conflicting views and they continually disputed with each other over many daysIt was certainly a good thing that I was unwilling to throw out the conventional wisdom for if I had the results would have created quite a song and danceAs it happened VenAjahn Sahn sent someone to invite me to come down to receive some offerings and gifts from the lay peopleI was in two minds whether or not I should goHowever I then remembered the state of my lower robeI had already been using it for three years and it might not last through the next Rains Retreat so I decided to goAccepting his invitation I went to renew my robes so that my requisites would be complete and I could then returnOn going down they offered me all the things I required and that distorted view seemed completely to disappear of itselfWhen I had finished cutting sewing and dyeing the robe I again went up the mountainBut this time I didnt return to my original spot but went on to the Mooser hill tribe village of Poo PhayahOn my arrival they were more than glad to see me and kindly came together to make a hut for my stayFirst though  Ah my hopes that the language barrier would probably stop anyone coming to bother me were soon dashedWhen I first arrived I stayed in one of their abandoned housesThese people had never seen forest tudong monks before and the whole village turned out from the youngest to the oldest to stare at meThey gawked from far and near some coming so close as almost to tread on my toesAs one onlooker went another one came to replace him and it went on from midday until around four in the afternoonThey stood there gawking and then sat there gawking then lay down gawking at meThey were dirty and smelledIt was all too much for me and made me feel quite dizzyThe villagers made me a path for walking meditationYet I only had to go out on it for them all to throng after me so that I ended with a long line behind me strung out the length of the pathThis was more than I could handle so I went inside and sat againMeanwhile they continued parading in groups along the path thinking it all great funAfterwards I was able to come to an understanding with their ChiefWe agreed that trailing behind me wasnt proper and that if they wanted to make merit then whenever they saw me out doing walking meditation they should peuThat would certainly be meritoriousFrom then on whenever they saw me going out to do walking meditation they would all approach and standing together in a line peuAnyone missing would be called out to come and join the groupOn reflection one couldnt help feeling sympathetic towards these forest people who though living far from material civilization were so honest and uprightIn those days no one had come up to assist and teach them for decades and  unless some serious crime had been committed  no government officials would ever show their faces up thereThey were selfgoverning and strictly trusted and relied on their ChiefThose bad characters who were troublemakers and stubbornly ignored their Chiefs admonition were expelled from the village by the ChiefIf the perpetrator refused to go the villagers would all move away from himYou can be assured that nothing like stealing and thievery existedWhenever I was walking through these mountain ranges and saw one or two isolated houses I could immediately surmise that I wouldnt be able to stay with so few peopleThe hill tribes in this region lacked sufficient rice after two successively bad harvestsThere were twelve houses in the village where I was staying but only three of them had enough rice to eatYet they all had such a lot of faithWhen I came on alms round only three people would come out to put food into my bowl but each one gave so much that it was sufficient for me to eatSometime later the Chief came to see me and explained that everyone had faith and wished to offer food on my alms round but they were embarrassed because they had no rice to giveThey had to eat boiled yams and tubers instead of riceI felt sorry for them and since I rather liked steamed yams myself I told him soI said that that was why I was able to come up to live with them  if I hadnt liked them I wouldnt have comeOnce they all knew about this they dug up wild yams to steam and offer into my bowl which was consequently filled everydayThey also were delighted with the idea laughing and smiling their faces lit up in an endearing wayThey did though remain apprehensive that I wouldnt be able to eat their yams and so they followed me back to my hut to see for themselvesHaving received their gifts I was determined to show my appreciation by letting them see me eat themThat year the rice crop had been sown but poor rainfall had caused the seedlings to shrivel and turn a pale yellowThe villagers built my hut ten days before the beginning of the Rains Retreat and when it was completed astonishingly the rain started to pour downThey were all overjoyed absolutely delighted to think that it was the result of the merit they had made in building a monastery for me to stay inThe rice was transformed by the rain into a lush green splendid cropTheir rice fields that year produced so much that they couldnt use it all and some of them were even able to sell the surplusApparently no monks had previously spent the Rains Retreat with the Mooser hill tribes people so that I may possibly have been the first monk in Thailand to have done soWhen they had completed the construction of my hut I recalled that in the Life of the Buddha Venerable Phra Siddhattha had been thirty five years old when his strivings had come to fruition in his AwakeningThat year I too would be thirty five years oldI therefore resolved that I would offer my strivings in meditation during that year to pay homage to the Enlightenment of the Lord BuddhaI will wholeheartedly accept whatever way my meditation practice leads even if my life should be lost because of itMay this life of mine be offered as one would offer a lotus flower in worship of himHaving made this resolution I applied myself to my meditation throughout the Rains RetreatYet it didnt seem to be progressing and remained firmly as it was beforeTo bring it up to the level of my resolution I decided to put myself through a trial by fasting for five daysThe Mooser had never seen such a thing and were afraid I would dieThey came and pleaded with me to partake of food as usual but I refused and continued for the full five days in accordance with my pledgeThey took it in turns surreptitiously to come and watch over meIf I closed my door to sit in meditation inside the room they would call out and ask me to reply and only when I answered would they leaveActually fasting is not the pathway to EnlightenmentThe Lord Buddha had already tried this method and subsequently said that it was more like selfmortificationAll my meditation teachers had repeated thatHaving already tried it for myself I knew that it was merely a technique for tormenting the body without leading to the arising of the wisdom to explore Dhamma and sharpen ones understandingI had fasted as a test of my willpower to see which was stronger  my attachment to life or my faith in the Dhamma qualities that I had already seenWhen I had come to the truth within my own heart about this I returned to eating as beforeYet I didnt take any rice for the first four or five days eating just steamed yams and taroWhen the Mooser saw that I was taking food again they were all delightedDuring the Rains Retreat some visions arose in my meditation pointing to the strength and firmness of my meditation proceduresThis brought me great satisfaction and contentmentThe Mooser would rejoice and boast that Your being with us is very goodOur hillrice fields have produced a bumper harvest some people will even be able to sell cattle   which they have never managed to do before Dried chilipeppers are another income source for us but apart from these items we have no other means of making moneyThis year we have more than enough money and can put some asideYou came and taught us not to gamble and play pai tooah and beer so we have stoppedPreviously groups of townspeople would come up and dupe us into gambling with them but now weve accepted your teachings and dont play any moreAt the end of the Rains Retreat the Chief personally came to offer a tort phah pah from himself and gave a length of white cloth for robe materialI had to bid farewell to the Mooser people so that I could go down to pay my respects to VenAjahn Mun who was at the village of Toong Makhao in the district of Maer PungThey were all much grieved at my departure and began crying and pleading with me to returnI was still undecided so I told them I would first see what my Ajahn had to sayPerhaps I would then come backWhen I reached VenAjahn Mun and related to him all what had happened while I had been living with the Mooser he was pleased and suggested that we went back thereFor the return trip all three of us  VenAjahn Mun Venerable Ornsee and I  went in a group togetherHowever when it came time to start climbing Venerable Ornsee became ill so we told him to wait down below to recuperate firstReturning to stay with the Mooser people this time made me feel somewhat uneasy because they were now more intimately acquainted with me than with VenAjahn MunMoreover VenAjahn Mun found it difficult to adjust to cold weatherComing up into the colder atmosphere had affected his health so badly that it appeared that he could probably not stay onBut through his strength of mind and fighting spirit he was able to overcome this and spend the whole of the Rains Retreat thereThis time around my meditation went very well because besides being able to use my own techniques I now also had those of the VenAjahn and I was able to learn from him all the timeClose to the start of the Rains Retreat the VenAjahn sent me down to bring VenOrnsee back up to be with usI was away for five nights and that left the VenAjahn by himselfIt was during this period of solitude that he strove in his meditation with absolute and fearless determination and achieved outstanding resultsHis illness also completely disappeared at the same timeDuring this Rains Retreat period the three of us were all resolute in our meditation practice each of us striving to the limit of our individual abilityWe were all so attuned to each other that any happenings  whether concerning external things or connected with the understanding of Dhamma  that occurred to one of us would seem to be known to allIt was during this Rains Retreat that VenAjahn Mun foretold how long his life would last and this subsequently proved to be accurateSometimes he would bring forward the visions and knowledge that had spontaneously arisen within his meditation as predictions about various things concerning certain of his disciplesYet he would add that one must not blindly believe all such things for they could be wrongAs for me I maintained a balanced mind concerning the things he said about me because I understood that such things were very much an individual affair each case being differentThey should not be the ultimate aim and purpose of one who truly practices meditationThat should be rather the total eradication of the defilementsThis Rains Retreat saw VenAjahn Mun teach us using canny and shrewd means as well as his various subtle and skillful techniquesI had never seen him do anything like this beforeI immediately carried out his teachings in every respect and so quickly that he once exclaimed to no one in particular that This Venerable Thate is hasty and impetuousVenAjahn Mun frankly opened up his true character to us and I can only count my great good fortune to have been under the guidance of a Meditation Master who taught in such a wayI think it would be difficult to find any other times when he could train his disciples in this wayThe appropriate conditions of the people involved the place and the time could never again be quite so conduciveAlthough he might have given his blessing and encouragement for me to become an heir to his Dhamma I have never been heedless and complacently accepted itI always held that what is true remains true whatever one might sayOne cant go beyond the true state of thingsDuring this Rains Retreat I came across a tribe of forest people who were known as the Yellow Leaf SpiritsThey themselves resented this name and asked that it not be used for they said that they too were afraid of spirits and it was better to call them forest peopleThe Mooser people said that although they had lived in that place for over fifty years they had never seen this tribe come near themThey were considered a tribe of ancient Thais and their language and accent sounded very similar to what I had heard when talking with the people from the towns of Yong and Ruang located to the north of Chiang DtoongThese townspeople had migrated southwards and settled down in Chiang Mai ProvinceThey had made their living as wickerworkers weaving trays known as kern traysThey had told me about these forest people relating how originally the tribe had consisted of about sixty but smallpox had later killed some of themAt that time only about thirty men and women remainedI can offer here some brief collected notes about their way of lifeTheir existence didnt rely on any permanent settlementThey cut a few small tree trunks to act as posts then covered those with branches leaves and whatever they could findIt was enough to sleep in and find some shelter from rain and dewSometimes they would sleep in caves or under rock overhangs or treesThe base of a tree sufficed for them even if it offered only a little shelterThese forest people had no clothing except a few items that they had solicited for covering their nakedness when they entered a villageThey lived together in groups and were afraid of spirits and tigersOnce they were in their shelters other people rarely noticed themIf by chance they were seen the women folk had to run away and if they werent fast enough they would drop to the ground and roll awayAny men of the tribe would immediately come out with their spears to fightThey believed it was so inauspicious for a woman to see a stranger that it would end with her being eaten by a tigerThe tribe would stay for a long time wherever there was a plentiful food supply but once the food ran out they would migrate elsewhereThat is why they were known as the Yellow Leaf Spirits for when the leaves covering their shelters turned yellow they would move onTheir food and diet were based on animal meat wild forest yams and tubers and honey from wild bee hivesThey wouldnt eat certain species of animals  snakes for example  and meat had to be cooked or roasted in the fire before it could be eatenRice or wheat did not make up their staple food unlike ordinary peopleIf they collected honey they would first mix it with rotted wood pulp or earth to give it some solidity before eating itThey lit their fires by striking a piece of iron against a stone   otherwise they would rub two sticks togetherI gave them a box of matches but they were afraid to use them because of the sudden ignition and hissing flare when struckTheir way of hunting used spears the ends of which were poisonedThese forest people would stealthily follow any animal tracks they had observed until they saw the animal lying down for its dayrestThen they would stalk in closer and hurl their spears directly at itIf the animal they sighted was still foraging for food they would stealthily find cover and creep in as close as possible before sending their spears arching up through the air to fall on their preyThey said that within a range of twenty to thirty metres they could be sure of their mealA superficial penetration of the spear meant they could eat the meat but if it went in more than one inch all the meat would become contaminated by the poison and be rendered inedibleThey once came and offered us some of their meatIt had an offensive rank smell arising from the smoke where it had been roastedThey put it in the fork of some tree branches about ten metres away and its rank and putrid smell almost kept us awake the whole nightVenAjahn Mun told the Mooser to take it and try boiling it but nearly half of it proved to be dirt and so it couldnt be eatenTheir tradition and customs were based in the forest and they never really left itThe only time people ever caught sight of them was when they ventured out to ask for clothing rice salt or iron for their flintsThe ancestors of this tribe as I understand it were probably fugitives who had long ago fled from their lords and masters into the jungleWe may deduce this from their taboo against crossing any open areas or cultivated fieldsNo matter how wide the fields or how difficult the route around they would avoid and bypass any signs of habitation or agriculture  even though nobody had actually forbidden them from crossingThis shows how the tribal elders had misled them away from going into open areas being afraid that someone would spot and take themThis also applies to what Ive already said about the women  that if they should catch sight of any stranger a tiger would eat themWhen the men came in to ask for rice wheat or yams and taro they would immediately eat everything without leaving anyI told them to take some back to share with their women folkHowever they replied that they couldnt do such a thing for if the women ate such foods they would become addicted to the taste and be spoiltWhenever they came among the Mooser their behavior betrayed their inherent fear of strangers especially of important people or officialsThey walked slowly and cautiously always wary and alert in a quite pitiful wayHowever when they entered the jungle they became so swift and agile that following them was difficult for the eyeAll one would see and hear were the stirring and rustling of the leavesTheir marriage customs gave individual freedom to both the women and the menFor example as elsewhere it was common that when a man had good luck and was prospering through successfully bringing in meat and food any woman attracted to him would go and stay with him and become his partnerI forgot to ask whether there was any dowry involvedThe raising of children was the sole responsibility of the womanThey had come to see me sometimesI then had an opportunity to question them about many aspects of their lifestyle and so was able to develop a good understanding about themWhenever I saw these forest people I felt sympathy and pity because they were also of the same Thai tribeI could understand every word of their conversation and their physical features were the same as ours in every wayThe thought arose deep down in me to find some way to help them to become established in some stable livelihood or at least to assist them to reach the subsistence level of the Mooser and the other hill tribes up in the mountainsIf they were willing to receive assistance I intended to inform the appropriate Government authorities so that they could bring in aid such as tools and supplies  including everything all the way to seedlings and seedsWhen they later came to see me I sounded them out What do you think of the rice the maize the taro the chili and the salt that you have been given to eatWas it deliciousYes they replied it was all very tastySo I continued if that is the case why dont you come and make a settlement like these Mooser peopleYou could then plant rice and taro for your own consumption  wouldnt that be goodThat was as far as I got for they immediately started to protest that they were a forest people and that they couldnt do such a thingIf they did the ground would be turned upside downWhen I heard these objections all my aid plans and projects ceased right thereWhat a shameAlthough these people were endowed with priceless humanity they were unable to take full advantage of it because of their birth in an unsuitable environmentMore to be pitied though are some of the people born in an affluent and pleasant environmentThey have everything including education opportunities yet heedlessly lose themselves through indulgence in pleasures that are without real substanceMeanwhile time consumes their life so that it isnt used for anything worthwhileThere are so many people like thisIn this Rains Retreat VenAjahn Mun not only foretold various things but also spoke of the responsibility he would have to shoulder concerning the group of Kammatthaana forest monksHe spoke of establishing a meditation monastery in the Chiang Mai area and asked if I had any suggestions to offerI was delighted to hear that he was thinking of resuming responsibility for our groupSo I remarked that the people of the Northeast of Thailand were more suited to Dhamma practice than the people of other regionsThis was especially so I pointed out in this Northern region where the results had been minimalLook I said Venerable Ajahn has been in this region for seven or eight years now but who has left their home to follow you and the way of practiceThose who do follow you are all without exception your old disciples from the NortheastAt this very moment the people there both monks and lay people  including VenChao Khun Dhammachedi  are always yearning for youEveryone pleaded with me to come and invite VenAjahn to return to the NortheastThey are happy to make all the necessary travel arrangements and said that all I had to do was to tell them what was requiredVenAjahn Mun then recalled a mountain range towards Nah Kaer District of Sakhon Nakorn Province that would certainly make a good and suitable place to stayHe favored those sort of mountains and so declared that it would be the place for us all to goBut he also said that it would have to be my job to act as doorkeeper for himIf someone came to visit him whom I considered unsuitable he told me that I was not to allow them in to see himAfter the Rains Retreat VenAjahn Mun went down to the district of Phrao againFor our part VenOrnsee and I had requested permission to remain in that area to continue our meditation efforts to our hearts contentNot many days later VenAjahn Mun returned bringing VenAjahn Sahn VenAjahn Waen and VenAjahn Khao up to see usHe mentioned again about establishing a meditation monastery for the group and I maintained my previous opinion that I didnt agree with it being set up in the NorthNevertheless if VenAjahn did go ahead and establish something in this region after three years I would come and wholeheartedly helpVenAjahn Mun and his group stayed with us for two nights before departing with VenAjahn Sahn VenAjahn Waen and VenAjahn Khao returning to PhraoMeanwhile VenAjahn Mun and VenManoo went off towards Maer Sai District of Chiang Rai Province where they eventually spent the coming Rains RetreatVenerable Ornsee and I remained meditating in that place until everybody had gone then we also went our separate waysVenOrnsee staying on there while I went over to another mountainWhat I am about to relate makes me feel quite embarrassed but it will put even greater shame on the defilementsWhat was itWell it happened when I left VenOrnsee and went off to stay aloneOne day I heard a tiger roar and became so terrified by its noise that I began to tremble and shake so much that I couldnt sleep and my meditation wouldnt settle down at allSome local people helped to chase it away by firing threatening shots with their guns and by hurling firebrands at itIt fled for a moment but then came back againIn the early morning when the villagers were going out to work in the fields they would sometimes spot the tiger crouching in the jungle ahead of themThey would then run away  although I never heard that it had done any harm to anyoneNo matter how I tried to sit in meditation it just didnt seem to come togetherAt that point I was still unaware that it was all to do with my fear of the tigerMy whole body would be soaked in sweatHey I thought whats all this about thenIm cold and yet Im still sweatingI tried removing the blanket wrapped around me and saw that I was still tremblingI felt exhausted with not being able to progress with my meditationThen I thought of lying down to rest a little and refresh myself ready for future effortsAt that very moment I heard the tiger roar out and my whole body started shivering and shaking as if I had a malarial feverIt was then I realized that this was all due to my fear of the tigers roarI sat up and established mindfulness settling the mind in stillness on a single object and ready to sacrifice my lifeHadnt I already accepted deathWasnt that the reason for my coming to live hereArent tiger and human both a fabrication of the same four elementsAfter death wont both end in the same conditionWho eats whom  who is the one who dies and who is the one that doesnt dieWhen I was willing to relinquish and investigate in this dauntless singleminded way I could no longer hear the noise of the tigerWhenever I afterwards heard the tigers roar my mind remained quite unconcernedI now saw it just as air reverberating from a material form causing soundEver since childhood I had had a natural tendency to be easily upset being of a rather nervous dispositionThe sound of the tiger had brought up some past conditioning that had caused my unconscious fearIt is these latent defilements lying submerged in the depths of the heart that are so extremely difficult to dispose ofTo conquer the defilements is absolutely impossible without a willingness to relinquish ones attachment and grasping for these conditioned thingsThere has to be an exchange of things wholly devoid of value for the taste of the deathless  that is only found within the heartAlthough Venerable Sariputta the righthand disciple of the Lord Buddha could abandon these things when he became an arahant his character traits remained  unlike the Fully Enlightened BuddhaDuring this period when I was fearlessly pressing forward with my practice something disagreeable came up as a meditation visionIts something that should be revealed to my readers so that some of the shameful tendencies of the defilements can be exposedRecognition of the harm of this type of defilement might then perhaps serve as a caution for their future restraintThe image that appeared was that of a middleaged woman someone whom I well remembered from about five or six years previouslyShe had then been a lay supporter of mine full of faith and sincere intentionsI considered her a good person a person of Dhamma courteous and refined someone suitable for me to be associated with and a fine example of a genuine upaasikaa of the Buddhist TeachingsHer physical appearance was rather ordinary or so it seemed to meApart from that I had never given her much thought except recalling her kind support to me as a monk  for a monk lives dependent on othersWhen the image appeared in my meditation she seemed to be sitting close to me on my right in a rather familiar wayThere then arose in my heart a spontaneous feeling as if the two of us had been living closely together for what seemed like decadesYet there was no lust or desire involved in itThis shocked meI withdrew from meditation and examined my heart but I couldnt detect any feelings of attachment towards herFurthermore I hadnt given her a moments thought over the previous five or six yearsWhy then should I have such a visionAfter a more thorough investigation I came to understand the nature of the latent defilement of sensualityThis lies deeply submerged in the ocean bed beyond the reach and understanding of the negligent person A person possessing wisdom but lacking faith energy and dauntless perseverance will be incapable of searching out and confronting it A person possessing faith energy and dauntless perseverance but lacking wisdom will still be incapable of eliminating it A person possessing faith energy and dauntless perseverance together with wisdom and someone who develops meditation by steadily cultivating those virtuous qualities without lapses will be able totally to eliminate the latent tendenciesI then proceeded to reflect further about those meditators who had successfully achieved all the absorptions yet could still be deceived and fall down badly because of the defilements of sensuality and lustThey take the sort of vision that I have just mentioned as genuine as truly signifying that they had been husband and wife in a previous lifeThis leads to the arising of tenderness and affection sexual excitement and desire that develop as is their wont into the searching out of that visionThere is then a meeting and a frank telling of what should not be revealedThe twin live wires already run side by side and if some metal object comes too close it has to be attracted and pulled inThey make contact and that is why its possible for so many meditators particularly monks  sometimes they have even been senior Teachers  to fall into the abyssOn seeing such a vision instead of being alarmed and seeing it as a threat and danger  and therefore arming themselves for victory over it  they submit and ally themselves with itWhat a wasteThe Lord Buddha recounted how human beings and animals born into this world one and all have been mothers and fathers sisters and brothers husbands and wivesThey have all been relatives to one another  in one or another birthPerhaps even the poultry and pork that we eat might be the flesh of our father or mother from a previous birthWe still have defilements and so are liable to die and take birth to die and be born through countless livesYet what sort of case is it when a seductive vision arises just once and one is lured away and goes after itWell now that we have already exposed and shamed Maara the defilements I would like to relate another instanceThis concerns an attractive young womanShe and her parents and relatives held me in deep regard and I tried to help by advising and instructing her in morality and virtueI particularly wanted her to see the hazard inherent in the feminine condition and to keep to the brahmacariya precepts all her lifeYet events didnt turn out that way for instead she went and lost her virginity in a very unfortunate wayWhen she came to her senses she was overwhelmed by tearful remorseI happened to hear about this and felt a deep weariness with all such gullibility and credulousnessAfterwards she both respected me and felt ashamed before meAll I could think of was how could things have come to this passLooking at her I felt that although her form might appear human her mindstate was that of an animalThe more I thought about it the more it made me feel sick and tired about her and the whole matter  almost to the point of nauseaThis state of mind persisted for many years afterwards and that nauseous feeling would arise whenever I recalled the incidentThere was such a strong feeling of weariness  I had never felt anything quite so deeply before  yet it certainly was not the correct way of practiceHowever that had all happened in the pastAfterwards I came to reflect on the harm of sensuality pondering the extent of its fierce severityWhen it arises in the underlying personality of anyone it can vent its power and devour its victimThis may happen regardless of whether the person has moral principles or is delinquent or whether they are seasoned meditators who have reached the highest levels of absorptionThe only exceptions being the Lord Buddha and the arahantsSensuality is totally lacking kindness or consideration being like a tiger pouncing on a defenceless puppy and coldbloodedly consuming itThis made me feel a lot more sensitive and open towards that young womanShe had always had wholesome intentions had hoped to be good yet passion can be so very destructiveIt pounces without caring whom its victim isIt is this sensual desire that must bear so much of the blame and is unforgivableThis increased my sympathy and compassion for herThose who are still sunk in the depths of the flood of sensual desires must come to birth in the sensual realmThis sensual realm or sphere is a place to develop spiritual virtuesFor those who want to progress in the way of the heart it is the field of battle where one can fight for victoryWhile for miscreants it can become their graveyardThe sensual realm or plane of existence is endowed with a full complement of natural resources and all the outer and the inner ones are completePersons of wisdom can take advantage of this in whatever way they wantIf there are no trees in the forest where will one go to find herbal medicinesIf there are no doctors then such medicines remain uselessIf there are medicine and doctor but the sick patient refuses treatment or will not take the prescription they cannot cure their illnessThose who see any worth in the sphere of sensuality and engross themselves in its array of sensual delights are called worthies of sensualityThose whom the poison of sensuality has infected and are aware of its virulence are called handicapped by sensualityThose who have totally relinquished all sensuality are called freed from sensualityReturning to where I had stayed before I exchanged places with VenOrnseeIt was then that I really did have quite an encounter with a tigerOne night a tiger came and pounced on and began to eat a water buffalo close by my hutI tried to drive it away by striking a bamboo and shouting loudly but the tiger would have none of itIt refused to let go of its prey and succeeded in dragging it away to eatThis time I was not afraid but I didnt dare leave my hut and go over to aid the water buffalo in case the tiger decided to gobble up a man tooAs the two of us had spent enough time meditating in that place we moved on to other Mooser villages scattered along those mountainsAfter we had spent some time introducing them to Dhamma and inspiring them with faith we returned down to the district of PhraoThen we looked around the region of Chiang Dao before returning to Maer Dtaeng DistrictThe small forest monastery at Pong Village was where VenAjahn Mun had once stayed for the Rains RetreatVenChao Khun Phra Upaaliigunuupamaacaariya had also spent some time thereThe lay people of this village were quite clever and had a reasonably good understanding of DhammaThat years Rains saw five of us staying there VenAjahn Boontham Venerable Kheung a monk from Loei Province VenAjahn Chorp and myselfI was the head monk and so had to choose suitably skillful means to use in my Dhamma talks to the group so that they would gain a solid basis for their future individual Dhamma practiceIn this group it was VenAjahn Chorp who was the most strict in his dhutanga practicesWhile including all the monks gathered for that Rains Retreat it would be difficult to find a better group of Dhamma companionsI gave a Dhamma talk almost every night and throughout the instruction my companions would willingly listen with calm and attentive mindsAfterwards I would give them an opportunity to bring up any questions or problems and to air whatever views they hadBesides VenAjahn Chorp VenKheung was particularly gifted in the faculty of knowing another persons mindIf something was preoccupying anyones mind or if someone had committed any breach of the monastic Rule one of these two monks would detect itIn our group the monk whom I felt most sorry for was VenAjahn BoonthamHe had been a monk for many years but still couldnt meditate very wellVenAjahn Chorp and Venerable Kheung were able to follow everything he was thinking and doing which concerned matters in which he certainly shouldnt have been indulgingWhenever his companions cautioned him about it he would readily admit his faults and would even humbly bow to them even though they were his juniorsHis feelings of inadequacy and shame in front of the group went with his having missed meeting VenAjahn Mun  although he had once been a disciple of VenAjahn SinghHe really wanted to hear a sermon by VenAjahn Mun and believed that he was already knowledgeable enough instantly to understand and gain insight into DhammaI was continually warning him not to be presumptuous and to be careful when he did come to meet and listen to VenAjahn Muns Dhamma talkHis overconfidence might make him unreceptive and cause him to feel negative towards the Venerable AjahnAfter the Rains Retreat was over VenAjahn Mun returned to visit us again and VenAjahn Boontham was able to listen to a Dhamma talkThat was all it took for regrettably it had the opposite effect to what he had expected and he became dissatisfied with the methods of training offered by VenAjahn MunLater perhaps because he felt so let down he deserted the group and went off wandering aloneHowever he met with misfortune and contracted cerebral malariaVenAjahn Reean found him and helped to bear him back to Chiang Mai where he died in the hospital without any relatives or disciples being around to help nurse himAfter staying to receive teachings from VenAjahn Mun for a suitable length of time Venerable Kheung and I took our leave to go off in search of solitude and secluded places by following the Maer Dtaeng River upstreamWe stayed in a secluded spot near a mountain area of tea plantationsI left Venerable Kheung to watch over our belongings in an abandoned monastery at the foot of the mountain while I climbed the ridge to find a suitable place to stay aboveIt happened that a young woman came strolling by flirting with some local young menVenerable Kheung saw this and he too became intensely excitedWhen I came back down from my place on the mountain and saw the state he was in I tried to counsel him and recommended various ways he could use to still the emotion  but without successI had had an intimation of such a possibility ever since he had first come to stay with meAt that time he had told me about a vision that he had experienced while staying with VenAjahn Mun in Maer Suay DistrictHe said that hearing about me had inspired him so much that he wished to meet meHe had then had a visionA road appeared that led straight from him to where I wasHe made a troublefree journey along the road that ended right at the foot of the stairs leading to my hutHe then seemed to catch hold of the stairs and started climbing  they seemed extremely high  up to meAfter bowing to me three times I offered him a complete set of robes but he refused to accept themIt seemed that circumstances were beginning to fit in with his visionI also felt as if our sympathetic association had reached its limitThat morning during the meal he had lost his temper with me over some insignificant issueBy the evening he had come to see me and admitted his faultHe related his experience of the previous evening when lust had overcome him at seeing the flirtatious young womanHis meditation throughout the following night had not been successful and he came to take his leave and go off wandering aloneAbout three months later we met again and I encouraged him to make a fresh start with his meditation If you have enough determination its still possible for you to succeedPlease just have done with it and start afreshNevertheless he wouldnt accept this advice and afterwards I learned with great regret that he had disrobedHe was a strongwilled individual and did nothing in half measures but he was also very opinionated and even VenAjahn Muns Dhamma talks didnt always convince himHe had once been a tough guy back in his home village before ordaining and leaving without any real goal in mindHe originally came from Nam Gam Village in the district of Taht PanomThe Six Higher Psychic Powers  one example being knowing the minds of other beings  are not something common to every personThey will not necessarily arise in the practice of everyone who meditatesWith some people no matter how refined their mind becomes no higher powers will ariseWhile other people meditate and when the mind converges into momentary or access concentration these powers developVenerable Kheung was adept at training his mind to enter tranquillity and he could remain in such a calm state all day and nightWhile walking around in seemingly quite an ordinary way in his mind he would feel as if he were walking on airWhile at other times he might feel as if he had penetrated into the interior of the earthAlthough VenKheungs mind didnt withdraw from concentration he lacked the wisdom to investigate the Three CharacteristicsHis powers were therefore only of the mundane sort arising out of mundane absorptionLet alone VenKheung just consider Venerable Devadatta who had been able to consult with Prince Ajaatasatthu by flying in through the palace window  that is until his abilities failedNong Doo was a Mon villageThe monks of the village seemed quite strict with their keeping of the monastic RuleHowever the villagers also said that their abbot was supernaturally quite powerfulWhenever the villagers went to a festival or fair he would consecrate and empower some sesame seed oil and give it to them to drink and rub on their bodiesThis would make them invulnerable to stabs and blowsWhen they went to neighbouring village fairs the other village folk would have to watch out for them very carefullyThe villagers from Nong Doo were confident in their Abbotteachers power and so started to consider themselves superior without fear of anyone elseThe nearby villages gathered together laid out a plan and arming themselves to the teeth came en masse to invest Nong Doo Village intent on taking their revenge by wiping it outWhen the resident menfolk there realized what was happening they had taken to their heels and hid themselves in the jungle to save their skinsThe Abbotteacher was already eighty years old when he was converted from such practices by the teachings of a wandering meditation monk who stayed at his monasteryRemarkably he was able to gain some insight into the truth of the Dhamma teachings of the Lord BuddhaHe then felt such faith in the meditation monk that he could give up his conceited opinions and offer himself as a disciple of the younger monkLater the whole monastery supported by the lay people decided to change over to become part of the Dhammayut communitySomdet Phra Maha Virawong when he was still Phra aanadilok and acting abbot of Wat Chedi Luang in Chiang Mai requested that I become the first abbot of the reestablished Wat Nong Doo with VenPalat Tongsook as deputy abbotIt was during this Rains Retreat that VenMahaa Kan learned to give his first sermon and taught Dhamma studiesI instructed the lay community during this Rains RetreatThis inspired their faith so much that on the Quarter Moon Days they came to the monastery to observe the Eight Precepts in unprecedented numbersWhole households would lock up the house and come to observe the Eight Precepts and spend the night in the monasteryTraditionally Mon young women were not expected to observe the Eight PreceptsFor the young men it was the oppositeWhen the young men disrobed after their temporary ordination they would unfailingly continue to go every week to the monastery and keep the Eight PreceptsThese people were really exemplary for despite their far from easy living conditions they were extremely devoutI also taught them to establish themselves steadfastly in the Three Refuges and to abandon their wrong views and beliefs in spiritworshipMany agreed to this and willingly renounced their Mon spirit worship and came to request the Three Refuges insteadUnfortunately after the Rains Retreat I had to leave them and travel back to the Northeast so things had to be suspended thereBeing a millionaire or a pauper does not stand in the way of gaining the Noble Treasure of one endowed with faith and wisdomThis is why this Noble Treasure surpasses all other wealthBefore leaving the North I went to pay my respects to VenAjahn MunHe had spent the Rains Retreat at Wat Chedi Luang in Chiang Mai at the request of Somdet Phra Maha VirawongI again took the opportunity to invite him to return to the Northeast having already submitted one invitation before the Retreat had startedHe remarked that he had also received a letter of invitation from VenChao Khun DhammachediIn fact I had been the one who had written to VenChao Khun Dhammachedi suggesting that such an invitation be sentI had done this after sounding out VenAjahn Mun and sensing that there was a chance that he might be willing to returnWhen I enquired again about his going back he said that he would go at the right timeI then respectfully informed him of my own plans to go back and took leave of himI explained that I had already been in the Northern region for quite a long time and felt that however things might turn out I would be able to take care of myselfAfter writing another letter to VenChao Khun Dhammachedi explaining the situation I set outThis time they arranged for a boy to accompany me on my journey but VenOrnsee stayed behind with VenAjahn MunWhen I reached Tah Bor in Nongkhai Province I was determined that the group of monks there be trained to be rigorous and conscientious in their practiceHowever after attempting this for around three or four years the results were only about or per cent of what they could have beenLater they seemed even lessI therefore turned more to integrating the study aspects into the practiceTogether with that I also led all the monks in the daily chanting and afterwards we would practice the rhythmic styles of both mokotsangyok and roygaaw chantingWe would regularly finish by chanting the Patimokkha Rule and by that I was able to produce many expert chantersThe benefits became so obvious that I have continued this way of practice right up to the presentAfter I had stayed two Rains Retreats in Wat Araññavaasee  from to  I led the lay supporters to build a small monastery on the western side of Glahng Yai VillageIt is now a permanent monastery and has continued to have resident monks and novices through each Rains RetreatThey have now named it Wat NirodharangseeIt was during this period that VenChao Khun Dhammachedi began to take a greater interest in meditation practice and in Venerable Ajahn MunIn truth when VenChao Khun Dhammachedi was still a novice  before he had gone off to Bangkok to study  he had been a disciple of VenAjahn Sao and VenAjahn MunAt that time however he had shown no interest in the way of practiceI think it was probably at the time of the boundarystone laying ceremony at Wat Bodhisomphorn that he became more closely acquainted with the two venerable AjahnsThey so aroused his interest that he was always questioning me about their way of practice and about their character and qualitiesHe would sometimes ask me to give him a sermon based on what I had heard from the two AjahnsWhen I recounted such teaching he would silently listen with great attention and respectAfterwards VenChao Khun Dhammachedi sent VenAjahn Oon Dhammadharo to Chiang Mai to invite VenAjahn Mun to return but without successVenAjahn Oon reported to VenAjahn Mun about his vegetarian practices and this eventually led to quarreling and discord in the groupVenAjahn Mun said that none of the arahants had ever quarreled over food and excrement so why were those present now doing soVenChao Khun Dhammachedi had to go to Bangkok on Sangha affairs and when they were completed he carried on to Chiang Mai and made the invitation himselfVenAjahn Mun said Hey whats this youve come with the big letterI remained at Wat Araññavaasee in Tah Bor for a period approaching nine yearsThis was a record for my ordained life until thenI had never taken any interest in building work because I considered it an interference and not the task of a recluseThinking that one ordained should rather concentrate all his energies on the duties of a recluseWhen I arrived in Wat Araññavaasee I realized that all the dwelling places there were an inheritance from the previous generation of senior monksThey had constructed them and we all lived in themI then reflected on those clauses in the monastic Rule where permission is given to repair any existing dwelling placesThis led me to feel rather ashamed of myself for I seemed to have been so busy making use of these resources and merely monitoring this heritage from the previous TeachersThis was when I began to guide the lay supporters in building projects and Ive continued right up to the present dayHowever at no point have I gone out and solicited donations for this workI have always been extremely sensitive about this  if the resources were available the work went forward if they werent then we simply stopped the workI never allowed myself to become bound to any project so that if it couldnt be finished or was underfunded I could easily abandon it without any feelings of attachmentWhile I was at Wat Araññavaasee I directed the lay supporters in the construction of two new huts a large study hall and many other smaller structuresBefore this extended period at Wat Araññavaasee I cant remember ever staying anywhere longer than three Rains RetreatsIt may have been due to the long period of my stay or perhaps for some other reason that my neurological disorder recurredHowever I still forced myself to endure it so that those who wanted to study and practice there were given a good opportunityIn Venerable Gate came to spend the Rains Retreat with usHe died during the Retreat from appendicitisHe had been ordained for fourteen years and was fortyeight years oldSince his ordination   we had never before stayed together for a Rains RetreatIt now seems that our coming together was not a good omenWhen he came I wasnt giving many sermons to the lay devotees and instead had them meditating quietly on their ownMy neurological disorder had grown so much worse that after I took the Dhamma seat to give a sermon I had no idea what I was talking about  but I could still speak all rightWhen I finished my sermon I would ask the listening lay people what I had been speaking about and whether it had made senseThey answered that they could understand it very wellIt was just as it had always beenOne day I had a dream in which Venerable Gate and I were walking on tudong together through the jungleWe came to a stream and started following the stream bedThe water wasnt very deep only reaching our waists yet it didnt appear to wet our robesI noticed how fresh the water looked and felt like scooping it up in my hands to rinse my mouth outWhen I did take a mouthful I gargled with it and then spat it out  and all my teeth came out with the waterWaking up I thought that it had really happenedI had to feel in my mouth before I knew it was only a dreamI had never really believed in the absolute truth of dreamsI thought that dreams occurred through our not attending to the activities of the mind so that it dithers when we fall asleep and then trails after its preoccupationsIf we were to take care of the heart then there would be no dreamingIf however we did dream we would be aware of the dreaming though we couldnt get up because the body remained stillWhen the body was able to move again and could get up the mind would no longer be asleepDreaming would occur when the heart wasnt asleep but was vacillating and ditheringWhen I refused to believe in the dream a vision appeared to my inner sightAs Ive mentioned above I became ill about four or five days before the full moon of the tenth lunar monthIt was the time of the traditional festival of Khao Boon Salahkpat and I was feeling so unwell that I couldnt stand up without vomitingI lay down with closed eyes and when I opened them again I found myself gazing at the sky with clouds passing across the sunIt hurt my eyes and I vomitedIt happened to be an Observance Day but I couldnt manage to go and give a sermon so instead they invited Venerable GateHe gave a sermon for one and a half hoursThe people listening were quite amazed at this not expecting him to be able to do so muchThe next morning my nervous disorder seemed to have cleared up and I was invited away to a meetingAt around eleven oclock in the morning someone came to tell me that Venerable Gate had stomach pains and so I returned to the monasteryWhen I arrived all I could do was look at him for we had no medicines and I didnt know what else to doMore than ten years before he had been ill with similar symptomsSometimes if medicine were available he would take it and get better while at other times it seemed to clear up even without medicinesHe had once been ill for five days and nights at Nah Seedah Village without being able to lie down or eatThe illness had then cleared up after he had used his finger to remove three or four small lumps  I dont know what they were  from his anusIn those days modernstyle doctoring had yet to spread widelyIf ones stomach was painful one found some stomachache pills to swallowWe didnt know anything about the appendixIf the stomach pains came from food poisoning or from fermentation and flatulence they would clear upIf they came from appendicitis they wouldnt and countless people died of itThis time Venerable Gate really did have appendicitis  and we had no medicineThe pain was almost beyond bearing so that he was tossing about but I never heard him cry outFinally he managed to get out a few wordsHe said that he certainly wouldnt be able to carry on in that wayHe thought that trying some walking meditation might help so he asked us to assist him up to the meditation path where he took about four or five steps before collapsingThe monks and novices who were attending him saw his condition and brought him back to lie down where he had been beforeAt that time I had begun to feel so weak after caring for him for such an extended period that I had asked leave from everyone to go and restA novice then came to call me with news that Venerable Gate had become very weak and faintedI rushed to see and found that he was lying there without speakingComing closer I reminded him of Dhamma and asked if he could hear what I was sayingHe replied that he could and this continued until about eight oclock that night when he diedVenerable Gate had been a person of great endurance in times of both sickness and healthIt wasnt just the one illness either for he had also suffered from appendicitis kidney stones and malariaEven when his appendix became infected for many days he neither complained nor troubled anyoneHe would quietly lie there aloneIf he were able to eat he would eat and if he couldnt he would just continue quietly to lie thereHe had always eaten only a small amount and had never been fussy about foodOnce he had managed on plain rice and salt for more than ten daysAll the meditation teachers had praised his great qualities of enduranceAfter I had arranged his funeral and finished the Rains Retreat of my mother also passed awayThat year had seen the whole village and town come down with infected sores and ulcers and this included my mother who had an ulcer on her shinThose who were affected had gone for treatment and were all cured except my motherI fetched the particular medicines that should have been effective in treating her but the problem didnt clear upThe flesh started festering and was suppurating so much that it fell away exposing the boneThere was no pain howeverWhile my mother was ill in Nah Seedah Village Glahng Yai Subdistrict of Nongkhai I had spent the Rains Retreat in Tah Bor District of Nongkhai ProvinceThe block that had made me so incredulous about the validity of my dream abruptly cleared upThe morning after dreaming that all my teeth had fallen out I felt certain that I would have some traveling to do that dayI returned from my alms round and saw someone waiting for me with news that my mothers condition had seriously deterioratedThose who mark dreams down as unbelievable useless affairs  well they can think what they wantBut I accept them with percent certaintyIf one dreams that ones teeth fall out then it definitely means that ones father or mother or one of ones brothers or sisters is very ill or has diedIt might otherwise relate to a very close friend or acquaintanceI nursed my mother as much as I could with both spiritual medicine and with medication but her body was already extremely agedShe was eightytwo years oldWhatever medicine we brought no longer seemed to help for she could no longer take it and her condition continued to deteriorateThis went on until things could no longer hold together and just as an old brown leaf falls she withered away and sankNevertheless I ministered to her heart and mind supporting her mindfulness and settling her in full tranquillity right up to the final moment when little breath remainedI thus fulfilled the obligations necessary for an ideal sonWhen her condition had still been stable she had always thought of me as an adviserShe would consult me if she wanted for anything or if she had any problems and would adopt any opinion I offeredWhen she was unwell I had supported her mindfulness so that sometimes she wouldnt need to take any other medicineShe had often recovered through her trust and faith in my teachingIt was the same when she was approaching death and perhaps it was due to this that the wound in her leg was not painfulI had experienced a vision of this mountain while staying in Wat Araññavasee Tah Bor but it was still very different from my expectationsFor a start it was hardly credible as a place of solitude for it was just a small hill in the middle of fields with villages clustered all around its baseHowever it was amazing how anyone who went there for meditation practice  whether monk novice or villager  would achieve remarkable resultsThese would be great or small depending on the basic ability of the personThe strangest case was that of one old man more than seventy years old who with his penchant for drinking liquor all day had been left so destitute that he was dependent on the villagersThey would hire him at fifty baht a month to attend on the resident monks but he wasnt very willingWhen I was there he found such faith that it was no longer necessary to hire him to do the jobSuch a wonderful vision had arisen in his meditation that he gave up all alcohol and was even able to take on the Eight Precepts on Observance daysThe villagers became so impressed with him that he could go into any house or shop and receive a free mealThis made him even more aware of the benefits of his practice and he continued his attendance on the monksEven stranger was the case of a mute person of Tah Chalaep who was also forced to be dependent on the villageI had taught him by sign language to observe the Eight Precepts on the Observance Day and to meditateThis eventually became so wonderfully meaningful to him that he taught other people by sign language to see the harm of drinking alcoholWhile meditating at home his mind would become so bright that he was able to view me in the monasteryIve recently heard that this person is alive and has built a monastery by himself invited monks to stay there and attends on them himselfFor myself things were also amazingI was searching out Dhamma that I never could have conceived of and comprehending Dhamma that I had never known beforeThe ways and means of the practice were clarified in precise detail so that I felt confident enough to compose my first book Illuminating the Way of Calm and InsightFollowing my original plans I continued practicing there for two Rains RetreatsAfter the end of the second Rains Retreat came news of VenAjahn Muns illness and I left full of appreciation for the virtues of this small hillI went to attend on VenAjahn Mun through his last illness until his passing awayAfter his cremation had been completed I never found an opportunity to return to Khao Noi even though the people there had offered me such outstanding supportI sent other monks to go in my place because my own plans were still uncertainAfter the cremation ceremony for VenAjahn Mun was over I pondered on the situation of our group of meditation monksUntil then we had only been a small group and among people in general still not well knownWe had had backing and support from some highly placed eldersFor example VenChao Khun Phra Upaaliigunuupamaacaariya had always come up to assist usHe had taken it upon himself to deal with any issue involving Sangha affairs that affected usWhen he died it was Somdet Phra Maha Virawong who looked after thisAfter he died VenAjahn Mun Bhuuridatta Thera was already well known and widely respected among the ecclesiastical hierarchyThen VenAjahn Mun himself passed away and the group seemed to be left aloneThe senior ecclesiastical elders neither knew many monks of our group nor did they seem likely to take on obligations about usLater in fact monks who were disciples of VenAjahn Mun did steadily become more widely knownSuch concerns caused me to travel to Bangkok for should the right occasion present itself I would be able to construct some bridges with the elders of the ecclesiastical hierarchyI could listen to their rulings and strategies and get to know their opinions about our groupI set out and stayed at Wat Bahn Jik in UdornThen I came to stay with VenAjahn Orn aanasiri at Wat Tiprat in UdornHe was obviously under the impression that I was deserting our group and going off aloneI had to explain all the facts before he understood my intentionsDuring the next Rains Retreat I heard that he had gone off to spend the Retreat in Khao Yoi Cave in Phetburi Province so Im not sure what interpretation he had put on my wordsWhen I reached Bangkok I had the chance to go and pay my respects to many ecclesiastical elders and could learn the attitude of each towards our group of meditation monksThis allowed me to feel quite confident towards the groups position and my ownI wanted to go and look over some of the famous places of meditation practice for example those of Rahtburi and PhetburiI therefore traveled around those places requesting permission to stay a while and learn from each before eventually reaching Songkla ProvinceAt that time VenKhun Siritejodom  who had once been a district officer and then had stayed with me  had gone down to Phuket and Phangnga where he had been spreading Dhamma and the way of practiceHe had later been joined in this propagating by VenMahaa Pin Jalito who was a native of Nakorn PatomHowever he did not belong to our groupTheir activities had overexcited the people so much  it was causing rifts and factional troubles  that the situation was getting out of controlVenMahaa Pin Jalito could no longer handle things and had no group support so when he heard that I was in Songkla he came and appealed for my group to go and help clear up the situation thereTo most people of that time the island of Phuket was regarded as an isolated place abundant in valuable natural resources and full of millionairesOther than the business community most islanders werent considered to know very much about the outside worldIn fact this was about percent accurate because communications were indeed still difficultOne mainly crossed to the island by boat but I remember that my own first visit was by planeWe took off from Songkla and landed in Phuket itselfThe only passengers on that trip were we two monks and one lay person its return flight had only one solitary passengerAt that time only a few laborers had come down from the Northeast of Thailand to stay although the locals feared them as if they were somehow monsters or tigersThis originated in various rumours about Northeasterners how they were brutal and cruel catching killing and eating childrenI had been on the island for a year before all the Northeaster laborers started heading thereThey arrived walking in file along the road and became an object of intense interest to the townspeopleMeanwhile people out on the towns outskirts or in the countryside who saw them coming would flee to the shelter of their homesAnyone out in the forest ducked and hid themselves in the treesI didnt witness this with my own eyes but they reported it to me laterThe prosperity of any single region of Thailand didnt seem to me to diverge by more than per cent from any of the othersAs the Thai saying has it If we have a lot we can expend a lot if we have little we can expend a littleThe saddest aspect of the Phuket people was the desire of the poor to present themselves on the same level as the richThat wasnt so goodWhen I first went to stay on Phuket Island it caused no excitement but it did bring me some painful encountersIm referring to what happened about ten days before the start of the Rains RetreatA party of people together with a group of local monks schemed together to prevent our residing thereThey tried various ways to frustrate us setting fire to our huts poisoning our food throwing stones at us and forbidding the people to give us alms foodWhen we were out on alms round they would sometimes head straight towards us on a collision courseAs we were the visitors in their territory we tried to be as conciliatory as possibleWe went to see their head and pleaded to be allowed at least to spend the coming Rains Retreat there for it was already so closeBut he wouldnt permit this and further accused us of being vagrant monksHe adamantly rejected whatever explanations and reasons I put forward until finally he let out that it was really his superiors who would not allow us to stayI therefore told him quite frankly that although he might have his superiors I also had mineAfterwards I learned that he had set down this serious challenge if Dhammayut Nikaya monks were able to spend the Rains Retreat in Phuket and Phangnga he would put on trousersSo you can see how disturbing it wasThe end result of these events came when our lay devotees eventually did succeed in arranging places for us to spend the Rains RetreatFifteen monks and novices had accompanied me that year which with those who had been with me before made eighteen in allWe divided ourselves between three locations Dtagooa Toong Tai Muang and Koke Kloi which was where I was stayingIt was during this Rains Retreat that we were not only subjected to buffeting from surface waves but were also affected by pressure from undercurrentsI refer here to other monks of our own Dhammayut group who started clamouring against usThey accused us of not keeping the disciplinary Rule that our practice was outside what the scriptural authorities set down that we didnt observe the Patimokkha Sangha duties inside an official Uposatha HallThese monks apparently said that anyone who wanted to be enlightened should go over to Ajahn ThateIf that were their true opinion then it wouldnt be strange for newly ordained ignorant monksHowever I did also understand and sympathize with those other monks who were more senior and learned because they only knew about study and had no experience of the way of practiceMy circumstances had allowed me the opportunity to practice regularly from the first year of my ordinationThe dispute about whether or not we were going to be allowed to stay for the Rains Retreat in that area wasnt yet finished withI found out that they had sent a report to the Religious Affairs Department which accused us of being vagrant monks come to disturb and sow discord among the populaceAn order was issued that details from our monks identification papers be noted so that a future investigation into the truth of these claims could be madeThe Chief Education Officer of the Province however didnt dare come himself and instead sent the local District Education Officer to take the detailsI asked to see his official authorization and when he couldnt produce it I refused his inspectionI then gave him a thorough and detailed explanation of the proper procedures for Sangha AffairsWhen he went away I still had no idea how they would react to this but later I found that the Ecclesiastical Regional Head Monk had afterwards sent a strongly worded letter of instruction and admonishment to both the Provincial Head Monk and the Provincial GovernorIve related here only a part of what I experienced during my first years stay in Phangnga ProvinceIf I were to go into everything I fear the reader would get bored with such trifling mattersOn being born into this world it becomes inevitable that there will be obstacles to achieving ones goalWhoever it is whatever their task whether it is done for good or ill decline or progress it will all depend on their circumspection and perseverance on their finding out the causes of the situation and thereby clearing them upOtherwise there can never be successAs one moves forward this will bring confidence and determination in dealing with such hurdles and this in turn speeds up ones realizationWith reference to the Dhammayut Nikaya monksThey always seemed to be faced with obstacles wherever they went and whatever they didHowever they were usually successful in their objectivesHere I would like to quote the fable about the fox and the lambThe fox accused the lamb Hey youWhy have you muddied my drinking water by walking through itThe lamb Please Sir I didnt muddy your water I crossed downstream from youThe fox HuhYou may not have muddied my water but your father certainly caused me a lot of troubleAnd with that he pounced on the lamb and ate it upEvam  The EndAfter the Rains Retreat was over we started building a wooden hut for the abbot but it wasnt completed at that timeThat Chinese New Year Madame Loei Woon the wife of Luang Anuphat Phuketgahn who was proprietor of the Chao Fah Mine invited us to go to PhuketThere were four of us VenMahaa Pin Jalito and myself with two novicesAny suitable opportunity that presented itself was used for searching out and setting up a place for us to stayLeaving VenMahaa Pin Jalito to organize and finish the building work I returned to Koke Kloi where I had spent the previous Rains RetreatWe stayed in Phuket for the Rains RetreatThere were four monks and a novice staying for that Rains Retreat and the monastery was situated at the foot of Dtoh Se Mountain beside the Provincial Town HallAt first our dwellings were made from nipa palm with a tiny room just big enough to set up a krot with its mosquito netThe exception was the abbots hut which was a little biggerThey were situated in a dense area of lalang grass up on the slopes of Dtoh Se Mountain below the Phuket Provincial CourthouseMadame Kae had bought those four rai of land from Nai Borworn the ore dealer for one thousand bahtPreviously it had been a coconut plantation belonging to one of the rich old families but had long since fallen into neglectNai Borworn had then bought it to mine for ore but as he hadnt found anything had sold it to Madame KaeAs the area that Madame Kae bought was too small I arranged for another four rai to be acquired for another four thousand bahtThis was the aforementioned dense tract of lalang grass and it was home to a variety of wild animals including tiger panther stag barking deer wild boar and monkeysWe made little huts in clearings just big enough to sweep around with narrow paths connecting themOne night when I opened my hut to go and meet with the others a tiger noisily jumped away into the forestSometimes while we were sitting together having a hot evening drink we could almost see the perpetrator of the roaring and scratching sound in the nearby treesIn broad daylight the tiger would come and pounce on dogs and cats and eat them upIt was fortunate that it didnt go on the rampage  the tiger kept to its own affairs and we humans did the sameThe people of Phuket could not even identify the typical tigers sounds but I had been much in the jungle and knew all its voicesWe stayed together in Phuket for fifteen years never returning to spend the Rains Retreat in PhangngaHowever the monks of our group throughout the three provinces of Phangnga Phuket and Krabee came under my leadershipWe all lived as one monastic community with the same rules and way of practiceA monk or novice from any of our monasteries who was in need of something essential would receive help from those who had things to share and spareWork at one monastery found everyone else ready and willing to lend a hand in a spirit of harmonyDonations that came to be offered would be collected and assigned for the maintenance of this or that monastery while donations given to individuals would be held in a central fundBeing a Preceptor I put all the donations offered to me personally into the central fund  notwithstanding the objections I received from some quartersWe never worried about not having our own money and the lay supporters conscientiously looked after all our needsWhatever we lacked would be carefully supplied  even train tickets were offered when we had to travelSince my ordination I have never come across such excellent care and attentionI will therefore take this opportunity to thank the people there especially of Phangnga and Phuket for all their help and supportDuring the time I was resident on Phuket Island I was always trying to establish and encourage virtue in both myself and among people in generalI maintained contact with all the local administrative head monks and they always responded with generous support towards our groupAny work or business that arose would often bring them in for mutual consultations and we always understood each other very wellAt the entry to the Rains Retreat I led my group of monks to present each senior elder with offerings of respectThis took place every year without fail and was quite unlike what had happened when we were in PhangngaNews even came from Phangnga that it was only VenMahaa Pin Jalito that they disliked and that they didnt mind our groupI think this arose because of VenMahaa Pin Jalitos brusque and outspoken manner of speaking when his listeners provoked himOne really should not take such people so seriouslyA Northeaster dialect proverb asserts that anyone endorsing such a person wont have a spoon to sip his soupWe tried our best to train the lay devotees so that they would know the customs and traditions of Buddhism making ourselves a model for them to seeWe instructed them about keeping the Uposatha Eight Precepts  not just during the Rains Retreat but outside it tooWe supported and strengthened the grounding that they had received from previous monks and then trained them in developing meditation every nightThe results of this then became clearly visible to each individual depending on the strength of their faith and dedication to the practiceAnother development was the increasing stream of our group of monks from the Northeast coming down to stay with meThe local youths were also regularly finding enough faith to ordainThose people in the South who admired and appreciated the way of practice came to be trained in the Dhammayut Community in greater numbersWe expanded into Krabee Province and with Phang nga and Phuket there were eleven monasteries where we could spend the Rains RetreatAll together this meant that in an average year there would be more than one hundred monks resident in these monasteriesThis was more than the total monks and novices of Muang District in Phuket at that time and twice the number that had been there when I had first arrivedAs our numbers increased I organized the teaching of a regular General Dhamma Studies Course in each monasteryWe would all come together at examination time and the first year we went to Wat Mahathat in Nakorn Seedhammaraht ProvinceIn the following years we asked permission to hold the examinations in Wat Chareon Samanakit in Phuket itselfEach year those who were examined in all three grades never numbered less than sixtyThey passed with good marks tooEventually Mahamakut Monastic College upgraded our status to that of a level two centerI saw the benefit to Buddhisms function in having both study and practice  pariyatti and patipatti  going along togetherThis has been the approach that I have followed up to todayWe stayed there struggling against various obstacles throughout fifteen yearsIt was accomplished for the sake of continuing the Buddhist way for the benefit of both the individual and the community overallIt also fulfilled the wishes of the lay supporters of Phuket and Phangnga who had been so kind and generous to usAt least they were able to become genuinely acquainted with the monks of the Dhammayut Group and the disciples of VenAjahn Mun BhuuridattaIn fact the Dhammayut Group had gone to Phuket many times intent on establishing itself there but it had never been successfulOne doesnt need to ask whether VenAjahn Mun was well known there for even his disciples had never managed to penetrate as far as PhuketOur group had been able to build an established monastery there for the first time in both the history of the Dhammayut Group and of PhuketWe felt proud of our accomplishments there in repaying the debt that we owed to the people of Phuket and Phangnga  who had never made any claims on usMy apprehensions  those that I expressed in Sectionabout the administration of our group  seemed to be coming trueIt concerned my making contact with the senior elders in Bangkok before I had gone south and when on moving south I had become acquainted with all the senior monks on the way to my stay on the island of PhuketPhuket was renowned as a place that brought great wealth to anyone who went to stay thereThey made accusations even against me saying that I was incredibly rich  of course this was completely untrueAlthough I had been in Phuket for fifteen years I didnt have anything because every penny offered to me or to any of the monks went into a central fund that was then all used for buildingBut in any case not many dwelling places were built thereIn the ten years since I came to the Northeast a much greater number have been completed together with an Uposatha Hall and a twostorey study hallI dont mention this matter out of any disdain for the people of Phuket and Phangnga thinking to answer their doubts about my supposed wealthThey had taken such good care of us  as Ive already mentioned they are unequalled anywhere  but the building of monasteries wasnt popular with themIn fact such a view was good in its own way for if a monastery were to be built in an overly grand and luxurious style it would then become a burden and worry when one was awayI departed Phuket Island without any worries although I did sympathize with the villagers there who had looked after us so wellOn departure I left more than one hundred thousand baht for VenPhra Khru Sathidabuññaarakkh who had been building an Uposatha Hall for four or five years and this allowed it to be finished in record timeThe site of this Uposatha Hall was on a mountain slope that had to be levelled firstI dont think that any of the other monks of Phuket and Phangnga could have hoped to have finished such a building within only four or five yearsIt is quite a recordThe senior elders in Bangkok and the lay devotees in general took a much greater interest in us when they saw how our groups were settling on Phuket IslandHowever I remained unmoved by all this extra attentionIve already explained how encountering obstacles had become quite an ordinary event for me because I had to overcome so many beforeAt that time Wat Mahaa Dhaatuyuvaraajarangsarit in Bangkok had begun to popularize the Burmese meditation technique of rising and fallingAlthough they widely publicized their technique they never ventured out into the jungle remaining in the villages and monasteriesMany people made their grade in the technique some of them so much so that they became unaware of how inflexible they wereAt the same time Wat Raajapraditth Wat Bovoranives and other monasteries initiated a groupIt was formed from the disciples of VenAjahn Mun Bhuuridatta TheraThey had been practicing for more than fifty years but had never publicized themselvesWhen one group uses publicity and the other doesnt it follows that both groups will become well knownBecoming well known without a lot of noise happened in this wayIn the Ecclesiastical Regional Governor invited VenAjahn Singh Khantayaagamo to go and teach meditation to the Buddhists of Phetburi ProvinceOn the fifth of December he requested that VenAjahn Singh be given the title of VenPhra Khru aanavisitthHe also asked that a title be given to me but this didnt come about because I wasnt head of a monastery that had been officially recognized by the Sangha ActOn the thirtieth of May they appointed me a Preceptor and simultaneously Ecclesiastical Head Monk of the districts of Phangnga Phuket KrabeeOn the fifth of December I received the title of Phra Khru NirodharangseeOn the sixteenth of June I became the Acting Ecclesiastical Provincial Governor of Phangnga Phuket Krabee ProvincesI also held the office of Director of Dhamma Studies for these three provincesOn the fifth of December I received the title of the ordinary level the insight category of Phra RajanirodharangseekampiirapaññaajarnAt the same time VenAjahn Singh Khantayaagamo received the title Phra aanavisitthsamiddhiviiraajaarn and VenAjahn Lee Dhammadharo was made Phra Suddhidhammarangsiikampira medhaajarnOn the twentieth of August I was made full Ecclesiastical Governor of those three provincesOn the twentyeighth of November I asked to resign from both my administrative governing positions and remained with just an honorary rankThis may have been the first time  except for the Chao Khun Vipassanaa Koson Thera of Wat Phaseechareon  that meditation monks received such royal ecclesiastical rankBefore this there had only been the designation without anybody truly taking it onThis can be seen where important elders names are listed and the appellation araññavaasee is appendedFrom that time onward a steady stream of senior meditation Ajahns of the lineage of VenAjahn Mun were to receive ecclesiastical titlesI would in fact prefer that these titles were not given to our group of meditating monks because they dont seem appropriateI once sent a private letter to the senior elders opposing this practice especially when it concerned the disciples of VenAjahn Mun Bhuuridatta TheraI had also challenged it when I met them face to face and I referred to what I considered was the appropriate way to goI had compared it to hanging jewellery around the neck of a monkey  it wouldnt mean anything to the monkeyStill this is only my personal opinion  although some monkeys decorated in such a way might even suggest that they were humansHowever the final result was that the elders requested that this practice of giving ecclesiastical titles should go forward for the benefit of the administration of the Sangha as a wholeWe have all been born into this vast world with its privileges and freedomsYet whatever our condition or status every one of us is liable to be encircled by the worldlydhammasIt will all depend on whether we are willing to submit to their dominance in our heartWe might also be able to turn the worldlydhammas to some useBefore when the monks or anyone for that matter saw me coming they thought that I was a rustic old monk out of the forestActually I preferred it when people considered me in such a wayYet as soon as I had position and rank I could go anywhere and anyone seeing me would greet me with my title and an invitationContacting people about assistance for some project or other was made even easierThe receiving of such rank and title adds to ones obligations and burden therefore I dont think such honors are at all suitable for those monks who wish for peace and solitude in the forestDuring the first few years on Phuket Island things had gone well and my health had been fairly good but in later years I had become increasingly sensitive to the climateThis followed the normal course of my wanderlust symptoms for wherever I stayed my health wouldnt remain sound for more than three yearsIn my heart I had never intended to stay permanently in Phuket and I had said as much to my fellow monks and the lay people when I had first gone thereStill I ended up staying there for all of fifteen years because of the earnest requests from senior monks and the lay peopleBy it was time to bid a sympathetic farewell to the tearful people of Phangnga PhuketKrabee bequeathing to the Southern people all the various monasteries that we had established through our effort of mind and body and through their contributions and material resourcesI also left them my ecclesiastical titles and honorsMay all the people of the South who were so kind and supportive of us may they all without exception find only happiness and success and be blessed with ever growing station prosperity long life health and complete contentmentMay all the monasteries there develop and grow for the benefit of allLeaving Phuket Island and being freed of all those burdens I was determined to follow my old inclinations towards solitude and peaceWhen visiting VenAjahn Fan in Phannah Nikom District I went on farther to see his monastery in the Khahm CaveI was delighted with it and asked his permission to spend one Rains Retreat thereAlthough the monastery didnt extend over a great area and the mountain wasnt so high the climate and atmosphere were excellentVenAjahn Fan had been conscientious and at the end of each Rains Retreat he had led the villagers in extending the track up the mountain until it had almost reached the topThe villagers actually enjoyed helping with the work and if called by VenAjahn Fan they would drop whatever they were engaged with to go and helpAll feelings of exhaustion from the long climb up to his monastery would disappear with a revitalising rest of five or six minutesThe atmosphere there was such that it more than compensated for the energy expended in climbing upSome homebound people say that Theres no need to go looking for the right place or climate for everything depends on the conditions within oneselfMaking peace and solitude within oneself is all that has to be doneYet this is not true because all four supporting conditions give real energy to the Dhamma practiceUnless we become like the domesticated pig of the village changing our abode means varying the atmosphere and our disposition tooThe domesticated pig and the wild boar are very different animals  even their food and behavior stand out in stark contrastDuring that Rains Retreat I could give full energy to my practice because all the lay devotees and monks had already been well trained by VenAjahn FanI therefore was not hampered by having to train them againSuch a steady and uninterrupted development of the practice allows realizations and strategies directly applicable to oneself to arise in quite wonderful waysI didnt need to sit and close my eyes for meditation was always developing wherever I happened to beWhatever I took up for examination whether it was myself other people or even the landscape and scenery it would all bring Dhamma discernmentPast memories and concerns  whether they were of worldly desires or not  were taken up solely with a view towards developing disenchantment with them allAfter the Rains Retreat VenAjahn Khao led a group of his disciples up to visit us for a timeHe was also pleased with the place and even asked me to take over his monastery at Wat Tam Klong Paen so that he could come and stay there himselfBut I had already unloaded myself of such burdens and didnt want any moreShortly after that I was invited to attend a funeral in Udornthani and so was able to travel on to visit Wat Tam Klong Paen for the first timeHowever I didnt like the air thereI left Udornthani after the ceremony was over and went to stay at Wat Pah Phra Sathit in Srii Chiang Mai District with VenAjahn Booa Pha PaññaabhaasoI then took a boat with VenKam Pan and we went to seek solitude at Hin Mark PengHin Mark Peng was well known among the people of those parts for its extreme coldThey had a saying If you dont have a blanket dont go and sleep at Hin Mark PengIts the coldest spot in all that region during the Cool SeasonIt was a place haunted by fierce spirits and wild animals such as tigers and bearsAbout forty years previously anyone passing by boat would remain deadly silent and not even dare look upFears like this led it to become a place of isolation and solitude without anyone daring to go nearSuch isolation always attracted forest meditation monks so that they could put the quality of their renunciation to the testAny forest monk able to stay there considered it a sign of the steadfastness and confidence of his practice while his Dhamma companions saw him as truly courageous in renunciationIt also became a place of significance for the law enforcement officersAs the surrounding population started to expand the wild animals were forced out and gradually disappearedSmugglers and cattle rustlers then used it as a place for sending contraband across the riverWhenever any water buffalo or cattle went missing or if news came of smuggling activities government officers and those who had lost their things would gather there to wait in ambush to recover their property and catch the culpritsEventually such a bad reputation also tarnished the neighbouring villages of Koke Sooak Phra Baht and Hooay HatWhenever the old people who were custodians of the local history got together they would always tend to tell about the future of Hin Mark Peng Kings from three cities would come to develop a flourishing Hin Mark PengThis arose because of those three great rocks lined up together on the bank of the Mekong RiverThe northern rock would belong to Luang Phra Bahng the middle rock to Bangkok and the southern rock to VientianeListening to this made me laugh for whoever would come and build anything worthwhile in such a placeThe jungle there was impenetrableIt was home to wild animals that were still to be found there more than forty years later  towards the end of  when I first came to check out the placeI both saw and heard the barking deer and partridges while to my delight overgrown monkeys appeared leaping from branch to branchThis kind of air and landscape were rare so I was delighted to have discovered such a placeI therefore resolved to come with VenKum Pan and spend the Rains Retreat thereI thought that I would be able to cease all building work and avoid taking on any further commitmentsOther people might equate that with confused thinking but in my heart I truly knew my position I had already accomplished much building workI had not inconsiderably ministered to the group of monks and lay devoteesIn the future it was better that I cease with all that and focus all my efforts on the practice  readying myself for deathI had reached an age when one couldnt be sure when death would comeI therefore spoke with VenKum Pan about staying with him and taking a restful breakThis meant all construction work and such things would be left totally to him although I would be happy to advise on Dhamma practiceHe not only agreed but was happy with this arrangementHe said that finding the material resources to start building was beyond his ability but that if funds became available he would accept all responsibilitiesI told him that something might possibly turn up however I would not go out looking for anythingWe would accept anything offered and if no one brought things well that was all right tooAfter the Rains Retreat Nahng Dtim in Vientiane Por Lee Maer Pao of Koke Sooak Village with Nai Prasopphon Khun Nitisahn and relatives resolved to come and build us each a hutEach hut cost about five thousand bahtNahng Nuay built one kuti in memory of Nahng Boowa thaew Malaikong at a cost of ten thousand bahtIn lay people from Bangkok came to visit by boatThe location and surroundings so impressed them that they helped to raise funds to renovate and to build a large wooden Study SalaIt was built in the Thai style with two floors the lower storey having a veranda on three sides surfaced with concreteThe area of the top floor was seventeen metres by eleven metres while that of the ground floor was nineteen and a half by sixteen metresIt was all finished on the twentieth of July at a cost of more than eighty thousand bahtThe actual labor came mostly from the monks and novices themselvesVenKum Pan was suffering from some eye disease and left for treatment and never returnedIn the same year the Bangkok devotees sponsored the building of two more huts while Nai Sakchai and his relatives from Pangkhone market of Pangkhone District in Sakhon Nakorn Province offered anotherEach cost about seven thousand baht while monastery funds were used to build another four toiletsIn a reinforced concrete rain water storage tank was built behind the Study SalaIt was eleven metres by three metres with a depth of a hundred and eighty centimetresIt cost fifteen thousand bahtIn a twostorey kuti was built on the bank of the Mekong River another hut was built In a hut was built and when a storm blew a tree down onto the western veranda of the large Study Sala the authorities repaired this at a cost of twenty thousand bahtThis year also saw the building of a reinforced concrete rain water tank in the nuns quarters with dimensions of three by six by two metres another reinforced concrete rain water tank of similar dimensions and the area in front of the large study hall was paved After the Rains Retreat thirty student monks from Korat came to receive meditation training for five daysIn another hut was built together with another six toilets for the nuns quarters and two more for visitors and a place for visitors to stay also a reinforced concrete rain water tank in front of the Uposatha Hall costing thirty thousand bahtThese projects were all sponsored through the monasterys fundsI fell ill around the fifth of July just before the entry to the Rains RetreatAt first it was influenza with a bronchial infection  to which I am susceptibleThey sent for the doctor at the local tobacco estate but I did not improveDrTawinsree Amornkraisarakit  lady doctor and assistant director of the Nongkhai Provincial Hospital  with Khun Tawan the provincial economics officer brought a car to take me for treatment in Nongkhai Provincial HospitalThe doctor treated me for five days but my condition didnt improveAn xray showed lung congestion pleurisy and pneumonia with an area of infectionKhun Dtoo Khovinta therefore sent a telegram about the situation to ProfUdom Posakrisna in BangkokWhen ProfUdom learned about this he invited me to go to Bangkok where he would await me at Siriraj HospitalThe lack of specialist care and equipment in Nongkhai required my traveling to BangkokThao Kae Kim Kai and DrSomsak the director of Nongkhai Provincial Hospital put me on the plane so that they could take me to Siriraj HospitalI was a patient there under the specialist care of ProfUdom with DrThira Limsila in regular attendance on meI received excellent care and attention from all the doctorsThey used suction to bring up a large amount of fluid from the lungs and during the first week my condition steadily improvedBy the second week however I was beginning to have allergic reactions to the drugs and then other complications set inPerhaps this had something to do with an idiosyncratic unease when staying in large buildingsAs my hospitalization extended so my condition deteriorated until my breathing became quite shallow and my voice was reduced to an almost inaudible whisperThe doctors would draw a lot of fluid from my lungs and the condition would ease a little bit but my general feeling of weakness did not improveI therefore asked the doctors to allow me to leave the hospital but they requested that I stay longerI was not able to do this and so asked to be discharged from the hospital on the fifteen of AugustThis was the period when I became disenchanted with and saw the irksomeness of the body This lump of a body that had brought illness and trouble to me and othersOf what use was the tiny amount of food all that I was able to swallow each dayBetter not to eat at all todayI told MrsKantharat Sapying who brought me food every day please not to bring the food in for I had decided not to eat anymoreShe wept and went to find DrChavadee RattapongDrChavadee sent for DrRote Suwanasutth because ProfUdoms duties had taken him out to the provincesI explained to the doctor about my condition and how I didnt feel well in such large buildingsDrRote therefore gave me permission to leave and arranged a car to take me to stay at MrsKantharats house for three daysBefore I left DrBanyat Paritnyanon came to examine me and gave some advice on my treatmentDrRote and DrChavadee kept in close contact bringing me medicine every day and my condition gradually improvedExamining within myself I realized that I wasnt going to die quite yet  although to other people it might have appeared otherwiseSome fortune tellers were even predicting that I would certainly die within five daysWhen ProfOuay Ketusingh came to visit me I asked his opinion about returning to my monasteryHe answered by saying the quicker I could return the betterThis was a pleasant surprise since I had already resolved that if I were going to die it would be better and more fitting for me as a true monk to die in the monasteryThao Kae Kim Kai hired a special plane to take me back and it filled up with the monks and lay devotees helping to see me on my wayWe arrived at the air field in Nongkhai at almost middayThe Mekong River had just burst its banks and because of the flooding we had to request help from the NPKwho were kind enough to lend us a boat from Kong Nang VillageThis took us to Wat Hin Mark Peng where we arrived at five oclock in the eveningDrChavadee had accompanied me and taken care of me all the way back to the monastery and then stayed on to treat me for another five or six daysWhen she saw that I was out of danger and improving she traveled back to BangkokWhile I was ill whether in Nongkhai Provincial Hospital or in Siriraj Hospital many monks novices and lay people  some known to me and some unknown  had come together to show me extraordinary care and concernThis was evident from the throngs that came to visit me every day while I was in Nongkhai Provincial HospitalEven more so in Siriraj Hospital where such great numbers came that the doctors had to forbid visitingSome people who came to visit were not allowed to see me so they asked instead to be allowed to bow their respects from outside my roomThis was amazingSo many people came to visit when I was ill and yet I hardly knew anyone in BangkokSome people who had never seen me before would come in and then burst into tears even before they had time to bow their respectsI would therefore like to record here the good will shown by everyone  my appreciation for everyones kindness will always remain with meThis applies especially to those people who came to visit and help care for me in Wat Hin Mark PengSome came back repeatedly even though traveling conditions during that time had become so difficult because of the floodingIt meant journeying by longtailed boat because all the road links were cutThis could sometimes take three or four hours so it really does deserve the utmost appreciationAs soon as I was back in the monastery my general condition began steadily to improveI had eminent and respected visitors come to call on meMy Rains Retreat however was curtailed because I had not returned in timeMy illness at that time brought great benefit to my meditation practiceWhen I arrived at Nongkhai Provincial Hospital my condition was deteriorating so much that I had immediately set about preparing myself for deathI had resolved to let go not grasping at anythingI had instructed myself You must leave your body and disease in the doctors handsReady yourself for death concentrate your heart establish potent mindfulness and investigate your heart to purify it completelyAfter that my mind was calm and peaceful without any disturbancesWhen the doctors had come along and asked how I felt I would answer that I was just fineThao Kae Kim Kai had come and carried me off by plane to Bangkok and I went along with itI even went as far as Siriraj Hospital where the doctors had asked about my condition and I had again said that I was as good as everHowever onlookers might have thought the oppositeMy extended stay in the hospital had its effect when I had started to find it tiresome and the days and nights seemed to lengthenI therefore needed to bring back to mind my original resolution about not holding back but being willing to let go of everything Ive already relinquished all that havent IWhy then am I involving myself in that sort of thingIts all their affairIt has to follow its own course and scheduleMy dying though is not involved with all thatWe each must do our separate duties as best we canMy resolution towards letting go then settled down in the stillness of the presentmoment Dhamma until there was no feeling of what was day and what was night timeThere was only the brightness of the stilled heart one with itselfWhen I later came to examine the state of my body and mind I realized that it wasnt yet time for them to disintegrate and pass awayNevertheless if I were to stay in the hospital there would be continual encounters with external sense impressions and their defusing would demand the constant attention of my concentration and wisdomNo wayBetter that I go back and fight them on my own battle ground That was why I had returned to the monastery as I have described aboveThe year saw the start of the construction of the Uposatha HallI will give a more detailed account of this in a future sectionAt the same time we also built a meeting sala for the nunsIt was a wooden twostorey structure with concrete posts and an asbestos roof four metres by nine with a four meter wide veranda on the ground floor going all the way around It cost a little over seventy thousand bahtI had helped to relocate the old school of Koke Sooak and Phra Bart villages so that it could be connected up to the rear of the new buildingThis new structure had concrete posts and four class roomsIt cost eighty thousand baht but hadnt been fully completed through lack of fundsIn I was able to continue the work by joining up the old and new buildings and partitioning off an office for the head teacherUnderneath I made a reinforced concrete rain water tank of seven by six by two metresAt the time we were moving the school I also went to set up another dwelling place for monks in the Wang Nam Mork ForestThis was about six kilometres to the west of Wat Hin Mark Peng and still had jungle with mountains caves and streamsIt was therefore ideal for anyone intent on developing their meditation in solitude and its natural environment was also well worth preservingA lay person gave about three rai of land in Lumpini DistrictWhen other donations increased the area to eleven or twelve rai another place for solitude and practice could be set upWat Lumpini was the equal of Wang Nam Mork  that I had just established  because streams skirted it on all four sidesIt was aimed at those who wished for more solitude as Wat Hin Mark Peng was becoming less peacefulFrom about there seems to have been a steadily growing interest among the people of Bangkok and Central Thailand in making contact with the various monasteries in the NortheastWat Hin Mark Peng also became more involved in receiving visitors from BangkokIn Somdet Phra aanasangworn the present Supreme Patriarch of Thailand was supporting the scheme of sending the foreign monks who had been ordained at Wat Bovoranives to study Dhamma in many different parts of Thailand and many came here to stay for the Rains RetreatThey were all well committed to the practiceMy trip to foreign lands this time received support and assistance from many parties who were concerned with teaching Dhamma abroadBesides I wanted to go and visit both the Thai and foreign monks living over thereThey had gone to spread the Dhamma and I wanted to hearten and encourage themIt struck me as amusing that although I was old and had recently been readying myself for death I found myself preparing to go abroadMoreover I didnt even know their languageIn fact this trip wasnt completely satisfactory for me as I always bear three things in mindIf one wants to go to any particular place or region One should know their languageOne should know their customs and traditionsOne should know about their livelihoodThis is all concerned with proper social discourse and communication with peopleHowever the lack of language alone makes the other two points almost mootNotwithstanding this I still received ample help with interpretation and liaison from those who were knowledgeable about such thingsThis gave me such good understanding that the language barriers fell away and almost ceased to be a problemI well knew that I was already very old already advanced in yearsGoing here and there no longer held any appeal for me  I had already traveled around quite widely  and finding a place to die like Wat Hin Mark Peng seemed ideal indeedThen Maer Chee Chuang   invited me to visit Singapore Australia and IndonesiaShe felt with my old age and the constant stream of visitors coming to see me in the monastery that I didnt have enough time to restFurthermore most of my visitors only seemed interested in asking for lottery numbersIf I were to go away it might give me some time to restI gave this some consideration and came to the conclusion that besides the problems with my language deficiency my strange face might provoke the curiosity of the crowds over thereWhat sort of rest would that beOf more important was that I should clearly consider all possible contingenciesI was elderly and had come to be considered quite a popular figure so that any mishap or my illness or death might cause difficulties for other peopleThis would especially bring criticism down on the one who had made the original invitation that they had taken me away but not looked after meEven so she kept up with her efforts aimed at inviting meThese were bolstered when her elder brother  who helped lead the Buddhist Society in Perth Western Australia  sent a letter inviting me to go and visit the Buddhists thereAfter due consideration I came to the conclusion that this time there were three good reasons to accept the invitationThe first reason concerned the lack of senior monks in Indonesia which with a population of more than a hundred and thirty million had ten million Buddhists living among Muslims and HindusWhen someone mentioned this to me it made me feel really compassionate towards them allI was also delighted to learn that they liked to meditateThe second reason arose because of the many monks from Indonesia and Australia who had come to ordain with Somdet Phra aanasangworn  the present Supreme Patriarch of Thailand  in Wat BovoranivesBefore the beginning of that years Rains Retreat the Englishborn VenDorn had taken tapes of my Dhamma talks and photographs to show in AustraliaOnce he knew that I was going with a party to Australia his preparations to receive us caused some people to become quite excited at the prospectThere was also a senior Thai monk VenPhra Bunyarit Pandito already living and teaching thereThis monk had done much to propagate Buddhism in Australia and had inspired many to come and ordain in ThailandThe third reason came from my reflection that in the future Buddhism would be spreading to many other countriesIt might come to be disseminated following the Christian missionizing model where Thai monks might go out and only spread the superficialities of BuddhismWhereas if individuals from the country concerned came to be ordained they could be trained truly to penetrate to the inner core of BuddhismThey could then spread the genuine Teaching themselves for thats the only way to penetrate to the essentialOne Indonesian monk VenSudhammo who had been ordained at Wat Bovoranives under Somdet Phra aanasangworn had then come to spend the preceding Rains Retreat at Wat Hin Mark PengHe was exactly the sort of monk who would be able to spread Buddhism  and he was in Indonesia awaiting my visit thereAfter considering all three reasons for going I made up my mind In whatever way I can may the remainder of this life be dedicated to the advancement of BuddhismThis decision allowed me increasingly to see the possible value of my life and caused me to give up personal comfort for BuddhismI had in fact previously received invitations from various individuals and groups in Bangkok to make a pilgrimage to the Buddhist holy places in IndiaThey offered to look after me and take care of my needs in every way but I had never acceptedTo find the inspiration to go I had often tried to imagine what such a trip would be like but my heart always remained indifferent to the ideaI reflected that India had been the birth place of Buddhism and that although I may have missed the chance to be born in time to meet the Lord Buddha and the age when Buddhism was flourishing the Holy Places were still thereI should therefore go and pay my respects so that I could gain inspiration understanding and empathy  yet my heart remained indifferent to the ideaPerhaps this apathy arose from a previous birth as I might have been born as a Buddhist monk in India when the Hindus were suppressing the monks and the holy placesPerhaps this had been so traumatic an experience that it was deterring me from going to India in this lifeWhoever has the faith and opportunity to go on pilgrimage to the Four Holy Places will gain great meritThe Lord Buddha spoke about this to Venerable Ananda These four holy places will be a great source of merit for people after I have finally passed awayI lack the merit to go there so I can only esteem and commend themAnyhow I would like to take this opportunity to remark how indebted I feel towards the people of India because their soil was the birth place of BuddhismBefore setting out for foreign lands I went to stay at Air Force LtGeneral Payom Yensootjais garden abode for monks in Dorn MuangEvery night more and more people were attracted to come and listen to Dhamma and sit in meditationI feel that the present day citizens of Bangkok City of Angels are more aware of their situation Though born in a heavenly city as the worldly description has it we remain very much human beings struggling and stuck in the rat race  the common lot of human beings everywhereSo perhaps we will want to transform ourselves into true spiritual beings knowing that angels born in heaven dont have the same opportunity for skillful and generous actions as we do in this human realmWhen such angels have exhausted their store of merit made in their previous human life times they return to birth in the human realmSometimes even this is not certain and they may be born in the lower realmsIt is different for the Noble Disciple  for instance the streamenterer  who after death is assured of not being born into any woeful existenceI am just an old monk and I was born in a place with inadequate educational opportunitiesOn occasion they have invited me to give Dhamma instruction to highly educated people and at first I felt quite reticent and embarrassed about itThis does however fit in with the Buddhist principles of not discriminating because of caste or classAssessment should be based on right knowledge and good conductWhen a knowledgeable person turns to evil ways he or she is liable to cause more strife and trouble to the country than the uninformed person who does the same thingAn ignoramus who doesnt do evil is better than a learned man who uses his knowledge for evil meansPeople may have only limited knowledge but if they employ it in trying to develop goodness it will bring advancement to all  from the immediate group right through to the national levelSuch considerations gave me more selfconfidence about teaching knowing that the more educated my listeners the easier they should be able to understandThe Lord Buddhas Dhamma Teaching points towards knowing the nature of things and this can fit in with the latest ideas of scienceGood scholars should only explore and enquire for knowledge that is concerned with weighty significant issues that may lead to the enrichment of peoples livesThey shouldnt be aiming for knowledge to increase their social position or statusFor instance teachers nowadays can educate their pupils to high levels so that they in turn may take that knowledge and teach other teachersOn the other hand there are bad pupils who spotting the teachers trifling mistake or having a difference of opinions with them work to have their teacher dismissedThey use their teachers services and then plot together to force him or her out and even think it an honorable and admirable thing to have doneThis then becomes an era for the development of corruption and wickedness and that can only lead to declineOur party included VenSteven VenChai Charn DrChavadee and Maer Chee ChuangWe set out from Bangkok on the seventh of November reaching Singapore the same day where a welcoming party of devotees received us and showed us all of the citySingapore is a small islandIt is only thirty kilometres long by twentyfive kilometres wide and with slightly more than three million people on the main and smaller surrounding islands it is densely populatedThey have therefore built blocks of flats of ten twenty or more floors to utilize all available spaceSeeing all these highrise apartment buildings we might imagine all Singaporeans to be rich but in truth they are just the same as in any other country of the worldThere are quite ordinary houses with tin roofs or even thatch just as there are in our villagesAs long as all human beings have defilements of greed aversion and delusion every sort of contrast and variety will continue to existAlthough each countrys government aims and strives to attain equality achieving it must remain impossibleI dont know of a single country that has been successfulRegimes that employ communist ideology give out propaganda that all their citizens are prosperous trouble free and equalWhy then should their people try to sneak away and escape from such a so called promised landWhyBecause our human defilements are too deeply entrenchedThe Lord Buddha continually taught about this saying that one should have sympathy and pity for ones fellow creatures always wishing them well through mutual harmonyEveryone wishes thisYet when one comes to act on the principle the defilements insidiously veil and cover it up so that one forgets and falls once again for the old delusionsSingapore had wide roads sufficient for its traffic needs and their drivers kept to the highway code  they didnt drive in a selfish wayThere were no traffic policemen at the crossroad and intersections with traffic lights standing in their placeThe roads were swept clean few people were milling about and the shops had plate glass frontages to keep out the dustBesides the tall blocks of flats the ordinary houses were also all set out in a very orderly pleasing fashionBetween the houses and along the roadsides were shady trees  all very pleasant and worth seeingWhen there was sufficient space between houses  whether it was in the central or outer suburbs  they planted it as a public park sometimes big and sometimes small where people could go to sit and relaxThe beaches were planted with trees and provided with proper car parkingThey liked to plant beautiful varieties of flowers all over the placeTheir soil was good and their climate was blessed with frequent rain that kept their flowers and bushes always green and flourishingAlthough Singapore might be a small heavily populated island dont imagine that it lacks jungleThere were conservation areas even in the midst of the city for an awareness of their scarce resources made them take especially good care of such thingsSingapore seemed higher above sea level than Bangkok and therefore didnt flood so easily and could be more easily kept cleanThe inhabitants also conscientiously upheld the laws and regulationsWhatever the outer circumstances we shouldnt lose sight of our conditionOur birth was messy and then we continually associate with both external and internal impuritiesWe bathe and shower and in no time are dirty againThis only concludes with the corruption and putrefaction of deathIf these are the underlying conditions where can we find a place that is cleanIt is only possible when all the individuals of a group come together in mutual understanding about the truthThey can then help each other  according to their various responsibilities  to uphold the cleanlinessHow can we each safeguard this inner cleanlinessWell we can start by watching over and securing the cleanliness in what is around usFor any society to prosper and flourish it requires these four conditionsThe land and terrain are favorable to the people living thereThe leaders and government who lay down the laws are just being neither too slack nor too oppressive towards the populaceAll the populace helps in keeping and respecting the laws of the landThe bureaucrats and officials are just and honestA society enjoying all four conditions will have full prosperityA deficiency in one of them means that any prosperity will remain incompleteIts out of the question that Bangkok can be made as clean as Singapore because its location is not favorableIt is sinking below sea level  so dont let anyone pretend they can fix Bangkoks problems as is vacuously claimed in the newspapersThe best way is that we uphold purity in our own lives and responsibilitiesPlease dont be so negligent and selfish about your affairsHurling abuse at each other over trivial mistakes tarnishes ones behavior and manners forfeiting all culture and refinement as if one were a completely ignorant personI taught Dhamma and meditation every night of the ten nights that our party remained in SingaporeThe meetings would not last more than three hours with each night between twenty and thirty Singaporeans coming for trainingThis teaching of Dhamma was really nothing more than a pointing out of the afflictions and flaws of the worldly lifeAnyone capable of seeing the harmful nature of the world can also see Dhamma because the world and Dhamma are interrelated and interconnectedWhenever I explained Dhamma the problems of the world always became highlighted on every sideThese problems are the same the world over and can be summarized into three issuesProblems concerning family and livelihoodProblems about looking for inspirationProblems about overcoming and transcending sufferingIts not surprising that problems of this first category should ariseWhen there is a world there must also be worldshattering problemsIf we fasten something ourselves we must also be able to untie itWho else can do itUnless that is someone could help by explaining the means of disentanglementThe fish hooks itself because it mistakes the anglers camouflaged baitIt hungrily snaps it up but when the hook catches there is no more eating only pain and sufferingThis is how desire leads to sufferingI offer you this consideration Make do withoutOnce the hook catches the more we struggle the more we intensify the painWe then become full of remorse and feel sorry for ourselves because of what we are sufferingYet it all originated in our own fatal errorAll we can do is wait for the lucky fisherman to take us away for his evening mealWith the second issue as long as we still have hopes and dreams we will have to struggle all the way until every exit has been tried and failedThe manner of the untrained heart is like that of a newly caught wild animalHowever much it might stamp and paw the ground provided that its bindings remain firm and unbroken it will eventually tire and become still knowing when it is beatenWe human beings are much the sameWhen our wishes dont find fulfillment in the object of affection our hearts contentment is stilledThat is how one knows where ones heart is going for refugeIt is going out to find pleasure in external objects that are only able to provide a superficial false sort of happinessTrue happiness is that of the quiet and serene mind without struggleThis will be the experience of anyone who discovers the point of true happinessTheir heart will continue to abide in happiness irrespective of their posture or activityAlthough anyone lacking such realization wont be able to appreciate such a possibility  it will be totally beyond their comprehensionConcerning the third issue I taught them to review and go over the first two points until they perceived that apart from the stilled heart every other kind of happiness was temporary and falseI then instructed them to be diligent in cultivating and developing that happiness and to continue their analysis until they became skilledWhen adept they would be able to abide as their heart wished whatever conditions they were subjected to for with this accomplishment one may abide in freedom either in happiness or painFrom what I heard from the Singaporeans it seems that they are blessed with virtuous views and opinionsThey realized the peril of birth in this world seeing that this existence is unauthentic and full of deceptionI had no idea that the people of Singapore would be so knowledgeable about the basic principles of the Lord Buddhas Teaching When they received the genuine Buddhist Teaching all their previous beliefs seemed to disappear so that only the essential Dhamma Truth prevailedIt was admirable how they showed their joy and firm conviction in their understanding of DhammaAmazingly some people seemed instinctively to be keeping the Five Precepts and practicing samadhi meditation so that insightknowledge could arise about themselves and othersWe flew out of Singapore for Australia on the seventeenth of NovemberOur point of entry was Perth and after stopping over there we carried on to Melbourne Sydney and CanberraThese were all big cities where there was much interest in BuddhismIf there was a local Buddhist society they would invite me to teach DhammaWhether they were Thai Lao Burmese Sri Lankan or Caucasian they all gave me an outstanding welcomeAll in our party wish to express our great appreciation for this helpWhile I was in Perth a swami came to visitBy a swami I mean one ordained in Hinduism who wears robes in color and shape similar to a Tibetan monkHe described himself as a Hindu LamaHinduism has many sects with many deities  it allows one to worship any of them provided its remembered that they all originate from one deityThis swami had already been ordained for fortyfive years and was seventysix years oldHe was already waiting for me in the reception room and when he saw me he immediately raised his palms together in añjali and gave a friendly welcomeI reciprocated with words of greeting and we established a friendly rapport so that I could ask about his religion and its particular way of practiceHe said that he was a head swamilama who taught Hinduism and that his family was HinduHe was a devout and dedicated Hindu who had ordained while still a youngster and had once gone to find the Mahayana monks in TibetAnother swami came but he was an ordinary lay person and unlike the first one wasnt ordainedHe was eightyone years old but his whole appearance was delightful  his complexion and constant smile made him look more like a sixtyoneyearoldHe was already waiting for me and when I came in he lifted his hands in añjali as the first swami had doneHe told me that as soon as he saw me he felt great lovingkindness for meAfter words of welcome I first asked about his religion just as I had done with the first swamiI begged his pardon before making my enquiries but he said there was no need because our dhammas were equivalentHe said that he didnt adhere to any religion because This world only has one deityThe Teachings of every religion derive from the one deity   and when ones action was right and good then one touched the original deityHe told me that he had studied yoga in India with six different teachers and that they had taught him many techniquesSome examples he gave were the yoga postures fasting and controlling the breathingHe possessed great knowledge and ability concerning Hinduism and had given up everything  he had no familyThis was why the Hindu devotees referred to him as swamiOur discussions together were harmonious and wellreceived by all  VenSteven acted as interpreter  and as they were about to depart they asked permission to bow at my feet for their blessing and good fortuneThis caused me some embarrassment because they themselves were so aged worthy and virtuousI therefore told them there was no need to bow for our dhammas being equal was already blessing enoughAs they left they kept turning around to face me and making añjali repeatedly clearly showing their respectAlthough one swami was ordained and the other wasnt they explained their path to the deity in the same way for they were both HindusI had asked them about their techniques for reaching the deity and their response had been the sameThe first swami told me about slowly repeating the mantra word Om two or three times and evoking the deity in the heartHe said By the heart recollecting the deity it would manifest as different images in the heartThe deity would then teach knowledge about right and wrong doing good and spurning evil sometimes there would be only a voice rather than an imageThe deity would then disappear leaving a state of emptiness and this is reaching the Lord NirandornThe second unordained swami explained in much the same way but he didnt refer to a mantraPerhaps this was a secret of his sect that he didnt want to revealHowever I do think he used a mantra in the same way as the first because they were of the same sectHe simply said that when one reached the deity it might manifest as various images or as a voice that would teach oneHe did not speak about the emptiness that remained after such visions and voices had disappeared about having reached the Lord NirandornThose of you who are engaged with all the religions are you finding this absorbing and enjoyableWhat do I meanWell I will try to explain and ask your indulgence for my ideas because I have never had opportunity to research the scriptures of any religion other than BuddhismThey say that one needs a firm faith that the deity exists although they cannot see the deitys bodyAfter putting faith in the deity one opens up to or one inclines the heart to rest in the deity at which point the deity manifests for one to seeIt is similar to this in Mahayana BuddhismIn Theravaada or Hinayaana Buddhism the Lord Buddha does have a body which is that of Prince Siddhattha of the SakyansHe went forth into the homeless life and with great exertion comprehensively cleansed all impurities and defilements from the heartHe realized Buddhahood through perfecting all the Dhamma virtuesHowever it was not merely the body of Phra Siddhattha that became the Lord BuddhaWhen one has faith and trust in the virtuous qualities of the Lord Buddha one can receive them into the heart or incline ones heart out to rest in those wholesome qualities until it becomes fully and firmly established in onepointednessVarious images or sounds can arise in such a state and according to the creed of the formless deity this state would be one with the deity and it would manifest to teach oneThe Buddhist Teaching would maintain that such manifestations were images or visions  nimitta  arising out of meditation and the sounds would be the clarifying voice of DhammaDhamma  being itself without form  would need to manifest in this way to accommodate to people with bodiesIn summary every religion or sect teaches its adherents to abandon evil and do good to receive the virtuous qualities of its deity into their heart or to give their heart to the deityThe way to reach the deity is the same for each religionHowever when a particular religions devotees dont understand the truth mistaken assumptions can ariseThey may think that because another religion practices in a different way it is wrong and that only their way is correctThey propagandize and criticize and stir things up so that they can become preeminent with an increasing number of adherentsThis is not what a Good Teacher with Dhamma would have taught and sages would view such ideas with a dubious eyeThose who practice should find this relationship  between meditative visions and coming in touch with the deity  as something worth investigatingDuring my trip to Australia I was not only able to teach Dhamma to anyone interested but could also exchange views with other monksThis was especially so with VenMahaa Samai who had been sent out by Mahamakut Monastic College to take up residence at Wat Buddharangsee in SydneyAlthough VenMahaa Samai was originally from Champahsak in Laos he had gone to stay at Wat Sapatoom in Bangkok while still a boyHe had received novice and bhikkhu ordination and passed his grade five Pali examinations from Mahamakut Monastic College Wat BovoranivesIn he went to teach general studies for a year in Wat Bodhisomphorn Udornthani and then volunteered to go and spread Dhamma in AustraliaHe had been there for two years  being part of the second party that followed after VenChao Khun Pariyat  and was the first monk to stay at the new Wat BuddharangseeAt the time of writing he has been a monk for thirteen years and is a courteous model monk worthy of respectVenMahaa Samai could be considered a representative of the Thai Sangha who wished to spread Buddhism to Australasia for no Theravada monks had ever been resident there beforeThe local people were basically Christian and this was to be the first Theravada monastery with monksPeople today all over the world are better educated especially about a science that is based on investigating the actual truth of thingsChristianity teaches reliance on faith and disallows critical analysis of the teachings of ones faithThis conflicts with modern scientific principles and a pope once even punished someone whose calculations pointed to a spherical world systemFinally however everyone  including the later popes  has accepted and used that theory right up to todayBuddhist Teaching gives complete freedom to investigate anything  even the Buddhist Teachings themselvesThis is because the principles on which Buddhism is based are far higher than those of scienceIt doesnt just examine and analyze material things but is able to detect the underlying truth of mental phenomenaAfter penetrating through with insight the realized truth is used solely for the peace and benefit of oneself and others without causing harm to anyoneSome people can apply it so that they are able to go beyond the world  for example the Lord Buddha and the arahantsIts such a pity that although modern people receive a superior education most of them consider just finishing their course work and securing a degree to be enoughIt may not have even crossed the minds of some people that the text books that formed the basis of their course had originated in someone elses understanding  which contained more than they were able to read in their booksTheir learning is not something original to their own understanding because true knowledge can only come through individual experienceThe Buddhist Teaching calls this paccattam  clearly seeing or knowing for oneself  and it arises from the strength of the cultivated mind that has attained to stillness and calm bringing insight and selftransformationThis is a genuine change from ones old nature to the true condition that is in line with the Buddhist Noble TruthsAnyone aiming for clear insight into the truth of Buddhism needs to combine learning with practiceOne or another alone is not enoughIn this time of advanced education it becomes necessary for anyone propagating Buddhism to have trained themselves in both waysAny deficiency in this and the results will not be as good as might have been expectedMy further advice to VenMahaa Samai was that he should propagate the whole packageBy this I mean that besides fully keeping the Patimokkha Rule  the small size of the group precluded study classes  the other duties and practices should be maintainedFor instance the dhutanga practices  these include the going out on alms round which should also help reduce kitchen expendituresThe spreading of Buddhism needs study together with practice so that it can put down roots that will endureVenMahaa Samai and all the monks agreed with all my advice and decided to carry out such a plan in the futureI suggested to VenMahaa Samai that there are three criticisms that are most common concerning the spreading of Buddhism in other countriesTheravada Sect monks unlike the other religions and sects being selfish and only concerned about themselves without helping others in need or distressTheravada monks who though they forbid the killing of animals still eat meatAnyone going out to spread Buddhism will be certain to encounter these criticisms so I advised VenMahaa Samai to prepare suitable replies and explanationsHe could then answer instantly any of these criticismsAn even more dangerous hazard is that those who go to spread Buddhism are unfamiliar with the local ways and customsThis may cause offence during interactions with the local residents and can lead to discouragement and disillusionment or it may cause one to forget oneself and be lured away to join in the fun of going nativeAs we all know the history of Australia describes how it had been a wild place with its peoples undeveloped and how Britain had got rid of its convicts and gangsters by transporting them there eventually the new people organized themselves and energetically developed agriculture and then supplied raw materials to the expanding industries of the world until its present prosperity was established Australia is endowed with many natural mineral resources and an enormous land area although its population is only thirteen million They dont just sit back enjoying their prosperity but try to develop it even furtherLets turn to have a close look at this Thai City of Angels of oursIf we go into town we cannot see a single angel for its streets are crowded with loafers and layaboutsPeople havent developed nor do they know what that meansThey mistakenly think that when something is finished there will be no need for any more work in the futureChildren are delighted when they become teenagersIts only when they become old that they realize it was just a stage on the way to old ageMaterials have to be removed and lost from somewhere in order for them to be brought to construct the wellplanned and attractive city with its traffic systemIt just shows how they take things from here to improve things over thereWe come to growth because of food and yet that involves destroying the lives of other animals and cropsGoing along our way we are only concerned with getting to our destination and have no thought that the base and origin from which we set forth is being left far behind step following stepDont just look ahead with your frontfacing eyes but also use wisdom to check behindThe truth that will free us from careless delusions and bring us to the Noble Truths of the Lord Buddhas Teachings can then be seenFrom Australia we went back to Singapore and on the twentyfourth of December continued on to IndonesiaAll the people I knew seemed to be there  VenChao Khun Suviirañaan VenPhra Khru Dhammadhornsombat VenSudhammo VenAggapaalo and VenKhemiyoThey all had gathered to await me at Jakarta airport with members of the local Buddhist SocietyI had the opportunity to visit other places besides Jakarta for example Bandung Jogjakarta Mendut Samarang Surabaya and BaliI visited Buddhist Societies and the Buddhist monasteries that our Dhammaduuta monks coming from Thailand to spread Buddhism had establishedVenChao Khun Vidhoondhammaaporn was the head of the organization that had built monasteries that included Wat Majjhimasaasanawong that adjoined the Mendut Chedi Wat Dhammapadiipaaraam in Badoo Malang and SurabayaI viewed each site with delight and noted that the local Buddhists women and men young and old would without fail come every evening to chant their devotionsAfterwards there would be a sermon from a monk who would then lead them in meditationGoing around Indonesia I saw venerable sites and objects that had the features of a syncretic religionI couldnt help but feel saddened by this and reflect on the situation in ThailandWho can deny the great value of memorials and venerable sites  one only has to look at IndonesiaAll the monks and scriptures have disappeared we cannot even say when it happened but anyhow their sacred sites remain for the minority BuddhistsMy thoughts went back to Thailand with its immense wealth of religious objects and sacred Buddhist sites more numerous even than in IndonesiaHowever many immense and amazing monuments Indonesia may have they cant compare with the beauty of our Shrines and Uposatha HallsNowhere else in the world are there such inspiring and worthy sitesI am absolutely convinced that if only the Thai people were to study and come to a true understanding of Buddhism their correct practice would make it impossible for other sects and ideologies to overwhelm and obliterate Buddhism from ThailandVenChao Khun Suviirañaan VenPhra Khru Dhammadhornsombat and VenSudhammo were our guides throughout our tour of Indonesia and they looked after us very wellAlthough VenChao Khun Vidhoondhammaaporn was away in Bangkok it became obvious to me how greatly they respected him there for even small children knew of him when his name was mentionedThis gives me trust in his devotion the sacrifices hes made for the Buddhist Teachings which make him an important asset for Somdet Phra aanasangworn the present Supreme Patriarch of ThailandMany centuries have passed since the first Thai delegation of monks went to spread Buddhism overseasThis present endeavor in Indonesia seems to me to be the most effective and fruitful since VenChao Khun Phra Upali of the Ayutthaya period led a group of fifteen monks to help reestablish Buddhism in Sri Lanka It is a shame that there are so few capable monks for they are a great boon to Buddhism and to the international community for nowadays they are much in demandWhen the giver has something in demand shouldnt he give it to those in need Or is it that the Thai Sangha that numbers tens of thousands of monks is so impoverished that it doesnt have anything to offer themAt this time some of the people of Indonesia are finding inspiration again in Buddhism and totally dedicating themselves to it even when the monks had been unable to visit they had formed themselves into Buddhist Societies and they were all certain that the Buddhist revival would continue into the future in accordance with a fivehundredyearold legendMay all revered and worthy monks spread their lovingkindness towards Indonesia to reverence the Buddhist religion and recollect the great compassion of the Lord BuddhaAfter traveling around these various countries  Australia Indonesia and going through Singapore three times  we arrived back in Bangkok on the th of JanuaryWe had been away for a little over two monthsAlthough this may seem a short period I certainly found it to be much more valuable than I had expectedQuite a few people in Singapore and Australia had shown a genuine interest in studying DhammaThis was most evident in Indonesia where their enthusiasm and earnestness had grown even more following the teaching I had been able to giveAfter going and witnessing this for myself I had to feel sympathetic towards themThough they have few teachers they manage for the most part to continue with the practiceI have written about these teachings in Dhamma Questions and Answers from Abroad while a more detailed description of our journey is found in An Account of Traveling AbroadAnyone interested can read about it in these publicationsThe durian fruit is thick skinned and has sharp prickles to protect its inner fleshWhoever wants to eat it must carefully turn it around to find the seam between the segments and split it open along that lineYou have probably partaken of this choice fruit and know its delicious flavorWhat is there in this world that is impeccably good and right in its every aspectThe art of knowing how to get at the good part of the durian fruit is similar to wise people who know how to train themselves and practice so as to develop flawless virtueAmong human beings of every gender age group race or tongue  and this extends to the animal kingdom  you probably wont find even one who doesnt admit to desiring their own happiness while abhorring sufferingIt is because of these two conditions that all the sentient beings of the world struggle to find a way out of their loathed suffering and attain to the state of happiness that they desireThis struggle sometimes becomes apparent in the striving for development and progressAlthough this development may seem to be a logical advance with proper inspection one will find that it is a very onesided progressThe other side being a fall into degeneration and retrogressionThe experience of suffering is of enormous value on the road to progress and development Yet at the same time and in manifold ways one brings more turmoil and distress into the worldI had never gone abroad before except when I had gone for morning alms round by boat paddling across the River Mekong to the Laotian city of Vientiane and then returning to my monasteryYet here I was with one foot in the grave going away with people on an overseass tripI cant say that I saw anything worth getting excited about other than seeing how the people and animals live in each countryConditions were basically identical to what I already knew in Thailand and Laos except the minor differences arising from local preferencesAll countries are in agreement on the one essential issue  an abhorrence of suffering and the struggle to overcome itThus the situation is that neither we nor any other creature wish to suffer yet we are born encircled by these two conditionsWe therefore need to reflect on how we should proceed with our lives regarding the three things that I will explain belowEach of us must live in a right moral Dhamma wayThe results of misunderstanding this and going astray will not just entail failure to achieve happiness for oneself and others but will also multiply the suffering and turmoil for both oneself and othersWhether they are influential intelligent and knowledgeable whether they are wealthy or poor they all come up with the same excuses when talking about the virtues of Dhamma and its moral restraintI did it because of social pressureIt was what they expected of me Recognize the fact that society is corrupt and start to question your own role in it  why shouldnt each of us be able to help in correcting thingsWhy shouldnt we be able to counter the bad influences and develop a good and beneficial societyFamilySocietyLivelihoodThese three things will advance smoothly in an orderly peaceful way if their development accords with the Dhamma principles for lay people as set down by the Lord BuddhaA lack of harmonization will cause ones way of life to become worthless and it will only bring conflictIt is Dhamma with virtue that guides the world to happinessThe development of any nation ideology or system  whether it is of material or administrative progress  that is deficient in such Dhamma virtue wont bring complete happiness to the heartDhamma requires that each person withdraws from bad conduct and becomes fearful about initiating corrupt behavior togetherThis is the true and supreme progress for the family for society for the advancement of the standard of living and for the nation as a wholeMy journey was facilitated in every way by the management  especially Air Force LtGeneral Choo and Khun Supharp Sutthichot  and staff of Thai International Airways They helped arrange my passport and visas and all along the way gave me exceptional assistance I must give a special mention to Khun Sutthiphon Kansut and his wife who arranged so much for us in Jakarta with air tickets and accompanying me safely to Singapore and later IndonesiaSo my special thanks to everyone who helped our partyApproximately two months after our return the lay people in Singapore invited me to go back to see whether there was a suitable site to build a monastery as a center for teaching meditationI went but although we looked at about ten different sites none of them seemed suitableIn one way this was a good thing for if we had indeed built a monastery the taking care of it would have become an extra burden for meThe bodily aggregate is the endlessly turning wheel of birth and deathThe heart of one without training must also spin with it while anyone who has practiced will grow tired and weary of the whole affairMy body had been like this when in I had left our group in PhuketEven when I was sitting quietly my voice had become so dried out and hoarse that I could no longer speakIt happened again when some newly ordained monks   came to train under meStraight after they had left my old symptoms returned and I came down with various minor complaintsMy voice was left hoarse and weak and it has never been the same sinceDrRote invited me to go to Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok for a general medical examinationThe tests there found no particular disease except the illness of old age  this is the nature of the cycle of birth and deathThis is what befalls all bodily and mental phenomena and only the circumstances will differThinking back over those twentyseven years that I have been in Wat Hin Mark Peng  what a long time it seemsIf one were a lay person that would be more than enough time to establish a comfortable position and standard of livingBeing an elderly monk I take care of the monastery which is the normal role for old monks everywhereI can no longer get around as I once could and even if I were able to go there is no forest left for tudong wandering like in the old daysThey have cut it all downThe number of devotees also seems to be multiplying daily and wherever I go more children appear  born from the word rather than the wombThey have trailed after me ever since when Air Force General Harin Hongsakun invited me to go into the solitude of Orb Luang Jormtong District of Chiang Mai ProvinceA crowd of people trailed after me and instead of being able to cut down on food and bodily comforts and get down to meditation  the opposite occurredThey provided a banquet with cushions and a luxurious bed on which to sleepWhen the Four Requisites of clothing food shelter and medicine become extravagant and overabundant they can become an obstacle to the development of the beginners meditationA very wealthy and affluent monastery will tend towards dissension and disharmony and its Dhamma study will not progress as it shouldIt is the same with the everyday world where an excess of wealth and affluence can become a threat to the whole communityThe leaders and officials become corrupt and swindle the public and government plundering the country and dividing the spoilsContention arises among them when their vested interests dont agreeAny influential merchant or citizen who gets in their way is killed and so countless deaths occurThis is why the Lord Buddha saidSakkaaro kaapurisam hanti  Power and influence destroy men of inferior wisdomThe longer one stays in the same place the more roots are put downLay devotees come to the monastery and notice features that arent quite perfect or beautiful enough which inspires them to build more permanent replacement structures that are more attractively designedThese beautiful buildings then need looking after for not to do so would be an offence against the monks DisciplineNeed one ask who the caretaker isIts this old monk of courseTeaching and training all the monks and novices who come here how to sit to lie down to eat to go on alms round and all the various duties and obligations including study requirements  this all falls on the shoulders of this old monkThey give one the title of senior incumbent and that seems quite fitting as one is truly encumberedThis though is unavoidable and one has to do ones best with the situation until the end of ones lifeI called to mind my teachers and the great masters of the past the Lord Buddha being the prime example and how they led and guided the TeachingThe thought arose that I too had managed step by step to help guide this development alongMy birth as a human being had not been wastedFurthermore I had ordained as a Buddhist monk and had fulfilled my obligationsWhenever people paid respect or made offerings to me I always thought What are they veneratingThey and I are identical  in that we are all conglomerations of the elements of earth water fire and airThey must at least be honoring the saffron robe which is the emblem and banner of the arahantsSuch faith sustains the religion and although conviction from within may be halfhearted they have trust in what has been passed down to themI am fully aware of the immense virtue and value of BuddhismSince my going forth and ordination it has supported and nurtured me towards becoming a good and virtuous personThe Teaching has never led me to commit the slightest immoral deedYet even so we are always resisting and being recalcitrant towards it and continuing our evil waysOur dwelling and sleeping places our sleeping mat pillow and mosquito net the food we eat  everything we daily pick up and use here the whole lot belongs to the Buddhas TeachingThe medicines to treat any illness we might develop belong to the faithful Buddhist devotees who selflessly donate themWhen we first ordain as monks we are completely dependent on the saffron robe the emblem of the Noble Ones which our Preceptor and Teachers bestow on usWhen one has received this matchless apparel the people bow their respects and support one with floods of offeringsI have been able to survive to the present day because of this TeachingBuddhism has brought infinite and untold virtue and blessings to me personally and to all of us in the worldComing to live here wherever I have been before I have always done whatever I could provided my health was up to it to build a basis of solid durable constructions for BuddhismNow that I am old and dont have enough strength for building projects lay devotees become inspired to sponsor the constructions that will stand in for me in the futureWe have shared any resources that are left over out among other monasteriesYet I will never become a slave to bricks concrete and wood because I know that such materials are just external thingsDespite their beauty and stylish design no matter how many millions they cost if we behave immorally they all become hollow and completely meaninglessThe true core or heart of Buddhism does not lie in material things but in individual actionsThis has been my guiding principleThe going forth in ordination has been termed nekkhamma or renunciation because it is the giving up of all forms of sensualityHaving resolved to train oneself  following the Noble Truth of the Lord Buddhas Teaching  to escape from all suffering one should not then bury oneself under a pile of bricks and mortar These sorts of building projects tend to be the source of great complications and difficulties and they mainly fail through lack of adequate resources  especially lack of moral virtueSuccess makes one feel happy and warm inside whereas failure brings the tearing of hair and agitationI never allowed such feelings about my projects and remained quite impartial and unconcerned about whether or not they would succeedI think of every project as just a part of the duties of the religionThe resources all come from the devotees for I myself have no wealthWhen the work is completed it benefits Buddhism and brings much merit to the lay devoteesThere should be no need to solicit contributions for that only brings annoyance so that people become fatigued with the whole businessI was able to complete all the projects because of donations that came in from all directions including overseas contributionsAny offerings  such as Kathina and Sanghadaana  towards Wat Hin Mark Peng were kept specifically for that purpose while any contributions given to me and intended for my personal use  from one baht to ten a hundred to even millions  I have channelled all into the various community projects that I have already mentionedFunds for this never seem to have dried up and there remains a strong interest in aiding my projects I myself dont seem to have retrogressed because of this and everything has gone smoothlySaadhuSaadhuSaadhuPast merit seems to have enabled me to be successful in thisI have never gone out looking for even a penny but funds have rolled in from all directionsIve become something like a central reserve bank for those Buddhists who want their funds directed to what will be most beneficial for Buddhism Administrating these funds can be difficult because of the lack of records But somehow I have smoothly managed them by allowing sufficient to accumulate in a projectfund  for Sala Uposatha Hall etc to complete the work then totally clearing its accountAny monk engaging in such management needs to be absolutely sure of his ability and his incorruptibility otherwise he should not involve himselfIf one goes against this principle it will damage the Buddhism that one respects so much and will also lead to ones own downfallThere are examples of this everywhereThis Capital M can be quite deadly and has already destroyed many peopleAiming solely for the benefit of Buddhism and the common good without taking selfish advantage will be of great fruit whereas undertaking anything for selfish motives will bring unfortunate resultsIt will be very damaging if one tries to get something for oneself while pursuing Buddhist projectsThis is even more so for some monksAfter involving themselves in building works such projects seem to take them over and their inner spiritual work and discipline are all abandonedThey build outwardly but fail to build their inner selves and this leads to great declineIt is now about sixty years since I first saw the forest here and it was when I actually came to live hereI have steadily developed it since that time and you can see the results with your own eyesThe important point being that this all arose through the faith and energy of my disciples both monks and lay people who contributed whatever they could  whether labor or moneyThere are more of them than I can ever hope to mentionThe Supreme Patriarch of Thailand graciously came to officiate at the ceremonial opening of the MondopHe was very pleased and officially declared Wat Hin Mark Peng to be a Model Monastery in the development field and gave me official recognition of this on the twentysixth of MayThis marks quite an honor for the monasteryI really hope that Wat Hin Mark Peng may continue to be a place for monks to practice for the longlasting benefit of BuddhismTherefore may all of you who have helped in the support of Wat Hin Mark Peng be happy long prosper and be firmly established in the noble Buddhist TeachingI have been a monk now for sixtyeight years and I have tried to practice only for the benefit of myself and others starting with myself and then carrying this further for the good of othersBy this I mean that I could go on tudong with great meditation teachers starting with my very first year as a monkI was determined to practice following the instruction of my Teachers and as I had no other responsibilities to occupy me I could apply myself fully to the taskIn later years I was able to be away from them and therefore had to accept many responsibilitiesA group of monks started following me and I had regularly to instruct the lay peopleIn those days because there were so few forest meditation monks when lay people saw anyone with a following of monks they would immediately consider him an Ajahn or Teacher and would trail after himEven when it was like that I never slackened with my meditation efforts and even saw it as a stimulus to practice even harderThis then became of benefit both to myself and othersTo be truly of benefit to others requires that one first be of benefit to oneselfOne is then able to share what one has with other peopleIf no one shows interest in receiving it one hasnt lost anythingThis has been part of my practice ever since I was ordainedOn HM the Kings birthday on the fifth of December I received by his order the ecclesiastical title of VenPhra Rajanirodharangsee Gambhiirapaññaavisit Yatigansasorn Bowornsanghaaraam AraññavaaseeI have already described my feelings about such ecclesiastical titles and I havent changed my mind but they explained to me that this was the way the king of Thailand always showed his appreciation for the work and responsibilities of senior monks and when they increased their good works so their title would be elevatedI am just a forest monk and I can only reflect on the gracious favor and offer my blessing  Anumodanaa to HM the KingWe believe that having been born together in this world we all owe each other mutual benefit and welfareChildren are indebted to their parents and parents have new obligations towards their childrenEach remembers their debt to the other without any thought of calling it inThe recalling to oneself of ones parental debt will however enable one to repay it according to ones perception of it  for some this will be great for others smallOne got into this form of debt by ones own actions without coercion from anyone else and so no one else can take it overPeople acknowledge their parental debt in innumerable waysThey recall that from their first until their last day they had been and always would be cared for with love and devotion in every wayFor instance they had to rely on mother and father in learning how to sit up to lie down to stand up to walk and to talk  for everythingWhen their parents became angry with them and smacked or caned them the parents had also held back somewhat remembering that this is my childSometimes they couldnt bring themselves to do itThere is a natural instinct in all beings for parents to love their offspring and this includes even the animalsThey love without thinking or knowing why or what they can gain from it and the children respond in the same wayThe bonding between animals however is shortlived and only occurs while the offspring are still small for with maturity it is all lostHuman love and affection knows no endIt endures until death and even beyondThe person who doesnt acknowledge the goodness and beneficence of his parents and who doesnt repay their kindness is base and worse than an animalIm going to boast a bit here I was born their son but my ordination while still young prevented me from providing my parents with the material support that everyone usually givesHowever my life as a monk allowed me to sustain and nourish their hearts aspirations and good will and that was what they appreciated beyond all elseThey could constantly call to mind that our own son is a monkNo matter how near or far away  even a thousand kilometres distant  they could still be happy and content because their aspirations had been fulfilledWhen both my parents became older I returned to teach and fortify their faith until both decided to ordain and wear white robesTheir meditation brought them many remarkable experiences that strengthened their faith even moreI taught them about the path to happiness and both would attentively listen to me as pupils listen to their teacherThey received all the teaching with open hearts not worrying that a child should be teaching his parentsMy father was a white robed chee pakao for eleven years before his passing away at the age of seventysevenMy mother was a whiterobed nun for seventeen years and died after my father when she was eightytwoI taught them right up to their final moments offering all the advice I possible could and I really feel that I was able completely to repay my debt to themI had no other outstanding debtsI organized funeral ceremonies suitable to their position and in accordance with my being a monkBeing ordained as a Buddhist monk for so long has allowed me to see the changing condition of this aging body with the transformations in the external worldIve seen so many things both good and bad and it has greatly expanded my wisdom and knowledgeI dont feel that I have wasted being born into the world with themI consider that I have been indebted to this world for I have taken its elements of earth water fire and air to form a bodyIn maintaining it I have had to absorb and use the things of the world for absolutely nothing of it belongs to meAfter death everything must be left behind in this worldSome people never consider such issues and by that fall into unyieldingly grasping hold of things  everything is mineHusband wife children and grandchildren household possessions  they are all mineTo the end even when those things disappear or are broken they still retain their hold on them as mineThere is activity that we should not perform yet having been born it has to be undertakenWe have been born with this self that is called conditioned and so as a matter of course we must grow old become ill and dieNot a single person wants it to be like that  becoming old and decrepit until one can no longer go anywhereNo one wants to die not to see their children and grandchildrens faces againAfter death those that remain even if they are the children of the deceased will not keep the corpse at home for more than fifteen days and most people will take it away for cremationThere it is the activity that we should not undertakeOne respects them so highly and then throws them on the fire  yet this has become a necessary actionNo one is going to keep the corpse at homeThe kamma that should not be made occurs after someones deathIt doesnt matter who it is ones father mother brothers sisters or other relatives including ones respected Teachers there have to be funeral ritesThis requires a lot more labor and material things than at the time of birth which succeeded with just the two  mother and fatherFuneral rites entail the feeding and receiving of guests lay people and monks and the finding of offerings for the monksFor those left behind who are not so well off this is no small burdenWhen they dont have enough they have to borrow from relatives and friends and so go further into debtThis sort of debt has absolutely no advantage and brings only lossStill anyone who is practicing generosity will treat it as a meritorious deed which is a sort of profit for oneselfHowever one takes it it is still something that we should not undertake and yet when those still living are confronted with this situation they feel obligatedComing to birth and dying are not the same for human beings of this worldIn being born there is a sequence dependent on the parentsWhoever is born before is called elder and whoever comes after is youngerDying is not like thatWhether one dies first or later depends on the results of ones kamma each according to his or her ownSometimes the younger dies before the elder or vice versaAfter death one doesnt necessarily have to go on to be reborn as siblings for again this depends on the results of kammaOne who has committed evil may be born as a preta or fall into deepest hell into aviciiThose who have purified their heart and transcended the mass of suffering will attain even to NibbanaIt all dependsI think that I have completely repaid my debt to my parents who have passed away I was their youngest son and Ive accomplished whatever duties were appropriate for a monk towards them bothBoth probably thought the same about this and wouldnt have wanted to call in any debt of mine because it had all worked out as they wishedAjahn Kumdee Reeo rahng my eldest brother loved me very dearly and I was sorry that he died when I was away spending the Rains Retreat in Chantaburi ProvinceI was unable to arrange his funeral in a way commensurate with his love for meWhen my other elder brothers and sisters were still alive I was able to teach them about virtue and Dhamma each according to their temperament and potential so that when they were about to die they had some refuge in the heartThey hadnt wasted their life for on meeting the Lord Buddhas Teachings they had practiced as much as they could according to their abilityMrsAhn Prahpphahn my eldest sister and the second child passed away in at the age of eightyeightMrsNaen Chiangtong my elder sister and the third child passed away in at the age of ninetyMrPlian Reeo rahng my elder brother and the fourth child passed away in at the age of eightyMrsNooan Glah Kaeng my elder sister and the fifth child passed away in at the age of seventynineVenPhra Gate my elder brother and the sixth child passed away in at the age of fortyeight with fourteen years as a monkMrsThoop Deeman my younger sister passed away on the sixteenth of May at the age of eightsixI made sure that all my brothers and sisters received the complete and proper funeral that they would have expectedThis was especially so with the youngest MrsThoop Deeman who in the last part of her life came to receive training with me as a whiterobed nun at Wat Hin Mark PengShe seems to have secured good results from her meditation practice that stood her in good stead when she became very ill in the final part of her lifeHer children came and took her away for hospital treatment in Sakhon Nakorn ProvinceThey told me that her mindfulness was good and she was aware right up to the final momentsShe had described what she was feeling to her children and grandchildren who were caring for her that her feet were becoming cold that the coldness had reached her calves her knees and her chestShe mindfully concentrated on her chest and her breathing became fainter and fainter and finally everything became stillNow I have to depend on myself for all my relatives and Meditation Masters are no longer availableI will continue to do good until no life remains because after death no one else can do either good or evil for usThis autobiography has now reached my eightyninth year and I think I will finish with this muchIn November Venerable Ajahn Thate again fell ill with a lung infectionComplications set in with symptoms of heart disease and prostrate problems and while treatment helped his health was never as strong as beforeAs described previously Venerable Ajahn Thate had always found Wat Tam Khahm to be an especially good place for both his Dhamma practice and his healthSo in March he moved from Wat Hin Mark Peng to take up residence at Wat Tam Khahm in the mountains of Sakhon Nakorn ProvinceVenAjahn Kiem Sorayo was the abbot there and was very happy to welcome his venerable guestVenerable Ajahn Thates health then gradually improved and he amazed everyone with his renewed vigour and appetiteAt his ninetysecond birthday celebrations he praised the local people of Sakhon Nakorn as the most supportive and caring of allHe told them that he was sorry not to have come to stay there when he was younger when he could have taught them moreHowever during May of Venerable Ajahn Thates condition again changed for the worse with a deterioration in his strength and appetiteA medical professor and his team came and discovered a gall bladder obstruction  from gall bladder stones or perhaps from a growthDespite Venerable Ajahn Thates advanced age of ninetytwo they tried their utmost to nurse him back to health so that he could continue his teaching for another couple of yearsA few days before the start of the Rains Retreat Venerable Ajahn Thate spoke privately about his personal affairsHe charged that if he should die his body should first be kept at Wat Tam Khahm but that the cremation should take place at Wat Hin Mark PengWhen his disciple took this opportunity to ask how long his body should be kept Venerable Ajahn Thate replied that that should come from the general agreement of everyone involvedAlthough Venerable Ajahn Thate was obviously frail and in pain during most of the Rains Retreat of he never complained or displayed any upsetHe was a shining example of the good Dhamma practitioner to those monks who were taking care of himOn the morning of Saturday December after some liquidized food and his medicine VenAjahn Thate was as usual taken around in his wheelchair for some mobile meditationAfter thirty minutes he said he was tired and went back to bedHis body seemed somewhat restless so his disciples played a tape of one of his own Dhamma talks on meditationHe confirmed to the monks that it was certainly necessary to set in neutralityLater in the day after another wheelaround he agreed that he was tired and so was helped into bedThis was at nine oclock in the eveningThe attendant monk respectfully suggested to the Venerable Ajahn that he should fix his attention on going to sleep so that he could wake up rested and strongHe nodded in agreement and almost immediately became stillHis attendant noticed how easily he had gone to sleep and knowing that he usually slept on his right side the attendant called on another monk to help turn him to that side thinking that he could rest longer in that positionThe monks massaged Venerable Ajahn Thates hands as he slept and noticed that he was very still without any movement at all  abnormally soThe peaceful look on his face meant that the monks attending did not have an inkling that the Venerable Ajahn Thate had in fact already passed awayAn ending of such great dignity and peace perfectly completes a life lived that wayHis life had touched many many people and this became manifest in the funeral and cremation ritesWhen news spread about his passing local monks and villagers immediately started coming to pay their last respectsIt was announced that HM the King of Thailand would officially sponsor the funeral ritesAs Venerable Ajahn Thate had previously ordered his body was first kept at Wat Tam Khahm and then moved to Wat Hin Mark PengThis is a bigger monastery and so much more appropriate for dealing with the funeral arrangements for the cremation was obviously to be a national eventThe cremation of Venerable Ajahn Thate took place on JanuaryPeople from all over Thailand  led by HM the King and the royal family  came to pay their final respectsEach region where the Venerable Ajahn had stayed seemed to be represented  even from overseas  so it was as if even in death he was still able to bring people togetherIt is estimated that there were ten thousand monks present and many hundreds of thousands of lay peopleYet even with such numbers it was arranged in a fitting and appropriate way and all accomplished through volunteer help and financeThe good weather allowed the arrangements to proceed smoothlyHM the King honored Venerable Ajahn Thate with royal sponsored funeral rites and the full panoply of ancient custom and ritualWhen all was ready HM the King flew in by helicopter officially to lead the making of offerings and light the cremation fireThe monks followed this filing past the coffin then the dignitaries with all the ordinary people who had supported Venerable Ajahn Thate for more than seventy years as a monkThe actual cremation took place later that night with a full moon shining down on the crematorium lake and fountain specially built for the occasionThese remain as a landmark and memorial to Venerable Ajahn Thate when devotees come to practice Dhamma and remember his exampleThe next morning when the fire was cooled the bones and ashes of Venerable Ajahn Thate were reverently removed and safeguarded as relicsThus ends the biography of Venerable Ajahn ThateIt started in a remote village at the beginning of the century and closed more than ninety years later surrounded by hundreds of thousands of disciples including the King of ThailandAlong the Way Venerable Ajahn Thate had continually taught and that continues in the practice he inspired and the books and taped talks he left behind  including this bookAnyone  of any religion or none  can appreciate the basic Buddhist guidelines for action and speechThere is no dogma hidden among these precepts for it is a plain and simple way of living without harming or hurting any creatureThe other feature to bear in mind is that it is something that the individual accepts voluntarilyNo one commands one to receive themIt is the individuals volition that changes a list of precepts into a way of livingThe appreciation and mindfulness of ones actions and speech then become more subtle which automatically leads on to meditationThere are the basic Five Precepts and these become more refined with the Eight PreceptsThese Precepts can be received by simply sayingI undertake the training ruleprecept  In the compiler brought a copy of her book Aajaaraaphiwaht to show Venerable Ajahn ThateIt was the commemorative book for the royal opening of the chedi and museum of the late VenAjahn Fan AacaaroOn leafing through the book he came across a sample of VenAjahn Fans handwriting using the dhamm characters and asked whether the compiler of the book could understand themWhen she admitted her ignorance Venerable Ajahn Thate smiled and remarked that it was a shame that such knowledge was disappearing so fast and that future generations would be completely ignorant of it Just a few days later Venerable Ajahn Thate kindly gave her the translation beautifully typed outThe original dhamm characters and his translation appear below together with his explanationWise people are those that are able to prevent the arising of evil in their personalityThere is a simile about a person planting a tree a mango tree for exampleThe person steadily tends and cares for it stopping any growth of parasitical creepers or pests because he is afraid that otherwise the tree will not flourish and wont be fruitfulThis is similar to the body of the wise personIt is natural for such a person to guard against wrong actions of body speech and mind so that they dont become the source for sadness and depressionThus the SakavatiAjahn Teacher inquires into the first part of the Maatikaa which is kusala dhammaHe translates correctly and adds more similes so that I come to understandI wrote down the Thai translation of this text so that my readers can compare and understand its meaningThis Dhamm alphabet is fast becoming extinct because nobody studies it anymoreExcept that is for those who were ordained sixty years ago and learned it thenThe Thai alphabet was then not so widespread and the monks had to learn the Dhamm charactersWe learned from actually reading the palm leaf manuscripts rather than just learning the vowels and consonantsThe subject matter was always about the Buddhas TeachingsFor instance about generosity morality and meditation about the heavenly fruits of good deeds and the dreadful results in hell of bad deedsAfter studying one or two manuscripts one could read them allIn former days in the time of Wiangjan the people still flourished and prospered with the Lord Buddhas TeachingsThey studied using three alphabets Dhamm Korm and Small ThaiThey called them Dhamm characters because they were only used for Dhamma the Teachings of the Lord BuddhaAn exception being those monks who disrobed after many years and used their knowledge to gain a living in astrology or herbal medicineOtherwise these characters were used to write down magic formula and spellsPeople then really held the Dhamm characters to be sacred and supernaturally powerfulThey considered them the very teaching of the Lord Buddha and its true as they thoughtWe only studied the Korm characters enough to know what they were about but did not write in themIf they were used in writing again it was only for the Buddhas Teachings the same as the DhammThe LesserThai script could be used for anything and is still used to this day in Vientiane for thats where it originated but it has evolved a great deal since then The Buddhist Order of monks has an unbroken lineage of twentyfive centuriesIn this world of growth and decay there is often need for reform as standards declineSuch reform historically has happened either through the king inviting knowledgeable monks to come and teach the ignorant monks or by an internal processIn the chaos that followed the destruction of the old Thai capital of Ayutthaya the general standard of the monks understanding and conduct declinedWhen Crown Prince Monkut became a monk and learned the Pali language he found that there were great differences between what the texts described and what was actually practicedA group of monks gathered around him intent on trying to follow more strictly the vinaya DisciplineWhen his son King Chulalongkorn ascended to the throne he formally acknowledged this reform group as the Dhammayut NikayaAs this reform movement spread in influence it acted as a catalyst for general reformSo that the majority grouping  the MahaaNikaya  reformed itself and the whole Community of monks became revitalizedThis book spans the time when this reform movement was spreading and shows how it also affected the tudong monks out in the forestsDetails of building projects abbreviated in the main text are detailed hereThe Uposatha Hall of Wat Hin Mark PengAround MrGong Pewsiri from Koke Sooak Village made a large Buddharuupa on the rocks facing the River Mekong using the local rock and organized it all himself for about one thousand bahtIt was more than five metres high but wasnt particularly beautiful because the workers were just ordinary local artisans rather than expert craftsmen several attempts at remodelling transformed that into what we have today After it was finished we built a pavilion around itOn the twentysixth of March the monastery received a royal proclamation establishing its boundariesSeeing that Wat Hin Mark Peng had now been properly established according to the law I decided it was the right time to build an Uposatha HallFormal meetings of the monks could then convene according to the Discipline and that would be for the future growth of the Buddhist TeachingThe site of the large Buddharuupa seemed ideal for if we were to build the Uposatha Hall around it we would have both a main Shrine Hall and the main presiding BuddharuupaThe foundation stonelaying ceremony took place on the twelfth of April with Somdet Phra Maha Virawong of Wat Sri Mahaa Dhaatu in Bangkaen Bangkok heading the monks and Air force LtGeneral Choo Suddhichot leading the lay devoteesThey constructed this Uposatha Hall with tiered double roofs which are seven metres wide and twentyone metres long while the ceiling is nine metres above the floor in all it cost about seven hundred thousand bahtThe consecration ceremony took place between the fifth and seventh of AprilIn the baked clay tile roof was replaced and it was redecorated inside and out which cost more than four hundred and fifty thousand bahtWat Hin Mark Pengs MondopIn I thought that this spot on the bank of the River Mekong would be an ideal site for building a mondopIt would be an artistic landmark for the Mekong River basin and have a Buddharuupa and Buddha relicsI also thought to myself that it could be a place to keep my bones and then other people would not have to trouble themselves about finding a place In things started to happen with plans being drawn and the Fine Arts Department inspecting and improving the artistic design it has three stories and is thirtysix metres high with each floor being thirteen metres square and the total cost was finally about five million bahtThe Desarangsee Hall The original sala at Wat Hin Mark Peng was all wooden with some woven split bamboo sides and a tin roof this was replaced by the Sala Desapradit that was also made of wood because of the number of visitors this gradually became too dilapidated and overcrowded so a new twostoried concrete sala was built twentythree metres wide by fortyfour metres long and cost more than seven and a half million bahtThey named it the Sala Desarangsee BEMural Wall Painting Paintings were commissioned in September On the central wall they portray scenes from the Lord Buddhas life the righthand wall depicts aspects of Wat Hin Mark Peng the lefthand wall portrays Northeast regional customs and traditions They took twelve months to paint at a cost of six hundred and fifty thousand bahtThe Bell Tower A bell that cost sixty thousand baht was cast and hung in a tower which cost three hundred and fifty thousand bahtWat Hin Mark Pengs LibraryThe Drum TowerDwelling Places for the Monks Huts have been repaired and completely rebuilt large or small according to the circumstances usually in the Thai Style until there are now fiftysix huts or kutis for the monks and novices with thirtyseven in the nuns quartersThe nuns sala the kitchens toilets washing facilities a largish waterworks and electricity generators these are valued at not less than ten million bahtThe Monastery Perimeter Wall Since the monastery became ever more solidly established with its area also expanding through donationsIn the local District Officer helped arrange official acknowledgement of this with land deeds from the Department of Land for two hundred and sixtyone rai It was the first place in that region to have legal claim to the land seeing the expansion of the local villages and the already established nature of the monastery I thought it would be good to mark the boundaries clearly with a perimeter wall the provincial Accelerated Rural Development prepared the site and it was built in at a cost of more than one and a half million bahtAfter finishing all these building projects according to plan I thought it would be appropriate that everyone who had helped could come together and see the results and also take the opportunity to celebrate HM the Kings Fifth Cycle AnniversarySo on the twentyfifth and twentysixth of April many senior monks and lay people came together to honor HM the King to admire the completed monastery and to celebrate my own eightyfifth birthdayI was able not only to establish Wat Hin Mark Peng on a solid foundation but the remaining resources were shared out among other deserving monasteries schools and hospitals etc To give some idea of this I will mention those projects that I can remember and have not yet describedWat Araññavaasee received an Uposatha Hall a Dhamma Study Hall two kutis a perimeter wall and a concrete roadThis cost more than nine million bahtWat Phra Buddhabahtkorkaeng Srii Chiang Mai

which is a scholarship fund for poor but well behaved hard working and clever students in the province of NongkhaiAt present it contains almost one million twohundred thousand bahtThere is also

area and aim to give help provincewideThe Thate Desarangsee Fund for caring for the monks and novices and the maintenance of the buildings of Wat Hin Mark Peng which stands at five million seven

natural quality and remove their attachments to all things  including their attachment to the agent that goes about knowing those thingsIn the end there is no agent attaining or getting anythingHowever natural phenomena behave that is how they simply keep on behaving at all timesWhen meditators practice correctly and have the discernment to see that quality as it really is the result is that they can withdraw their attachments from all things  including their attachment to the discernment that enters in to see the quality as it really isThe practice of all things good and noble is to reach this very pointVenPhra Ajahn Thate DesarangseeWhat are the fourBhikkhus the bhikkhu following my Teaching keeps his mind steadfastly on the body with diligence comprehension and mindfulness thus keeping away covetousness and distressThe bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on sensation with diligence comprehension and mindfulness thus keeping away covetousness and distressThe bhikkhu concentrates steadfastly on the mind with diligence comprehension and mindfulness thus keeping away covetousness and distressThe bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the dhamma with diligence comprehension and mindfulness thus keeping away covetousness and distressThen with entire mindfulness he breathes in and with entire mindfulness he breathes outBreathing in a long inhalation he is conscious of breathing in a long inhalation or breathing out a long exhalation he is conscious of breathing out a long exhalationBreathing in a short inhalation he is conscious of breathing in a short inhalation or breathing out a short exhalation he is conscious of breathing out a short exhalationHe trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the incoming breath at its beginning its middle and at its endHe trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the outgoing breath at its beginning its middle and at its endhe trains himself to calm down the strong inhalation as he breathes inhe trains himself to calm down the strong exhalation as he breathes outJust as bhikkhus a skilful turner or a turners apprentice knows a long pull when a long pull is made or knows a short pull when a short pull is made even so bhikkhus the bhikkhu breathing in a long inhalation is conscious of breathing in a long inhalation or breathing out a long exhalation is conscious of breathing out a long exhalation or breathing in a short inhalation is conscious of breathing in a short inhalation or breathing out a short exhalation is conscious of breathing out a short exhalationHe trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the incoming breath at its beginning its middle and at its endHe trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole

he breathes outThus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is hisOccasionally he realizes that the aggregate of physical phenomena of others must be of a similar natureBecause of this realization he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena of othersIn this way he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate

certainly expected in him arahatship in this very existence or if there yet be any trace of Clinging left the state of an anāgāmiThus spoke the BhagavaDelighted the bhikkhus received the words of the Buddha with respectful appreciationWhen the bhikkhu can steadfastly keep his mind on the bodypostures by means of diligence mindfulness concentration comprehension he perceives the sign or incessant appearance of physical phenomena This perception usually begins when the bhikkhu achieves the second vipassanā ñāṇa  paccaya pariggaha ñāṇaFrom this perception the bhikkhu draws the conclusion that rebirth of beings take place in a similar wayTherefore while the bhikkhu is perceiving the continuous appearance of physical phenomena he realizes that endless rebirths are due to ignorance of Four Ariya Truths craving for pleasure of the senses kamma which has the potency for rebirth as its effect nutriment which is essential for physical phenomena mind which is the motivating force heat and coldThe causes of dissolution of physical phenomena are the absence of the above factorsThe bhikkhu then realizes that extinction of ignorance of Four Ariya Truths will cause the extinction of endless appearance of physical phenomenaThe actual perception of the sign of change or disappearance or deterioration of physical phenomena will begin when the bhikkhu achieves the third vipassanā ñāṇa  Sammasana ñāṇaThe sign of change is called viparinama lakkhaṇāIn fact the perception of the appearance and disappearance of physical phenomena by means of nibbatti and viparināma lakkhaṇā becomes clearer when the bhikkhu achieves the fourth vipassanā ñāṇa  Udayabbaya ñāṇaHowever the perception of only the disappearance of physical phenomena becomes stronger when he achieves the fifth vipassanā ñāṇa  bhaṅga ñāṇaThese false views of the body and limbs begin to disappear when he achieves the fifth vipassanā ñāṇa  bhaṅga ñāṇaFrom that stage the bhikkhu perceives only the deterioration of the bodyAnd he is no longer conscious of the body and the limbs as suchAnd therefore he does not take pride and pleasure in themWith this perception of the nonexistence of the body and limbs he fully achieves the eleventh vipassanā ñāṇa The Pathavīdhātu is predominant in the first twenty items of the list given in SectionThe podhātu is predominant in the last twelve itemsThe Tejodhātu consists of four kinds of heat in the body and Vāyo dhātu consists of six kinds of Vāyo in the bodyAs a matter of fact anuttara is normally an epithet for Lokuttarā citta or Maggaphala cittaHowever in vipassanā practice the yogi can concentrate only on the five upādānakkhandhas the five Aggregates which form the objects of ClingingHe cannot concentrate on Maggaphala cittaTherefore jhānas are given the epithet anuttaraKāmacchanda all forms of taṇhā and lobha craving and desireByāpāda ill will harbouring evil desires to illtreat or destroy others or to bring others into troubleThinamiddha sloth and torpor feeling or indolence particularly for doing good and meritorious deedsUddhaccakukkucca distraction and worryThis has two aspects flitting about of the mind in all directions and worrying over past commissions and omissionsVicikicchā doubt or wavering of mindThe discarded kāmacchanda will not rise again due to Arahatta MaggaThe discarded byāpāda will not arise again due to Anāgāmi MaggaThe discarded thinamiddha will not arise again due to Arahatta MaggaThe discarded uddhaccakukkucca will not arise again due to Arahatta Magga and Anāgāmi Magga respectivelyThe discarded vicikicchā will

ClingingTherefore only the viññānakkhandhā which does not include maggaphala citta can be the object of ClingingThis discourse is an interesting example of the folklore of the Pali canonIt shows that the tendency of Asian popular Buddhism to regard the Buddha as a protective figure and not just as a teacher has its roots in the earliest part of the traditionMetrical analysis indicates that the long tribute section of this discourse is very old while the verses in the introductory section  which is also found in the Samyutta Nikaya  are later in formThis fits with a more subjective judgment that the tribute was an earlier composition  in the honorific style of the ancient court bards  to which the introduction was added laterThis judgment is based on the fact that the two sections do not quite fit each otherThe introduction to the tribute indicates that the reciter of the tribute is the Buddha himself whereas the narration in the tribute indicates otherwiseAt any rate this discourse is the closest thing in the Pali canon to a whos who of the deva worlds and should provide useful material for anyone interested in the cosmology of early BuddhismThe Commentary reports the belief that the devas enjoy hearing this discourse chanted in PaliUntil recently it was part of many monks standard memorized repertoire to be chanted at weddings and the dedication of new buildingsEven today as many of the traditions of memorization in Asia seem to be falling by the wayside there are a few monks and laypeople who chant this discourse regularlyI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Great Wood together with a large Sangha of approximately five hundred bhikkhus all of them arahantsAnd most of the devatas from ten worldsystems had gathered in order to see the Blessed One and the Bhikkhu SanghaThen the thought occurred to four devatas of the ranks from the Pure Abodes The Blessed One is dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Great Wood together with a large Sangha of about five hundred bhikkhus all of them arahantsAnd most of the devatas from ten worldsystems have gathered in order to see the Blessed One and the Bhikkhu SanghaLet us also approach the Blessed One and on arrival let us each speak a verse in his presenceThen just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm those devatas disappeared from among the devas of the Pure Abodes and reappeared before the Blessed OneHaving paid homage to the Blessed One they stood to one sideAs they were standing there one devata recited this verse in the Blessed Ones presenceThen another devata recited this verse in the Blessed Ones presenceThen another devata recited this verse in the Blessed Ones presenceThen another devata recited this verse in the Blessed Ones presenceThen the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks most of the devatas from ten worldsystems have gathered in order to see the Tathagata and the Bhikkhu SanghaThose who in the past were Pure Ones Rightly Selfawakened at most had their devatagathering like mine at the presentThose who in the future will be Pure Ones Rightly Selfawakened will at most have their devatagathering like mine at the presentI will detail for you the names of the deva hostsI will describe to you the names of the deva hostsI will teach you the names of the deva hostsListen and pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord the monks repliedThe Blessed One saidThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Mahavana near the city of Kapilavatthu in the province of the Sakyans together with a great retinue of monks all of them arahants and five hundred in numberDevas from ten thousand worldsystems frequently assembled for the purpose of seeing the Blessed One and the bhikkhusanghaThen to four devas of the Suddhavasa brahma world this thought occurred The Blessed One is living in the Mahavana near the city of Kapilavatthu in the province of the Sakyans with a great retinue of monks all of them arahants and five hundred in numberDevas are frequently assembling there for the purpose of seeing the Blessed One and the bhikkhusanghaIt is well if we were also to repair to the place where the Blessed One is and each of us recite a stanza in his presenceThen those devas as quickly as a strong man might stretch out his arm or bend his outstretched arm vanished from the pure abodes and appeared before the Blessed One saluted him and stood beside himSo standing one of the devas recited this stanza in his presenceThere is a great assembly in the forestA host of devas has assembledWe have come to this dhammaassembly to see the invincible sanghaThen another deva recited this stanza in the presence of the Blessed OneThe monks in this have collected their thoughts and made their minds uprightThe wise guard their senses even as a charioteer holds the reinsThen another deva recited this stanza in the presence of the Blessed OneHaving cut off the stake having dug up the crossbar devoid of desire they go their way pure stainless with vision clear and well tamed these young arahants move about like elephantsThen another deva recited this stanza in the presence of the Blessed OneThey who go for refuge to the Buddha shall not go to evil state of existence but will quit the human body and fill the ranks of the devasThe Blessed One then addressed the monks Often monks devas from the ten worldsystems foregather to see the Tathagata and the monks the community of bhikkhusDevas have assembled before the consummate supreme Buddhas of the past devas will appear before the consummate supreme Buddhas of the future as they do assemble now before meI will tell you monks the names of the host of devas I will reveal the names of the host of devasListen pay attentionI will speak Yes Venerable Sir said the monks by way of assentThe Blessed One said thisIn measured speech I will give utteranceThe terrestrial devas remain in their realmThose bent on meditation frequent rocky cleftsWell composed they live like solitary lions overcoming the fear that causes hair to stand on end with immaculate minds pure serene and undefiledKnowing that there were in the forest near the city of Kapilavatthu five hundred and more disciples delighted in the word of the Buddha the Master thereupon addressed

rejoicing with Aryan disciples This is one of the most profound discourses in the Pali canonIt gives an extended treatment of the teachings of dependent coarising and notself in an outlined context of how these teachings function in practiceThe first part of the discourse takes the factors of dependent coarising in sequence from effect to cause tracing them down to the mutual dependency of nameandform on the one hand and consciousness on the otherIn connection with this point it is worth noting that the word great in the title of the discourse may have a double meaning modifying the word discourse  its a long discourse  and modifying causes referring to the fact that nameandform and consciousness as causal factors can account for everything describable in the cosmosAfter tracing the basic sequence of factors in the causal pattern the discourse then reviews their interrelationships showing how they can explain stress and suffering both on the individual and on the social levelThe second part of the discourse taking up the teaching of notself shows how dependent coarising gives focus to this teaching in practiceIt begins with a section on Delineations of a Self classifying the various ways in which a sense of self might be defined in terms of formThe scheme of analysis introduced in this section  classifying views of the self according to the variables of form and formless finite and infinite already existing naturally developing in the future and alterable through human effort  covers all the theories of the self proposed in the classical Upanisads as well as all theories of self or soul proposed in more recent timesThe inclusion of an infinite self in this list gives the lie to the belief that the Buddhas teachings on notself were denying nothing more than a sense of separate or limited selfThe discourse points out that even a limitless infinite allembracing sense of self is based on an obsession in the mind that has to be abandonedThe following section on Nondelineations of a Self shows that it is possible for the mind to function without reading a self into experienceThe remaining sections focus on ways in which this can be done by treating the sense of self as it relates to different aspects of nameandformThe first of these sections  Assumptions of a Self  focuses on the sense of self as it relates to feeling one of the name factors in nameandformThe next section  Seven Stations of Consciousness  focuses on form formlessness and perception which is another one of the name factors that allows a place for consciousness to land and grow on the macro level in the cycle of death and rebirthThe last section  Eight Emancipations  focuses on form formlessness and perception on the micro level in the practice of meditative absorptionIn each of these cases once the sense of attachment and identification with nameandform can be broken the mutual dependency between consciousness and nameandform is broken as wellThis brings about total freedom from the limits of the extent to which there are means of designation expression and delineation the extent to which the sphere of discernment extends the extent to which the cycle revolves for the manifesting of this world  ie nameandform together with consciousness This is the release at which the Buddhas teachings are aimedI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was living among the KurusNow the Kurus have a town named KammasadhammaThere VenAnanda approached the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Its amazing lord its astounding how deep this dependent coarising is and how deep its appearance and yet to me it seems as clear as clear can beDont say that AnandaDont say thatDeep is this dependent coarising and deep its appearanceIts because of not understanding and not penetrating this Dhamma that this generation is like a tangled skein a knotted ball of string like matted rushes and reeds and does not go beyond transmigration beyond the planes of deprivation woe and bad destinationsIf one is asked Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for aging and death

one delineate when delineating a selfEither delineating a self possessed of form and finite one delineates that My self is possessed of form and finite Or delineating a self possessed of form and infinite one delineates that My self is possessed of form and infinite Or delineating a self formless and finite one delineates that My self is formless and finite Or delineating a self formless and infinite one delineates that My self is formless and infiniteNow the one who when delineating a self delineates it as possessed of form and finite either delineates it as possessed of form and finite in the present or of such a nature that it will become possessed of form and finite or he believes that Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that way This being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self possessed of form and finite obsesses himThe one who when delineating a self delineates it as possessed of form and infinite either delineates it as possessed of form and infinite in the present or of such a nature that it will become possessed of form and infinite or he believes that Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that way

being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self formless and infinite obsesses himTo what extent Ananda does one not delineate when not delineating a selfEither not delineating a self possessed of form and finite one does not delineate that My self is possessed of form and finite Or not delineating a self possessed of form and infinite one does not delineate that My self is possessed of form and infinite Or not delineating a self formless and finite one does not delineate that My self is formless and finite Or not delineating a self formless and infinite one does not delineate that My self is formless and infiniteNow the one who when not delineating a self does not delineate it as possessed of form and finite does not delineate it as possessed of form and finite in the present nor does he delineate it as of such a nature that it will become possessed of form and finite nor does he believe that Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that way This being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self possessed of form and finite does not obsess himThe one who when not delineating a self does not delineate it as possessed of

proper to say that a fixed view of a self formless and infinite does not obsess himTo what extent Ananda does one assume when assuming a selfAssuming feeling to be the self one assumes that Feeling is my self Feeling is not my self My self is oblivious  Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious to feeling but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feelingNow one who says Feeling is my self should be addressed as follows There are these three feelings my friend  feelings of pleasure feelings of pain and feelings of neither pleasure nor painWhich of these three feelings do you assume to be the self At a moment when a feeling of pleasure is sensed no feeling of pain or of neither pleasure nor pain is sensedOnly a feeling of pleasure is sensed at that momentAt a moment when a feeling of pain is sensed no feeling of pleasure or of neither pleasure nor pain is sensedOnly a feeling of pain is sensed at that momentAt a moment when a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed no feeling of pleasure or of pain is sensedOnly a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed at that momentNow a feeling of pleasure is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessationA feeling of pain is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessationA feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessationHaving sensed a feeling of pleasure as my self then with the cessation of ones very own feeling of pleasure my self has perishedHaving sensed a feeling of pain as my self then with the cessation of ones very own feeling of pain my self has perishedHaving sensed a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain as my self then with the cessation of ones very own feeling of neither pleasure nor pain my self has perishedThus he assumes assuming in the immediate present a self inconstant entangled in pleasure and pain subject to arising and passing away he who says Feeling is my self Thus in this manner Ananda one does not see fit to assume feeling to be the selfAs for the person who says Feeling is not the self My self is oblivious he should be addressed as follows My friend where nothing whatsoever is sensed at all would there be the thought I am No lordThus in this manner Ananda one does not see fit to assume that Feeling is not my self My self is obliviousAs for the person who says Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feeling he should be addressed as follows My friend should feelings altogether and every way stop without remainder then with feeling completely not existing owing to the cessation of feeling would there be the thought I am No lordThus in this manner Ananda one does not see fit to assume that Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feelingNow Ananda in as far as a monk does not assume feeling to be the self nor the self as oblivious nor that My self feels in that my self is subject to feeling then not assuming in this way he is not sustained by anything in the worldUnsustained he is not agitatedUnagitated he is totally unbound right withinHe discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldIf anyone were to say with regard to a monk whose mind is thus released that The Tathagata exists after death is his view that would be mistaken that The Tathagata does not exist after death that The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death that The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death is his view that would be mistakenWhyHaving directly known the extent of designation and the extent of the objects of designation the extent of expression and the extent of the objects of expression the extent of description and the extent of the objects of description the extent of discernment and the extent of the objects of discernment the extent to which the cycle revolves Having directly known that the monk is releasedThe monk released having directly known that does not see does not know is his opinion that would be mistakenAnanda there are these seven stations of consciousness and two spheresWhich sevenThere are beings with diversity of body and diversity of perception such as human beings some devas and some beings in the lower realmsThis is the first station of consciousnessThere are beings with diversity of body and singularity of perception such as the devas of the Brahma hosts generated by the first and some beings in the four realms of deprivationThis is the second station of consciousnessThere are beings with singularity of body and diversity of perception such as the Radiant DevasThis is the third station of consciousnessThere are beings with singularity of body and singularity of perception such as the Beautifully Lustrous DevasThis is the fourth station of consciousnessThere are beings whowith the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity Infinite space arrive at the dimension of the infinitude of spaceThis is the fifth station of consciousnessThere are beings who with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space Infinite consciousness arrive at the dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessThis is the sixth station of consciousnessThere are beings who with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness There is nothing arrive at the dimension of nothingnessThis is the seventh station of consciousnessThe dimension of nonpercipient beings and second the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionNow as for the first station of consciousness  beings with diversity of body and diversity of perception such as human beings some devas and some beings in the lower realms If one discerns that discerns its origination discerns its passing away discerns its allure discerns its drawbacks discerns the escape from it would it be proper by means of that to take delight thereNo lordAnanda when knowing  as they actually are  the origination passing away allure drawbacks of  and escape from  these seven stations of consciousness and two spheres a monk is released through lack of clinging he is said to be a monk released through discernmentAnanda there are these eight emancipationsWhich eightPossessed of form one sees formsThis is the first emancipationNot percipient of form internally one sees forms externallyThis is the second emancipationOne is intent only on the beautifulThis is the third emancipationWith the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity Infinite space one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of spaceThis is the fourth emancipationWith the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space Infinite consciousness one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessThis is the fifth emancipationWith the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness There is nothing one enters and remains in the dimension of nothingnessThis is the sixth emancipationWith the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness one enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionThis is the seventh emancipationWith the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception one enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feelingThis is the eighth emancipationNow when a monk attains these eight emancipations in forward order in reverse order in forward and reverse order when he attains them and emerges from them wherever he wants however he wants and for as long as he wants when through the ending of the mental fermentations he enters and remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease and discernmentrelease having directly known it and realized it in the here and now he is said to be a monk released in both waysAnd as for another release in both ways higher or more sublime than this there is noneThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified VenAnanda delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThus I would reconstruct the Pali of the final sentence in this paragraph as Tadabhiññaa vimutto bhikkhu na jaanaati na passati iti saa ditthi tadakallamThis sutta portrays two modes by which the Buddha responded to the controversial issues of his dayThe first mode  illustrated by his contribution to the discussion on the ultimate cessation of perception  was to adopt the terms of the discussion but to invest them with his own meanings and then to try to direct the discussion to the practice leading to the cessation of suffering  stressThe second mode  illustrated by his treatment of whether the cosmos is eternal etc was to declare the issues as unconducive to awakening and to refuse to take a position on themSeveral other suttas  such as MN MN and AN portray the Buddha and his disciples adopting the second modeThis sutta is unusual in its extended portrait of the Buddhas adopting the firstMany of the technical terms he uses here  such as the perception of a refined truth the peak of perception the alert stepby step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception the acquisition of a self  are found no where else in the CanonAt the end of the sutta he describes them as the worlds designations the worlds expressions the worlds ways of speaking the worlds descriptions with which the Tathagata expresses himself but without grasping at them In other words he picks them up for the purpose at hand and then lets them goThus they are not to be regarded as central to his teachingInstead they should be read as examples of his ability to adapt the language of his interlocutors to his own purposesFor this reason this sutta is best read only after you have read other suttas and are familiar with the more central concepts of the Buddhas teachingsOf particular interest here is the Buddhas treatment of the three acquisitions of a self The first  the gross self  refers to the ordinary everyday sense of identifying with ones bodyThe latter two  the mindmade acquisition and the formless acquisition  refer to the sense of self that can be developed in meditationThe mindmade acquisition can result from an experience of the mindmade body  the astral body  that constitutes one of the powers that can be developed through concentration practiceThe formless acquisition can result from any of the formless states of concentration  such as an experience of infinite space infinite consciousness or nothingnessAlthough meditators on experiencing these states might assume that they have encountered their true self the Buddha is careful to note that these are acquisitions and that they are no more ones true self than the body isThey are ones acquisition of a self only for the time that one identifies with themThe Buddha goes on to say that he teaches the Dhamma for the sake of abandoning every acquisition of a self such that when you practice it defiling mental qualities will be abandoned bright mental qualities will grow and you will enter  remain in the culmination  abundance of discernment having known  realized it for yourself in the here  nowI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryNow on that occasion Potthapada the wanderer together with a large following of about wanderers had taken up residence in the debating hall near the Tinduka tree in the singlepavilion park of Queen MallikaThen the Blessed One early in the morning taking his robes  bowl entered Savatthi for almsThen the thought occurred to him While its still too early to go into Savatthi for alms why dont I go to the debating hall near the Tinduka tree in the singlepavilion park of Queen Mallika to see Potthapada the wanderer So he went to the debating hall near the Tinduka tree in the singlepavilion park of Queen MallikaNow on that occasion Potthapada the wanderer was sitting with his large following of wanderers all making a great noise  racket discussing many kinds of bestial topics of conversation conversation about kings robbers  ministers of state armies alarms  battles food  drink clothing furniture garlands  scents relatives vehicles villages towns cities the countryside women  heroes the gossip of the street  the well tales of the dead tales of diversity the creation of the world  of the sea talk of whether things exist or notThen Potthapada the wanderer saw the Blessed One coming from afar and on seeing him hushed his following Be quiet good sirsDont make any noiseHere comes Gotama the contemplativeHe is fond of quietude and speaks in praise of quietudeMaybe if he perceives our group as quiet he will consider it worth his while to come our way So the wanderers fell silentThen the Blessed One went to Potthapada and Potthapada said to him Come Blessed OneWelcome Blessed OneIts been a long time since the Blessed One has gone out of his way to come hereSit down Blessed OneThis seat has been prepared So the Blessed One sat on the prepared seatPotthapada taking a lower seat sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him For what topic of conversation are you gathered together hereIn the midst of what topic of conversation have you been interruptedWhen this was said Potthapada replied Never mind lord about the topic of conversation for which we have gathered hereIt wont be difficult for the Blessed One to hear about that laterFor the past few days a discussion has arisen among the many sects of brahmans  contemplatives gathered and sitting together in the debating hall concerning the ultimate cessation of perception How is there the ultimate cessation of perception With regard to this some said A persons perception arises and ceases without cause without reasonWhen it arises one is percipientWhen it ceases one is not percipient Thats how one group described the ultimate cessation of perceptionThen someone else said No thats not how it isPerception is a persons self which comes and goesWhen it comes one is percipientWhen it goes one is not percipient Thats how one group described the ultimate cessation of perceptionThen someone else said No thats not how it is for there are brahmans  contemplatives of great power great potencyThey draw perception in and out of a personWhen they draw it in one is percipientWhen they draw it out one is not percipient Thats how one group described the ultimate cessation of perceptionThen someone else said No thats not how it is for there are devas of great power great potencyThey draw perception in and out of a personWhen they draw it in one is percipientWhen they draw it out one is not percipient Thats how one group described the ultimate cessation of perceptionThen the memory of the Blessed One arose within me Ah the Blessed OneAh the One Wellgone  who surely is wellskilled in these matters The Blessed One is skilled and expert in the ultimate cessation of perceptionSo what lord is the ultimate cessation of perceptionIn this regard Potthapada those brahmans  contemplatives who say that a persons perception arises  ceases without cause without reason are wrong from the very startWhy is thatBecause a persons perception arises  ceases with a cause with a reasonWith training one perception arises and with training another perception ceasesAnd what is that trainingThere is the case where a Tathagata appears in the world worthy and rightly selfawakenedThis is how a monk is consummate in virtueSeeing that these five hindrances have been abandoned within him he becomes gladGlad he becomes enrapturedEnraptured his body grows tranquilHis body tranquil he is sensitive to pleasureFeeling pleasure his mind becomes concentratedQuite withdrawn from sensual pleasures withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities the monk enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluationHis earlier perception of sensuality ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of seclusionOn that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of seclusionAnd thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceasesThen with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations the monk enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceHis earlier perception of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of seclusion ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of concentrationOn that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of concentrationAnd thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceasesAnd then with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding His earlier perception of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of concentration ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of equanimityOn that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of equanimityAnd thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceasesAnd then with the abandoning of pleasure and pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress  the monk enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpainHis earlier perception of a refined truth of equanimity ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of neither pleasure nor painOn that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of neither pleasure nor painAnd thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceasesAnd then with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity Infinite space the monk enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of spaceHis earlier perception of a refined truth of neither pleasure nor pain ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of spaceOn that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of spaceAnd thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceasesAnd then with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space Infinite consciousness the monk enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessHis earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessOn that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessAnd thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceasesAnd then with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness There is nothing enters  remains in the dimension of nothingnessHis earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of nothingnessOn that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of nothingnessAnd thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceasesNow when the monk is percipient of himself here then from there to there step by step he touches the peak of perceptionAs he remains at the peak of perception the thought occurs to him Thinking is bad for meNot thinking is better for meIf I were to think and will this perception of mine would cease and a grosser perception would appearWhat if I were neither to think nor to will So he neither thinks nor wills and as he is neither thinking nor willing that perception ceases and another grosser perception does not appearHe touches cessationThis Potthapada is how there is the alert stepby step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perceptionNow what do you think Potthapada  have you ever before heard of such an alert stepby step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perceptionNo lordAnd here is how I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One When the monk is percipient of himself here then from there to there step by step he touches the peak of perceptionAs he remains at the peak of perception the thought occurs to him Thinking is bad for meNot thinking is better for meIf I were to think and will this perception of mine would cease and a grosser perception would appearWhat if I were neither to think nor to will So he neither thinks nor wills and as he is neither thinking nor willing that perception ceases and another grosser perception does not appearHe touches cessationThis Potthapada is how there is the alert stepby step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception Thats right PotthapadaBut lord does the Blessed One describe one peak of perception or many peaks of perceptionPotthapada I describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perceptionAnd how does the Blessed One describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perceptionIn whatever way one touches cessation Potthapada thats the way I describe the peak of perceptionThats how I describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perceptionNow lord does perception arise first and knowledge after or does knowledge arise first and perception after or do perception  knowledge arise simultaneouslyPotthapada perception arises first and knowledge afterAnd the arising of knowledge comes from the arising of perceptionOne discerns Its in dependence on this that my knowledge has arisen Through this line of reasoning one can realize how perception arises first and knowledge after and how the arising of knowledge comes from the arising of perceptionNow lord is perception a persons self or is perception one thing and self anotherWhat self do you posit PotthapadaI posit a gross self possessed of form made up of the four great existents feeding on physical foodThen Potthapada your self would be gross possessed of form made up of the four great existents feeding on physical foodThat being the case then for you perception would be one thing and self anotherAnd its through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another even as there remains this gross self  possessed of form made up of the four great existents and feeding on food  one perception arises for that person as another perception passes awayIts through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self anotherThen lord I posit a mindmade self complete in all its parts not inferior in its faculties Then Potthapada your self would be mindmade complete in all its parts not inferior in its facultiesThat being the case then for you perception would be one thing and self anotherAnd its through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another even as there remains this mindmade self  complete in all its parts not inferior in its faculties  one perception arises for that person as another perception passes awayIts through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self anotherThen lord I posit a formless self made of perceptionThen Potthapada your self would be formless and made of perceptionThat being the case then for you perception would be one thing and self anotherAnd its through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another even as there remains this formless self made of perception one perception arises for that person as another perception passes awayIts through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self anotherIs it possible for me to know lord whether perception is a persons self or if perception is one thing and self anotherPotthapada  having other views other practices other satisfactions other aims other teachers  its hard for you to know whether perception is a persons self or if perception is one thing and self anotherWell then lord if  having other views other practices other satisfactions other aims other teachers  its hard for me to know whether perception is a persons self or if perception is one thing and self another then is it the case that the cosmos is eternal that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthlessPotthapada I havent expounded that the cosmos is eternal that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthlessThen is it the case that the cosmos is not eternal that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthlessPotthapada I havent expounded that the cosmos is not eternal that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthlessThen is it the case that the cosmos is finite the cosmos is infinite the soul  the body are the same the soul is one thing and the body another after death a Tathagata exists after death a Tathagata does not exist after death a Tathagata both exists  does not exist after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthlessPotthapada I havent expounded that after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthlessBut why hasnt the Blessed One expounded these thingsBecause they are not conducive to the goal are not conducive to the Dhamma are not basic to the holy lifeThey dont lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingThats why I havent expounded themAnd what has the Blessed One expoundedI have expounded that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stressAnd why has the Blessed One expounded these thingsBecause they are conducive to the goal conducive to the Dhamma and basic to the holy lifeThey lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingThats why I have expounded themSo it is Blessed OneSo it is O One WellgoneWell now its time for the Blessed One to do as he sees fitThen the Blessed One got up from his seat and leftNot long after he had left the wanderers with sneering words jeered at Potthapada the wanderer from all sides So whatever Gotama the contemplative says Sir Potthapada rejoices in his every word So it is Blessed OneSo it is O One Wellgone But we dont understand Gotama the contemplative as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is infinite or the cosmos is finite or whether after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not existWhen this was said Potthapada the wanderer replied to the wanderers I too dont understand Gotama the contemplative as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is infinite or the cosmos is finite or whether after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not existBut Gotama the contemplative describes a genuine authentic and accurate practice grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the DhammaAnd when a genuine authentic and accurate practice grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the Dhamma is being explained why shouldnt a knowledgeable person such as myself rejoice in the wellspokenness of Gotama the contemplatives wellspoken wordsThen two or three days later Citta the elephant trainers son and Potthapada the wanderer went to the Blessed OneOn their arrival Citta bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side while Potthapada the wanderer greeted the Blessed One courteouslyAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One The other day not long after the Blessed One had left the wanderers with sneering words jeered at me from all sides So whatever Gotama the contemplative says Sir Potthapada rejoices in his every word So it is Blessed OneSo it is O One Wellgone But we dont understand Gotama the contemplative as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is infinite or the cosmos is finite or whether after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not existWhen this was said I replied to the wanderers I too dont understand Gotama the contemplative as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is infinite or the cosmos is finite or whether after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not existBut Gotama the contemplative describes a genuine authentic and accurate practice grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the DhammaAnd when a genuine authentic and accurate practice grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the Dhamma is being explained why shouldnt a knowledgeable person such as myself rejoice in the wellspokenness of Gotama the contemplatives wellspoken words Potthapada all those wanderers are blind and have no eyesYou alone among them have eyesI have taught and declared some teachings to be categorical and some teachings to be noncategoricalAnd what are the teachings that I have taught and declared to be noncategoricalThe cosmos is eternal I have taught and declared to be an noncategorical teachingThe cosmos is not eternal The cosmos is finite The cosmos is infinite The soul  the body are the same The soul is one thing and the body another After death a Tathagata exists After death a Tathagata does not exist After death a Tathagata both exists  does not exist After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist I have taught and declared to be an noncategorical teachingAnd why have I taught and declared these teachings to be noncategoricalBecause they are not conducive to the goal are not conducive to the Dhamma are not basic to the holy lifeThey dont lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingThats why I have taught and declared them to be noncategoricalAnd what have I taught and declared to be categorical teachingsThis is stress I have taught and declared to be a categorical teachingThis is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress I have taught and declared to be a categorical teachingAnd why have I taught and declared these teachings to be categoricalBecause they are conducive to the goal conducive to the Dhamma and basic to the holy lifeThey lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingThats why I have taught and declared them to be categoricalThere are some brahmans  contemplatives with a doctrine  view like this After death the self is exclusively happy and free from disease I approached them and asked them Is it true that you have a doctrine  view like this After death the self is exclusively happy and free from disease When asked this they replied Yes So I asked them But do you dwell having known or seen an exclusively happy world When asked this they said No So I asked them But have you ever been aware of a self exclusively happy for a day or a night or for half a day or half a night When asked this they said No So I asked them But do you know that This is the path this is the practice for the realization of an exclusively happy world When asked this they said No So I asked them But have you heard the voices of devas reborn in an exclusively happy world saying Practice well my dearsPractice straightforwardly my dears for the realization of an exclusively happy world because it was through such a practice that we ourselves have been reborn in an exclusively happy world When asked this they said NoSo what do you think Potthapada  when this is the case dont the words of those brahmans  contemplatives turn out to be unconvincingYes lordWhen this is the case the words of those brahmans  contemplatives turn out to be unconvincingPotthapada its as if a man were to say Im in love with the most beautiful woman in this country and other people were to say to him Well my good man this most beautiful woman in this country with whom you are in love do you know if shes of the warrior caste the priestly caste the merchant caste or the laborer caste and when asked this he would say No Then they would say to him Well then do you know her name or clan nameWhether shes tall short or of medium heightWhether shes dark fair or ruddyskinnedDo you know what village or town or city shes from When asked this he would say No Then they would say to him So youve never known or seen the woman youre in love with When asked this he would say YesSo what do you think Potthapada  when this is the case dont the words of that man turn out to be unconvincingYes lord In the same way there are some brahmans  contemplatives with a doctrine  view like this After death the self is exclusively happy and free from disease Dont the words of those brahmans  contemplatives turn out to be unconvincingYes lord Potthapada its as if a man at a crossroads were to build a staircase for ascending to a palace and other people were to say to him Well my good man this palace for which you are building a staircase do you know whether its east west north or south of hereWhether its high low or in between and when asked this he would say No Then they would say to him So you dont know or see the palace for which you are building a staircase When asked this he would say YesSo what do you think Potthapada  when this is the case dont the words of that man turn out to be unconvincingYes lord In the same way there are some brahmans  contemplatives with a doctrine  view like this After death the self is exclusively happy and free from disease Dont the words of those brahmans  contemplatives turn out to be unconvincingYes lordWhen this is the case the words of those brahmans  contemplatives turn out to be unconvincingPotthapada there are these three acquisitions of a self the gross acquisition of a self the mindmade acquisition of a self and the formless acquisition of a selfAnd what is the gross

worlds ways of speaking the worlds descriptions with which the Tathagata expresses himself but without grasping to them When this was said Potthapada the wanderer said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master GotamaMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monksMay Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeBut Citta the elephant trainers son said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master GotamaMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monksLet me obtain the Going Forth in the Blessed Ones presenceLet me obtain AcceptanceSo Citta the elephant trainers son obtained the Going Forth in the Blessed Ones presence he obtained AcceptanceAnd not long after his Acceptance  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute  he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus VenElephanttrainers Son became another one of the arahantsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large community of monks  approximately monks in all  and arrived at SalavatikaNow at that time the brahman Lohicca was reigning with feudatory rights over Salavatika  together with its wealth grass timber  grain  through a royal grant bestowed by King Pasenadi KosalaAnd at that time an evil viewpoint to this effect had arisen to him Suppose that a brahman or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrineHaving arrived at a skillful doctrine he should not declare it to anyone else for what can one person do for anotherIt would be just the same as if having cut through an old bond one were to make another new bondI say that such a thing is an evil greedy deed for what can one person do for anotherThen Lohicca heard it said Gotama the contemplative  the son of the Sakyans having gone forth from the Sakyan clan  on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large community of monks  approximately monks in all  has arrived at SalavatikaAnd of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread He is indeed a Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone a knower of the cosmos an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed teacher of human  divine beings awakened blessedHe has made known  having realized it through direct knowledge  this world with its devas maras  brahmas its generations with their contemplatives  brahmans their rulers  common people has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end has expounded the holy life both in its particulars  in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pureIt is good to see such a worthy one So Lohicca said to Rosika the barber Come dear RosikaGo to Gotama the contemplative and on arrival ask whether he is free from illness  affliction is carefree strong  living in comfort saying The brahman Lohicca Master Gotama asks whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfort And then say May Master Gotama together with the community of monks consent to tomorrows meal with the brahman Lohicca Responding As you say sir to the brahman Lohicca Rosika the barber went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowing down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One The brahman Lohicca lord asks whether the Blessed One is free from illness  affliction is carefree strong  living in comfortAnd he says May the Blessed One together with the community of monks consent to tomorrows meal with the brahman Lohicca The Blessed One consented through silenceThen Rosika the barber understanding the Blessed Ones consent rose from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One circumambulated him  keeping him to his right  and returned to the brahman LohiccaOn arrival he said to him I have informed the Blessed One of your words The brahman Lohicca lord asks whether the Blessed One is free from illness  affliction is carefree strong  living in comfortAnd he says May the Blessed One together with the community of monks consent to tomorrows meal with the brahman Lohicca And the Blessed One has consentedThen as the night was ending the brahman Lohicca had choice staple  nonstaple foods prepared in his own home and then said to Rosika the barber Come dear RosikaGo to Gotama the contemplative and on arrival announce the time It is time Master GotamaThe meal is ready Responding As you say sir to the brahman Lohicca Rosika the barber went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowing down to him stood to one sideAs he was standing there he announced the time It is time lordThe meal is readyThen the Blessed One having put on his robes early in the morning carrying his bowl  outer robe went together with a community of monks to SalavatikaMeanwhile Rosika the barber was following right behind the Blessed One and said to him Lord an evil viewpoint to this effect has arisen to the brahman Lohicca Suppose that a brahman or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrineHaving arrived at a skillful doctrine he should not declare it to anyone else for what can one person do for anotherIt would be just the same as if having cut through an old bond one were to make another new bondI say that such a thing is an evil greedy deed for what can one person do for another It would be good if the Blessed One would extract the brahman Lohicca from this evil viewpointPerhaps that will be RosikaPerhaps that will beThen the Blessed One went to the brahman Lohiccas homeOn arrival he sat down on a seat made readyThe brahman Lohicca with his own hand served  satisfied the Blessed One  the community of monks with choice staple  nonstaple foodsThen when the Blessed One had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl the brahman Lohicca took a lower seat and sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Lohicca that an evil viewpoint to this effect has arisen to you Suppose that a brahman or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrineHaving arrived at a skillful doctrine he should not declare it to anyone else for what can one person do for anotherIt would be just the same as if having cut through an old bond one were to make another new bondI say that such a thing is an evil greedy deed for what can one person do for anotherYes Master GotamaWhat do you think LohiccaDont you reign over SalavatikaYes Master GotamaNow suppose someone were to say The brahman Lohicca reigns over SalavatikaHe alone should consume the fruits  revenues of Salavatika and not share them with others Would someone speaking in this way be a creator of obstacles for your subjects or would he notHe would be a creator of obstacles Master GotamaAnd being a creator of obstacles would he be sympathetic for their welfare or notHe would not be sympathetic for their welfare Master GotamaAnd in one not sympathetic for their welfare would his mind be established in good will for them or in animosityIn animosity Master GotamaWhen the mind is established in animosity is there wrong view or right viewWrong view Master GotamaNow for one of wrong view Lohicca I tell you there is one of two destinations either hell or the animal wombWhat do you think LohiccaDoesnt King Pasenadi Kosala reign over Kasi  KosalaYes Master GotamaNow suppose someone were to say King Pasenadi Kosala reigns over Kasi  KosalaHe alone should consume the fruits  revenues of Kasi  Kosala and not share them with others Would someone speaking in this way be a creator of obstacles for King Pasenadis subjects  you  others  or would he notHe would be a

Master GotamaNow for one of wrong view Lohicca I tell you there is one of two destinations either hell or the animal wombSo then Lohicca if anyone were to say The brahman Lohicca reigns over SalavatikaHe alone should consume the fruits  revenues of Salavatika and not share them with others he speaking in this way would be a creator of obstacles for your subjectsBeing a creator of obstacles he would not be sympathetic for their welfareIn one not sympathetic for their welfare the mind would be established in animosity for themWhen the mind is established in animosity there is wrong viewFor one of wrong view I tell you there is one of two destinations either hell or the animal wombIn the same way if anyone were to say Suppose that a brahman or contemplative were to arrive

one were to make another new bondI say that such a thing is an evil greedy deed for what can one person do for another  he speaking in this way would be a creator of obstacles for those children of good family who coming to the doctrine  discipline revealed by the Tathagata attain the sort of grand distinction where they attain the fruit of streamentry the fruit of oncereturning the fruit of nonreturning the fruit of arahantship and for those who ripen deva wombs for the sake of bringing about the deva stateBeing a creator of obstacles he would not be sympathetic for their welfareIn one not sympathetic for their welfare the mind would be established in animosity for themWhen the mind is established in animosity there is wrong viewFor one of wrong view I tell you there is one of two

these three sorts of teacher who are worthy of criticism in the world and when anyone criticizes these sorts of teachers the criticism is true factual righteous  unblameworthyWhich threeThere is the case where a certain teacher has not attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth from the home life into homelessnessHe not having attained that goal of the contemplative life teaches his disciples This is for your welfareThis is for your happiness His disciples dont listen dont lend ear dont put forth an intent for gnosisThey practice in a way deviating from the teachers instructionsHe should be criticized saying You venerable sir have not attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth from the home life into homelessnessNot having attained that goal of the contemplative life you teach your disciples This is for your welfareThis is for your happiness Your disciples dont listen dont lend ear dont put forth an intent for gnosis and practice in a way deviating from the teachers instructionsIts just as if a man were to pursue who pulls away or to embrace one who turns her backI say that such a thing is an evil greedy deed for what can one person do for another This is the first teacher who is worthy of criticism in the world and when anyone criticizes this sort of teacher the criticism is true factual righteous  unblameworthyThen there is the case where a certain teacher has not attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth from the home life into homelessnessHe not having attained that goal of the contemplative life teaches his disciples This is for your welfareThis is for your happiness His disciples listen lend ear put forth an intent for gnosis and practice in a way not deviating from the teachers instructionsHe should be criticized saying You venerable sir have not attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth from the home life into homelessnessNot having attained that goal of the contemplative life you teach your disciples This is for your welfareThis is for your happiness Your disciples listen lend ear put forth an intent for gnosis and practice in a way not deviating from the teachers instructionsIts just as if a man neglecting his own field were to imagine that anothers field should be weededI say that such a thing is an evil greedy deed for what can one person do for another This is the second teacher who is worthy of criticism in the world and when anyone criticizes this sort of teacher the criticism is true factual righteous  unblameworthyThen there is the case where a certain teacher has attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth from the home life into homelessnessHe having attained that goal of the contemplative life teaches his disciples This is for your welfareThis is for your happiness His disciples dont listen dont lend ear dont put forth an intent for gnosisThey practice in a way deviating from the teachers instructionsHe should be criticized saying You venerable sir have attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth from the home life into homelessnessHaving attained that goal of the contemplative life you teach your disciples This is for your welfareThis is for your happiness Your disciples dont listen dont lend ear dont put forth an intent for gnosis and practice in a way deviating from the teachers instructionsIts just as if having cut through an old bond one were to make another new bondI say that such a thing is an evil greedy deed for what can one person do for another This is the third teacher who is worthy of criticism in the world and when anyone criticizes this sort of teacher the criticism is true factual righteous  unblameworthyWhen this was said the brahman Lohicca said to the Blessed One But is there Master Gotama any teacher who is not worthy of criticism in the worldThere is Lohicca a teacher who is not worthy of criticism in the worldBut which teacher Master Gotama is not worthy of criticism in the worldThere is the case Lohicca where a Tathagata appears in the world worthy  rightly selfawakenedHe teaches the Dhamma admirable in its beginning admirable in its middle admirable in its endHe proclaims the holy life both in its particulars  in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pureA householder or householders son hearing the Dhamma gains conviction in the Tathagata and reflects Household life is confining a dusty pathThe life gone forth is like the open airIt is not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shellWhat if I were to shave off my hair  beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessnessSo after some time he abandons his mass of wealth large or small leaves his circle of relatives large or small shaves off his hair  beard puts on the ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessnessWhen he has thus gone forth he lives restrained by the rules of the monastic code seeing danger in the slightest faultsConsummate in his virtue he guards the doors of his senses is possessed of mindfulness  alertness and is contentEndowed with this noble aggregate of virtue this noble restraint over the sense faculties this noble mindfulness  alertness and this noble contentment he seeks out a secluded dwelling a wilderness the shade of a tree a mountain a glen a hillside cave a charnel ground a forest grove the open air a heap of strawAfter his meal returning from his alms round he sits down crosses his legs holds his body erect and brings mindfulness to the foreAbandoning covetousness with regard to the world he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousnessHe cleanses his mind of covetousnessAbandoning ill will  anger he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will sympathetic with the welfare of all living beingsHe cleanses his mind of ill will  angerAbandoning sloth  drowsiness he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth  drowsiness mindful alert percipient of lightHe cleanses his mind of sloth  drowsinessAbandoning restlessness  anxiety he dwells undisturbed his mind inwardly stilledHe cleanses his mind of restlessness  anxietyAbandoning uncertainty he dwells having crossed over uncertainty with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualitiesHe cleanses his mind of uncertaintySuppose that a man taking a loan invests it in his business affairsHis business affairs succeedHe repays his old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining his wifeThe thought would occur to him Before taking a loan I invested it in my business affairsNow my business affairs have succeededI have repaid my old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining my wife Because of that he would experience joy  happinessNow suppose that a man falls sick  in pain  seriously illHe does not enjoy his meals and there is no strength in his bodyAs time passes he eventually recovers from that sicknessHe enjoys his meals and there is strength in his bodyThe thought would occur to him Before I was sick Now I am recovered from that sicknessI enjoy my meals and there is strength in my body Because of that he would experience joy  happinessNow suppose that a man is bound in prisonAs time passes he eventually is released from that bondage safe  sound with no loss of propertyThe thought would occur to him Before I was bound in prisonNow I am released from that bondage safe  sound with no loss of my property Because of that he would experience joy  happinessNow suppose that a man is a slave subject to others not subject to himself unable to go where he likesAs time passes he eventually is released from that slavery subject to himself not subject to others freed able to go where he likesThe thought would occur to him Before I was a slave Now I am released from that slavery subject to myself not subject to others freed able to go where I like Because of that he would experience joy  happinessNow suppose that a man carrying money  goods is traveling by a road through desolate countryAs time passes he eventually emerges from that desolate country safe  sound with no loss of propertyThe thought would occur to him Before carrying money  goods I was traveling by a road through desolate countryNow I have emerged from that desolate country safe  sound with no loss of my property Because of that he would experience joy  happinessIn the same way when these five hindrances are not abandoned in himself the monk regards it as a debt a sickness a prison slavery a road through desolate countryBut when these five hindrances are abandoned in himself he regards it as unindebtedness good health release from prison freedom a place of securitySeeing that they have been abandoned within him he becomes gladGlad he becomes enrapturedEnraptured his body grows tranquilHis body tranquil he is sensitive to pleasureFeeling pleasure his mind becomes concentratedQuite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters and remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluationHe permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the rapture  pleasure born from withdrawalJust as if a skilled bathman or bathmans apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together sprinkling it again  again with water so that his ball of bath powder  saturated moistureladen permeated within  without  would nevertheless not drip even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of withdrawalThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born from withdrawalWhen a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction Lohicca that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher the criticism would be false unfactual unrighteous  blameworthyFurthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceHe permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of composureJust like a lake with springwater welling up from within having no inflow from the east west north or south and with the skies supplying abundant showers time  again so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate  pervade suffuse  fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of composureThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born of composureWhen a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction Lohicca that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher the criticism would be false unfactual unrighteous  blameworthyAnd furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the pleasure divested of raptureJust as in a lotus pond some of the lotuses born  growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated  pervaded suffused  filled with cool water from their roots to their tips and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water even so the monk permeates this very body with the pleasure divested of raptureThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of raptureWhen a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction Lohicca that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher the criticism would be false unfactual unrighteous  blameworthyAnd furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpainHe sits permeating the body with a pure bright awarenessJust as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating the body with a pure bright awarenessThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awarenessWhen a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction Lohicca that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher the criticism would be false unfactual unrighteous  blameworthyWith his mind thus concentrated purified  bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge  visionHe discerns This body of mine is endowed with form composed of the four primary elements born from mother  father nourished with rice  porridge subject to inconstancy rubbing pressing dissolution  dispersionAnd this consciousness of mine is supported here and bound up here Just as if there were a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water  eight faceted well polished clear limpid consummate in all its aspects and going through the middle of it was a blue yellow red white or brown thread  and a man with good eyesight taking it in his hand were to reflect on it thus This is a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water eight faceted well polished clear limpid consummate in all its aspectsAnd this going through the middle of it is a blue yellow red white or brown thread In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified  bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability  the monk directs  inclines it to knowledge  visionHe

defects pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability he directs  inclines it to creating a mindmade bodyFrom this body he creates another body endowed with form made of the mind complete in all its parts not inferior in its facultiesJust as if a man were to draw a reed from its sheathThe thought would occur to him This is the sheath this is the reedThe sheath is one thing the reed another but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath Or as if a man were to draw a sword from its scabbardThe thought would occur to him This is the sword this is the scabbardThe sword is one thing the scabbard another but the sword has been drawn out from the scabbard Or as if a man were to pull a snake out from its sloughThe thought would occur to him This is the snake this is the sloughThe snake is one thing the slough another but the snake has been pulled out from the slough In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified  bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable

imperturbability he directs  inclines it to the modes of supranormal powersHe wields manifold supranormal powersHaving been one he becomes many having been many he becomes oneHe appearsHe vanishesHe goes unimpeded through walls ramparts  mountains as if through spaceHe dives in  out of the earth as if it were waterHe walks on water without sinking as if it were dry landSitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged birdWith his hand he touches  strokes even the sun  moon so mighty  powerfulHe exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worldsJust as a skilled potter or his assistant could craft from wellprepared clay whatever kind of pottery vessel he likes or as a skilled ivorycarver or his assistant could craft from wellprepared ivory any kind of ivorywork he likes or as a skilled goldsmith or his assistant could craft from wellprepared gold any kind of gold article he likes in the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified  bright

seized by the hair another man who was falling into the pit of hell were to pull him up  set him on firm groundIn the same way Master Gotama has pulled me up as I was falling into the pit of hell and has set me on firm groundMagnificent Master GotamaMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monksMay Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeSamsara literally means wanderingon Many people think of it as the Buddhist name for the place where we currently live  the place we leave when we go to nibbanaBut in the early Buddhist texts its the answer not to the question Where are we but to the question What are we doing Instead of a place its a process the tendency to keep creating worlds and then moving into themAs one world falls apart you create another one and go thereAt the same time you bump into other people who are creating their own worlds tooThe play and creativity in the process can sometimes be enjoyableIn fact it would be perfectly innocuous if it didnt entail so much sufferingThe worlds we create keep caving in and killing usMoving into a new world requires effort not only the pains and risks of taking birth but also the hard knocks  mental and physical  that come from going through childhood into adulthood over and over againThe Buddha once asked his monks Which do you think is greater the water in the oceans or the tears youve shed while wandering on His answer the tearsThink of that the next time you gaze at the ocean or play in its wavesIn addition to creating suffering for ourselves the worlds we create feed off the worlds of others just as theirs feed off oursIn some cases the feeding may be mutually enjoyable and beneficial but even then the arrangement has to come to an endMore typically it causes harm to at least one side of the relationship often to bothWhen you think of all the suffering that goes into keeping just one person clothed fed sheltered and healthy  the suffering both for those who have to pay for these requisites as well as those who have to labor or die in their production  you see how exploitative even the most rudimentary process of worldbuilding can beThis is why the Buddha tried to find the way to stop samsaraingOnce he had found it he encouraged others to follow it tooBecause samsaraing is something that each of us does each of us has to stop it him or her self aloneIf samsara were a place it might seem selfish for one person to look for an escape leaving others behindBut when you realize that its a process theres nothing selfish about stopping it at allIts like giving up an addiction or an abusive habitWhen you learn the skills needed to stop creating your own worlds of suffering you can share those skills with others so that they can stop creating theirsAt the same time youll never have to feed off the worlds of others so to that extent youre lightening their load as wellIts true that the Buddha likened the practice for stopping samsara to the act of going from one place to another from this side of a river to the further shoreBut the passages where he makes this comparison often end with a paradox the further shore has no here no there no in between From that perspective its obvious that samsaras parameters of space and time were not the preexisting context in which we wanderedThey were the result of our wanderingFor someone addicted to worldbuilding the lack of familiar parameters sounds unsettlingBut if youre tired of creating incessant unnecessary suffering you might want to give it a tryAfter all you could always resume building if the lack of here or there turned out to be dullBut of those who have learned how to break the habit no one has ever felt tempted to samsara againI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Nalanda in Pavarikas mango groveThen Kevatta the householder approached the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord this Nalanda is powerful both prosperous and populous filled with people who have faith in the Blessed OneIt would be good if the Blessed One were to direct a monk to display a miracle of psychic power from his superior human state so that Nalanda would to an even greater extent have faith in the Blessed OneWhen this was said the Blessed One said to Kevatta the householder Kevatta I dont teach the monks in this way Come monks display a miracle of psychic power to the lay people clad in white A second time A third time Kevatta the householder said to the Blessed One I wont argue with the Blessed One but I tell you Lord this Nalanda is powerful both prosperous and populous filled with people who have faith in the Blessed OneIt would be good if the Blessed One were to direct a monk to display a miracle of psychic power from his superior human state so that Nalanda would to an even greater extent have faith in the Blessed OneA third time the Blessed One said to Kevatta the householder Kevatta I dont teach the monks in this way Come monks display a miracle of psychic power to the lay people clad in whiteKevatta there are these three miracles that I have declared having directly known and realized them for myselfWhich threeThe miracle of psychic power the miracle of telepathy and the miracle of instructionAnd what is the miracle of psychic powerThere is the case where a monk wields manifold psychic powersHaving been one he becomes many having been many he becomes oneHe appearsHe vanishesHe goes unimpeded through walls ramparts and mountains as if through spaceHe dives in and out of the earth as if it were waterHe walks on water without sinking as if it were dry landSitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged birdWith his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon so mighty and powerfulHe exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worldsThen someone who has faith and conviction in him sees him wielding manifold psychic powers exercising influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worldsHe reports this to someone who has no faith and no conviction telling him Isnt it awesomeIsnt it astounding how great the power how great the prowess of this contemplativeJust now I saw him wielding manifold psychic powers exercising influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worldsThen the person without faith without conviction would say to the person with faith and with conviction Sir there is a charm called the Gandhari charm by which the monk wielded manifold psychic powers exercising influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds What do you think Kevatta  isnt that what the man without faith without conviction would say to the man with faith and with convictionYes lord thats just what he would saySeeing this drawback to the miracle of psychic power Kevatta I feel horrified humiliated and disgusted with the miracle of psychic powerAnd what is the miracle of telepathyThere is the case where a monk reads the minds the mental events the thoughts the ponderings of other beings other individuals Such is your thinking here is where your thinking is thus is your mindThen someone who has faith and conviction in him sees him reading the minds of other beings He reports this to someone who has no faith and no conviction telling him Isnt it awesomeIsnt it astounding how great the power how great the prowess of this contemplativeJust now I saw him reading the minds of other beingsThen the person without faith without conviction would say to the person with faith and with conviction Sir there is a charm called the Manika charm by which the monk read the minds of other beings What do you think Kevatta  isnt that what the man without faith without conviction would say to the man with faith and with convictionYes lord thats just what he would saySeeing this drawback to the miracle of telepathy Kevatta I feel horrified humiliated and disgusted with the miracle of telepathyAnd what is the miracle of instructionThere is the case where a monk gives instruction in this way Direct your thought in this way dont direct it in thatAttend to things in this way dont attend to them in thatLet go of this enter and remain in that This Kevatta is called the miracle of instructionFurthermore there is the case where a Tathagata appears in the world worthy and rightly selfawakenedHe teaches the Dhamma admirable in its beginning admirable in its middle admirable in its endHe proclaims the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pureA householder or householders son hearing the Dhamma gains conviction in the Tathagata and reflects Household life is confining a dusty pathThe life gone forth is like the open airIt is not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shellWhat if I were to shave off my hair and beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessnessSo after some time he abandons his mass of wealth large or small leaves his circle of relatives large or small shaves off his hair and beard puts on the ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessnessWhen he has thus gone forth he lives restrained by the rules of the monastic code seeing danger in the slightest faultsConsummate in his virtue he guards the doors of his senses is

wifeThe thought would occur to him Before taking a loan I invested it in my business affairsNow my business affairs have succeededI have repaid my old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining my wife Because of that he would experience joy and happinessNow suppose that a man falls sick  in pain and seriously illHe does not enjoy his meals and there is no strength in his bodyAs time passes he eventually recovers from that sicknessHe enjoys his meals and there is strength in his bodyThe thought would occur to him Before I was sick Now I am recovered from that sicknessI enjoy my meals and there is strength in my body Because of that he would experience joy and happinessNow suppose that a man is bound in prisonAs time passes he eventually is released from that bondage safe

himself the monk regards it as a debt a sickness a prison slavery a road through desolate countryBut when these five hindrances are abandoned in himself he regards it as unindebtedness good health release from prison freedom a place of securitySeeing that they have been abandoned within him he becomes gladGlad he becomes enrapturedEnraptured his body grows tranquilHis body tranquil he is sensitive to pleasureFeeling pleasure his mind becomes concentratedQuite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters and remains in the first jhana rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought and evaluationHe permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born from withdrawalJust as if a skilled bathman or bathmans apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together sprinkling it again and again with water so that his ball of bath powder  saturated moistureladen permeated within and without  would nevertheless not drip even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of withdrawalThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born from withdrawalThis too is called the miracle of instructionFurthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters and remains in the second jhana rapture and pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation  internal assuranceHe permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composureJust like a lake with springwater welling up from within having no inflow from the east west north or south and with the skies supplying abundant showers time and again so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate and pervade suffuse and fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composureThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born of composureThis too is called the miracle of instructionAnd furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding He permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the pleasure divested of raptureJust as in a lotus pond some of the lotuses born and growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated and pervaded suffused and filled with cool water from their roots to their tips and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water even so the monk permeates this very body with the pleasure divested of raptureThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of raptureThis too is called the miracle of instructionAnd furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure and stress  as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress  he enters and remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neitherpleasure nor stressHe sits permeating the body with a pure bright awarenessJust as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating the body with a pure bright awarenessThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awarenessThis too is called the miracle of instructionWith his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge and visionHe discerns This body of mine is endowed with form composed of the four primary elements born from mother and father nourished with rice and porridge subject to inconstancy rubbing pressing dissolution and dispersionAnd this consciousness of mine is supported here and bound up here Just as if there were a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water  eight faceted well polished clear limpid consummate in all its aspects and going through the middle of it was a blue yellow red white or brown thread  and a man with good eyesight taking it in his hand were to reflect on it thus This is a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water eight faceted well polished clear limpid consummate in all its aspectsAnd this going through the middle of it is a blue yellow red white or brown thread In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant

called the miracle of instructionWith his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to creating a mindmade bodyFrom this body he creates another body endowed with form made of the mind complete in all its parts not inferior in its facultiesJust as if a man were to draw a reed from its sheathThe thought would occur to him This is the sheath this is the reedThe sheath is one thing the reed another but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath Or as if a man were to draw a sword from its scabbardThe thought would occur to him This is the sword this is the scabbardThe sword is one thing the scabbard another but the sword has been drawn out from the scabbard Or as if a man were to pull a snake out from its sloughThe thought would occur to him This is the snake this is the sloughThe snake is one thing the slough another but the snake has been pulled out from the slough In the

sun and moon so mighty and powerfulHe exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worldsJust as a skilled potter or his assistant could craft from wellprepared clay whatever kind of pottery vessel he likes or as a skilled ivorycarver or his assistant could craft from wellprepared ivory any kind of ivorywork he likes or as a skilled goldsmith or his assistant could craft from wellprepared gold any kind of gold article he likes in the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to

unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past livesHe recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose thereThere too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose here Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and detailsJust as if a man were to go from his home village to another village and then from that village to yet another village and then from that village back to his home villageThe thought would occur to him I went from my home village to that village over thereThere I stood in such a way sat in such a way talked in such a way and remained silent in such a wayFrom that village I went to that village over there and there I stood in such a way sat in such a way talked in such a way and remained silent in

reappearance of beingsHe sees  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellBut these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world Thus  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kammaJust as if there were a tall building in the central square and a man with good eyesight standing on top of it were to see people entering a house leaving it walking along the street and sitting in the central squareThe thought would occur to him These people are entering a house leaving it walking along the streets and sitting in the central square In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to

thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentationsHe discerns as it has come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are mental fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentation of sensuality the fermentation of becoming the fermentation of ignoranceWith release there is the knowledge Released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this world Just as if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen  clear limpid and unsullied  where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells gravel and pebbles and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting and it would occur to him This pool of water is clear limpid and unsulliedHere are these shells gravel and pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability  the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentationsHe discerns as it has come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress

release there is the knowledge Released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThis too is called the miracle of instructionThese are the three miracles that I declare Kevatta having directly known and realized them for myselfOnce Kevatta this train of thought arose in the awareness of a certain monk in this very community of monks Where do these four great elements  the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property  cease without remainder Then he attained to such a state of concentration that the way leading to the gods appeared in his centered mindSo he approached the gods of the retinue of the Four Great Kings and on arrival asked them Friends where do these four great elements  the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property  cease without remainderWhen this was said the gods of the retinue of the Four Great Kings said to the monk We also dont know where the four great elements cease without remainderBut there are the Four Great Kings who are higher and more sublime than weThey should know where the four great elements cease without remainderSo the monk approached the Four Great Kings and on arrival asked them Friends where do these four great elements cease without remainderWhen this was said the Four Great Kings said to the monk We also dont know where the four great elements cease without remainderBut there are the gods of the Thirtythree who are higher and more sublime than weThey should knowSo the monk approached the gods of the Thirtythree and on arrival asked them Friends where do these four great elements cease without remainderWhen this was said the gods of the Thirtythree said to the monk We also dont know where the four great elements cease without remainderBut there is Sakka the ruler of the gods who is higher and more sublime than weHe should know So the monk approached Sakka the ruler of the gods and on arrival asked him Friend where do these four great elements cease without remainderWhen this was said Sakka the ruler of the gods said to the monk I also dont know where the four great elements cease without remainderBut there are the Yama gods who are higher and more sublime than They should knowThe Yama gods said We also dont know But there is the god named Suyama He should knowSuyama said I also dont know But there is the god named Santusita He should knowSantusita said I also dont know But there are the Nimmanarati gods They should knowThe Nimmanarati gods said We also dont know But there is the god named Sunimmita He should knowSunimmita said I also dont know But there are the Paranimmitavasavatti gods They should knowThe Paranimmitavasavatti gods said We also dont know But there is the god named Paranimmita Vasavatti He should knowSo the monk approached the god Vasavatti and on arrival asked him Friend where do these four great elements cease without remainderWhen this was said the god Vasavatti said to the monk I also dont know where the four great elements cease without remainderBut there are the gods of the retinue of Brahma who are higher and more sublime than They should know where the four great elements cease without remainderThen the monk attained to such a state of concentration that the way leading to the gods of the retinue of Brahma appeared in his centered mindSo he approached the gods of the retinue of Brahma and on arrival asked them Friends where do these four great elements  the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property  cease without remainderWhen this was said the gods of the retinue of Brahma said to the monk We also dont know where the four great elements cease without remainderBut there is Brahma the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Sovereign Lord the Maker Creator Chief Appointer and Ruler Father of All That Have Been and Shall BeHe is higher and more sublime than weHe should know where the four great elements cease without remainderBut where friends is the Great Brahma nowMonk we also dont know where Brahma is or in what way Brahma isBut when signs appear light shines forth and a radiance appears Brahma will appearFor these are the portents of Brahmas appearance light shines forth and a radiance appearsThen it was not long before Brahma appearedSo the monk approached the Great Brahma and on arrival said Friend where do these four great elements  the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property  cease without remainderWhen this was said the Great Brahma said to the monk I monk am Brahma the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Sovereign Lord the Maker Creator Chief Appointer and Ruler Father of All That Have Been and Shall BeA second time the monk said to the Great Brahma Friend I didnt ask you if you were Brahma the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Sovereign Lord the Maker Creator Chief Appointer and Ruler Father of All That Have Been and Shall BeI asked you where these four great elements  the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property  cease without remainderA second time the Great Brahma said to the monk I monk am Brahma the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Sovereign Lord the Maker Creator Chief Appointer and Ruler Father of All That Have Been and Shall BeA third time the monk said to the Great Brahma Friend I didnt ask you if you were Brahma the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Sovereign Lord the Maker Creator Chief Appointer and Ruler Father of All That Have Been and Shall BeI asked you where these four great elements  the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property  cease without remainderThen the Great Brahma taking the monk by the arm and leading him off to one side said to him These gods of the retinue of Brahma believe There is nothing that the Great Brahma does not knowThere is nothing that the Great Brahma does not seeThere is nothing of which the Great Brahma is unawareThere is nothing that the Great Brahma has not realized That is why I did not say in their presence that I too dont know where the four great elements cease without remainderSo you have acted wrongly acted incorrectly in bypassing the Blessed One in search of an answer to this question elsewhereGo right back to the Blessed One and on arrival ask him this questionHowever he answers it you should take it to heartThen  just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm  the monk disappeared from the Brahma world and immediately appeared in front of meHaving bowed down to me he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to me Lord where do these four great elements  the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property  cease without remainderWhen this was said I said to him Once monk some seafaring merchants took a shoresighting bird and set sail in their shipWhen they could not see the shore they released the shoresighting birdIt flew to the east south west north straight up and to all the intermediate points of the compassIf it saw the shore in any direction it flew thereIf it did not see the shore in any direction it returned right back to the shipIn the same way monk having gone as far as the Brahma world in search of an answer to your question you have come right back to my presenceYour question should not be phrased in this way Where do these four great elements  the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property  cease without remainderInstead it should be phrased like thisAnd the answer to that isThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified Kevatta the householder delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThe translation of the Mahaparinibbana Sutta which is offered here is a work of collaboration but is based upon a text prepared by Sister Vajira of Germany to whom credit for the initial work must be givenThe final revision of the text was done by Mr Francis StoryThe notes and references which it is hoped will help in the understanding of the text have been contributed by the Venerable Nyanaponika Mahathera much of the material for them being taken from the Pali CommentaryEvery effort has been made to give a faithful rendering of the original PaliThe greater part of the sutta is straight forward narrative but it also includes references to profound aspects of the Dhamma which have to be understood in their precise meaning if the full import of the Buddhas last exhortations is to be conveyedIn the choice which inevitably arises between terminological exactitude and literary form the translators have endeavored to preserve the former with as little sacrifice as possible of the latterThose who understand the difficulties of Pali translation will appreciate that this is no easy task and will readily overlook the absence of those literary graces which only a freer rendering would have permittedAs in previous translations some repetitions have been omitted and some repetitive passages condensed Buddhist Publication SocietyIn this revised edition of Last Days of the Buddha a number of stylistic changes have been made aimed at improved readabilityThe word Bhagava untranslated in the original edition has been replaced by the Blessed One several archaic expressions which gave a slightly Biblical flavor to the diction have been replaced by their modern counterparts awkward sentences have been reformulated and greater consistency was aimed at in the rendering of certain terms and expressionsThe notes have also been revised in certain respectsThe titles of the chapters and sections have been supplied by the translator and editors though the division of the work into six recitation units dates back to the period when the Canon was transmitted orally from one generation to the nextOf the thirtyfour discourses that make up the Digha Nikaya ours the sixteenth is the longest and so altogether maintains the first place where length is concernedIt preserves the principal feature of the Buddhist sutta insofar as it is like others a rehearsal of events as they have been witnessedOn account of its unique composition however it is more than other suttas capable not only of winning the affection of the pious Buddhist as it naturally does but also of attracting the general reader since it is indeed a fine specimen of sacred universal literatureIt gives a good general idea of the Buddhas Teaching too even though it hardly offers anything that is not found  and often more extensively dealt with  in other suttasAt the end of his life after almost half a centurys ministry the Master had long since taught all that was necessary for attaining the idealDuring the last period his primary concern therefore was to impress on his followers the necessity of unflinchingly putting into practice those very same teachings an appeal that could of course hardly fail in stirring their hearts more than ever beforeThe Sangha came indeed to witness the greatest event in its history and was keenly aware of it especially since the Master had announced his Parinibbana three months aheadThe impression on the bhikkhus who flocked to him in large numbers as he was pressing northward was tremendous and could not fail to be reflected vividly in the oral accountBecause of its particular import and abundance this material was soon formed into one body and so our sutta came to beIn this connection it is hardly possible not to remember gratefully the Venerable AnandaHis share in the preservation of the Masters word is paramount to any other bhikkhus and his figure is inseparable from our textsThis was to become manifest for all time in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta which is plainly unimaginable without himFor it is Ananda and again Ananda whom the Master addresses having tested for twentyfive years his sure grasp and brilliant memory and also his indefatigable personal devotionBut Ananda too here more than elsewhere by his constant queries worries and amazements becomes without intending it a central figure beside the Master himself which undoubtedly increases the attractiveness of the textThus then Ananda gentle and pleasant as his name and yet almost throughout his career incurring the reproach of the brethren was immortalized along with his beloved Master and  as we may add  along with his strange position between praise and blame assuming mystic character in the third chapterThe third chapter almost exclusively is devoted to depicting the circumstances connected with the Masters relinquishment of life which is the dramatic culmination of eventsIt overwhelmingly drives home the purely metaphysical significance of the Parinibbana or at least ought to do soFor the Buddha neither succumbed to his fatal illness nor did he give way to the appeal of Mara but sovereignly let go of existence at a timely hour just as fortyfive years earlier on becoming fully enlightened he had duly taken upon himself the wearisome task of teaching menThis fact is most thoughtprovoking and consistently leads to the conclusion that by his Parinibbana indeed the Buddha bore the last and highest possible testimony to his Teaching which permits of no lingering inclination to selfpreservation and continuance but on the contrary reaches the highest exultation ending it allThe Masters Parinibbana is therefore the one sorrowful event in the history of Buddhism that turns out in its true meaning to be really the most blissfulThus have I heardOnce the Blessed One dwelt at Rajagaha on the hill called Vultures PeakAt that time the king of Magadha Ajatasattu son of the Videhi queen desired to wage war against the VajjisHe spoke in this fashion These Vajjis powerful and glorious as they are I shall annihilate them I shall make them perish I shall utterly destroy themAnd Ajatasattu the king of Magadha addressed his chief minister the brahman Vassakara saying Come brahman go to the Blessed One pay homage in my name at his feet wish him good health strength ease vigour and comfort and speak thus O Lord Ajatasattu the king of Magadha desires to wage war against the VajjisHe has spoken in this fashion These Vajjis powerful and glorious as they are I shall annihilate them I shall make them perish I shall utterly destroy them And whatever the Blessed One should answer you keep it well in mind and inform me for Tathagatas do not speak falselyVery well sire said the brahman Vassakara in assent to Ajatasattu king of MagadhaAnd he ordered a large number of magnificent carriages to be made ready mounted one himself and accompanied by the rest drove out to Rajagaha towards Vultures PeakHe went by carriage as far as the carriage could go then dismounting he approached the Blessed One on footAfter exchanging courteous greetings with the Blessed One together with many pleasant words he sat down at one side and addressed the Blessed One thus Venerable Gotama Ajatasattu the king of Magadha pays homage at the feet of the Venerable Gotama and wishes him good health strength ease vigour and comfortHe desires to wage war against the Vajjis and he has spoken in this fashion These Vajjis powerful and glorious as they are I shall annihilate them I shall make them perish I shall utterly destroy them At that time the Venerable Ananda was standing behind the Blessed One fanning him and the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda thus What have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis have frequent gatherings and are their meetings well attendedI have heard Lord that this is soSo long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their declineWhat have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis assemble and disperse peacefully and attend to their affairs in concordI have heard Lord that they doSo long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their declineWhat have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis neither enact new decrees nor abolish existing ones but proceed in accordance with their ancient constitutionsI have heard Lord that they doSo long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their declineWhat have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis show respect honor esteem and veneration towards their elders and think it worthwhile to listen to themI have heard Lord that they doSo long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their declineWhat have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis refrain from abducting women and maidens of good families and from detaining themI have heard Lord that they refrain from doing soSo long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their declineWhat have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis show respect honor esteem and veneration towards their shrines both those within the city and those outside it and do not deprive them of the due offerings as given and made to them formerlyI have heard Lord that they do venerate their shrines and that they do not deprive them of their offeringsSo long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their declineWhat have you heard Ananda do the Vajjis duly protect and guard the arahats so that those who have not come to the realm yet might do so and those who have already come might live there in peaceI have heard Lord that they doSo long Ananda as this is the case the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected not their declineAnd the Blessed One addressed the brahman Vassakara in these words Once brahman I dwelt at Vesali at the Sarandada shrine and there it was that I taught the Vajjis these seven conditions leading to welfareSo long brahman as these endure among the Vajjis and the Vajjis are known for it their growth is to be expected not their declineThereupon the brahman Vassakara spoke thus to the Blessed One If the Vajjis Venerable Gotama were endowed with only one or another of these conditions leading to welfare their growth would have to be expected not their declineWhat then of all the sevenNo harm indeed can be done to the Vajjis in battle by Magadhas king Ajatasattu except through treachery or discordWell then Venerable Gotama we will take our leave for we have much to perform much work to doDo as now seems fit to you brahman And the brahman Vassakara the chief minister of Magadha approving of the Blessed Ones words and delighted by them rose from his seat and departedThen soon after Vassakaras departure the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda thus Go now Ananda and assemble in the hall of audience as many bhikkhus as live around RajagahaVery well Lord And the Venerable Ananda did as he was requested and informed the Blessed One The community of bhikkhus is assembled LordNow let the Blessed One do as he wishesThereupon the Blessed One rose from his seat went up to the hall of audience took his appointed seat there and addressed the bhikkhus thus Seven conditions leading to welfare I shall set forth bhikkhusListen and pay heed to what I shall saySo be it LordThe growth of the bhikkhus is to be expected not their decline bhikkhus so long as they assemble frequently and in large numbers meet and disperse peacefully and attend to the affairs of the Sangha in concord so long as they appoint no new rules and do not abolish the existing ones but proceed in accordance with the code of training laid down so long as they show respect honor esteem and veneration towards the elder bhikkhus those of long standing long gone forth the fathers and leaders of the Sangha and think it worthwhile to listen to them so long as they do not come under the power of the craving that leads to fresh becoming so long as they cherish the forest depths for their dwellings so long as they establish themselves in mindfulness so that virtuous brethren of the Order who have not come yet might do so and those already come might live in peace so long bhikkhus as these seven conditions leading to welfare endure among the bhikkhus and the bhikkhus are known for it their growth is to be expected not their declineSeven further conditions leading to welfare I shall set forth bhikkhusListen and pay heed to what I shall saySo be it LordThe growth of the bhikkhus is to be expected not their decline bhikkhus so long as they do not delight in are not pleased with and are not fond of activities talk sleep and company so long as they do not harbor do not come under the spell of evil desires have no bad friends associates or companions and so long as they do not stop halfway on account of some trifling achievementSo long bhikkhus as these seven conditions leading to

their brethren they train themselves openly and in private in the rules of conduct which are complete and perfect spotless and pure liberating praised by the wise uninfluenced and favorable to concentration of mind and in company with their brethren preserve openly and in private the insight that is noble and liberating and leads one who acts upon it to the utter destruction of sufferingSo long bhikkhus as these six conditions leading to welfare endure among the bhikkhus and the bhikkhus are known for it their growth is to be expected not their declineAnd the Blessed One living at Rajagaha at the hill called Vultures Peak often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thusSuch and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdomGreat becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdomWhen the Blessed One had stayed at Rajagaha as long as he pleased he addressed the Venerable Ananda thus Come Ananda let us go to AmbalatthikaSo be it LordAnd the Blessed One took up his abode at Ambalatthika together with a large community of bhikkhusAt Ambalatthika the Blessed One came to stay in the kings rest house and there too the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thusSuch and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdomGreat becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdomWhen the Blessed One had stayed at Ambalatthika as long as he pleased he addressed the Venerable Ananda thus Come Ananda let us go to NalandaSo be it LordAnd the Blessed One took up his abode at Nalanda together with a large community of bhikkhus and came to stay in the mango grove of PavarikaThen the Venerable Sariputta went to the Blessed One respectfully greeted him sat down at one side and spoke thus to himThis faith Lord I have in the Blessed One that there has not been there will not be nor is there now another recluse or brahman more exalted in Enlightenment than the Blessed OneLofty indeed is this speech of yours Sariputta and lordlyA bold utterance a veritable sounding of the lions roarBut how is this SariputtaThose Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of the past  do you have direct personal knowledge of all those Blessed Ones as to their virtue their meditation their wisdom their abiding and their emancipation Not so LordThen how is this SariputtaThose Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of the future  do you have direct personal knowledge of all those Blessed Ones as to their virtue their meditation their wisdom their abiding and their emancipationNot so LordThen how is this SariputtaOf me who am at present the Arahant the Fully Enlightened One do you have direct personal knowledge as to my virtue my meditation my wisdom my abiding and my emancipationNot so LordThen it is clear Sariputta that you have no such direct personal knowledge of the Arahats the Fully Enlightened Ones of the past the future and the presentHow then dare you set forth a speech so lofty and lordly an utterance so bold a veritable sounding of the lions roar saying This faith Lord I have in the Blessed One that there has not been there will not be nor is there now another recluse or brahman more exalted in Enlightenment than the Blessed OneNo such direct personal knowledge indeed is mine Lord of the Arahants the Fully Enlightened Ones of the past the future and the present and yet I have come to know the lawfulness of the DhammaSuppose Lord a kings frontier fortress was strongly fortified with strong ramparts and turrets and it had a single gate and there was a gatekeeper intelligent experienced and prudent who would keep out the stranger but allow the friend to enterAs he patrols the path that leads all around the fortress he does not perceive a hole or fissure in the ramparts even big enough to allow a cat to slip throughSo he comes to the conclusion Whatever grosser living things are to enter or leave this city they will all have to do so just by this gate In the same way Lord I have come to know the lawfulness of the DhammaFor Lord all the Blessed Ones Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of the past had abandoned the five hindrances the mental defilements that weaken wisdom had well established their minds in the four foundations of mindfulness had duly cultivated the seven factors of enlightenment and were fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme EnlightenmentAnd Lord all the Blessed Ones Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of the future will abandon the five hindrances the mental defilements that weaken wisdom will well establish their minds in the four foundations of mindfulness will duly cultivate the seven factors of enlightenment and will be fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme EnlightenmentAnd the Blessed One too Lord being at present the Arahant the Fully Enlightened One has abandoned the five hindrances the mental defilements that weaken wisdom has well established his mind in the four foundations of mindfulness has duly cultivated the seven factors of enlightenment and is fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme EnlightenmentAnd also in Nalanda in the mango grove of Pavarika the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thusSuch and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdomGreat becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration utterly freed from the taints

to PataligamaSo be it LordAnd the Blessed One took up his abode at Pataligama together with a large community of bhikkhusThen the devotees of Pataligama came to know The Blessed One they say has arrived at Pataligama And they approached the Blessed One respectfully greeted him sat down at one side and addressed him thus May the Blessed One Lord kindly visit our council hall And the Blessed One consented by his silenceKnowing the Blessed Ones consent the devotees of Pataligama rose from their seats respectfully saluted him and keeping their right sides towards him departed for the council hallThen they prepared the council hall by covering the floor all over arranging seats and water and setting out an oil lampHaving done this they returned to the Blessed One respectfully greeted him and standing at one side announced Lord the council hall is ready with the floor covered all over seats and water prepared and an oil lamp has been set outLet the Blessed One come Lord at his convenienceAnd the Blessed One got ready and taking his bowl and robe went to the council hall together with the company of bhikkhusAfter rinsing his feet the Blessed One entered the council hall and took his seat close to the middle pillar facing eastThe community of bhikkhus after rinsing their feet also entered the council hall and took seats near the western wall facing east so that the Blessed One was before themAnd the devotees of Pataligama after rinsing their feet and entering the council hall sat down near the eastern wall facing west so that the Blessed One was in front of themThereupon the Blessed One addressed the devotees of Pataligama thus The immoral man householders by falling away from virtue encounters five perils great loss of wealth through heedlessness an evil reputation a timid and troubled demeanor in every society be it that of nobles brahmans householders or ascetics death in bewilderment and at the breaking up of the body after death rebirth in a realm of misery in an unhappy state in the nether world in hellFive blessings householders accrue to the righteous man through his practice of virtue great increase of wealth through his diligence a favorable reputation a confident deportment without timidity in every society be it that of nobles brahmans householders or ascetics a serene death and at the breaking up of the body after death rebirth in a happy state in a heavenly worldAnd the Blessed One spent much of the night instructing the devotees of Pataligama in the Dhamma rousing edifying and gladdening them after which he dismissed them saying The night is far advanced householdersYou may go at your convenienceSo be it Lord And the devotees of Pataligama rose from their seats respectfully saluted the Blessed One and keeping their right sides towards him departedAnd the Blessed One soon after their departure retired into privacyAt that time Sunidha and Vassakara the chief ministers of Magadha were building a fortress at Pataligama in defense against the VajjisAnd deities in large numbers counted in thousands had taken possession of sites at PataligamaIn the region where deities of great power prevailed officials of great power were bent on constructing edifices and where deities of medium power and lesser power prevailed officials of medium and lesser power were bent on constructing edificesAnd the Blessed One saw with the heavenly eye pure and transcending the faculty of men the deities counted in thousands where they had taken possession of sites in PataligamaAnd rising before the night was spent towards dawn the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda thus Who is it Ananda that is erecting a city at PataligamaSunidha and Vassakara Lord the chief ministers of Magadha are building a fortress at Pataligama in defence against the VajjisIt is Ananda as if Sunidha and Vassakara had taken counsel with the gods of the ThirtythreeFor I beheld Ananda with the heavenly eye pure and transcending the faculty of men a large number of deities counted in thousands that have taken possession of sites at PataligamaIn the region where deities of great power prevail officials of great power are bent on constructing edifices and where deities of medium and lesser power prevail officials of medium and lesser power are bent on constructing edificesTruly Ananda as far as the Aryan race extends and trade routes spread this will be the foremost city Pataliputta a tradecenterBut Pataliputta Ananda will be assailed by three perils  fire water and dissensionThen Sunidha and Vassakara went to the Blessed One and after courteous greeting to the Blessed One and exchanging many pleasant words they stood at one side and addressed him thus May the Venerable Gotama please accept our invitation for tomorrows meal together with the community of bhikkhus And the Blessed One consented by his silenceKnowing the Blessed Ones consent Sunidha and Vassakara departed for their own abodes where they had choice food hard and soft preparedAnd when it was time they announced to the Blessed One It is time Venerable Gotama the meal is readyThereupon the Blessed One got ready in the forenoon and taking bowl and robe he went together with the community of bhikkhus to the abode of Sunidha and Vassakara where he took the seat prepared for himAnd Sunidha and Vassakara themselves attended on the community of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha and served them with choice food hard and softWhen the Blessed One had finished his meal and had removed his hand from the bowl they took low seats and sat down at one sideAnd the Blessed One thanked them with these stanzasAfter this the Blessed One rose from his seat and departedThen Sunidha and Vassakara followed behind the Blessed One step by step saying Through whichever gate the recluse Gotama will depart today that we will name the Gotamagate and the ford by which he will cross the river Ganges shall be named the Gotamaford And so it came to pass where the gate was concernedBut when the Blessed One came to the river Ganges it was full to the brim so that crows could drink from itAnd some people went in search of a boat or float while others tied up a raft because they desired to get acrossBut the Blessed One as quickly as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or draw in his outstretched arm vanished from this side of the river Ganges and came to stand on the yonder sideAnd the Blessed One saw the people who desired to cross searching for a boat or float while others were binding raftsAnd then the Blessed One seeing them thus gave forth the solemn utteranceNow the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to KotigamaSo be it Lord And the Blessed One took up his abode at Kotigama together with a large community of bhikkhusAnd the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Bhikkhus it is through not realizing through not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that this long course of birth and death has been passed through and undergone by me as well as by youWhat are these fourThey are the noble truth of suffering the noble truth of the origin of suffering the noble truth of the cessation of suffering and the noble truth of the way to the cessation of sufferingBut now bhikkhus that these have been realized and penetrated cut off is the craving for existence destroyed is that which leads to renewed becoming and there is no fresh becomingThus it was said by the Blessed OneAnd the Happy One the Master further saidAnd also at Kotigama the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdomGreat becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdomWhen the Blessed One had stayed at Kotigama as long as he pleased he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to NadikaSo be it Lord And the Blessed One took up his abode in Nadika together with a large community of bhikkhus staying in the Brick HouseThen the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One and after greeting him respectfully sat down at one sideAnd he said to the Blessed One Here in Nadika Lord there have passed away the bhikkhu Salha and the bhikkhuni NandaLikewise there have passed away the layman Sudatta and the laywoman Sujata likewise the layman Kakudha Kalinga Nikata Katissabha Tuttha Santuttha Bhadda and SubhaddaWhat is their destiny LordWhat is their future stateThe bhikkhu Salha Ananda through the destruction of the taints in this very lifetime has attained to the taintfree deliverance of mind and deliverance through wisdom having directly known and realized it by himselfThe bhikkhuni Nanda Ananda through the destruction of the five lower fetters has arisen spontaneously and will come to final cessation in that very place not liable to return from that worldThe layman Sudatta Ananda through the destruction of the three fetters and the lessening of lust hatred and delusion has become a oncereturner and is bound to make an end of suffering after having returned but once more to this worldThe laywoman Sujata Ananda through the destruction of the three fetters has become a streamenterer and is safe from falling into the states of misery assured and bound for EnlightenmentThe layman Kakudha Ananda through the destruction of the five lower fetters has arisen spontaneously and will come to final cessation in that very place not liable to return from that worldSo it is with Kalinga Nikata Katissabha Tuttha Santuttha Bhadda and Subhadda and with more than fifty laymen in NadikaMore than ninety laymen who have passed away in Nadika Ananda through the destruction of the three fetters and the lessening of lust hatred and delusion have become oncereturners and are bound to make an end of suffering after having returned but once more to this worldMore than five hundred laymen who have passed away in Nadika Ananda through the complete destruction of the three fetters have become streamenterers and are safe from falling into the states of misery assured and bound for EnlightenmentBut truly Ananda it is nothing strange that human beings should dieBut if each time it happens you should come to the Tathagata and ask about them in this manner indeed it would be troublesome to himTherefore Ananda I will give you the teaching called the Mirror of the Dhamma possessing which the noble disciple should he so desire can declare of himself There is no more rebirth for me in hell nor as an animal or ghost nor in any realm of woeA streamenterer am I safe from falling into the states of misery assured am I and bound for Enlightenment And what Ananda is that teaching called the Mirror of Dhamma possessing which the noble disciple may thus declare of himselfIn this case Ananda the noble disciple possesses unwavering faith in the Buddha thus The Blessed One is an Arahant the Fully Enlightened One perfect in knowledge and conduct the Happy One the knower of the world the paramount trainer of beings the teacher of gods and men the Enlightened One the Blessed OneHe possesses unwavering faith in the Dhamma thus Well propounded by the Blessed One is the Dhamma evident timeless inviting investigation leading to emancipation to be comprehended by the wise each for himselfHe possesses unwavering faith in the Blessed Ones Order of Disciples thus Well faring is the Blessed Ones Order of Disciples righteously wisely and dutifully that is to say the four pairs of men the eight classes of personsThe Blessed Ones Order of Disciples is worthy of honor of hospitality of offerings of veneration  the supreme field for meritorious deeds in the worldAnd he possesses virtues that are dear to the Noble Ones complete and perfect spotless and pure which are liberating praised by the wise uninfluenced and favorable to concentration of mindThis Ananda is the teaching called the Mirror of the Dhamma whereby the noble disciple may thus know of himself There is no more rebirth for me in hell nor as an animal or ghost nor in any realm of woeA streamenterer am I safe from falling into the states of misery assured am I and bound for Enlightenment And also in Nadika in the Brick House the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdomGreat becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdomWhen the Blessed One had stayed in Nadika as long as he pleased he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to VesaliSo be it O Lord And the Blessed One took up his abode in Vesali together with a large community of bhikkhus and stayed in Ambapalis groveThen the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Mindful should you dwell bhikkhus clearly comprehending thus I exhort youAnd how bhikkhus is a bhikkhu mindfulWhen he dwells contemplating the body in the body earnestly clearly comprehending and mindfully after having overcome desire and sorrow in regard to the world and when he dwells contemplating feelings in feelings the mind in the mind and mental objects in mental objects earnestly clearly comprehending and mindfully after having overcome desire and sorrow in regard to the world then is he said to be mindfulAnd how bhikkhus does a bhikkhu have clear comprehensionWhen he remains fully aware of his coming and going his looking forward and his looking away his bending and stretching his wearing of his robe and carrying of his bowl his eating and drinking masticating and savoring his defecating and urinating his walking standing sitting lying down going to sleep or keeping awake his speaking or being silent then is he said to have clear comprehensionMindful should you dwell bhikkhus clearly comprehending thus I exhort youThen Ambapali the courtesan came to know The Blessed One they say has arrived at Vesali and is now staying in my Mango Grove And she ordered a large number of magnificent carriages to be made ready mounted one of them herself and accompanied by the rest drove out from Vesali towards her parkShe went by carriage as far as the carriage could go then alighted and approaching the Blessed One on foot she respectfully greeted him and sat down at one sideAnd the Blessed One instructed Ambapali the courtesan in the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened herThereafter Ambapali the courtesan spoke to the Blessed One saying May the Blessed One O Lord please accept my invitation for tomorrows meal together with the community of bhikkhus And by his silence the Blessed One consentedSure then of the Blessed Ones consent Ambapali the courtesan rose from her seat respectfully saluted him and keeping her right side towards him took her departureThen the Licchavi of Vesali came to know The Blessed One they say has arrived at Vesali and is now staying in Ambapalis grove And they ordered a large number of magnificent carriages to be made ready each mounted one and accompanied by the rest drove out from VesaliNow of these Licchavis some were in blue with clothing and ornaments all of blue while others were in yellow red and whiteAnd it so happened that Ambapali the courtesan drove up against the young Licchavis axle by axle wheel by wheel and yoke by yokeThereupon the Licchavis exclaimed Why do you drive up against us in this fashion AmbapaliThus it is indeed my princes and not otherwiseFor the Blessed One is invited by me for tomorrows meal together with the community of bhikkhusGive up the meal Ambapali for a hundred thousandBut she replied Even if you were to give me Vesali sirs together with its tributary lands I would not give up a meal of such importanceThen the Licchavis snapped their fingers in annoyance See friendsWe are defeated by this mango lassWe are utterly outdone by this mango lass But they continued on their way to Ambapalis groveAnd the Blessed One beheld the Licchavis from afar as they drove upThen he spoke to the bhikkhus saying Those of you bhikkhus who have not yet seen the Thirtythree gods may behold the assembly of the Licchavis and may gaze on them for they are comparable to the assembly of the Thirtythree godsThen the Licchavis drove their carriages as far as the carriages could go then alighted and approaching the Blessed One on foot they respectfully greeted him and sat down at one sideThe Blessed One instructed the Licchavis in the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened themThereafter the Licchavis spoke to the Blessed One saying May the Blessed One O Lord please accept our invitation for tomorrows meal together with the community of bhikkhusThe invitation for tomorrows meal Licchavis has been accepted by me from Ambapali the courtesanThen the Licchavis snapped their fingers in annoyance See friendsWe are defeated by this mango lassWe are utterly outdone by this mango lass And then the Licchavis approving of the Blessed Ones words and delighted with them rose from their seats respectfully saluted him and keeping their right sides towards him took their departureThen after the night had passed Ambapali the courtesan had choice food hard and soft prepared in her park and announced it to the Blessed One It is time O Lord the meal is ready Thereupon the Blessed One got ready in the forenoon and taking bowl and robe he went together with the community of bhikkhus to Ambapalis dwelling and there he took the seat prepared for himAnd Ambapali herself attended on the community of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha and served them with choice food hard and softAnd when the Blessed One had finished his meal and had removed his hand from his bowl Ambapali the courtesan took a low seat and placing herself at one side spoke to the Blessed One saying This park O Lord I offer to the community of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha And the Blessed One accepted the parkHe then instructed Ambapali in the Dhamma and having roused edified and gladdened her he rose from his seat and departedAnd also at Vesali in Ambapalis grove the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdomGreat becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdomWhen the Blessed One had stayed in Ambapalis grove as long as he pleased he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to the village of BeluvaSo be it Lord And the Blessed One took up his abode in the village of Beluva together with a large community of bhikkhusAt that time the Blessed One spoke to the bhikkhus saying Go now bhikkhus and seek shelter anywhere in the neighborhood of Vesali where you are welcome among acquaintances and friends and there spend the rainy seasonAs for me I shall spend the rainy season in this very place in the village of BeluvaSo be it O Lord the bhikkhus saidBut when the Blessed One had entered upon the rainy season there arose in him a severe illness and sharp and deadly pains came upon himAnd the Blessed One endured them mindfully clearly comprehending and unperturbedThen it occurred to the Blessed One It would not be fitting if I came to my final passing away without addressing those who attended on me without taking leave of the community of bhikkhusThen let me suppress this illness by strength of will resolve to maintain the life process and live onAnd the Blessed One suppressed the illness by strength of will resolved to maintain the life process and lived onSo it came about that the Blessed Ones illness was allayedAnd the Blessed One recovered from that illness and soon after his recovery he came out from his dwelling place and sat down in the shade of the building on a seat prepared for himThen the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One respectfully greeted him and sitting down at one side he spoke to the Blessed One saying Fortunate it is for me O Lord to see the Blessed One at ease againFortunate it is for me O Lord to see the Blessed One recoveredFor truly Lord when I saw the Blessed Ones sickness it was as though my own body became weak as a creeper every thing around became dim to me and my senses failed meYet Lord I still had some little comfort in the thought that the Blessed One would not come to his final passing away until he had given some last instructions respecting the community of bhikkhusThus spoke the Venerable Ananda but the Blessed One answered him saying What more does the community of bhikkhus expect from me AnandaI have set forth the Dhamma without making any distinction of esoteric and exoteric doctrine there is nothing Ananda with regard to the teachings that the Tathagata holds to the last with the closed fist of a teacher who keeps some things backWhosoever may think that it is he who should lead the community of bhikkhus or that the community depends upon him it is such a one that would have to give last instructions respecting themBut Ananda the Tathagata has no such idea as that it is he who should lead the community of bhikkhus or that the community depends upon himSo what instructions should he have to give respecting the community of bhikkhusNow I am frail Ananda old aged far gone in yearsThis is my eightieth year and my life is spentEven as an old cart Ananda is held together with much difficulty so the body of the Tathagata is kept going only with supportsIt is Ananda only when the Tathagata disregarding external objects with the cessation of certain feelings attains to and abides in the signless concentration of mind that his body is more comfortableTherefore Ananda be islands unto yourselves refuges unto yourselves seeking no external refuge with the Dhamma as your island the Dhamma as your refuge seeking no other refugeAnd how Ananda is a bhikkhu an island unto himself a refuge unto himself seeking no external refuge with the Dhamma as his island the Dhamma as his refuge seeking no other refugeWhen he dwells contemplating the body in the body earnestly clearly comprehending and mindfully after having overcome desire and sorrow in regard to the world when he dwells contemplating feelings in feelings the mind in the mind and mental objects in mental objects earnestly clearly comprehending and mindfully after having overcome desire and sorrow in regard to the world then truly he is an island unto himself a refuge unto himself seeking no external refuge having the Dhamma as his island the Dhamma as his refuge seeking no other refugeThose bhikkhus of mine Ananda who now or after I am gone abide as an island unto themselves as a refuge unto themselves seeking no other refuge having the Dhamma as their island and refuge seeking no other refuge it is they who will become the highest if they have the desire to learnThen the Blessed One getting ready in the forenoon took bowl and robe and went into Vesali for almsAfter the alms round and meal on his return he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Take up a mat Ananda and let us spend the day at the Capala shrineSo be it Lord And the Venerable Ananda took up a mat and followed behind the Blessed One step by stepAnd the Blessed One went to the Capala shrine and sat down on the seat prepared for himAnd when the Venerable Ananda had seated himself at one side after he had respectfully saluted the Blessed One the Lord said to him Pleasant Ananda is Vesali pleasant are the shrines of Udena Gotamaka Sattambaka Bahuputta Sarandada and CapalaAnd the Blessed One said Whosoever Ananda has developed practiced employed strengthened maintained scrutinized and brought to perfection the four constituents of psychic power could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of itThe Tathagata Ananda has done soTherefore the Tathagata could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of itBut the Venerable Ananda was unable to grasp the plain suggestion the significant prompting given by the Blessed OneAs though his mind was influenced by Mara he did not beseech the Blessed One May the Blessed One remain O LordMay the Happy One remain O Lord throughout the worldperiod for the welfare and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit well being and happiness of gods and menAnd when for a second and a third time the Blessed One repeated his words the Venerable Ananda remained silentThen the Blessed One said to the Venerable Ananda Go now Ananda and do as seems fit to youEven so O Lord And the Venerable Ananda rising from his seat respectfully saluted the Blessed One and keeping his right side towards him took his seat under a tree some distance awayAnd when the Venerable Ananda had gone away Mara the Evil One approached the Blessed OneAnd standing at one side he spoke to the Blessed One saying Now O Lord let the Blessed One come to his final passing away let the Happy One utterly pass awayThe time has come for the Parinibbana of the LordFor the Blessed One O Lord spoke these words to me I shall not come to my final passing away Evil One until my bhikkhus and bhikkhunis laymen and laywomen have come to be true disciples  wise well disciplined apt and learned preservers of the Dhamma living according to the Dhamma abiding by the appropriate conduct and having learned the Masters word are able to expound it preach it proclaim it establish it reveal it explain it in detail and make it clear until when adverse opinions arise they shall be able to refute them thoroughly and well and to preach this convincing and liberating Dhamma And now O Lord bhikkhus and bhikkhunis laymen and laywomen have become the Blessed Ones disciples in just this waySo O Lord let the Blessed One come to his final passing awayThe time has come for the Parinibbana of the LordFor the Blessed One O Lord spoke these words to me I shall not come to my final passing away Evil One until this holy life taught by me has become successful prosperous farrenowned popular and widespread until it is well proclaimed among gods and men And this too has come to pass in just this waySo O Lord let the Blessed One come to his final passing away let the Happy One utterly pass awayThe time has come for the Parinibbana of the LordWhen this was said the Blessed One spoke to Mara the Evil One saying Do not trouble yourself Evil OneBefore long the Parinibbana of the Tathagata will come aboutThree months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass awayAnd at the Capala shrine the Blessed One thus mindfully and clearly comprehending renounced his will to live onAnd upon the Lords renouncing his will to live on there came a tremendous earthquake dreadful and astonishing and thunder rolled across the heavensAnd the Blessed One beheld it with understanding and made this solemn utteranceThen it came to the mind of the Venerable Ananda Marvellous it is indeed and most wonderfulThe earth shakes mightily tremendouslyDreadful and astonishing it is how the thunders roll across the heavensWhat could be the reason what the cause that so mighty an earthquake should ariseAnd the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One and respectfully greeting him sat down at one sideThen he spoke to the Blessed One saying Marvellous it is indeed and most wonderfulThe earth shakes mightily tremendouslyDreadful and astonishing it is how the thunders roll across the heavensWhat could be the reason what the cause that so mighty an earthquake should ariseThen the Blessed One said There are eight reasons Ananda eight causes for a mighty earthquake to ariseWhat are those eightThis great earth Ananda is established upon liquid the liquid upon the atmosphere and the atmosphere upon spaceAnd when Ananda mighty atmospheric disturbances take place the liquid is agitatedAnd with the agitation of the liquid tremors of the earth ariseThis is the first reason the first cause for the arising of mighty earthquakesAgain Ananda when an ascetic or holy man of great power one who has gained mastery of his mind or a deity who is mighty and potent develops intense concentration on the delimited aspect of the earth element and to a boundless degree on the liquid element he too causes the earth to tremble quiver and shakeThis is the second reason the second cause for the arising of mighty earthquakesAgain Ananda when the Bodhisatta departs from the Tusita realm and descends into his mothers womb mindfully and clearly comprehending and when the Bodhisatta comes out from his mothers womb mindfully and clearly comprehending and when the Tathagata becomes fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment when the Tathagata sets rolling the excellent Wheel of the Dhamma when the Tathagata renounces his will to live on and when the Tathagata comes to pass away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains  then too Ananda this great earth trembles quivers and shakesThese Ananda are the eight reasons the eight causes for a great earthquake to ariseNow there are eight kinds of assemblies Ananda that is to say assemblies of nobles brahmans householders ascetics of the Four Great Kings of the Thirtythree gods of Maras and of BrahmasAnd I recall Ananda how I have attended each of these eight kinds of assemblies amounting to hundredsAnd before seating myself and starting the conversation or the discussion I made my appearance resemble theirs my voice resemble theirsAnd so I taught them the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened themYet while I was speaking to them thus they did not know me and they would enquire of one another asking Who is he that speaks to usIs it a man or a godThen having taught them the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened them I would straightaway vanishAnd when I had vanished too they did not know me and they would enquire of one another asking Who is he that has vanishedIs it a man or a godAnd such Ananda are the eight kinds of assembliesNow there are eight fields of mastery AnandaWhat are those eightWhen one perceiving forms subjectively sees small forms beautiful or ugly external to himself and mastering them is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are  this is the first field of masteryWhen one perceiving forms subjectively sees large forms beautiful or ugly external to himself and mastering them is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are  this is the second field of masteryWhen one not perceiving forms subjectively sees small forms beautiful or ugly external to himself and mastering them is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are  this is the third field of masteryWhen one not perceiving forms subjectively sees large forms beautiful or ugly external to himself and mastering them is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are  this is the fourth field of masteryWhen one not perceiving forms subjectively sees forms external to himself that are blue blue in color of a blue luster like the blossoms of flax or like fine Benares muslin which burnished on both sides is blue blue in color of a blue luster  when such a one sees forms external to himself that are blue and mastering them is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are  this is the fifth field of masteryWhen one not perceiving forms subjectively sees forms external to himself that are yellow yellow in color of a yellow luster like the Kanikara blossom or like fine Benares muslin which burnished on both sides is yellow yellow in color of a yellow luster  when such a one sees forms external to himself that are yellow and mastering them is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are  this is the sixth field of masteryWhen one not perceiving forms subjectively sees forms external to himself that are red red in color of a red luster like the Bandhujivaka blossom or like fine Benares muslin which burnished on both sides is red red in color of a red luster  when such a one sees forms external to himself that are red and mastering them is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are  this is the seventh field of masteryWhen one not perceiving forms subjectively sees forms external to himself that are white white in color of a white luster like the morning star or like fine Benares muslin which burnished on both sides is white white in color of a white luster  when such a one sees forms external to himself that are white and mastering them is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are  this is the eighth field of masteryThese Ananda are the eight fields of masteryNow there are eight liberations AnandaWhat are those eightOneself having form one perceives forms this is the first liberationBeing unaware of ones own form one perceives forms external to oneself this is the second liberationExperiencing loveliness one is intent upon it this is the third liberationBy utterly transcending the perceptions of matter by the disappearance of the perceptions of sensereaction and by giving no attention to diversityperceptions one becomes aware of attains to and abides in the sphere of infinite space this is the fourth liberationBy utterly transcending the sphere of infinite space one becomes aware of attains to and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness this is the fifth liberationBy utterly transcending the sphere of infinite consciousness one becomes aware of attains to and abides in the sphere of nothingness this is the sixth liberationBy utterly transcending the sphere of nothingness one attains to and abides in the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception this is the seventh liberationBy utterly transcending the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception one attains to and abides in the cessation of perception and sensation this is the eighth liberationThese Ananda are the eight liberationsThere was a time Ananda when I dwelt at Uruvela on the bank of the Nerañjara River at the foot of the goatherds banyantree soon after my supreme EnlightenmentAnd Mara the Evil One approached me saying Now O Lord let the Blessed One come to his final passing awayLet the Happy One utterly pass awayThe time has come for the Parinibbana of the LordThen Ananda I answered Mara the Evil One saying I shall not come to my final passing away Evil One until my bhikkhus and bhikkhunis laymen and laywomen have come to be true disciples  wise well disciplined apt and learned preservers of the Dhamma living according to the Dhamma abiding by appropriate conduct and having learned the Masters word are able to expound it preach it proclaim it establish it reveal it explain it in detail and make it clear until when adverse opinions arise they shall be able to refute them thoroughly and well and to preach this convincing and liberating DhammaI shall not come to my final passing away Evil One until this holy life taught by me has become successful prosperous farrenowned popular and widespread until it is well proclaimed among gods and menAnd again today Ananda at the Capala shrine Mara the Evil One approached me saying Now O Lord bhikkhus and bhikkhunis laymen and laywomen have come to be true disciples of the Blessed One  wise well disciplined apt and learned preservers of the Dhamma living according to the Dhamma abiding in the appropriate conduct and having learned the Masters word are able to expound it preach it proclaim it establish it reveal it explain it in detail and make it clear and when adverse opinions arise they are now able to refute them thoroughly and well and to preach this convincing and liberating DhammaAnd now O Lord this holy life taught by the Blessed One has become successful prosperous farrenowned popular and widespread and it is well proclaimed among gods and menTherefore O Lord let the Blessed One come to his final passing awayLet the Happy One utterly pass awayThe time has come for the Parinibbana of the LordAnd then Ananda I answered Mara the Evil One saying Do not trouble yourself Evil OneBefore long the Parinibbana of the Tathagata will come aboutThree months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass awayAnd in this way Ananda today at the Capala shrine the Tathagata has renounced his will to live onAt these words the Venerable Ananda spoke to the Blessed One saying May the Blessed One remain O LordMay the Happy One remain O Lord throughout the worldperiod for the welfare and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit well being and happiness of gods and menAnd the Blessed One answered saying Enough AnandaDo not entreat the Tathagata for the time is past Ananda for such an entreatyBut for a second and a third time the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One May the Blessed One remain O LordMay the Happy One remain O Lord throughout the worldperiod for the welfare and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit well being and happiness of gods and menThen the Blessed One said Do you have faith Ananda in the Enlightenment of the Tathagata And the Venerable Ananda replied Yes O Lord I doThen how Ananda can you persist against the Tathagata even up to the third timeThen the Venerable Ananda said This O Lord I have heard and learned from the Blessed One himself when the Blessed One said to me Whosoever Ananda has developed practiced employed strengthened maintained scrutinized and brought to perfection the four constituents of psychic power could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of itThe Tathagata Ananda has done soTherefore the Tathagata could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of it And did you believe it AnandaYes O Lord I didThen Ananda the fault is yoursHerein have you failed inasmuch as you were unable to grasp the plain suggestion the significant prompting given by the Tathagata and you did not then entreat the Tathagata to remainFor if you had done so Ananda twice the Tathagata might have declined but the third time he would have consentedTherefore Ananda the fault is yours herein have you failedAt Rajagaha Ananda when dwelling at Vultures Peak I spoke to you saying Pleasant Ananda is Rajagaha pleasant is Vultures PeakWhosoever Ananda has developed Therefore the Tathagata could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of itSo also at the Banyan Grove at Robbers Cliff at the Sattapanni Cave on the Vebhara Mountain at the Black Rock of Isigili at the Serpents Pool in the Cool Forest at the Tapoda Grove at the Bamboo Grove in the Squirrels Feedingground at Jivakas Mango Grove and at Small Nook in the Deer Park I spoke to you in the same words saying Pleasant Ananda is Rajagaha pleasant are these placesWhosoever Ananda has developed Therefore the Tathagata could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of itBut you Ananda were unable to grasp the plain suggestion the significant prompting given you by the Tathagata and you did not entreat the Tathagata to remainFor if you had done so Ananda twice the Tathagata might have declined but the third time he would have consentedTherefore Ananda the fault is yours herein you have failedSo also at Vesali Ananda at different times the Tathagata has spoken to you saying Pleasant Ananda is Vesali pleasant are the shrines of Udena Gotamaka Sattambaka Bahuputta Sarandada and CapalaWhosoever Ananda has developed Therefore the Tathagata could if he so desired remain throughout a worldperiod or until the end of itBut you Ananda were unable to grasp the plain suggestion the significant prompting given you by the Tathagata and you did not entreat the Tathagata to remainFor if you had done so Ananda twice the Tathagata might have declined but the third time he would have consentedTherefore Ananda the fault is yours herein you have failedYet Ananda have I not taught from the very beginning that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change separation and severanceOf that which is born come into being is compounded and subject to decay how can one say May it not come to dissolution There can be no such state of thingsAnd of that Ananda which the Tathagata has finished with that which he has relinquished given up abandoned and rejected  his will to live on  the Tathagatas word has been spoken once for all Before long the Parinibbana of the Tathagata will come aboutThree months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass away And that the Tathagata should withdraw his words for the sake of living on  this is an impossibilitySo then Ananda let us go to the hall of the Gabled House in the Great Forest And the Venerable Ananda replied So be it LordThen the Blessed One with the Venerable Ananda went to the hall of the Gabled House in the Great ForestAnd there he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Go now Ananda and assemble in the hall of audience all the bhikkhus who dwell in the neighborhood of VesaliSo be it Lord And the Venerable Ananda gathered all the bhikkhus who dwelt in the neighborhood of Vesali and assembled them in the hall of audienceAnd then respectfully saluting the Blessed One and standing at one side he said The community of bhikkhus is assembled LordNow let the Blessed One do as he wishesThereupon the Blessed One entered the hall of audience and taking the seat prepared for him he exhorted the bhikkhus saying Now O bhikkhus I say to you that these teachings of which I have direct knowledge and which I have made known to you  these you should thoroughly learn cultivate develop and frequently practice that the life of purity may be established and may long endure for the welfare and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit well being and happiness of gods and menAnd what bhikkhus are these teachingsThey are the four foundations of mindfulness the four right efforts the four constituents of psychic power the five faculties the five powers the seven factors of enlightenment and the Noble Eightfold PathThese bhikkhus are the teachings of which I have direct knowledge which I have made known to you and which you should thoroughly learn cultivate develop and frequently practice that the life of purity may be established and may long endure for the welfare and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit well being and happiness of gods and menThen the Blessed One said to the bhikkhus So bhikkhus I exhort you All compounded things are subject to vanishStrive with earnestnessThe time of the Tathagatas Parinibbana is nearThree months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass awayAnd having spoken these words the Happy One the Master spoke again sayingThen the Blessed One getting ready in the forenoon took bowl and robe and went into Vesali for almsAfter the alms round and meal on his return he looked upon Vesali with the elephants look and said to the Venerable Ananda This Ananda is the last time that the Tathagata will look upon VesaliCome Ananda let us go to BhandagamaSo be it O Lord And the Blessed One took up his abode at Bhandagama together with a large community of bhikkhusAnd the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Bhikkhus it is through not realizing through not penetrating four principles that this long course of birth and death has been passed through and undergone by me as well as by youWhat are those fourThey are noble virtue noble concentration noble wisdom and noble emancipationBut now bhikkhus that these have been realized and penetrated cut off is the craving for existence destroyed is that which leads to renewed becoming and there is no fresh becomingAnd having spoken these words the Happy One the Master spoke again sayingVirtue concentration wisdom and emancipation unsurpassed These are the principles realized by Gotama the renownedAnd knowing them he the Buddha to his monks has taught the DhammaHe the destroyer of suffering the Master the Seer is at peaceAnd also at Bhandagama the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdomGreat becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdomWhen the Blessed One had stayed at Bhandagama as long as he pleased he spoke to the Venerable Ananda Come Ananda let us go to HatthigamaSo be it Lord And the Blessed One took up his abode at Hatthigama together with a large community of bhikkhusAnd when the Blessed One had stayed at Hatthigama as long as he pleased he took up his abode at Ambagama then at JambugamaAnd at each of these places the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdomGreat becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdomAnd when the Blessed One had stayed at Jambugama as long as he pleased he spoke to the Venerable Ananda Come Ananda let us go to BhoganagaraSo be it Lord And the Blessed One took up his abode at Bhoganagara together with a large community of bhikkhus and stayed in the Ananda shrineAnd there the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Now bhikkhus I shall make known to you the four great referencesListen and pay heed to my words And those bhikkhus answered sayingSo be it LordThen the Blessed One said In this fashion bhikkhus a bhikkhu might speak Face to face with the Blessed One brethren I have heard and learned thus This is the Dhamma and the Discipline the Masters Dispensation or In an abode of such and such a name lives a community with elders and a chiefFace to face with that community I have heard and learned thus This is the Dhamma and the Discipline the Masters Dispensation or In an abode of such and such a name live several bhikkhus who are elders who are learned who have accomplished their course who are preservers of the Dhamma the Discipline and the SummariesFace to face with those elders I have heard and learned thus This is the Dhamma and the Discipline the Masters Dispensation or In an abode of such and such a name lives a single bhikkhu who is an elder who is learned who has accomplished his course who is a preserver of the Dhamma the Discipline and the SummariesFace to face with that elder I have heard and learned thus This is the Dhamma and the Discipline the Masters DispensationIn such a case bhikkhus the declaration of such a bhikkhu is neither to be received with approval nor with scornWithout approval and without scorn but carefully studying the sentences word by word one should trace them in the Discourses and verify them by the DisciplineIf they are neither traceable in the Discourses nor verifiable by the Discipline one must conclude thus Certainly this is not the Blessed Ones utterance this has been misunderstood by that bhikkhu  or by that community or by those elders or by that elder In that way bhikkhus you should reject itBut if the sentences concerned are traceable in the Discourses and verifiable by the Discipline then one must conclude thus Certainly this is the Blessed Ones utterance this has been well understood by that bhikkhu  or by that community or by those elders or by that elder And in that way bhikkhus you may accept it on the first second third or fourth referenceThese bhikkhus are the four great references for you to preserveAnd also at Bhoganagara at the Ananda shrine the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus Such and such is virtue such and such is concentration and such and such is wisdomGreat becomes the fruit great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct great becomes the fruit great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration utterly freed from the taints of lust becoming and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdomWhen the Blessed One had stayed at Bhoganagara as long as he pleased he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to PavaSo be it Lord And the Blessed One took up his abode at Pava together with a great community of bhikkhus and stayed in the Mango Grove of Cunda who was by family a metalworkerAnd Cunda the metalworker came to know The Blessed One they say has arrived at Pava and is staying in my Mango Grove And he went to the Blessed One and having respectfully greeted him sat down at one sideAnd the Blessed One instructed Cunda the metalworker in the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened himThen Cunda spoke to the Blessed One saying May the Blessed One O Lord please accept my invitation for tomorrows meal together with the community of bhikkhus And by his silence the Blessed One consentedSure then of the Blessed Ones consent Cunda the metalworker rose from his seat respectfully saluted the Blessed One and keeping his right side towards him took his departureAnd Cunda the metalworker after the night had passed had choice food hard and soft prepared in his abode together with a quantity of sukaramaddava and announced it to the Blessed One saying It is time O Lord the meal is readyThereupon the Blessed One in the forenoon having got ready took bowl and robe and went with the community of bhikkhus to the house of Cunda and there sat down on the seat prepared for himAnd he spoke to Cunda saying With the sukaramaddava you have prepared Cunda you may serve me with the other food hard and soft you may serve the community of bhikkhusSo be it Lord And with the sukaramaddava prepared by him he served the Blessed One and with the other food hard and soft he served the community of bhikkhusThereafter the Blessed One spoke to Cunda saying Whatever Cunda is left over of the sukaramaddava bury that in a pitFor I do not see in all this world with its gods Maras and Brahmas among the host of ascetics and brahmans gods and men anyone who could eat it and entirely digest it except the Tathagata aloneAnd Cunda the metalworker answered the Blessed One saying So be it O LordAnd what remained over of the sukaramaddava he buried in a pitThen he returned to the Blessed One respectfully greeted him and sat down at one sideAnd the Blessed One instructed Cunda the metalworker in the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened himAfter this he rose from his seat and departedAnd soon after the Blessed One had eaten the meal provided by Cunda the metalworker a dire sickness fell upon him even dysentery and he suffered sharp and deadly painsBut the Blessed One endured them mindfully clearly comprehending and unperturbedThen the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to Kusinara And the Venerable Ananda answered So be it LordNow on the way the Blessed One went aside from the highway and stopped at the foot of a treeAnd he said to the Venerable Ananda Please fold my upper robe in four Ananda and lay it downI am weary and want to rest awhileSo be it Lord And the Venerable Ananda folded the robe in four and laid it downAnd the Blessed One sat down on the seat prepared for him and said to the Venerable Ananda Please bring me some water AnandaI am thirsty and want to drinkAnd the Venerable Ananda answered the Blessed One But just now Lord a great number of carts five hundred carts have passed over and the shallow water has been cut through by the wheels so that it flows turbid and muddyBut the Kakuttha River Lord is quite close by and its waters are clear pleasant cool and translucentIt is easily approachable and delightfully placedThere the Blessed One can quench his thirst and refresh his limbsBut a second time the Blessed One made his request and the Venerable Ananda answered him as beforeAnd then for a third time the Blessed One said Please bring me some water AnandaI am thirsty and want to drinkThen the Venerable Ananda answered saying So be it Lord And he took the bowl and went to the streamAnd the shallow water which had been cut through by the wheels so that it flowed turbid and muddy became clear and settled down pure and pleasant as the Venerable Ananda drew nearThen the Venerable Ananda thought Marvellous and most wonderful indeed is the power and glory of the TathagataAnd he took up water in the bowl and carried it to the Blessed One and said Marvellous and most wonderful indeed is the power and glory of the TathagataFor this shallow water which had been cut through by the wheels so that it flowed turbid and muddy became clear and settled down pure and pleasant as I drew nearNow let the Blessed One drink the waterLet the Happy One drink And the Blessed One drank the waterNow it so happened that one Pukkusa of the Malla clan who was a disciple of Alara Kalama was passing by on his way from Kusinara to PavaAnd when he saw the Blessed One seated at the foot of a tree he approached him respectfully greeted him and sat down at one sideAnd he spoke to the Blessed One saying Marvellous it is Lord most wonderful it is O Lord the state of calmness wherein abide those who have gone forth from the worldFor at one time Lord Alara Kalama was on a journey and he went aside from the highway and sat down by the wayside at the foot of a tree to pass the heat of the dayAnd it came about Lord that a great number of carts even five hundred carts passed by him one by oneAnd then Lord a certain man who was following behind that train of carts approached and spoke to him saying Did you sir see a great number of carts that passed you by And Alara Kalama answered him I did not see them brother But the noise sir surely you heard I did not hear it brother Then that man asked him Then sir perhaps you slept No brother I was not sleeping Then sir were you conscious I was brother Then that man said Then sir while conscious and awake you still did not see the great number of carts even five hundred carts that passed you by one after another nor heard the noiseWhy sir your very robe is covered with their dust And Alara Kalama replied saying So it is brotherAnd to that man O Lord came the thought Marvellous it is most wonderful indeed it is the state of calmness wherein abide those who have gone forth from the world And there arose in him great faith in Alara Kalama and he went his wayNow what do you think PukkusaWhat is more difficult to do more difficult to meet with  that a man while conscious and awake should not see a great number of carts even five hundred carts that passed him by one after another nor hear the noise or that one conscious and awake in the midst of a heavy rain with thunder rolling lightning flashing and thunderbolts crashing should neither see it nor hear the noiseWhat O Lord are five hundred carts  nay six seven eight nine hundred or a thousand or even hundreds of thousands of carts  compared with thisNow one time Pukkusa I was staying at Atuma and had my abode in a barn thereAnd at that time there was a heavy rain with thunder rolling lightning flashing and thunderbolts crashingAnd two farmers who were brothers were killed close to the barn together with four oxen and a great crowd came forth from Atuma to the spot where they were killedNow at that time Pukkusa I had come out of the barn and was walking up and down in thought before the doorAnd a certain man from the great crowd approached me respectfully greeted me and stood at one sideAnd I asked him Why brother has this great crowd gathered together And he answered me Just now Lord there was a heavy rain with thunder rolling lightning flashing and thunderbolts crashingAnd two farmers who were brothers were killed close by together with four oxenIt is because of this that the great crowd has gatheredBut where Lord were youI was here brother Yet Lord did you not see it I did not see it brother But the noise Lord you surely heard I did not hear it brother Then that man asked me Then Lord perhaps you slept No brother I was not sleeping Then Lord you were conscious I was brother Then that man said Then Lord while conscious and awake in the midst of a heavy rain with thunder rolling lightning flashing and thunderbolts crashing you neither saw it nor heard the noise And I answered him saying I did not brotherAnd to that man Pukkusa came the thought Marvellous it is most wonderful indeed it is the state of calmness wherein abide those who have gone forth from the world And there arose in him great faith in me and he respectfully saluted me and keeping his right side towards me he went his wayWhen this had been said Pukkusa of the Malla clan said to the Blessed One The faith Lord that I had in Alara Kalama I now scatter to the mighty wind I let it be carried away as by a flowing streamExcellent O Lord most excellent O LordIt is as if Lord one were to set upright what had been overthrown or to reveal what had been hidden or to show the path to one who had gone astray or to light a lamp in the darkness so that those having eyes might see  even so has the Blessed One set forth the Dhamma in many waysAnd so O Lord I take my refuge in the Blessed One the Dhamma and the Community of BhikkhusMay the Blessed One accept me as his disciple one who has taken refuge until the end of lifeThen Pukkusa of the Malla clan spoke to a certain man saying Bring me at once friend two sets of goldenhued robes burnished and ready for wear And the man answered him So be it sirAnd when the robes were brought Pukkusa of the Malla clan offered them to the Blessed One saying May the Blessed One O Lord out of compassion accept this from me And the Blessed One said Robe me then in one Pukkusa and in the other robe AnandaSo be it Lord And he thereupon robed the Blessed One in one and in the other he robed the Venerable AnandaAnd then the Blessed One instructed Pukkusa of the Malla clan in the Dhamma and roused edified and gladdened himAnd after that Pukkusa rose from his seat respectfully saluted the Blessed One and keeping his right side towards him went his wayAnd soon after Pukkusa of the Malla clan had departed the Venerable Ananda arranged the set of goldenhued robes burnished and ready for wear about the body of the Blessed OneBut when the set of robes was arranged upon the body of the Blessed One it became as though faded and its splendor dimmedAnd the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One Marvellous it is O Lord most wonderful indeed it is how clear and radiant the skin of the Tathagata appearsThis set of goldenhued robes burnished and ready for wear Lord now that it is arranged upon the body of the Blessed One seems to have become faded its splendor dimmedIt is so AnandaThere are two occasions Ananda when the skin of the Tathagata appears exceedingly clear and radiantWhich are these twoThe night Ananda when the Tathagata becomes fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment and the night when the Tathagata comes to his final passing away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remainsThese Ananda are the two occasions on which the skin of the Tathagata appears exceedingly clear and radiantAnd now today in the last watch of this very night Ananda in the Mallas Sala Grove in the vicinity of Kusinara between two sala trees the Tathagata will come to his ParinibbanaSo now Ananda let us go to the Kakuttha RiverThen the Blessed One went to the Kakuttha River together with a great community of bhikkhusAnd he went down into the water and bathed and drankAnd coming forth from the water again he went to the Mango Grove and there spoke to the Venerable Cundaka saying Please fold my upper robe in four Cundaka and lay it downI am weary and would rest awhileSo be it Lord And Cundaka folded the robe in four and laid it downAnd the Blessed One lay down on his right side in the lions posture resting one foot upon the other and so disposed himself mindfully and clearly comprehending with the time for rising held in mindAnd the Venerable Cundaka sat down right in front of the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying It may come to pass Ananda that someone will cause remorse to Cunda the metalworker saying It is no gain to you friend Cunda but a loss that it was from you the Tathagata took his last alms meal and then came to his end Then Ananda the remorse of Cunda should be dispelled after this manner It is a gain to you friend Cunda a blessing that the Tathagata took his last alms meal from you and then came to his endFor friend face to face with the Blessed One I have heard and learned There are two offerings of food which are of equal fruition of equal outcome exceeding in grandeur the fruition and result of any other offerings of foodWhich twoThe one partaken of by the Tathagata before becoming fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment and the one partaken of by the Tathagata before passing into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remainsBy his deed the worthy Cunda has accumulated merit which makes for long life beauty well being glory heavenly rebirth and sovereignty Thus Ananda the remorse of Cunda the metalworker should be dispelledThen the Blessed One understanding that matter breathed forth the solemn utteranceThen the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us cross to the farther bank of the Hiraññavati and go to the Mallas Sala Grove in the vicinity of KusinaraSo be it LordAnd the Blessed One together with a large company of bhikkhus went to the further bank of the river Hiraññavati to the Sala Grove of the Mallas in the vicinity of KusinaraAnd there he spoke to the Venerable Ananda sayingPlease Ananda prepare for me a couch between the twin sala trees with the head to the northI am weary Ananda and want to lie downSo be it Lord And the Venerable Ananda did as the Blessed One asked him to doThen the Blessed One lay down on his right side in the lions posture resting one foot upon the other and so disposed himself mindfully and clearly comprehendingAt that time the twin sala trees broke out in full bloom though it was not the season of floweringAnd the blossoms rained upon the body of the Tathagata and dropped and scattered and were strewn upon it in worship of the TathagataAnd celestial mandarava flowers and heavenly sandalwood powder from the sky rained down upon the body of the Tathagata and dropped and scattered and were strewn upon it in worship of the TathagataAnd the sound of heavenly voices and heavenly instruments made music in the air out of reverence for the TathagataAnd the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Ananda the twin sala trees are in full bloom though it is not the season of floweringAnd the blossoms rain upon the body of the Tathagata and drop and scatter and are strewn upon it in worship of the TathagataAnd celestial coral flowers and heavenly sandalwood powder from the sky rain down upon the body of the Tathagata and drop and scatter and are strewn upon it in worship of the TathagataAnd the sound of heavenly voices and heavenly instruments makes music in the air out of reverence for the TathagataYet it is not thus Ananda that the Tathagata is respected venerated esteemed worshipped and honored in the highest degreeBut Ananda whatever bhikkhu or bhikkhuni layman or laywoman abides by the Dhamma lives uprightly in the Dhamma walks in the way of the Dhamma it is by such a one that the Tathagata is respected venerated esteemed worshipped and honored in the highest degreeTherefore Ananda thus should you train yourselves We shall abide by the Dhamma live uprightly in the Dhamma walk in the way of the Dhamma At that time the Venerable Upavana was standing before the Blessed One fanning himAnd the Blessed One rebuked him saying Move aside bhikkhu do not stand in front of meAnd to the Venerable Ananda came the thought This Venerable Upavana has been in attendance on the Blessed One for a long time closely associating with him and serving himYet now right at the end the Blessed One rebukes himWhat now could be the reason what the cause for the Blessed One to rebuke the Venerable Upavana saying Move aside bhikkhu do not stand in front of meAnd the Venerable Ananda told his thought to the Blessed OneThe Blessed One said Throughout the tenfold worldsystem Ananda there are hardly any of the deities that have not gathered together to look upon the TathagataFor a distance of twelve yojanas around the Sala Grove of the Mallas in the vicinity of Kusinara there is not a spot that could be pricked with the tip of a hair that is not filled with powerful deitiesAnd these deities Ananda are complaining From afar have we come to look upon the TathagataFor rare in the world is the arising of Tathagatas Arahants Fully Enlightened OnesAnd this day in the last watch of the night the Tathagatas Parinibbana will come aboutBut this bhikkhu of great powers has placed himself right in front of the Blessed One concealing him so that now at the very end we are prevented from looking upon him Thus Ananda the deities complainOf what kind of deities Lord is the Blessed One awareThere are deities Ananda in space and on earth who are earthlyminded with dishevelled hair they weep with uplifted arms they weep flinging themselves on the ground they roll from side to side lamenting Too soon has the Blessed One come to his ParinibbanaToo soon has the Happy One come to his ParinibbanaToo soon will the Eye of the World vanish from sightBut those deities who are freed from passion mindful and comprehending reflect in this way Impermanent are all compounded thingsHow could this be otherwise Formerly Lord on leaving their quarters after the rains the bhikkhus would set forth to see the Tathagata and to us there was the gain and benefit of receiving and associating with those very revered bhikkhus who came to have audience with the Blessed One and to wait upon himBut Lord after the Blessed One has gone we shall no longer have that gain and benefitThere are four places Ananda that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverenceWhat are the fourHere the Tathagata was born This Ananda is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverenceHere the Tathagata became fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme Enlightenment This Ananda is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverenceHere the Tathagata set rolling the unexcelled Wheel of the Dhamma This Ananda is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverenceHere the Tathagata passed away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains This Ananda is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverenceThese Ananda are the four places that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverenceAnd truly there will come to these places Ananda pious bhikkhus and bhikkhunis laymen and laywomen reflecting Here the Tathagata was bornHere the Tathagata became fully enlightened in unsurpassed supreme EnlightenmentHere the Tathagata set rolling the unexcelled Wheel of the DhammaHere the Tathagata passed away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remainsAnd whoever Ananda should die on such a pilgrimage with his heart established in faith at the breaking up of the body after death will be reborn in a realm of heavenly happinessThen the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One How Lord should we conduct ourselves towards womenDo not see them AnandaBut Lord if we do see themDo not speak AnandaBut Lord if they should speak to usThen Ananda you should establish mindfulnessThen the Venerable Ananda said How should we act Lord respecting the body of the TathagataDo not hinder yourselves Ananda to honor the body of the TathagataRather you should strive Ananda and be zealous on your own behalf for your own goodUnflinchingly ardently and resolutely you should apply yourselves to your own goodFor there are Ananda wise nobles wise brahmans and wise householders who are devoted to the Tathagata and it is they who will render the honor to the body of the TathagataThen the Venerable Ananda said But how Lord should they act respecting the body of the TathagataAfter the same manner Ananda as towards the body of a universal monarchBut how Lord do they act respecting the body of a universal monarchThe body of a universal monarch Ananda is first wrapped round with new linen and then with teased cotton wool and so it is done up to five hundred layers of linen and five hundred of cotton woolWhen that is done the body of the universal monarch is placed in an iron oil vessel which is enclosed in another iron vessel a funeral pyre is built of all kinds of perfumed woods and so the body of the universal monarch is burned and at a crossroads a stupa is raised for the universal monarchSo it is done Ananda with the body of a universal monarchAnd even Ananda as with the body of a universal monarch so should it be done with the body of the Tathagata and at a crossroads also a stupa should be raised for the TathagataAnd whosoever shall bring to that place garlands or incense or sandalpaste or pay reverence and whose mind becomes calm there  it will be to his well being and happiness for a long timeThere are four persons Ananda who are worthy of a stupaWho are those fourA Tathagata an Arahant a Fully Enlightened One is worthy of a stupa so also is a Paccekabuddha and a disciple of a Tathagata and a universal monarchAnd why Ananda is a Tathagata an Arahant a Fully Enlightened One worthy of a stupaBecause Ananda at the thought This is the stupa of that Blessed One Arahant Fully Enlightened One the hearts of many people will be calmed and made happy and so calmed and with their minds established in faith therein at the breaking up of the body after death they will be reborn in a realm of heavenly happinessAnd so also at the thought This is the stupa of that Paccekabuddha or This is the stupa of a disciple of that Tathagata Arahant Fully Enlightened One or This is the stupa of that righteous monarch who ruled according to Dhamma  the hearts of many people are calmed and made happy and so calmed and with their minds established in faith therein at the breaking up of the body after death they will be reborn in a realm of heavenly happinessAnd it is because of this Ananda that these four persons are worthy of a stupaThen the Venerable Ananda went into the vihara and leaned against the doorpost and wept I am still but a learner and still have to strive for my own perfectionBut alas my Master who was so compassionate towards me is about to pass awayAnd the Blessed One spoke to the bhikkhus saying Where bhikkhus is AnandaThe Venerable Ananda Lord has gone into the vihara and there stands leaning against the door post and weeping I am still but a learner and still have to strive for my own perfectionBut alas my Master who was so compassionate towards me is about to pass away Then the Blessed One asked a certain bhikkhu to bring the Venerable Ananda to him saying Go bhikkhu and say to Ananda Friend Ananda the Master calls you So be it Lord And that bhikkhu went and spoke to the Venerable Ananda as the Blessed One had asked him toAnd the Venerable Ananda went to the Blessed One bowed down to him and sat down on one sideThen the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Enough AnandaDo not grieve do not lamentFor have I not taught from the very beginning that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change separation and severanceOf that which is born come into being compounded and subject to decay how can one say May it not come to dissolutionThere can be no such state of thingsNow for a long time Ananda you have served the Tathagata with lovingkindness in deed word and thought graciously pleasantly with a whole heart and beyond measureGreat good have you gathered AnandaNow you should put forth energy and soon you too will be free from the taintsThen the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Bhikkhus the Blessed Ones Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of times past also had excellent and devoted attendant bhikkhus such as I have in AnandaAnd so also bhikkhus will the Blessed Ones Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones of times to comeCapable and judicious is Ananda bhikkhus for he knows the proper time for bhikkhus to have audience with the Tathagata and the time for bhikkhunis the time for laymen and for laywomen the time for kings and for ministers of state the time for teachers of other sects and for their followersIn Ananda bhikkhus are to be found four rare and superlative qualitiesWhat are the fourIf bhikkhus a company of bhikkhus should go to see Ananda they become joyful on seeing him and if he then speaks to them of the Dhamma they are made joyful by his discourse and when he becomes silent they are disappointedSo it is also when bhikkhunis laymen or laywomen go to see Ananda they become joyful on seeing him and if he then speaks to them of the Dhamma they are made joyful by his discourse and when he becomes silent they are disappointedIn a universal monarch bhikkhus are to be found four rare and superlative qualitiesWhat are those fourIf bhikkhus a company of nobles should go to see the universal monarch they become joyful on seeing him and if he then speaks they are made joyful by his talk and when he becomes silent they are disappointedSo it is also when a company of brahmans of householders or of ascetics goes to see a universal monarchAnd in just the same way bhikkhus in Ananda are to be found these four rare and superlative qualitiesWhen this had been said the Venerable Ananda spoke to the Blessed One saying Let it not be Lord that the Blessed One should pass away in this mean place this uncivilized township in the midst of the jungle a mere outpost of the provinceThere are great cities Lord such as Campa Rajagaha Savatthi Saketa Kosambi and Benares  let the Blessed One have his final passing away in one of thoseFor in those cities dwell many wealthy nobles and brahmans and householders who are devotees of the Tathagata and they will render due honor to the remains of the TathagataDo not say that AnandaDo not say This mean place this uncivilized township in the midst of the jungle a mere outpost of the province In times long past Ananda there was a king by the name of Maha Sudassana who was a universal monarch a king of righteousness a conqueror of the four quarters of the earth whose realm was established in security and who was endowed with the seven jewelsAnd that King Maha Sudassana Ananda had his royal residence here at Kusinara which was then called Kusavati and it extended twelve yojanas from east to west and seven from north to southAnd mighty Ananda was Kusavati the capital prosperous and well populated much frequented by people and abundantly provided with foodJust as the royal residence of the deities Alakamanda is mighty prosperous and well populated much frequented by deities and abundantly provided with food so was the royal capital of KusavatiKusavati Ananda resounded unceasingly day and night with ten sounds  the trumpeting of elephants the neighing of horses the rattling of chariots the beating of drums and tabours music and song cheers the clapping of hands and cries of Eat drink and be merryGo now Ananda to Kusinara and announce to the Mallas Today Vasetthas in the last watch of the night the Tathagatas Parinibbana will take placeApproach O Vasetthas draw nearDo not be remorseful later at the thought In our township it was that the Tathagatas Parinibbana took place but we failed to see him at the end So be it Lord And the Venerable Ananda prepared himself and taking bowl and robe went with a companion to KusinaraNow at that time the Mallas had gathered in the council hall for some public businessAnd the Venerable Ananda approached them and announced Today Vasetthas in the last watch of the night the Tathagatas Parinibbana will take placeApproach Vasetthas draw nearDo not be remorseful later at the thought In our township it was that the Tathagatas Parinibbana took place but we failed to see him at the end When they heard the Venerable Ananda speak these words the Mallas with their sons their wives and the wives of their sons were sorely grieved grieved at heart and afflicted and some with their hair all dishevelled with arms uplifted in despair wept flinging themselves on the ground they rolled from side to side lamenting Too soon has the Blessed One come to his ParinibbanaToo soon has the Happy One come to his ParinibbanaToo soon will the Eye of the World vanish from sightAnd thus afflicted and filled with grief the Mallas with their sons their wives and the wives of their sons went to the Sala Grove the recreation park of the Mallas to the place where the Venerable Ananda wasAnd the thought arose in the Venerable Ananda If I were to allow the Mallas of Kusinara to pay reverence to the Blessed One one by one the night will have given place to dawn before they are all presented to himTherefore let me divide them up according to clan each family in a group and so present them to the Blessed One thus The Malla of such and such a name Lord with his wives and children his attendants and his friends pays homage at the feet of the Blessed One And the Venerable Ananda divided the Mallas up according to clan each family in a group and presented them to the Blessed OneSo it was that the Venerable Ananda caused the Mallas of Kusinara to be presented to the Blessed One by clans each family in a group even in the first watch of the nightNow at that time a wandering ascetic named Subhadda was dwelling at KusinaraAnd Subhadda the wandering ascetic heard it said Today in the third watch of the night the Parinibbana of the ascetic Gotama will take placeAnd the thought arose in him I have heard it said by old and venerable wandering ascetics teachers of teachers that the arising of Tathagatas Arahants Fully Enlightened Ones is rare in the worldYet this very day in the last watch of the night the Parinibbana of the ascetic Gotama will take placeNow there is in me a doubt but to this extent I have faith in the ascetic Gotama that he could so teach me the Dhamma as to remove that doubtThen the wandering ascetic Subhadda went to the Sala Grove the recreation park of the Mallas and drew near to the Venerable Ananda and told the Venerable Ananda his thoughtAnd he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Friend Ananda it would be good if I could be allowed into the presence of the ascetic GotamaBut the Venerable Ananda answered him saying Enough friend SubhaddaDo not trouble the TathagataThe Blessed One is wearyYet a second and a third time the wandering ascetic Subhadda made his request and a second and a third time the Venerable Ananda refused himAnd the Blessed One heard the talk between them and he called the Venerable Ananda and said Stop AnandaDo not refuse SubhaddaSubhadda Ananda may be allowed into the presence of the TathagataFor whatever he will ask me he will ask for the sake of knowledge and not as an offenceAnd the answer I give him that he will readily understandThereupon the Venerable Ananda said to the wandering ascetic Subhadda Go then friend Subhadda the Blessed One gives you leaveThen the wandering ascetic Subhadda approached the Blessed One and saluted him courteouslyAnd having exchanged with him pleasant and civil greetings the wandering ascetic Subhadda seated himself at one side and addressed the Blessed One saying There are Venerable Gotama ascetics and brahmans who are heads of great companies of disciples who have large retinues who are leaders of schools well known and renowned and held in high esteem by the multitude such teachers as Purana Kassapa Makkhali Gosala Ajita Kesakambali Pakudha Kaccayana Sañjaya Belatthaputta Nigantha NataputtaHave all of these attained realization as each of them would have it believed or has none of them or is it that some have attained realization and others notEnough SubhaddaLet it be as it may whether all of them have attained realization as each of them would have it believed or whether none of them has or whether some have attained realization and others notI will teach you the Dhamma Subhadda listen and heed it well and I will speakSo be it LordAnd the Blessed One spoke saying In whatsoever Dhamma and Discipline Subhadda there is not found the Noble Eightfold Path neither is there found a true ascetic of the first second third or fourth degree of saintlinessBut in whatsoever Dhamma and Discipline there is found the Noble Eightfold Path there is found a true ascetic of the first second third and fourth degrees of saintlinessNow in this Dhamma and Discipline Subhadda is found the Noble Eightfold Path and in it alone are also found true ascetics of the first second third and fourth degrees of saintlinessDevoid of true ascetics are the systems of other teachersBut if Subhadda the bhikkhus live righteously the world will not be destitute of arahatsIn age but twentynine was I SubhaddaAnd there is none of the second degree nor of the third degree nor of the fourth degree of saintlinessDevoid of true ascetics are the systems of other teachersBut if Subhadda the bhikkhus live righteously the world will not be destitute of arahatsWhen this was said the wandering ascetic Subhadda spoke to the Blessed One saying Excellent O Lord most excellent O LordIt is as if Lord one were to set upright what had been overthrown or to reveal what had been hidden or to show the path to one who had gone astray or to light a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes might see  even so has the Blessed One set forth the Dhamma in many waysAnd so O Lord I take my refuge in the Blessed One the Dhamma and the Community of BhikkhusMay I receive from the Blessed One admission to the Order and also the higher ordinationWhoever Subhadda having been formerly a follower of another creed wishes to receive admission and higher ordination in this Dhamma and Discipline remains on probation for a period of four monthsAt the end of those four months if the bhikkhus are satisfied with him they grant him admission and higher ordination as a bhikkhuYet in this matter I recognize differences of personalitiesIf O Lord whoever having been formerly a follower of another creed wishes to receive admission and higher ordination in this Dhamma and Discipline remains on probation for a period of four months and at the end of those four months if the bhikkhus are satisfied with him they grant him admission and higher ordination as a bhikkhu  then I will remain on probation for a period of four yearsAnd at the end of those four years if the bhikkhus are satisfied with me let them grant me admission and higher ordination as a bhikkhuBut the Blessed One called the Venerable Ananda and said to him Ananda let Subhadda be given admission into the Order And the Venerable Ananda replied So be it LordThen the wandering ascetic Subhadda said to the Venerable Ananda It is a gain to you friend Ananda a blessing that in the presence of the Master himself you have received the sprinkling of ordination as a discipleSo it came about that the wandering ascetic Subhadda in the presence of the Blessed One received admission and higher ordinationAnd from the time of his ordination the Venerable Subhadda remained alone secluded heedful ardent and resoluteAnd before long he attained to the goal for which a worthy man goes forth rightly from home to homelessness the supreme goal of the holy life and having by himself realized it with higher knowledge he dwelt thereinHe knew Destroyed is birth the higher life is fulfilled nothing more is to be done and beyond this life nothing more remains And the Venerable Subhadda became yet another among the arahats and he was the last disciple converted by the Blessed One himselfNow the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying It may be Ananda that to some among you the thought will come Ended is the word of the Master we have a Master no longer But it should not Ananda be so consideredFor that which I have proclaimed and made known as the Dhamma and the Discipline that shall be your Master when I am goneAnd Ananda whereas now the bhikkhus address one another as friend let it not be so when I am goneThe senior bhikkhus Ananda may address the junior ones by their name their family name or as friend but the junior bhikkhus should address the senior ones as venerable sir or your reverenceIf it is desired Ananda the Sangha may when I am gone abolish the lesser and minor rulesAnanda when I am gone let the higher penalty be imposed upon the bhikkhu ChannaBut what Lord is the higher penaltyThe bhikkhu Channa Ananda may say what he will but the bhikkhus should neither converse with him nor exhort him nor admonish himThen the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying It may be bhikkhus that one of you is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha the Dhamma or the Sangha the path or the practiceThen question bhikkhusDo not be given to remorse later on with the thought The Master was with us face to face yet face to face we failed to ask him But when this was said the bhikkhus were silentAnd yet a second and a third time the Blessed One said to them It may be bhikkhus that one of you is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha the Dhamma or the Sangha the path or the practiceThen question bhikkhusDo not be given to remorse later on with the thought The Master was with us face to face yet face to face we failed to ask him And for a second and a third time the bhikkhus were silentThen the Blessed One said to them It may be bhikkhus out of respect for the Master that you ask no questionsThen bhikkhus let friend communicate it to friend Yet still the bhikkhus were silentAnd the Venerable Ananda spoke to the Blessed One saying Marvellous it is O Lord most wonderful it isThis faith I have in the community of bhikkhus that not even one bhikkhu is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha the Dhamma or the Sangha the path or the practiceOut of faith Ananda you speak thusBut here Ananda the Tathagata knows for certain that among this community of bhikkhus there is not even one bhikkhu who is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha the Dhamma or the Sangha the path or the practiceFor Ananda among these five hundred bhikkhus even the lowest is a streamenterer secure from downfall assured and bound for enlightenmentAnd the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus saying Behold now bhikkhus I exhort you All compounded things are subject to vanishStrive with earnestnessThis was the last word of the TathagataAnd the Blessed One entered the first jhanaRising from the first jhana he entered the second jhanaRising from the second jhana he entered the third jhanaRising from the third jhana he entered the fourth jhanaAnd rising out of the fourth jhana he entered the sphere of infinite spaceRising from the attainment of the sphere of infinite space he entered the sphere of infinite consciousnessRising from the attainment of the sphere of infinite consciousness he entered the sphere of nothingnessRising from the attainment of the sphere of nothingness he entered the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionAnd rising out of the attainment of the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception he attained to the cessation of perception and feelingAnd the Venerable Ananda spoke to the Venerable Anuruddha saying Venerable Anuruddha the Blessed One has passed awayNo friend Ananda the Blessed One has not passed awayHe has entered the state of the cessation of perception and feelingThen the Blessed One rising from the cessation of perception and feeling entered the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionRising from the attainment of the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception he entered the sphere of nothingnessRising from the attainment of the sphere of nothingness he entered the sphere of infinite consciousnessRising from the attainment of the sphere of infinite consciousness he entered the sphere of infinite spaceRising from the attainment of the sphere of infinite space he entered the fourth jhanaRising from the fourth jhana he entered the third jhanaRising from the third jhana he entered the second jhanaRising from the second jhana he entered the first jhanaRising from the first jhana he entered the second jhanaRising from the second jhana he entered the third jhanaRising from the third jhana he entered the fourth jhanaAnd rising from the fourth jhana the Blessed One immediately passed awayAnd when the Blessed One had passed away simultaneously with his Parinibbana there came a tremendous earthquake dreadful and astounding and the thunders rolled across the heavensAnd when the Blessed One had passed away simultaneously with his Parinibbana Brahma Sahampati spoke this stanzaAnd when the Blessed One had passed away simultaneously with his Parinibbana Sakka king of the gods spoke this stanzaAnd when the Blessed One had passed away simultaneously with his Parinibbana the Venerable Anuruddha spoke this stanzaAnd when the Blessed One had passed away simultaneously with his Parinibbana the Venerable Ananda spoke this stanzaThen when the Blessed One had passed away some bhikkhus not yet freed from passion lifted up their arms and wept and some flinging themselves on the ground rolled from side to side and wept lamenting Too soon has the Blessed One come to his ParinibbanaToo soon has the Happy One come to his ParinibbanaToo soon has the Eye of the World vanished from sightBut the bhikkhus who were freed from passion mindful and clearly comprehending reflected in this way Impermanent are all compounded thingsHow could this be otherwiseAnd the Venerable Anuruddha addressed the bhikkhus saying Enough friendsDo not grieve do not lamentFor has not the Blessed One declared that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change separation and severanceOf that which is born come into being compounded and subject to decay how can one say May it not come to dissolutionThe deities friends are aggrievedBut venerable sir of what deities is the Venerable Anuruddha awareThere are deities friend Ananda in space and on the earth who are earthlyminded with dishevelled hair they weep with uplifted arms they weep flinging themselves on the ground they roll from side to side lamenting Too soon has the Blessed One come to his ParinibbanaToo soon has the Happy One come to his ParinibbanaToo soon has the Eye of the World vanished from sight But those deities who are freed from passion mindful and clearly comprehending reflect in this way Impermanent are all compounded thingsHow could this be otherwise Now the Venerable Anuruddha and the Venerable Ananda spent the rest of the night in talking on the DhammaThen the Venerable Anuruddha spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Go now friend Ananda to Kusinara and announce to the Mallas The Blessed One Vasetthas has passed awayDo now as seems fitting to you So be it venerable sir And the Venerable Ananda prepared himself in the forenoon and taking bowl and robe went with a companion into KusinaraAt that time the Mallas of Kusinara had gathered in the council hall to consider that very matterAnd the Venerable Ananda approached them and announced The Blessed One Vasetthas has passed awayDo now as seems fitting to youAnd when they heard the Venerable Ananda speak these words the Mallas with their sons their wives and the wives of their sons were sorely grieved grieved at heart and afflicted and some with their hair all dishevelled with arms upraised in despair wept flinging themselves on the ground they rolled from side to side lamenting Too soon has the Blessed One come to his ParinibbanaToo soon has the Happy One come to his ParinibbanaToo soon has the Eye of the World vanished from sightThen the Mallas of Kusinara gave orders to their men saying Gather now all the perfumes flowergarlands and musicians even all that are in Kusinara And the Mallas with the perfumes the flowergarlands and the musicians and with five hundred sets of clothing went to the Sala Grove the recreation park of the Mallas and approached the body of the Blessed OneAnd having approached they paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and erecting canopies and pavilions they spent the day showing respect honor and veneration to the body of the Blessed OneAnd then the thought came to them Now the day is too far spent for us to cremate the body of the Blessed OneTomorrow we will do itAnd for the second day and a third fourth fifth and sixth day they paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and erecting canopies and pavilions they spent the day showing respect honor and veneration to the body of the Blessed OneBut on the seventh day the thought came to them We have paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and have shown respect honor and veneration let us now carry the body of the Blessed One southward to the southern part of the town and beyond and let us there cremate the body of the Blessed One south of the townAnd eight Mallas of the foremost families bathed from the crown of their heads and wearing new clothes with the thought We will lift up the body of the Blessed One tried to do so but they could notThen the Mallas spoke to the Venerable Anuruddha saying What is the cause Venerable Anuruddha what is the reason that these eight Mallas of the foremost families bathed from the crown of their heads and wearing new clothes with the thought We will lift up the body of the Blessed One try to do so but cannotYou Vasetthas have one purpose the deities have anotherThen what venerable sir is the purpose of the deitiesYour purpose Vasetthas is this We have paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and have shown respect honor and veneration let us now carry the body of the Blessed One southward to the southern part of the town and beyond and let us there cremate the body of the Blessed One south of the town But the purpose of the deities Vasetthas is this We have paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with heavenly dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and have shown respect honor and veneration let us now carry the body of the Blessed One northward to the northern part of the town and having carried it through the northern gate let us go through the center of the town and then eastward to the east of the town and having passed through the east gate let us carry it to the cetiya of the Mallas Makutabandhana and there let us cremate the body of the Blessed One As the deities wish venerable sir so let it beThereupon the whole of Kusinara even to the dust heaps and rubbish heaps became covered kneedeep in mandarava flowersAnd homage was paid to the body of the Blessed One by the deities as well as the Mallas of KusinaraWith dance song music flowergarlands and perfume both divine and human respect honor and veneration were shownAnd they carried the body of the Blessed One northward to the northern part of the town and having carried it through the northern gate they went through the center of the town and then eastward to the east of the town and having passed through the east gate they carried the body of the Blessed One to the cetiya of the Mallas Makutabandhana and there laid it downThen the Mallas of Kusinara spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying How should we act Venerable Ananda respecting the body of the TathagataAfter the same manner Vasetthas as towards the body of a universal monarchBut how venerable Ananda do they act respecting the body of a universal monarchThe body of a universal monarch Vasetthas is first wrapped round with new linen and then with teased cotton woolAnd again it is wrapped round with new linen and again with teased cotton wool and so it is done up to five hundred layers of linen and five hundred of cotton woolWhen that is done the body of the universal monarch is placed in an iron oilvessel which is enclosed in another iron vessel and a funeral pyre is built of all kinds of perfumed woods and so the body of the universal monarch is burnedAnd at a crossroads a stupa is raised for the universal monarchSo it is done Vasetthas with the body of a universal monarchAnd even Vasetthas as with the body of a universal monarch so should it be done with the body of the Tathagata and at a crossroads also a stupa should be raised for the TathagataAnd whoever shall bring to that place garlands or incense or sandalwood paste or pay reverence and whose mind becomes calm there  it will be to his well being and happiness for a long timeThen the Mallas gave orders to their men saying Gather now all the teased cotton wool of the Mallas And the Mallas of Kusinara wrapped the body of the Blessed One round with new linen and then with teased cotton woolAnd again they wrapped it round with new linen and again with teased cotton wool and so it was done up to five hundred layers of linen and five hundred of cotton woolWhen that was done they placed the body of the Blessed One in an iron oilvessel which was enclosed in another iron vessel and they built a funeral pyre of all kinds of perfumed woods and upon it they laid the body of the Blessed OneNow at that time the Venerable Maha Kassapa was journeying from Pava to Kusinara together with a large company of five hundred bhikkhusAnd on the way the Venerable Maha Kassapa went aside from the highway and sat down at the foot of a treeAnd a certain Ajivaka came by on his way to Pava and he had taken a mandarava flower from KusinaraAnd the Venerable Maha Kassapa saw the Ajivaka coming from a distance and as he drew close he spoke to him saying Do you know friend anything of our MasterYes friend I knowIt is now seven days since the ascetic Gotama passed awayFrom there I have brought this mandarava flowerThereupon some bhikkhus not yet freed from passion lifted up their arms and wept and some flinging themselves on the ground rolled from side to side and wept lamenting Too soon has the Blessed One come to his ParinibbanaToo soon has the Happy One come to his ParinibbanaToo soon has the Eye of the World vanished from sightNow at that time one Subhadda who had renounced only in his old age was seated in the assemblyAnd he addressed the bhikkhus saying Enough friendsDo not grieve do not lamentWe are well rid of that great asceticToo long friends have we been oppressed by his saying This is fitting for you that is not fitting for you Now we shall be able to do as we wish and what we do not wish that we shall not doBut the Venerable Maha Kassapa addressed the bhikkhus saying Enough friendsDo not grieve do not lamentFor has not the Blessed One declared that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change separation and severanceOf that which is born come into being compounded and subject to decay how can one say May it not come to dissolutionNow at that time four Mallas of the foremost families bathed from the crown of their heads and wearing new clothes with the thought We will set alight the Blessed Ones pyre tried to do so but they could notAnd the Mallas spoke to the Venerable Anuruddha saying What is the cause Venerable Anuruddha what is the reason that these four Mallas of the foremost families bathed from the crown of their heads and wearing new clothes with the thought We will set alight the Blessed Ones pyre try to do so but cannotYou Vasetthas have one purpose the deities have anotherThen what venerable sir is the purpose of the deitiesThe purpose of the deities Vasetthas is this The Venerable Maha Kassapa is on his way from Pava to Kusinara together with a large company of five hundred bhikkhusLet not the Blessed Ones pyre be set alight until the Venerable Maha Kassapa has paid homage at the feet of the Blessed One As the deities wish venerable sir so let it beAnd the Venerable Maha Kassapa approached the pyre of the Blessed One at the cetiya of the Mallas Makutabandhana in KusinaraAnd he arranged his upper robe on one shoulder and with his clasped hands raised in salutation he walked three times round the pyre keeping his right side towards the Blessed Ones body and he paid homage at the feet of the Blessed OneAnd even so did the five hundred bhikkhusAnd when homage had been paid by the Venerable Maha Kassapa and the five hundred bhikkhus the pyre of the Blessed One burst into flame by itselfAnd it came about that when the body of the Blessed One had been burned no ashes or particles were to be seen of what had been skin tissue flesh sinews and fluid only bones remainedJust as when ghee or oil is burned it leaves no particles or ashes behind even so when the body of the Blessed One had been burned no ashes or particles were to be seen of what had been skin tissue flesh sinews and fluid only bones remainedAnd of the five hundred linen wrappings only two were not consumed the innermost and the outermostAnd when the body of the Blessed One had been burned water rained down from heaven and extinguished the pyre of the Blessed One and from the sala trees water came forth and the Mallas of Kusinara brought water scented with many kinds of perfumes and they too extinguished the pyre of the Blessed OneAnd the Mallas of Kusinara laid the relics of the Blessed One in their council hall and surrounded them with a latticework of spears and encircled them with a fence of bows and there for seven days they paid homage to the relics of the Blessed One with dance song music flowergarlands and perfume and showed respect honor and veneration to the relics of the Blessed OneThen the king of Magadha Ajatasattu son of the Videhi queen came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed awayAnd he sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara saying The Blessed One was of the warrior caste and I am tooI am worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed OneI will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honorAnd the Licchavis of Vesali came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed awayAnd they sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara saying The Blessed One was of the warrior caste and we are tooWe are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed OneWe will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honorAnd the Sakyas of Kapilavatthu came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed awayAnd they sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara saying The Blessed One was the greatest of our clanWe are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed OneWe will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honorAnd the Bulis of Allakappa came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed awayAnd they sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara saying The Blessed One was of the warrior caste and we are tooWe are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed OneWe will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honorAnd the Kolis of Ramagama came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed awayAnd they sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara saying The Blessed One was of the warrior caste and we are tooWe are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed OneWe will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honorAnd the Vethadipa brahman came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed awayAnd he sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara saying The Blessed One was of the warrior caste and I am a brahmanI am worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed OneI will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honorAnd the Mallas of Pava came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed awayAnd they sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara saying The Blessed One was of the warrior caste and we are tooWe are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed OneWe will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honorBut when they heard these words the Mallas of Kusinara addressed the assembly saying The Blessed One has passed away in our townshipWe shall not part with any portion of the relics of the Blessed One Then the brahman Dona spoke to the assembly sayingSo be it brahmanDivide the relics into eight equal portions yourselfAnd the brahman Dona said to the assembly So be it sirs And he divided justly into eight equal portions the relics of the Blessed One and having done so he addressed the assembly saying Let this urn sirs be given to meOver this urn I will erect a stupa and in its honor I will hold a festival And the urn was given to the brahman DonaThen the Moriyas of Pipphalivana came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed awayAnd they sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara saying The Blessed One was of the warrior caste and we are tooWe are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed OneWe will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honorThere is no portion of the relics of the Blessed One remaining the relics of the Blessed One have been dividedBut take from here the ashes And they took from there the ashesAnd the king of Magadha Ajatasattu son of the Videhi queen erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Rajagaha and in their honor held a festivalThe Licchavis of Vesali erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Vesali and in their honor held a festivalThe Sakyas of Kapilavatthu erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Kapilavatthu and in their honor held a festivalThe Bulis of Allakappa erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Allakappa and in their honor held a festivalThe Kolis of Ramagama erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Ramagama and in their honor held a festivalThe Vethadipa brahman erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Vethadipa and in their honor held a festivalThe Mallas of Pava erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Pava and in their honor held a festivalThe Mallas of Kusinara erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Kusinara and in their honor held a festivalThe brahman Dona erected a stupa over the urn and in its honor held a festivalAnd the Moriyas of Pipphalivana erected a stupa over the ashes at Pipphalivana and in their honor held a festivalSo it came about that there were eight stupas for the relics a ninth for the urn and a tenth for the ashesAnd thus it was in the days of oldComy He may stay alive completing the life span pertaining to men at the given timeKappavasesa in excess ie more or less above the hundred years said to be the normally highest life expectationAmong the numerous meanings of the word kappa there is in fact that of time in general and not only the duration of an aeon but the meaning life span seems to have been ascribed to it only in this passageAlso the meaning in excess for avasesa is unusualThe four constituents of psychic power are concentration due to zeal energy purity of mind and investigationThe commentary to our text gives three alternative explanations the flesh from a single firstborn pig neither too young nor too old which had come to hand naturally ie without intentional killing a preparation of soft boiled rice cooked with the five cowproducts a kind of alchemistic elixirDhammapala in his commentary to Udana VIII gives in addition young bamboo shoots trampled by pigsThe goal of Buddhist practice nibbana is said to be totally uncaused and right there is a paradoxIf the goal is uncaused how can a path of practice  which is causal by nature  bring it aboutThis is an ancient questionThe Milindapañha a set of dialogues composed near the start of the common era reports an exchange where King Milinda challenges a monk Nagasena with precisely this questionNagasena replies with an analogyThe path of practice doesnt cause nibbana he saysIt simply takes you there just as a road to a mountain doesnt cause the mountain to come into being but simply leads you to where it isNagasenas reply though apt didnt really settle the issue within the Buddhist traditionOver the years many schools of meditation have taught that mental fabrications simply get in the way of a goal thats uncaused and unfabricatedOnly by doing nothing at all and thus not fabricating anything in the mind they say will the unfabricated shine forthThis view is based on a very simplistic understanding of fabricated reality seeing causality as linear and totally predictable X causes Y which causes Z and so on with no effects turning around to condition their causes and no possible way of using causality to escape from the causal networkHowever one of the many things the Buddha discovered in the course of his awakening was that causality is not linearThe experience of the present is shaped both by actions in the present and by actions in the pastActions in the present shape both the present and the futureThe results of past and present actions continually interactThus there is always room for new input into the system which gives scope for free willThere is also room for the many feedback loops that make experience so thoroughly complex and that are so intriguingly described in chaos theoryReality doesnt resemble a simple line or circleIts more like the bizarre trajectories of a strange attractor or a Mandelbrot setBecause there are many similarities between chaos theory and Buddhist explanations of causality it seems legitimate to explore those similarities to see what light chaos theory can throw on the issue of how a causal path of practice can lead to an uncaused goalThis is not to equate Buddhism with chaos theory or to engage in pseudoscienceIts simply a search for similes to clear up an apparent conflict in the Buddhas teachingAnd it so happens that one of the discoveries of nonlinear math  the basis for chaos theory  throws light on just this issueIn the th century the French mathematician JulesHenri Poincar discovered that in any complex physical system there are points he called resonancesIf the forces governing the system are described as mathematical equations the resonances are the points where the equations intersect in such a way that one of the members is divided by zeroThis of course produces an undefined result which means that if an object within the system strayed into a resonance point it would no longer be defined by the causal network determining the systemIt would be set freeIn actual practice its very rare for an object to hit a resonance pointThe equations describing the points immediately around a resonance tend to deflect any incoming object from entering the resonance unless the object is on a precise path to the resonances very heartStill it doesnt take too much complexity to create resonances  Poincar discovered them while calculating the gravitational interactions among three bodies the earth the sun and the moonThe more complex the system the greater the number of resonances and the greater the likelihood that objects will stray into themIts no wonder that meteors on a large scale and electrons on a small scale occasionally wander right into a resonance in a gravitational or electronic field and thus to the freedom of total unpredictabilityThis is why meteors sometimes leave the solar system and why your computer occasionally freezes for no apparent reasonIts also why strange things could happen someday to the beating of your heartIf we were to apply this analogy to the Buddhist path the system were in is samsara the round of rebirthIts resonances would be what the texts called nonfashioning the opening to the uncaused nibbanaThe wall of resistant forces around the resonances would correspond to pain stress and attachmentTo allow yourself to be repelled by stress or deflected by attachment no matter how subtle would be like approaching a resonance but then veering off to another part of the systemBut to focus directly on analyzing stress and attachment and deconstructing their causes would be like getting on an undeflected trajectory right into the resonance and finding total undefined freedomThis of course is simply an analogyBut its a fruitful one for showing that there is nothing illogical in actively mastering the processes of mental fabrication and causality for the sake of going beyond fabrication beyond cause and effectAt the same time it gives a hint as to why a path of total inaction would not lead to the unfabricatedIf you simply sit still within the system of causality youll never get near the resonances where true nonfashioning liesYoull keep floating around in samsaraBut if you take aim at stress and clinging and work to take them apart youll be able to break through to the point where the present moment gets divided by zero in the mindAs my teacher once said If you cant control your mouth theres no way you can hope to control your mind This is why right speech is so important in daytoday practiceRight speech explained in negative terms means avoiding four types of harmful speech lies divisive speech harsh speech and idle chatterNotice the focus on intent this is where the practice of right speech intersects with the training of the mindBefore you speak you focus on why you want to speakThis helps get you in touch with all the machinations taking place in the committee of voices running your mindIf you see any unskillful motives lurking behind the committees decisions you veto themAs a result you become more aware of yourself more honest with yourself more firm with yourselfYou also save yourself from saying things that youll later regretIn this way you strengthen qualities of mind that will be helpful in meditation at the same time avoiding any potentially painful memories that would get in the way of being attentive to the present moment when the time comes to meditateIn positive terms right speech means speaking in ways that are trustworthy harmonious comforting and worth taking to heartWhen you make a practice of these positive forms of right speech your words become a gift to othersIn response other people will start listening more to what you say and will be more likely to respond in kindThis gives you a sense of the power of your actions the way you act in the present moment does shape the world of your experienceYou dont need to be a victim of past eventsFor many of us the most difficult part of practicing right speech lies in how we express our sense of humorEspecially here in America were used to getting laughs with exaggeration sarcasm group stereotypes and pure silliness  all classic examples of wrong speechIf people get used to these sorts of careless humor they stop listening carefully to what we sayIn this way we cheapen our own discourseActually theres enough irony in the state of the world that we dont need to exaggerate or be sarcasticThe greatest humorists are the ones who simply make us look directly at the way things areExpressing our humor in ways that are truthful useful and wise may require thought and effort but when we master this sort of wit we find that the effort is well spentWeve sharpened our own minds and have improved our verbal environmentIn this way even our jokes become part of our practice an opportunity to develop positive qualities of mind and to offer something of intelligent value to the people around usSo pay close attention to what you say  and to why you say itWhen you do youll discover that an open mouth doesnt have to be a mistakeThus have I heardOn one occasion the Exalted One was travelling along the highway between Rājagaha and Nālandā together with a great company of bhikkhus with about five hundred bhikkhusAt the same time the wanderer Suppiya was also travelling along the highway between Rājagaha and Nālandā together with his pupil the youth BrahmadattaAlong the way the wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaBut his pupil the youth Brahmadatta spoke in many ways in praise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaThus these two teacher and pupil followed closely behind the Exalted One and the company of bhikkhus making assertions in direct contradiction to each otherThen the Exalted One together with the company of bhikkhus entered the royal resthouse in the Ambalaṭṭhika garden in order to pass the nightThe wanderer Suppiya together with his pupil the youth Brahmadatta also entered the royal resthouse in the Ambalaṭṭhika garden in order to pass the nightThere too the wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha while his pupil Brahmadatta spoke in many ways in their praiseThus these two teacher and pupil dwelt together making assertions in direct contradiction to each otherWhen dawn broke a number of bhikkhus after rising assembled in the pavilionAs they sat together the following conversation sprang up among them It is wonderful and marvellous friends how the Exalted One he who knows and sees the Worthy One the perfectly enlightened Buddha has so thoroughly penetrated the diversity in the dispositions of beingsFor this wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha while his own pupil the youth Brahmadatta spoke in many ways in their praiseThese two teacher and pupil followed closely behind the Exalted One and the company of bhikkhus making assertions in direct contradiction to each otherThen the Exalted One realizing the turn their discussion had taken entered the pavilion sat down on the prepared seat and addressed the bhikkhus What kind of discussion were you holding just now bhikkhusWhat was the subject of your conversationThe bhikkhus replied When dawn had broken Lord after rising we assembled in the pavilionAs we sat here the following conversation sprang up among us It is wonderful and marvellous friends how the Exalted One he who knows and sees the Worthy One the perfectly enlightened Buddha has so thoroughly penetrated the diversity in the dispositions of beingsFor this wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha while his own pupil the youth Brahmadatta spoke in many ways in their praiseThese two teacher and pupil followed closely

their statements are rightly or wrongly spokenCertainly not LordIf bhikkhus others speak in dispraise of me or in dispraise of the Dhamma or in dispraise of the Sangha you should unravel what is false

praise of the Dhamma or in praise of the Sangha you should not give way to jubilation joy and exultation in your heartFor if you were to become jubilant joyful and exultant in such a situation you

bhikkhus are those trifling and insignificant matters those minor details of mere moral virtue that a worldling would refer to when speaking in praise of the TathāgataThere are bhikkhus other dhammas deep difficult to see difficult to understand peaceful and sublime beyond the sphere of reasoning subtle comprehensible only to the wise which the Tathāgata having realized for himself with direct knowledge propounds to others and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speakAnd what are these dhammasThere are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are speculators about the past who hold settled views about the past and who on eighteen grounds assert various conceptual theorems referring to the pastAnd owing to what with reference to what do these honorable recluses and brahmins frame their speculationsThere are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are eternalists and who on four grounds proclaim the self and the world to be eternalAnd owing to what with reference to what do these honorable recluses and brahmins proclaim their viewsIn the first case bhikkhus some recluse or a brahmin by means of ardor endeavor application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his numerous past lives that is one birth two three four or five births ten twenty thirty forty or fifty births a hundred a thousand or a hundred thousand births many hundreds of births many thousands of births many hundreds of thousands of birthsThen I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such my span of lifePassing away thence I rearose thereThere too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such my span of lifePassing away thence I rearose here Thus he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their detailsHe speaks thus The self and the world are eternal barren steadfast as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillarAnd though these beings roam and wander pass away and rearise yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itselfWhat is the reasonBecause I by means of ardor endeavor application diligence and right reflection attain to such a degree of mental concentration that with my mind thus concentrated I recollect my numerous past lives in their modes and their detailsFor this reason I know this the self and the world are eternal barren steadfast as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillarAnd though these beings roam and wander pass away and rearise yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itselfThis bhikkhus is the first caseIn the second case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins eternalists who proclaim the self and the world to be eternalHerein bhikkhus a certain recluse or brahmin by means of ardor endeavor application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his numerous past lives that is one aeon of worldcontraction and expansion throughout two three four five or ten aeons of worldcontraction and expansionThen I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such my span of lifePassing away thence I rearose thereThere too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such my span of lifePassing away thence I rearose here Thus he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their detailsHe speaks thus The self and the world are eternal barren steadfast as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillarAnd though these beings roam and wander pass away and rearise yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itselfWhat is the reasonThis bhikkhus is the second caseIn the third case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins eternalists who proclaim the self and the world to be eternalHerein bhikkhus some recluse or brahmin by means of ardor endeavor application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his numerous past lives that is ten aeons of worldcontraction and expansion throughout twenty thirty or forty aeons of worldcontraction and expansion Thus he recollects his numerous past lives in their modes and their detailsHe speaks thus The self and the world are eternal barren steadfast as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillarAnd though these beings roam and wander pass away and rearise yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itselfWhat is the reasonThis bhikkhus is the third caseIn the fourth case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins eternalists who proclaim the self and the world to be eternalHerein bhikkhus some recluse or brahmin is a rationalist an investigatorHe declares his view  hammered out by reason deduced from his investigations following his own flight of thought  thus The self and the world are eternal barren steadfast as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillarAnd though these beings roam and wander pass away and rearise yet the self and the world remain the same just like eternity itselfThis bhikkhus is the fourth caseIt is on these four grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are eternalists proclaim the self and the world to be eternalWhatever recluses and brahmins there may be who proclaim the self and the world to be eternal all of them do so on these four grounds or on a certain one of themOutside of these there is noneThis bhikkhus the Tathāgata understandsAnd he understands These standpoints thus assumed and thus misapprehended lead to such a future destination to such a state in the world beyond He understands as well what transcends this yet even that understanding he does not misapprehendAnd because he is free from misapprehension he has realized within himself the state of perfect peaceHaving understood as they really are the origin and the passing away of feelings their satisfaction their unsatisfactoriness and the escape from them the Tathāgata bhikkhus is emancipated through nonclingingThese are those dhammas bhikkhus that are deep difficult to see difficult to understand peaceful and sublime beyond the sphere of reasoning subtle comprehensible only to the wise which the Tathāgata having realized for himself with direct knowledge propounds to others and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speakThere are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are eternalists in regard to some things and noneternalists in regard to other things and who on four grounds proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternalAnd owing to what with reference to what do these honorable recluses and brahmins proclaim their viewsThere comes a time bhikkhus when after the lapse of a long period this world contractsWhile the world is contracting beings for the most part are reborn in the bhassara BrahmaworldThere they dwell mindmade feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the air abiding in gloryAnd they continue thus for a long long period of timeBut sooner or later bhikkhus after the lapse of a long period there comes a time when this world begins to expand once againWhile the world is expanding an empty palace of Brahmā appearsThen a certain being due to the exhaustion of his lifespan or the exhaustion of his merit passes away from the bhassara plane and rearises in the empty palace of BrahmāThere he dwells mind made feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the air abiding in gloryAnd he continues thus for a long long period of timeThen as a result of dwelling there all alone for so long a time there arises in him dissatisfaction and agitation Oh that other beings might come to this place Just at that moment due to the exhaustion of their lifespan or the exhaustion of their merit certain other beings pass away from the bhassara plane and rearise in the palace of Brahmā in companionship with himThere they dwell mindmade feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the air abiding in gloryAnd they continue thus for a long long period of timeThereupon the being who rearose there first thinks to himself I am Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Vanquisher the Unvanquished the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord the Maker and Creator the Supreme Being the Ordainer the Almighty the Father of all that are and are to beAnd these beings have been created by meWhat is the reasonBecause first I made the wish Oh that other beings might come to this place And after I made this resolution now these beings have comeAnd the beings who rearose there after him also think This must be Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Vanquisher the Unvanquished the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord the Maker and Creator the Supreme Being the Ordainer the Almighty the Father of all that are and are to beAnd we have been created by himWhat is the reasonBecause we see that he was here first and we appeared here after himHerein bhikkhus the being who rearose there first possesses longer life greater beauty and greater authority than the beings who rearose there after himNow bhikkhus this comes to pass that a certain being after passing away from that plane takes rebirth in this worldHaving come to this world he goes forth from home to homelessnessWhen he has gone forth by means of ardor endeavor application diligence and right reflection he attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life but none previous to thatHe speaks thus We were created by him by Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Vanquisher the Unvanquished the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord the Maker and Creator the Supreme Being the Ordainer the Almighty the Father of all that are and are to beHe is permanent stable eternal not subject to change and he will remain the same just like eternity itselfBut we who have been created by him and have come to this world are impermanent unstable shortlived doomed to perishThis bhikkhus is the first caseIn the second case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins eternalists in regard to some things and noneternalists in regard to other things proclaiming the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternalThere are bhikkhus certain gods called corrupted by playThese gods spend an excessive time indulging in the delights of laughter and playAs a consequence they become forgetful and when they become forgetful they pass away from that planeNow bhikkhus this comes to pass that a certain being after passing away from that plane takes rebirth in this worldHaving come to this world he goes forth from home to homelessnessWhen he has gone forth by means of ardor endeavor application diligence and right reflection he attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life but none previous to thatHe speaks thus Those honorable gods who are not corrupted by play do not spend an excessive time indulging in the delights of laughter and playAs a consequence they do not become forgetful and because they do not become forgetful they do not pass away from that planeThose gods are permanent stable eternal not subject to change and they will remain the same just like eternity itselfBut we were gods corrupted by playWe spent an excessive time indulging in the delights of laughter and play and as a consequence we became forgetfulWhen we became forgetful we passed away from that planeComing to this world now we are impermanent unstable shortlived doomed to perishThis bhikkhus is the second caseIn the third case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins eternalists in regard to some things and noneternalists in regard to other things proclaiming the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternalThere are bhikkhus certain gods called corrupted by mind These gods contemplate one another with excessive envyAs a consequence their minds becomes corrupted by anger towards one anotherWhen their minds are corrupted by anger their bodies and minds become exhausted and consequently they pass away from that planeNow bhikkhus this comes to pass that a certain being after passing away from that plane takes rebirth in this worldHaving come to this world he goes forth from home to homelessnessWhen he has gone forth by means of ardor endeavor application diligence and right reflection he attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life but none previous to thatHe speaks thus Those honorable gods who are not corrupted by mind do not contemplate each other with excessive envyAs a result their minds do not become corrupted by anger towards one another their bodies and minds do not become exhausted and they do not pass away from that planeThose gods are permanent stable not subject to change and they will remain the same just like eternity itselfBut we were gods corrupted by mindWe contemplated each other with excessive envy and as a result our minds became corrupted by anger towards one anotherWhen our minds were corrupted by anger our bodies and minds became exhausted and consequently we passed away from that planeComing to this world now we are impermanent unstable shortlived doomed to perishThis bhikkhus is the third caseIn the fourth case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins eternalists in regard to some things and noneternalists in regard to other things proclaiming the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternalHerein bhikkhus recluse or a certain brahmin is a rationalist an investigatorHe declares his view  hammered out by reason deduced from his investigations following his own flight of thought  thus That which is called the eye the ear the nose the tongue and the body  that self is impermanent unstable noneternal subject to changeBut that which is called mind or mentality or consciousness  that self is permanent stable eternal not subject to change and it will remain the same just like eternity itselfThis bhikkhus is the fourth caseIt is on these four grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are partialeternalists proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternalWhatever recluses and brahmins there may be who proclaim the self and the world to be partly eternal and partly noneternal all of them do so on these four grounds or on a certain one of themOutside of these there is noneThis bhikkhus the Tathāgata understandsAnd he understands These standpoints thus assumed and thus misapprehended lead to such a future destination to such a state in

which the Tathāgata having realized for himself with direct knowledge propounds to others and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speakThere are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are extensionists and who on four grounds proclaim the world to be finite or infiniteAnd owing to what with reference to what do these honorable recluses and brahmins proclaim their viewsIn the first case bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin by means of ardor endeavor application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he abides perceiving the world as finiteHe speaks thus The world is finite and boundedWhat is the reasonBecause I attain to such concentration

recluses and brahmins extensionists proclaiming the world to be finite or infiniteHerein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin by means of ardor endeavor application diligence and right reflection attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he abides perceiving the world as finite in the upward and downward directions but as infinite acrossHe speaks thus The world is both finite and infiniteThose recluses and brahmins who declare the world to be finite and bounded speak falsely and those recluses and brahmins who declare the world to be infinite and boundless also speak falselyThe world is both finite and infiniteFor what reasonBecause I attain to such concentration of mind that I abide perceiving the world as finite in the upward and downward directions but as infinite acrossFor this reason I know this the world is both finite and infiniteThis bhikkhus is the third caseIn the fourth case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins extensionists proclaiming the world to be finite or infiniteHerein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin is a rationalist an investigatorHe declares his view  hammered out by reason deduced from his investigations following his own flight of thought  thus The world is neither finite nor infiniteThose recluses and brahmins who declare the world to be finite and bounded those who declare it to be infinite and boundless and those who declare it to be both finite and infinite  all these speak falselyThe world is neither finite nor infiniteThis bhikkhus is the fourth caseIt is on these four grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are extensionists proclaim the world to be finite or infiniteWhatever recluses or brahmins there may be who proclaim the world to be finite or infinite all of them do so on these four grounds or on a certain one of themOutside of these there is noneThis bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands and it is concerning these that those who would praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speakThere are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who are endless equivocatorsWhen questioned about this or that point on four grounds they resort to evasive statements and to endless equivocationAnd owing to what with reference to what do these honorable recluses and brahmins do soHerein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin does not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesomeHe thinks I do not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesomeIf without understanding I were to declare something to be wholesome or unwholesome my declaration might be falseIf my declaration should be false that would distress me and that distress would be an obstacle for me Therefore out of fear and loathing of making a false statement he does not declare anything to be wholesome or unwholesomeBut when he is questioned about this or that point he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation I do not take it thus nor do I take it in that way nor do I take it in some other wayI do not say that it is not nor do I say that it is neither this nor that This bhikkhus is the first caseIn the second case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins endless equivocators resorting to evasive statements and to endless equivocationHerein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin does not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesomeHe thinks I do not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesomeIf without understanding I were to declare something to be wholesome or unwholesome desire and lust or hatred and aversion might arise in meShould desire and lust or hated and aversion arise in me that would be clinging on my partSuch clinging would distress me and that distress would be an obstacle for me Therefore out of fear and loathing of clinging he does not declare anything to be wholesome or unwholesomeBut when questioned about this or that point he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation I do not take it thus nor do I take it in that way nor do I take it in some other wayI do not say that it is not nor do I say that it is neither this nor that This bhikkhus is the second caseIn the third case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins endless equivocators resorting to evasive statements and to endless equivocationHerein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin does not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesomeHe thinks I do not understand as it really is what is wholesome and what is unwholesomeNow there are recluses and brahmins who are wise clever experienced in controversy who wander about demolishing the views of others with their wisdomIf without understanding I were to declare something to be wholesome or unwholesome they might crossexamine me about my views press me for reasons and refute my statementsIf they should do so I might not be able to replyIf I could not reply that would distress me and that distress would be an obstacle for me Therefore out of fear and loathing of being crossexamined he does not declare anything to be wholesome or unwholesomeBut when questioned about this or that point he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation I do not take it thus nor do I take it in that way nor do I take it in some other wayI do not say that it is not nor do I say that it is neither this nor thatThis bhikkhus is the third caseIn the fourth case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins endless equivocators resorting to evasive statements and to endless equivocationHerein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin is dull and stupidDue to his dullness and stupidity when he is questioned about this or that point he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation If you ask me whether there is a world beyond  if I thought there is another world I would declare that there isBut I do not take it thus nor do I take it in that way nor do I take it in some other wayI do not say that it is not nor do I say that is neither this nor thatSimilarly when asked any of the following questions he resorts to the same evasive statements and to endless equivocationThis bhikkhus is the fourth caseIt is on these four grounds bhikkhus that those recluses and brahmins who are endless equivocators resort to evasive statements and to endless equivocation when questioned about this or that pointWhatever recluses or brahmins there may be who resort to evasive statements and to endless equivocation all of them do so on these four grounds or on a certain one of themOutside of these

and brahmins who are fortuitous originationists and who on two grounds proclaim the self and the world to originate fortuitouslyAnd owing to what with reference to what do these honorable recluses and brahmins proclaim their viewsThere are bhikkhus certain gods called nonpercipient beings When perception arises in them those gods pass away from that planeNow bhikkhus this comes to pass that a certain being after passing away from that plane takes rebirth in this worldHaving come to this world he goes forth from home to homelessnessWhen he has gone forth by means of ardor endeavor application diligence and right reflection he attains to such a degree of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects the arising of perception but nothing previous to thatHe speaks thus The self and the world originate fortuitouslyWhat is the reasonBecause previously I did not exist but now I amNot having been I sprang into beingThis bhikkhus is the first caseIn the second case owing to what with reference to what are some honorable recluses and brahmins fortuitous originationists proclaiming the self and the world to originate fortuitouslyHerein bhikkhus a

view The self good sir has material form it is composed of the four primary elements and originates from father and motherSince this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death at this point the self is completely annihilated In this way some proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent beingTo him another says There is good sir such a self as you assertThat I do not denyBut it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilatedFor there is good sir another self  divine having material form pertaining to the sense sphere feeding on edible nutrimentThat you neither know nor see but I know it and see itSince this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death at this point the self is completely annihilated In this way others proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent beingTo him another says There is good sir such a self as you assertThat I do not denyBut it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilatedFor there is good sir another self  divine having material form mindmade complete in all its limbs and organs not destitute of any facultiesThat you neither know nor see but I know it and see itSince this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death at this point the self is completely annihilated In this way others proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent beingTo him another says There is good sir such a self as you assertThat I do not denyBut it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilatedFor there is good sir another self belonging to the base of infinite space the complete surmounting of perceptions of material form by the disappearance of perceptions of resistance by nonattention to perceptions of diversity Space is infinite That you neither know nor see but I know it and see itSince this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death at this point the self is completely annihilated In this way others proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent beingTo him another says There is good sir such a self as you assertThat I do not denyBut it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilatedFor there is good sir another self belonging to the base of infinite consciousness completely surmounting the base of infinite space Consciousness is infinite That you neither know nor seeBut I know it and see itSince this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death  at this point the self is completely annihilated In this way some proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent beingTo him another says There is good sir such a self as you assertThat I do not denyBut it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilatedFor there is good sir another self belonging to the base of nothingness completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness There is nothing That you neither know nor seeBut I know it and see itSince this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death  at this point the self is completely annihilated In this way some proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent beingTo him another says There is good sir such a self as you assertThat I do not denyBut it is not at that point that the self is completely annihilatedFor there is good sir another self belonging to the base of neither perception nor nonperception completely surmounting the base of nothingness This is the peaceful this is the sublime That you neither know nor seeBut I know it and see itSince this self good sir is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death  at this point the self is completely annihilated In this way some proclaim the annihilation destruction and extermination of an existent beingIt is on these seven grounds bhikkhus that

extermination of an existent being all of them do so on these seven grounds or on a certain one of themOutside of these there is noneThis bhikkhus the Tathāgata understands and it is concerning these that those who would rightly praise the Tathāgata in accordance with reality would speakThere are bhikkhus some recluses and brahmins who maintain a doctrine of Nibbāna here and now and who on five grounds proclaim Nibbāna here and now for an existent beingAnd owing to what with reference to what do these honorable recluses and brahmins proclaim their viewsHerein bhikkhus a certain recluse or a brahmin asserts the following doctrine or view When this self good sir furnished and supplied with the five strands of sense pleasures revels in them  at this point the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now In this way some proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent beingTo him another says There is good sir such a self as you assertThat I do not denyBut it is not at that point that the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and nowWhat is the reasonBecause good sir sense pleasures are impermanent suffering subject to change and through their change and transformation there arise sorrow lamentation pain grief and despairBut when the self quite secluded from sense pleasures secluded from unwholesome states enters and abides in the first jhāna which is accompanied by initial and sustained thought and contains the rapture and happiness born of seclusion  at this point good sir the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now In this way others proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent beingTo him another says There is good sir such a self as you assertThat I do not denyBut it is not at that point that the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and nowWhat is the reasonBecause that jhāna contains initial and sustained thought therefore it is declared to be grossBut when with the subsiding of initial and sustained thought the self enters and abides in the second jhāna which is accompanied by internal confidence and unification of mind is free from initial and sustained thought and contains the rapture and happiness born of concentration  at this point good sir the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now In this way others proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent beingTo him another says There is good sir such a self as you assertThat I do not denyBut it is not at that point that the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and nowWhat is the reasonIt is declared to be gross because of the mental exhilaration connected with rapture that exists thereBut when with the fading away of rapture one abides in equanimity mindful and clearly comprehending and still experiencing happiness with the body enters and abides in the third jhāna so that the ariyans announce He abides happily in equanimity and mindfulness  at this point good sir the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now In this way some proclaim supreme Nibbāna here and now for an existent beingTo him another says There is good sir such a self as you assertThat I do not denyBut it is not at that point that the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and nowWhat is the reasonIt is declared to be gross because a mental concern Happiness exists thereBut when with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the disappearance of previous joy and grief one enters and abides in the fourth jhāna which is without pleasure and pain and contains purification of mindfulness through equanimity  at this point good sir the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now In this way some

which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThis discourse is one of the masterpieces of the Pali canonAt heart it is a comprehensive portrait of the Buddhist path of training illustrating each stage of the training with vivid similesThis portrait is placed in juxtaposition to the Buddhist view of the teachings of rival philosophical teachers of the time showing how the Buddha  in contradistinction to the inflexible partyline approach of his contemporaries  presented his teaching in a way that was pertinent and sensitive to the needs of his listenersThis larger portrait of the intellectual landscape of early Buddhist India is then presented in a moving narrative frame the sad story of King AjatasattuAjatasattu was the son of King Bimbisara of Magadha one of the Buddhas earliest followersUrged on by Devadatta  the Buddhas cousin who wished to use Ajatasattus support in his bid to take over the Buddhas position as head of the Sangha  Ajatasattu arranged for his fathers death so that he could secure his own position on the throneAs a result of this evil deed he was destined not only to be killed by his own son  Udayibhadda  but also to take immediate rebirth in one of the lowest regions of hellIn this discourse Ajatasattu visits the Buddha in hopes that the latter will bring some peace to his mindThe question he puts to the Buddha shows the limited level of his own understanding so the Buddha patiently describes the steps of the training beginning at a very basic level and gradually moving up as a way of raising the kings spiritual horizonsAt the end of the talk Ajatasattu takes refuge in the Triple GemAlthough his earlier deeds were so heavy that this expression of faith could have only limited consequences in the immediate present the Commentary assures us that the kings story would ultimately have a happy endingAfter the Buddhas death he sponsored the First Council at which a congress of arahant disciples produced the first standardized account of the Buddhas teachingsAs a result of the merit coming from this deed Ajatasattu is destined  after his release from hell  to attain Awakening as a Private BuddhaI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Rajagaha in Jivaka Komarabhaccas mango grove with a large community of monks  monks in allNow at that time  it being the observance day the fullmoon night of the waterlily season the fourth month of the rains  King Ajatasattu of Magadha the son of Queen Videha was sitting on the roof terrace of his palace surrounded by his ministersThen he felt inspired to exclaim How wonderful is this moonlit nightHow beautiful How lovely How inspiring How auspicious is this moonlit nightWhat brahman or contemplative should we visit tonight who might enlighten and bring peace to our mindWhen this was said one of the ministers said to the king Your majesty there is Purana Kassapa the leader of a community the leader of a group the teacher of a group honored and famous esteemed as holy by the mass of peopleHe is aged long gone forth advanced in years in the last phase of lifeYour majesty should visit himPerhaps if you visited him he would enlighten and bring peace to your mindWhen this was said the king remained silentThen another minister said to the king Your

lifeYour majesty should visit himPerhaps if you visited him he would enlighten and bring peace to your mindWhen this was said the king remained silentAll this time Jivaka Komarabhacca was sitting silently not far from the kingSo the king said to him Friend Jivaka why are you silentYour majesty there is the Blessed One worthy and rightly selfawakened staying in my mango grove with a large community of monks  monks in allConcerning this Blessed One this admirable report has been spread Surely the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in clear knowing and conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the cosmos unexcelled trainer of tamable people teacher of beings human and divine awakened blessed Your majesty should visit himPerhaps if you visited him he would enlighten and bring peace to your mindThen in that case friend Jivaka have the riding elephants preparedHaving replied As you say your majesty having had five hundred female elephants prepared as well as the kings personal tusker Jivaka announced to the king Your majesty your riding elephants are preparedDo what you think it is now time to doThen the king having had five hundred of his women mounted on the five hundred female elephants  one on each  and having mounted his own personal tusker set out from the capital in full royal state with attendants carrying torches headed for Jivaka Komarabhaccas mango groveBut when the king was not far from the mango grove he was gripped with fear trepidation his hair standing on endFearful agitated his hair standing on end he said to Jivaka Komarabhacca Friend Jivaka you arent deceiving me are youYou arent betraying me are youYou arent turning me over to my enemies are youHow can there be such a large community of monks  in all  with no sound of sneezing no sound of coughing no voices at allDont be afraid great kingDont be afraidIm not deceiving you or betraying you or turning you over to your enemiesGo forward great king go forwardThose are lamps burning in the pavilion hallThen the king going as far on his tusker as the ground would permit dismounted and approached the door of the pavilion on footOn arrival he asked Jivaka Where friend Jivaka is the Blessed OneThat is the Blessed One great king sitting against the middle pillar facing east surrounded by the community of monksThen the king approached the Blessed One and on reaching him stood to one sideAs he was standing there  surveying the community of monks sitting in absolute silence as calm as a lake  he felt inspired to exclaim May my son Prince Udayibhadda enjoy the same peace that this community of monks now enjoysHave you come great king together with your affectionsLord my son Prince Udayibhadda is very dear to meMay he enjoy the same peace that this community of monks now enjoysThen bowing down to the Blessed One and saluting the community of monks with his hands palmtopalm over his heart he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One I would like to ask the Blessed One about a certain issue if he would give me the opportunity to explain my questionAsk great king whatever you likeLord there are these common craftsmen elephanttrainers horsetrainers charioteers archers standard bearers camp marshals supply corps officers high royal officers commandos military heroes armorclad warriors leatherclad warriors domestic slaves confectioners barbers bath attendants cooks garlandmakers laundrymen weavers basketmakers potters calculators accountants and any other common craftsmen of a similar sortThey live off the fruits of their crafts visible in the here and nowThey give pleasure and refreshment to themselves to their parents wives and children to their friends and colleaguesThey put in place an excellent presentation of offerings to brahmans and contemplatives leading to heaven resulting in happiness conducive to a heavenly rebirthIs it possible lord to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life visible in the here and nowDo you remember great king ever having asked this question of other brahmans and contemplativesYes I doIf it isnt troublesome for you how did they answerNo its not troublesome for me wherever the Blessed One  or someone like the Blessed One  is sittingThen speak great kingOnce lord I approached Purana Kassapa and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies I sat to one sideAs I was sitting there I asked him Venerable Kassapa there are these common craftsmen They live off the fruits of their crafts visible in the here and now Is it possible venerable sir to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life visible in the here and nowWhen this was said Purana Kassapa said to me Great king in acting or getting others to act in mutilating or getting others to mutilate in torturing or getting others to torture in inflicting sorrow or in getting others to inflict sorrow in tormenting or getting others to torment in intimidating or getting others to intimidate in taking life taking what is not given breaking into houses plundering wealth committing burglary ambushing highways committing adultery speaking falsehood  one does no evilIf with a razoredged disk one were to turn all the living beings on this earth to a single heap of flesh a single pile of flesh there would be no evil from that cause no coming of evilEven if one were to go along the right bank of the Ganges killing and getting others to kill mutilating and getting others to mutilate torturing and getting others to torture there would be no evil from that cause no coming of evilEven if one were to go along the left bank of the Ganges giving and getting others to give making sacrifices and getting others to make sacrifices there would be no merit from that cause no coming of meritThrough generosity selfcontrol restraint and truthful speech there is no merit from that cause no coming of

of elation and distress  he enters and remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neitherpleasure nor stressHe sits permeating the body with a pure bright awarenessJust as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating the body with a pure bright awarenessThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awarenessThis too great king is a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous

forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the community of monksMay the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeA transgression has overcome me lord in that I was so foolish so muddleheaded and so unskilled as to kill my father  a righteous man a righteous king  for the sake of sovereign rulershipMay the Blessed One please accept this confession of my transgression as such so that I may restrain myself in the futureYes great king a transgression overcame you in that you were so foolish so muddleheaded and so unskilled as to kill your father  a righteous man a righteous king  for the sake of sovereign rulershipBut because you see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with the Dhamma we accept your confessionFor it is a cause of growth in the Dhamma  Discipline of the noble ones when seeing a transgression as such one makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma and exercises restraint in the futureWhen this was said King Ajatasattu said to the Blessed One Well then lord I am now taking leaveMany are my duties many my responsibilitiesThen do great king what you think it is now time to doSo King Ajatasattu delighting and rejoicing in the Blessed Ones words rose from his seat bowed down to him and  after circumambulating him  leftNot long after King Ajatasattu had left the Blessed One addressed the monks The king is wounded monksThe king is incapacitatedHad he not killed his father  that righteous man that righteous king  the dustless stainless Dhamma eye would have arisen to him as he sat in this very seatThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsMany Westerners when new to Buddhism are struck by the uncanny familiarity of what seem to be its central concepts interconnectedness wholeness egotranscendenceBut what they may not realize is that the concepts sound familiar because they are familiarTo a large extent they come not from the Buddhas teachings but from the Dharma gate of Western psychology through which the Buddhas words have been filteredThey draw less from the root sources of the Dharma than from their own hidden roots in Western culture the thought of the German RomanticsThe German Romantics may be dead and almost forgotten but their ideas are still very much aliveTheir thought has survived because they were the first to tackle the problem of how it feels to grow up in a modern societyTheir analysis of the problem together with their proposed solution still rings trueModern society they saw is dehumanizing in that it denies human beings their wholenessThe specialization of labor leads to feelings of fragmentation and isolation the bureaucratic state to feelings of regimentation and constrictionThe only cure for these feelings the Romantics proposed is the creative artistic actThis act integrates the divided self and dissolves its boundaries in an enlarged sense of identity and interconnectedness with other human beings and nature at largeHuman beings are most fully human when free to create spontaneously from the heartThe hearts creations are what allow people to connectAlthough many Romantics regarded religious institutions and doctrines as dehumanizing some of them turned to religious experience  a direct feeling of oneness with the whole of nature  as a primary source for rehumanizationWhen psychology and psychotherapy developed as disciplines in the West they absorbed many of the Romantics ideas and broadcast them into the culture at largeAs a result concepts such as integration of the personality selffulfillment and interconnectedness together with the healing powers of wholeness spontaneity playfulness and fluidity have long been part of the air we breatheSo has the idea that religion is a primarily a quest for a feelingexperience and religious doctrines are a creative response to that experienceIn addition to influencing psychology these conceptions inspired liberal Christianity and reform Judaism which proposed that traditional doctrines had to be creatively recast to speak to each new generation in order to keep religious experience vital and aliveSo it was only natural that when the Dharma came west people interpreted it in line with these conceptions as wellAsian teachers  many of whom had absorbed Romantic ideas through Westernized education before coming here  found they could connect with Western audiences by stressing themes of spontaneity and fluidity in opposition to the bureaucracy of the ego Western students discovered that they could relate to the doctrine of dependent coarising when it was interpreted as a variation on interconnectedness and they could embrace the doctrine of notself as a denial of the separate self in favor of a larger more encompassing identity with the entire cosmosIn fact the Romantic view of religious life has shaped more than just isolated Dharma teachingsIt colors the Western view of the purpose of Dharma practice as a wholeWestern teachers from all traditions maintain that the aim of Buddhist practice is to gain the creative fluidity that overcomes dualitiesAs one author has put it the Buddha taught that dissolving the barriers that we erect between ourselves and the world is the best use of our human lives manifests as inquisitiveness as adaptability as humor as playfulness our capacity to relax with not knowing Or as another has said When our identity expands to include everything we find a peace with the dance of the world Adds a third Our job for the rest of our life is to open up into that immensity and to express itJust as the Chinese had Taoism as their Dharma gate  the homegrown tradition providing concepts that helped them understand the Dharma  we in the West have Romanticism as oursThe Chinese experience with Dharma gates though contains an important lesson that is often overlookedAfter three centuries of interest in Buddhist teachings they began to realize that Buddhism and Taoism were asking different questionsAs they rooted out these differences they started using Buddhist ideas to question their Taoist presuppositionsThis was how Buddhism instead of turning into a drop in the Taoist sea was able to inject something genuinely new into Chinese cultureThe question here in the West is whether we will learn from the Chinese example and start using Buddhist ideas to question our Dharma gate to see exactly how far the similarities between the gate and the actual Dharma goIf we dont we run the danger of mistaking the gate for the Dharma itself and of never going through it to the other sideTaken broadly Romanticism and the Dharma view spiritual life in a similar lightBoth regard religion as a product of human activity rather than divine interventionBoth regard the essence of religion as experiential and pragmatic and its role as therapeutic aimed at curing the diseases of the human mindBut if you examine the historical roots of both traditions you find that they disagree sharply not only on the nature of religious experience but also on the nature of the mental diseases it can treat and on the nature of what it means to be curedThese differences arent just historical curiositiesThey shape the presuppositions that meditators bring to the practiceEven when fully present the mind carries along its past presuppositions using them to judge which experiences  if any  should be valuedThis is one of the implications of the Buddhist doctrine on karmaAs long as these presuppositions remain unexamined they hold an unknown powerSo to break that power we need to examine the roots of the Buddhist Romanticism  the Dharma as seen through the Romantic gateAnd for the examination to jibe with Buddhist ideas of causality we have to look for those roots in two directions into the past for the origin of Romantic ideas and into the present for the conditions that keep Romantic ideas attractive in the here and nowThe Romantics took their original inspiration from an unexpected source Kant the wizened old professor whose daily walks were so punctual that his neighbors could set their clocks by himIn his Critique of Judgment he taught that aesthetic creation and feeling were the highest activities of the human mind in that they alone could heal the dichotomies of human experienceFriedrich Schiller perhaps the most influential Romantic philosopher elaborated on this thesis with his notion of the aesthetic play drive as the ultimate expression of human freedom beyond both the compulsions of animal existence and the laws of reason bringing both into integrationMan he said is fully a human being only when he playsIn Schillers eyes this play drive not only integrated the self but also helped dissolve ones separation from other human beings and the natural environment as a wholeA person with the internal freedom needed for selfintegration would instinctively want others to experience the same freedom as wellThis connection explains the Romantic political program of offering help and sympathy for the oppressed of all nations in overthrowing their oppressorsThe value of internal unity in their eyes was proven by its ability to create bonds of unity in the world of social and political actionSchiller saw the process of integration as unending perfect unity could never be achievedA meaningful life was one continually engaged in the process of integrationThe path was the goalIt was also totally unpatterned and unconstrainedGiven the free nature of the play drive each persons path to integration was individual and uniqueSchillers colleague Friedrich Schleiermacher applied these ideas to religion concluding that it like any other art form was a human creation and that its greatest function lay in healing the splits both within the human personality and in human society at largeHe defined the essence of religion as the sensibility and taste for the infinite which begins in the receptive mind state where awareness opens to the infiniteThis feeling for the infinite is followed by an act of the creative imagination which articulates that feeling to oneself and othersBecause these creative acts  and thus all religious doctrines  are a step removed from the reality of the experience they are constantly open to improvement and changeA few quotations from his essays On Religion will give a sense of Schleiermachers thoughtThe individual is not just part of a whole but an exhibition of itThe mind like the universe is creative not just receptiveWhoever has learned to be more than himself knows that he loses little when he loses himselfRather than align themselves with a belief of personal immortality after death the truly religious would prefer to strive to annihilate their personality and live in the one and in the allWhere is religion chiefly to be soughtWhere the living contact of a human being with the world fashions itself as feelingTruly religious people are tolerant of different translations of this feeling even the hesitation of atheismNot to have the divine immediately present in ones feelings has always seemed to them more irreligious than such a hesitationTo insist on one particular conception of the divine to be true is far from religionSchiller and Schleiermacher both had a strong influence on Ralph Waldo Emerson which can easily be seen in the latters writingsWere sometimes told that Emerson was influenced by Eastern religions but actually his readings in Buddhism and Hinduism simply provided chapter and verse for the lessons he had already learned from the European RomanticsBring the past into the eyed present and live ever in a new dayWith consistency a great soul has simply nothing to doThe essence of genius of virtue and of life is what is called Spontaneity or InstinctEvery man knows that to his involuntary perceptions a perfect faith is dueThe reason why the world lacks unity is because man is disunited with himself We live in succession in division in parts in particlesMeanwhile within man is the soul of the whole the wise silence the universal beauty to which every part and particle is equally related the eternal OneAnd this deep power in which we exist and whose beatitude is all accessible to us is not only selfsufficing and perfect in every hour but the act of seeing and the thing seen the seer and the spectacle the subject and the object are oneAt present the Romantics and Transcendentalists are rarely read outside of literature or theology classesTheir ideas have lived on in the general culture largely because they were adopted by the discipline of psychology and translated into a vocabulary that was both more scientific and more accessible to the public at largeOne of the most crucial translators was William James who gave the psychological study of religion its modern form a century ago in with the publication of The Varieties of Religious ExperienceJames broad sympathies extended beyond Western culture to include Buddhism and Hinduism and beyond the acceptable religions of his time to include the Mental Culture movement the th centurys version of the New AgeHis interest in diversity makes him seem amazingly postmodernStill James was influenced by the intellectual currents alive in his time which shaped the way he converted his large mass of data into a psychology of religionAlthough he spoke as a scientist the current with the deepest influence on his thought was RomanticismHe followed the Romantics in saying that the function of religious experience was to heal the sense of divided self creating a more integrated selfidentity better able to function in societyHowever to be scientific the psychology of religion must not side for or against any truth claims concerning the content of religious experiencesFor instance many religious experiences produce a strong conviction in the oneness of the cosmos as a wholeAlthough scientific observers should accept the feeling of oneness as a fact they shouldnt take it as proof that the cosmos is indeed oneInstead they should judge each experience by its effects on the personalityJames was not disturbed by the many mutually contradictory truthclaims that religious experiences have produced over the centuriesIn his eyes different temperaments need different truths as medicine to heal their psychological woundsDrawing on Methodism to provide two categories for classifying all religious experiences  conversion and sanctification  James gave a Romantic interpretation to bothFor the Methodists these categories applied specifically to the souls relationship to GodConversion was the turning of the soul to Gods will sanctification the attunement of the soul to Gods will in all its actionsTo apply these categories to other religions James removed the references to God leaving a more Romantic definition conversion unifies the personality sanctification represents the ongoing integration of that unification into daily lifeAlso James followed the Romantics in judging the effects of both types of experiences in thisworldly termsConversion experiences are healthy when they foster healthy sanctification the ability to maintain ones integrity in the rough and tumble of daily life acting as a moral and responsible member of human societyIn psychological terms James saw conversion as simply an extreme example of the breakthroughs ordinarily encountered in adolescenceAnd he agreed with the Romantics that personal integration was a process to be pursued throughout life rather than a goal to be achievedOther writers who took up the psychology of religion after James devised a more scientific vocabulary to analyze their dataStill they maintained many of the Romantic notions that James had introduced into the fieldFor example in Modern Man in Search of a Soul Carl Jung agreed that religions proper role lay in healing of divisions within the personality although he saw the same basic split in everyone the narrow fearful ego vsthe wiser more spacious unconsciousThus he regarded religion as a primitive form of psychotherapyIn fact he actually lay closer than James to the Romantics in his definition of psychic healthQuoting Schillers assertion that human beings are most human when they are at play Jung saw the cultivation of spontaneity and fluidity both as a means for integrating the divided personality and as an expression of the healthy personality engaged in the unending process of integration internal and external throughout lifeUnlike James Jung saw the integrated personality as lying above the rigid confines of moralityAnd although he didnt use the term he extolled what Keats called negative capability the ability to deal comfortably with uncertainties and mysteries without trying to impose confining certainties on themThus Jung recommended borrowing from religions any teachings that assist the process of integration while rejecting any teachings that would inhibit the spontaneity of the integrated selfIn Religions Values and PeakExperiences Abraham Maslow the American father of transpersonal psychology divided religious experiences into the same two categories used by JamesBut in an attempt to divorce these categories from any particular tradition he named them after the shape they would assume if graphed over time peakexperiences and plateauexperiencesThese terms have now entered the common vernacularPeakexperiences are shortlived feelings of oneness and integration that can come not only in the area of religion but also in sport sex and artPlateauexperiences exhibit a more stable sense of integration and last much longerMaslow had little use for traditional interpretations of peak experiences regarding them as cultural overlays that obscured the true nature of the experienceAssuming all peak experiences regardless of cause or context to be basically the same he reduced them to their common psychological features such as feelings of wholeness dichotomytranscendence playfulness and effortlessnessThus reduced he found they werent of lasting value unless they could be transformed into plateau experiencesTo this end he saw psychotherapy as necessary for their perfection integrating them into a regime of counseling and education that would actualize the full potential of the human being  intellectual physical social sexual  in a society where all areas of life are sacred and plateauexperiences commonplace for allThese three writers on the psychology of religion despite their differences kept Romantic ideas about religion alive in the West by giving them the scientific stamp of approvalThrough their influence these ideas have shaped humanistic psychology and  through humanistic psychology  the expectations many Americans bring to the DharmaHowever when we compare these expectations with the original principles of the Dharma we find radical differencesThe contrast between them is especially strong around the three most central issues of spiritual life What is the essence of religious experienceWhat is the basic illness that religious experience can cureAnd what does it mean to be curedThe nature of religious experienceFor humanistic psychology as for the Romantics religious experience is a direct feeling rather than the discovery of objective truthsThe essential feeling is a oneness overcoming all inner and outer divisionsThese experiences come in two sorts peak experiences in which the sense of oneness breaks through divisions and dualities and plateau experiences where  through training  the sense of oneness creates a healthy sense of self informing all of ones activities in everyday lifeHowever the Dharma as expounded in its earliest records places training in oneness and a healthy sense of self prior to the most dramatic religious experiencesA healthy sense of self is fostered through training in generosity and virtueA sense of oneness  peak or plateau  is attained in mundane levels of concentration that constitute the path rather than the goal of practiceThe ultimate religious experience Awakening is something else entirelyIt is described not in terms of feeling but of knowledge skillful mastery of the principles of causality underlying actions and their results followed by direct knowledge of the dimension beyond causality where all suffering stopsThe basic spiritual illnessRomantichumanistic psychology states that the root of suffering is a sense of divided self which creates not only inner boundaries  between reason and emotion body and mind ego and shadow  but also outer ones separating us from other people and from nature and the cosmos as a wholeThe Dharma however teaches that the essence of suffering is clinging and that the most basic form of clinging is selfidentification regardless of whether ones sense of self is finite or infinite fluid or static unitary or notThe successful spiritual cureRomantichumanistic psychology maintains that a total final cure is unattainableInstead the cure is an ongoing process of personal integrationThe enlightened person is marked by an enlarged fluid sense of self unencumbered by moral rigidityGuided primarily by what feels right in the context of interconnectedness one negotiates with ease  like a dancer  the roles and rhythms of lifeHaving learned the creative answer to the question What is my true identity one is freed from the need for certainties about any of lifes other mysteriesThe Dharma however teaches that full Awakening achieves a total cure opening to the unconditioned beyond time and space at which point the task is doneThe awakened person then follows a path that cant be traced but is incapable of transgressing the basic principles of moralitySuch a person realizes that the question What is my true identity was illconceived and knows from direct experience the total release from time and space that will happen at deathWhen these two traditions are compared pointbypoint its obvious that  from the perspective of early Buddhism  Romantichumanistic psychology gives only a partial and limited view of the potentials of spiritual practiceThis means that Buddhist Romanticism in translating the Dharma into Romantic principles gives only a partial and limited view of what Buddhism has to offerNow for many people these limitations dont matter because they come to Buddhist Romanticism for reasons rooted more in the present than in the pastModern society is now even more schizoid than anything the Romantics ever knewIt has made us more and more dependent on wider and wider circles of other people yet keeps most of those dependencies hiddenOur food and clothing come from the store but how they got there or who is responsible for ensuring a continual supply we dont knowWhen investigative reporters track down the web of connections from field to final product in our hands the bare facts read like an exposOur sweatshirts for example come from Uzbekistani cotton woven in Iran sewn in South Korea and stored in Kentucky  an unstable web of interdependencies that involve not a little suffering both for the producers and for those pushed out of the production web by cheaper laborWhether or not we know these details we intuitively sense the fragmentation and uncertainty created by the entire systemThus many of us feel a need for a sense of wholenessFor those who benefit from the hidden dependencies of modern life a corollary need is a sense of reassurance that interconnectedness is reliable and benign  or if not yet benign that feasible reforms can make it that wayThey want to hear that they can safely place their trust in the principle of interconnectedness without fear that it will turn on them or let them downWhen Buddhist Romanticism speaks to these needs it opens the gate to areas of Dharma that can help many people find the solace theyre looking forIn doing so it augments the work of psychotherapy which may explain why so many psychotherapists have embraced Dharma practice for their own needs and for their patients and why some have become Dharma teachers themselvesHowever Buddhist Romanticism also helps close the gate to areas of the Dharma that would challenge people in their hope for an ultimate happiness based on interconnectednessTraditional Dharma calls for renunciation and sacrifice on the grounds that all interconnectedness is essentially unstable and any happiness based on this instability is an invitation to sufferingTrue happiness has to go beyond interdependence and interconnectedness to the unconditionedIn response the Romantic argument brands these teachings as dualistic either inessential to the religious experience or inadequate expressions of itThus it concludes they can safely be ignoredIn this way the gate closes off radical areas of the Dharma designed to address levels of suffering remaining even when a sense of wholeness has been masteredIt also closes off two groups of people who would otherwise benefit greatly from Dharma practiceFor both of these groups the concepts of Buddhist Romanticism seem Pollyannaish the cure it offers too facileAs a Dharma gate its more like a door shut in their facesLike so many other products of modern life the root sources of Buddhist Romanticism have for too long remained hiddenThis is why we havent recognized it for what it is or realized the price we pay in mistaking the part for the wholeBarring major changes in American society Buddhist Romanticism is sure to surviveWhats needed is for more windows and doors to throw light onto the radical aspects of the Dharma that Buddhist Romanticism has so far left in the darkTheres an old saying that the road to hell is paved with good intentions but thats not really the caseThe road to hell is paved with intentions that are careless lustful or meanGood intentions  in proportion to their true goodness  tend toward heavens of pleasureSo why do they have such a bad reputationFor three main reasonsOne is that not all good intentions are especially skillfulEven though they mean well they can be misguided and inappropriate for the occasion thus resulting in pain and regretA second reason is that we often misunderstand the quality of our own intentionsWe may mistake a mixed intention for a good one for instance and thus get disappointed when it gives mixed resultsA third reason is that we easily misread the way intentions yield their results  as when the painful results of a bad intention in the past obscure the results of a good intention in the present and yet we blame our present intention for the painAll these reasons acting together lead us to become disillusioned with the potential of good intentionsAs a result we either grow cynical about them or else simply abandon the care and patience needed to perfect themOne of the Buddhas most penetrating discoveries is that our intentions are the main factors shaping our lives and that they can be mastered as a skillIf we subject them to the same qualities of mindfulness persistence and discernment involved in developing any skill we can perfect them to the point where they will lead to no regrets or damaging results in any given situation ultimately they can lead us to the truest possible happinessTo train our intentions in this way though requires a deep level of selfawarenessWhy is thatIf you look carefully at the reasons for our disillusionment with good intentions youll find that they all come down to delusion delusion in how we formulate our intentions delusion in how we perceive our intentions and delusion in how we attend to their resultsAs the Buddha tells us delusion is one of the three main roots for unskillful mental habits the other two being greed and aversionThese unskillful roots lie entangled with skillful roots  states of mind that are free of greed aversion and delusion  in the soil of the untrained heartIf we cant isolate and dig up the unskillful roots we can never be fully sure of our intentionsEven when a skillful intention seems foremost in the mind the unskillful roots can quickly send up shoots that blind us as to whats actually going onIf we were to sketch this state of affairs the picture would look something like this The straight road to hell is paved with bad intentions some of which may look good to a casual glanceRoads paved with good intentions leading to heavens of pleasure  some of them quite skillful  branch off on either side of the way but all too often they get lost in an underbrush of unskillfulness and we find ourselves back on the road to hellThe Buddhas discovery was that if we nourish the skillful roots they can grow and effectively block the road to hell if we cut away the underbrush of unskillfulness and dig out its roots we can develop our good intentions to higher and higher levels of skill until ultimately they bring us to a happiness totally unlimited beyond any further need for a pathThe most basic step in this process is to make sure that we stay off the road to hellWe do this through the practice of generosity and virtue consciously replacing unskillful intentions with more skillful onesWe then refine our intentions even further through meditation digging up the roots of greed aversion and delusion to prevent them from influencing the choices shaping our livesGreed and anger are sometimes easy to detect but delusion  by its very nature  is obscureWhen were deluded we dont know were deludedThats why meditation has to focus on strengthening and quickening our powers of mindfulness and alertness so that we can catch sight of delusion and uproot it before it takes over our mindsThe Buddhas most basic meditation instructions for refining intention start not on the cushion but with the activity of daily lifeThey are contained in a discourse to his young son Rahula and attack the Catch of delusion through two approachesThe first is what the early Buddhist texts call appropriate attention  the ability to ask yourself the right questions questions that cut straight to the causes of pleasure and pain without entangling the mind in needless confusionThe second approach is friendship with admirable people  associating with and learning from people who are virtuous generous and wiseThese two factors the Buddha said are the most helpful internal and external aids for a person following the pathIn essence the Buddha told Rahula to use his actions as a mirror for reflecting the quality of his mindEach time before he acted  and here acting covers any action in thought word or deed  he was to reflect on the result he expected from the action and ask himself Is this going to lead to harm for myself and others or not If it was going to be harmful he shouldnt do itIf it looked harmless he could go ahead and actHowever the Buddha cautioned Rahula he shouldnt blindly trust his expectationsWhile he was in the process of acting he should ask himself if there were any unexpected bad consequences arisingIf there were he should stopIf there werent he could continue his action to the endEven then though the job of reflection wasnt finishedHe should also notice the actual short and longterm consequences of the actionIf an action in word or deed ended up causing harm then he should inform a fellowpractitioner on the path and listen to that persons adviceIf the mistaken action was purely an act of the mind then he should develop a sense of shame and disgust toward that kind of thoughtIn both cases he should resolve never to make the same mistake againIf however the longterm consequences of the original action were harmless he should take joy in being on the right path and continue his trainingFrom this we can see that the essential approach for uncovering delusion is the familiar principle of learning from our own mistakesThe way the Buddha formulates this principle though has important implications for it demands qualities of selfhonesty and maturity in areas where they are normally hard to find our evaluation of our own intentions and of the results of our actionsAs children we learn to be dishonest about our intentions simply as a matter of survival I didnt mean to do it I couldnt help it I was just swinging my arm and he got in the wayAfter a while we begin to believe our own excuses and dont like to admit to ourselves when our intentions are less than nobleThus we get into the habit of not articulating our intentions when faced with a choice of refusing to consider the consequences of our intentions and  in many cases  of denying that we had a choice to begin withThis is how addictive behavior starts and unskillful intentions are given free reinA similar dynamic surrounds our reactions to the consequences of our actionsWe start learning denial at an early age  It wasnt my fault It was already broken when I lay down on it  and then internalize the process as a way of preserving our selfimage to the point where it becomes our second nature to turn a blind eye to the impact of our mistakesAs the Buddha points out the end of suffering requires that we abandon craving and ignorance but if we cant be honest with ourselves about our intentions how can we perceive craving in time to abandon itIf we cant face up to the principle of cause and effect in our actions how will we ever overcome ignoranceIgnorance is caused less by a lack of information than by a lack of selfawareness and selfhonestyTo understand the noble truths requires that we be truthful with ourselves in precisely the areas where selfhonesty is most difficultIt also requires maturityAs we examine our intentions we need to learn how to say no to unskillful motives in a way thats firm enough to keep them in check but not so firm that it drives them underground into subconscious repressionWe can learn to see the mind as a committee the fact that unworthy impulses are proposed by members of the committee doesnt mean that we are unworthyWe dont have to assume responsibility for everything that gets brought to the committee floorOur responsibility lies instead in our power to adopt or veto the motionAt the same time we should be adult enough to admit that our habitual or spontaneous impulses are not always trustworthy  first thought is not always best thought  and that what we feel like doing now may not give results that will be pleasant to feel at a later dateAs the Buddha said there are four courses of action that may be open to us at any particular time one that we want to do and will give good results one that we dont want to do and will give bad results one that we want to do but will give bad results and one that we dont want to do but will give good resultsThe first two are nobrainersWe dont need much intelligence to do the first and avoid the secondThe measure of our true intelligence lies in how we handle the last two choicesExamining the results of our actions requires maturity as well a mature realization that selfesteem cant be based on always being right and that theres nothing demeaning or degrading in admitting a mistakeWe all come from a state of delusion  even the Buddha was coming from delusion as he sought Awakening  so its only natural that there will be mistakesOur human dignity lies in our ability to recognize those mistakes to resolve not to repeat them and to stick to that resolutionThis in turn requires that we not be debilitated by feelings of guilt or remorse over our errorsAs the Buddha states feelings of guilt cant undo a past error and they can deprive the mind of the strength it needs to keep from repeating old mistakesThis is why he recommends an emotion different from guilt  shame  although his use of the word implies something totally unlike the sense of unworthiness we often associate with the termRemember that both the Buddha and Rahula were members of the noble warrior class a class with a strong sense of its own honor and dignityAnd notice that the Buddha tells Rahula to see his past mistakes not himself as shamefulThis implies that its beneath Rahulas dignity to act in ways that are less than honorableThe fact that he can see his actions as shameful is a sign of his honor  and is also a sign that hell be able not to repeat themThis sense of honor is what underlies a mature healthy and productive sense of shameAt first glance we might think that continual selfreflection of this sort would add further complications to our lives when they already seem more than complicated enough but in fact the Buddhas instructions are an attempt to strip the questions in our minds down to the most useful essentialsHe explicitly warns against taking on too many questions particularly those that lead nowhere and tie us up in knots Who am IAm I basically a good personAn unworthy person Instead he tells us to focus on our intentions so that we can see how they shape our life and to master the processes of cause and effect so that they can shape our life in increasingly better waysThis is the way every great artist or craftsman develops mastery and skillThe emphasis on the intentions behind our actions and their resulting consequences also carries over from daily life onto the meditation seat providing our meditation with the proper focusIn examining our actions in terms of cause and effect skillful and unskillful we are already beginning to look at experience in line with the two sets of variables that make up the four noble truths the origination of stress the path to the cessation of stress stress and the cessation of stressThe way the Buddha recommended that Rahula judge the results of his actions  both while doing them and after they are done  echoes the insight that formed the heart of his Awakening that intentions have results both in the immediate present and over timeWhen we look at the present moment from this perspective we find that our experience of the present doesnt just happen Instead its a product of our involvement  in terms of present intentions the results of present intentions and the results of past intentions  in which present intentions are the most important factorThe more we focus on that involvement the more we can bring it out of the halflight of the subconscious and into the full light of awarenessThere we can train our intentions through conscious trial and error to be even more skillful enabling us to lessen our experience of suffering and pain in the presentThis is how skillful intentions pave the road to mental health and well being in the ordinary world of our livesAs we work at developing our intentions to even higher levels of skill we find that the most consummate intentions are those that center the mind securely in a clear awareness of the presentAs we use them to become more and more familiar with the present we come to see that all present intentions no matter how skillful are inherently burdensomeThe only way out of this burden is to allow the unraveling of the intentions that provide the weave for our present experienceThis provides an opening to the dimension of unlimited freedom that lies beyond themThats how skillful intentions pave the road all the way to the edge of nirvanaAnd from there the path  like that of birds through space  cant be tracedDuring my first weeks with my teacher Ajaan Fuang I began to realize that he had psychic powersHe never made a show of them but I gradually sensed that he could read my mind and anticipate future eventsI became intrigued What else did he knowHow did he know itHe must have detected where my thoughts were going for one evening he gently headed me off You know he said the whole aim of our practice is purity of heartEverything else is just gamesThat one phrase  purity of heart  more than intrigued meIt reverberated deep down insideAlthough I was extremely disillusioned with Christianity I still valued Kierkegaards dictum Purity of heart is to will one thingI didnt agree with Kierkegaard as to what that one thing was but I did agree that purity of heart is the most important treasure of lifeAnd here Ajaan Fuang was offering to teach me how to develop itThats one of the reasons why I stayed with him until he diedHis basic definition of purity of heart was simple enough a happiness that will never harm anyoneBut a happiness like that is hard to find for ordinary happiness requires that we eatAs the first of the Novices Questions says What is oneAll beings subsist on food This is how the Buddha introduced the topic of causality to young people The primary causal relationship isnt something gentle like light reflecting off mirrors or jewels illuminating jewelsIts feedingOur bodies need physical food for their wellbeingOur minds need the food of pleasant sensory contacts intentions and consciousness itself in order to functionIf you ever want proof that interconnectedness isnt always something to celebrate just contemplate how the beings of the world feed on one another physically and emotionallyInterbeing is intereatingAs Ajaan Suwat my second teacher once said If there were a god who could arrange that by my eating I could make everyone in the world full Id bow down to that god But thats not how eating worksOrdinarily even wellintentioned people may not see eating as harmfulWere so compelled to eat that we blind ourselves to its larger impactOur first pleasure after the terror of being born was getting to feedWe did it with our eyes closed and most people keep their eyes closed to the impact of their feeding throughout lifeBut when you go to a quiet secluded place and start examining your life you begin to see what an enormous issue it is just to keep the body and mind well fedOn the one hand you see the suffering you create for others simply in your need to feedOn the other you see something even more dismaying the emotions that arise within you when you dont feel that your body and mind are getting enough to eatYou realize that as long as your source of physical or mental food is unreliable youre unreliable tooYou see why even good people can reach a point where theyre capable of murder deceit adultery or theftBeing born with a body means that were born with a huge bundle of needs that compels and can overwhelm our mindsFortunately we human beings have the potential to civilize our eating habits by learning to wean ourselves from our passion for the junk food of sights sounds smells etc and look instead for good food withinWhen we learn to appreciate the joy that comes from generosity honor compassion and trust we see that its much more fulfilling than the pleasure that comes simply from grabbing what we can for ourselvesWe realize that our happiness cant be independent of the happiness of othersWe can give one another our belongings our time our love our selves and see it not as a loss but as a mutual gainUnfortunately these qualities of the heart are conditional for they depend on a tender web of beliefs and feelings  belief in justice and the basic goodness of human nature feelings of trust and affectionWhen that web breaks as it so easily can the heart can turn viciousWe see this in divorce broken families and society at largeWhen the security of our food source  the basis of our mental and material wellbeing  gets threatened the finer qualities of the mind can vanishPeople who believe in kindness can suddenly seek revengeThose who espouse nonviolence can suddenly call for warAnd those who rule by divisiveness  by making a mockery of compassion prudence and our common humanity  find a willing following for their lawofthejungle agendaThis is why compassion based only on belief or feeling is not enough to guarantee our behavior  and why the practice of training the mind to reach an unconditioned happiness is not a selfish thingIf you value compassion and trust its an imperative for only an unconditioned happiness can guarantee the purity of your behaviorIndependent of space and time its beyond alterationNo one can threaten its food source for it has no need to feedWhen youve had even just a glimpse of this happiness your belief in goodness becomes unshakableThat way other people can totally trust you and you can genuinely trust yourselfYou lack for nothingPurity of heart is to know this one thingThese two are foolsWhich twoThe one who doesnt see hisher transgression as a transgression and the one who doesnt rightfully pardon another who has confessed hisher transgressionThese two are foolsThese two are wiseWhich twoThe one who sees hisher transgression as a transgression and the one who rightfully pardons another who has confessed hisher transgressionThese two are wiseIts a cause of growth in the Dhamma and Vinaya of the noble ones when seeing a transgression as such one makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma and exercises restraint in the futureThe Buddha succeeded in establishing a religion that has been a genuine force for peace and harmony not only because of the high value he placed on these qualities but also because of the precise instructions he gave on how to achieve them through forgiveness and reconciliationCentral to these instructions is his insight that forgiveness is one thing reconciliation is something elseThe Pali word for forgivenesskhamaalso means the earth A mind like the earth is nonreactive and unperturbedWhen you forgive me for harming you you decide not to retaliate to seek no revengeYou dont have to like meYou simply unburden yourself of the weight of resentment and cut the cycle of retribution that would otherwise keep us ensnarled in an ugly samsaric wrestling matchThis is a gift you can give us both totally on your own without my having to know or understand what youve doneReconciliation  patisaraniyakamma  means a return to amicability and that requires more than forgivenessIt requires the reestablishing of trustIf I deny responsibility for my actions or maintain that I did no wrong theres no way we can be reconciledSimilarly if I insist that your feelings dont matter or that you have no right to hold me to your standards of right and wrong you wont trust me not to hurt you againTo regain your trust I have to show my respect for you and for our mutual standards of what is and is not acceptable behavior to admit that I hurt you and that I was wrong to do so and to promise to exercise restraint in the futureAt the same time you have to inspire my trust too in the respectful way you conduct the process of reconciliationOnly then can our friendship regain a solid footingThus there are right and wrong ways of attempting reconciliation those that skillfully meet these requirements for reestablishing trust and those that dontTo encourage right reconciliation among his followers the Buddha formulated detailed methods for achieving it along with a culture of values that encourages putting those methods to useThe methods are contained in the Pali Vinayas instructions for how monks should confess their offenses to one another how they should seek reconciliation with lay people they have wronged how they should settle protracted disputes and how a full split in the Sangha should be healedAlthough directed to monks these instructions embody principles that apply to anyone seeking reconciliation of differences whether personal or politicalThe first step in every case is an acknowledgement of wrongdoingWhen a monk confesses an offense such as having insulted another monk he first admits to having said the insultThen he agrees that the insult really was an offenseFinally he promises to restrain himself from repeating the offense in the futureA monk seeking reconciliation with a lay person follows a similar pattern with another monk on friendly terms with the lay person acting as mediatorIf a dispute has broken the Sangha into factions that have both behaved in unseemly ways then when the factions seek reconciliation they are advised first to clear the air in a procedure called covering over with grass Both sides make a blanket confession of wrongdoing and a promise not to dig up each others minor offensesThis frees them to focus on the major wrongdoings if any that caused or exacerbated the disputeTo heal a full split in the Sangha the two sides are instructed first to inquire into the root intentions on both sides that led to the split for if those intentions were irredeemably malicious or dishonest reconciliation is impossibleIf the group tries to patch things up without getting to the root of the split nothing has really been healedOnly when the root intentions have been shown to be reconcilable and the differences resolved can the Sangha perform the brief ceremony that reestablishes harmonyPervading these instructions is the realization that genuine reconciliation cannot be based simply on the desire for harmonyIt requires a mutual understanding of what actions served to create disharmony and a promise to try to avoid those actions in the futureThis in turn requires a clearly articulated agreement about  and commitment to  mutual standards of right and wrongEven if the parties to a reconciliation agree to disagree their agreement needs to distinguish between right and wrong ways of handling their differencesYet right and wrong have gotten a bad rap in Western Buddhist circles largely because of the ways in which we have seen right and wrong abused in our own culture  as when one person tries to impose arbitrary standards or meanspirited punishments on others or hypocritically demands that others obey standards that he himself does notTo avoid these abuses some people have recommended living by a nondual vision that transcends attachment to right and wrongThis vision however is open to abuse as wellIn communities where it is espoused irresponsible members can use the rhetoric of nonduality and nonattachment to excuse genuinely harmful behavior their victims are left adrift with no commonly accepted standards on which to base their appeals for redressEven the act of forgiveness is suspect in such a context for what right do the victims have to judge actions as requiring forgiveness or notAll too often the victims are the ones held at fault for imposing their standards on others and not being able to rise above dualistic viewsThis means that right and wrong have not really been transcended in such a communityTheyve simply been realigned If you can claim a nondual perspective youre in the right no matter what youve doneIf you complain about another persons behavior youre in the wrongAnd because this realignment is not openly acknowledged as such it creates an atmosphere of hypocrisy in which genuine reconciliation is impossibleSo the solution lies not in abandoning right and wrong but in learning how to use them wiselyThus the Buddha backed up his methods for reconciliation with a culture of values whereby right and wrong become aids rather than hindrances to reconciliationTo prevent those in the right from abusing their position he counseled that they reflect on themselves before they accuse another of wrongdoingThe checklist of questions he recommended boils down to this Am I free from unreconciled offenses of my ownAm I motivated by kindness rather than vengeanceAm I really clear on our mutual standards Only if they can answer yes to these questions should they bring up the issueFurthermore the Buddha recommended that they determine to speak only words that are true timely gentle to the point and prompted by kindnessTheir motivation should be compassion solicitude for the welfare of all parties involved and the desire to see the wrongdoer rehabilitated together with an overriding desire to hold to fair principles of right and wrongTo encourage a wrongdoer to see reconciliation as a winning rather than a losing proposition the Buddha praised the honest acceptance of blame as an honorable rather than a shameful act not just a means but the means for progress in spiritual practiceAs he told his son Rahula the ability to recognize ones mistakes and admit them to others is the essential factor in achieving purity in thought word and deedOr as he said in the Dhammapada people who recognize their own mistakes and change their ways illumine the world like the moon when freed from a cloudIn addition to providing these incentives for honestly admitting misbehavior the Buddha blocked the paths to denialModern sociologists have identified five basic strategies that people use to avoid accepting blame when theyve caused harm and its noteworthy that the Pali teaching on moral responsibility serves to undercut all fiveThe strategies are to deny responsibility to deny that harm was actually done to deny the worth of the victim to attack the accuser and to claim that they were acting in the service of a higher causeThe Pali responses to these strategies are We are always responsible for our conscious choicesWe should always put ourselves in the other persons placeAll beings are worthy of respectWe should regard those who point out our faults as if they were pointing out treasureThere are no  repeat no  higher purposes that excuse breaking the basic precepts of ethical behaviorIn setting out these standards the Buddha created a context of values that encourages both parties entering into a reconciliation to employ right speech and to engage in the honest responsible selfreflection basic to all Dhamma practiceIn this way standards of right and wrong behavior instead of being oppressive or petty engender deep and longlasting trustIn addition to creating the external harmony conducive to Dhamma practice the process of reconciliation thus also becomes an opportunity for inner growthThe Buddha admitted that not all disputes can be reconciledThere are times when one or both parties are unwilling to exercise the honesty and restraint that true reconciliation requiresEven then though forgiveness is still an optionThis is why the distinction between reconciliation and forgiveness is so importantIt encourages us not to settle for mere forgiveness when the genuine healing of right reconciliation is possible and it allows us to be generous with our forgiveness even when it is notThe Buddha could have concluded his teaching career with some inspiring words on the bliss of nirvana or emptiness but he didntHe ended with a piece of advice Achieve completion through appamadaCommon English translations of through appamada  such as untiringly earnestly with diligence  convey the notion of sustained determined effortThese give the impression that the Buddhas last message was to stick with the practiceTranslations of the phrase into various Asian languages though give it a different twistSri Lankan commentaries translate appamada as unrelaxed mindfulness Thais interpret it as heedfulness vigilance wariness careThe Canon itself in another context defines appamada as carefully guarding the mind against defiling mental states at the same time strengthening it in terms of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernmentIn the light of these interpretations the Buddhas final message wasnt simply to persevereHe was saying Dont be complacentWatch out for dangerProtect the minds good qualitiesDont get caught with your guard downThese interpretations help make sense of other instances where the Buddha stressed the importance of appamada as when he said that appamada is the path to the Deathless or that all skillful qualities of mind are rooted in appamada converge in appamada and have appamada as the foremost among themMere sustained effort cant fill the role of appamada in these passages for effort without wisdom can wreak all sorts of havocVigilance and heedfulness however provide the perspective needed to keep effort on the right track keeping us wary of our potential for causing pointless suffering for ourselves and others and teaching us to trust in our ability  if we take the appropriate care  to bring those sufferings to an endThis combined sense of wariness and trust is based on conviction of the principle of karma that our actions really do make a difference that the difference between causing and not causing suffering really does matter and that the principles of skillful and unskillful action are patterned enough that we really can learn useful lessons from our mistakesAt the same time this combination of wariness and trust is what allows appamada to play such an important role in the practice providing the motivation to get on the path of skillful action in the first place and the inner checks and balances that can keep us on the path all the way to the DeathlessWithout a strong sense of trust in the path its hard to attempt it without a strong sense of the dangers inherent in any conditioned happiness its easy to fall offThe chief danger of course lies in the minds creative capacity for selfdeceptionBut  unlike many other religious figures  the Buddha didnt simply recommend that if we cant trust ourselves we should place our trust in himInstead he provided ways for us to train ourselves to be trustworthy by investigating the areas where we tend to lie to ourselves most our intentions and the results of our actionsIn his first instructions to his son Rahula he told Rahula to reflect on his intentions before acting on them and to carry through with them only if he saw that his intended action would cause no harmWhile acting he should reflect on the immediate results of his actions if they were causing any unintended harm he should stopAfter acting he should reflect on the longterm results of his actionsIf he saw that they actually did cause harm he should resolve never to repeat themIf they didnt he should take joy and continue on the pathThese are basic instructions in integrity learning to see where you can and cant trust yourself and  by repeatedly testing yourself against the principle of action and result  making yourself a person you can consistently trustAs you develop this inner integrity it becomes easier to gauge the integrity of any teaching or teacher you encounter for here too the Buddha recommends vigilance testing things through action and resultGauge teachings by the harm they do or dont create when you put them into practiceGauge teachers not by their special powers divine authority or enlightened transmission but by the harm they do or dont do through their actionsThis pattern of heedful scrutiny applies not only to blatant actions but also to the most subtle workings of the mind your response to sensory stimuli your deepest meditative and nonmeditative experiencesWhatever youre doing  and especially when you dont seem to be doing anything at all  dont be complacentLook carefully again and again for even the slightest stress or disturbance you might be causing inadvertently and learn how to drop whatever youre doing thats causing itKeep at this until theres nothing more to be droppedIn this way your sense of appamada helps to ensure that your path goes all the way to the DeathlessTo borrow an old analogy if the practice is like a building then appamada is not only the foundationIt also acts as the walls and the roof as wellSixteen brahman ascetics  students of a teacher named Bavari  approach the Buddha with questions on the goal of his teaching and how to attain itFrom their questions it is obvious that some of them at least are quite advanced in their meditation practiceTradition tells us that the first fifteen of the ascetics attained arahantship immediately after the Buddha answered their questionsAs for the sixteenth  Pingiya  the Cula Niddesa tells us that after his questions were answered he attained the Dhamma Eye a term that usually means streamentryThe commentary to the Cula Niddesa however interprets it as meaning that he became a nonreturnerA recurrent image in these dialogues is of life as a raging flood  a flood of birth aging and death sorrow and lamentation stress and sufferingThe purpose of spiritual practice is to find a way across the flood to the safety of the far shoreThis image explains the frequent reference to finding a way past entanglements  the flotsam and jetsam swept along by the flood that may prevent ones progress and to the desire to be without acquisitions  the unnecessary baggage that could well cause one to sink midstreamThere is evidence that these sixteen dialogues were highly regarded right from the very early centuries of the Buddhist traditionAs concise statements of profound teachings particular to Buddhism they sparked an attitude of devotion coupled with the desire to understand their more cryptic passagesMost of the Cula Niddesa a late addition to the Pali canon is devoted to explaining them in detailFive discourses  one in the Samyutta Nikaya four in the Anguttara  discuss specific verses in the set and a sixth discourse tells of a lay woman who made a practice of rising before dawn to chant the full set of sixteen dialoguesThe notes to this translation include material drawn from the Cula Niddesa together with extensive quotations from the five discourses mentioned aboveThe Buddha wasnt the sort of teacher who simply answered questionsHe also taught which questions to askHe understood the power of questions that they give shape to the holes in your knowledge and force that shape  valid or not  onto the answers you hope will fill up those holesEven if you use right information to answer a wrong question it can take on the wrong shapeIf you then use that answer as a tool youre sure to apply it to the wrong situations and end up with the wrong resultsThats why the Buddha was careful to map out a science of questions showing which questions  in what order  lead to freedom and which ones dontAt the same time he gave his talks in a questionandanswer format to make perfectly clear the shape of the questions he was answeringSo if youre looking to his teaching for answers and want to get the most out of them you should first be clear about what questions youre bringing to it and check to see if theyre in line with the questions the teachings were meant to addressThat way your answers wont lead you astrayA case in point is the teaching on notselfMany students interpret this as the Buddhas answer to two of the most frequentlyasked questions in the history of serious thought Who am I and Do I have a true self In the light of these questions the teaching seems to be a noself teaching saying either an unqualified No There is no self or a qualified No no separate selfBut the one time the Buddha was asked pointblank if there is a self he refused to answer on the grounds that either a Yes or a No to the question would lead to extreme forms of wrong view that block the path to awakeningA Yes or a qualified No would lead to attachment youd keep clinging to a sense of self however you defined itAn unqualified No would lead to bewilderment and alienation for youd feel that your innermost sense of intrinsic worth had been deniedAs for the question Who am I the Buddha included it in a list of deadend questions that lead to a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion a writhing a fetter of viewsBound by a fetter of views dont gain freedom from birth aging and death from sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair In other words any attempt to answer either of these questions is unskillful karma blocking the path to true freedomSo if the notself teaching isnt meant to answer these questions what question does it answerA basic one What is skillful In fact all of the Buddhas teachings are direct or indirect answers to this questionHis great insight was that all our knowledge and ignorance all our pleasure and pain come from our actions our karma so the quest for true knowledge and true happiness comes down to a question of skillIn this case the precise question is Is selfidentification skillful And the answer is Only up to a point In the areas where you need a healthy sense of self to act skillfully its wise to maintain that sense of selfBut eventually as skillful behavior becomes second nature and you develop more sensitivity you see that selfidentification even of the most refined sort is harmful and stressfulYou have to let it goSo as with any skill there are definite steps along the road to masteryAnd because the asking of a question is a type of karma the questions you ask not only have to start with the issue of skill they also have to be skillful  to approach the issue skillfully  themselvesEach step in the Buddhas skill is thus defined by a set of questions that focus your attention and shape your thinking in the most strategic directionIn fact the questions he recommends can be taken as a map to the practice you start out with questions that assume a self and use that assumption to motivate yourself to act more and more skillfullyOnly when you reach an appropriate level of skill do the questions turn to deconstruct your sense of self pinpointing the things you identify as your self and showing that theyre not really youWhen the act of selfidentification runs out of options it stops in midair  and the mind opens to freedomSo if you put the notself teaching in its proper context  this regimen of questions  youll see that its not a deadend answer to a deadend questionInstead its a cuttingedge tool for bringing about liberationTo begin this regimen the Buddha recommends that when you visit a teacher the first questions to ask are these What is skillfulWhat is unskillfulWhat if I do it will be for my longterm harm and sufferingOr what if I do it will be for my longterm wellbeing and happiness Although these last two questions bring in the concepts of I and my they arent the focus of the inquiryThe focus is on doing on developing skill on using your concern for me and my wellbeing to train your actions toward true happinessThe Buddhas answers to these preliminary questions read like a course in wilderness survivalFirst come the dos and dontsA wilderness instructor will tell you If a moose charges you runIf a bear charges you dont The Buddhas corresponding dos and donts are ten guidelines dealing with body speech and mindThe guidelines for the body are dont kill dont steal dont engage in illicit sexFor speech dont tell lies dont speak divisively dont speak abusively dont engage in idle chatterAnd for the mind abandon greed abandon ill will cultivate right viewsThese are the Buddhas basic ground rules for the survival of your happiness and many of his teachings simply elaborate on these ten pointsBut as any wilderness instructor will tell you survival requires more than simple rules of thumbYou have to be alert to the gaps not covered by the rulesYou need to learn to use your powers of observation imagination and ingenuity to dig out unskillful habits and develop new habits to fill in the gapsThat way you can live comfortably in the wilderness respectful of the bears and moose and other dangers around you without being overwhelmed by themThe same holds true with the Buddhas skill in addition to following the dos and donts you have to learn how to dig out the roots of unskillful behavior so that you can become adept in all areas of your life including the areas where the dos and donts dont applyThe roots of unskillful behavior are three greed anger and delusionOf the three delusion is the most insidious for it blinds you to its very existenceThe only way to overcome it is to be relentlessly observant looking at your actions in terms of cause and effect gauging their short and longterm consequences for yourself and othersAgain this involves learning to ask the right questionsEach time youre about to act ask yourself This action that I want to do would it lead to selfharm to the harm of others or to bothIs it an unskillful action with painful consequences painful results If you foresee harm dont follow through with itIf not go ahead and actWhile acting ask yourself if there are any unexpected bad consequences arisingIf there are stopIf there arent continue with what youre doingWhen the action is done look into its actual short and longterm consequencesIf an action in word or deed has ended up causing harm inform an experienced fellowpractitioner on the path and listen to that persons adviceIf the mistaken action was purely an act of the mind try to develop distaste for that kind of thinkingIn both cases resolve never to make the same mistake again and use your ingenuity to make the resolve stickIf however the longterm consequences of the original action were harmless take joy and satisfaction in being on the right path and continue your trainingAs you stay with this line of questioning it fosters two major resultsTo begin with you become more sensitive to your actions and respectful of their effects both in the present and over timeUnlike the child who says It was already broken when I stepped on it youre aware of when you break things  physical or mental  and when you dontAt the same time you gain mastery over the patterns of action and effectYou get better and better at handling things without their getting brokenThis in turn fosters a healthy sense of self and I based on competence and skillYour sense of self becomes goodhumored enough to freely admit mistakes mature enough to learn from them quick enough to notice the immediate effects of your actions while patient enough to strive for longterm goalsConfident in its own powers of observation this I also has the humility needed to learn from the experience and advice of othersThese two results  sensitivity to the effects of your own actions and a competent sense of self  enable you to settle into a level of mental concentration thats solid and nourishingYou overcome the hindrance of uncertainty as to whats skillful and unskillful and are able to develop the skillful qualities needed to center the mindAs this centered focus develops an interesting thing happens your sensitivity to actions and your sense of self come face to faceYou begin to see that self not as a thing but as an activity a process of Imaking and mymaking in which you repeatedly create and recreate your sense of who you areYou also begin to notice that this Imaking even when it produces the most skillful self possible inevitably results in stressWhyBecause any sense of I or mine involves clinging  even when your concentration tunes into a sense of universal self  and all clinging is stressfulSo to take the development of skillfulness to its ultimate degree you have to unlearn the habit of Imaking and mymakingAnd to do this another set of questions is requiredThese are the questions that introduce the strategy of notselfThe Buddha recommends that you focus on any phenomenon around which you might sense an I or a mine and ask a series of questions starting with Is this constant or inconstant If you identify with your body look at itYoull see that it grows hungry and thirsty that its aging destined to grow ill and dieAnd is anything inconstant easeful or stressful Look at any attempt to find a stable happiness based on the body and youll see how stressful it isAnd is it fitting to regard whats inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I amPursue this line of inquiry inward through layer after layer of physical and mental events until you can zero in on the high command the self thats managing not only the stability of your concentration but also your internal dialogue of questions and answersFortified with the sense of stability and calm that come with strong concentration you can start deconstructing that self with no anxiety over what will happen when its goneAnd when the intentions making up that self are deconstructed a strange thing happensIts as if you had pulled out a strategic thread holding a tapestry together and now the whole thing unravels on its ownEverything that could possibly be clung to falls awayWhat remains is total absolute freedom  free from time and space from both self and notself for both self and notself are perceptions which that freedom transcendsEven when youve had only a first humbling taste of this freedom you appreciate how adroitly the teaching on notself answers the question of What is skillful And you understand why the Buddha recommends putting the question of Who am I asideTo begin with it wouldnt have taken you to this freedom and could well have stood in freedoms wayBecause your I is an activity any attempt to pin it down before you had mastered the processes of activity would have left you pouncing on shadows distracted from the real work at handAny attempt to deconstruct your I before it had become healthy and mature would have led to a release neurotic and insecure youd simply be running away from the messy mismanaged parts of your lifeIn addition any answer to the question Who am I would be totally inappropriate to describe your newfound freedom for its a dimension apart where the concepts of I notI am am not do not applyThe only question still concerning you is how to dig out the remaining roots of unskillfulness still latent in the mindOnce theyre dug up the Buddha promises nothing stands in the way to full and final freedomAnd in that freedom the mind lacks nothing has nothing in excessTheres none of the delusion that would shape the hole of a burning question and none of the greed or aversion that would give it teethThe only remaining questions are bonus ones how best to take whatever skills youve developed along the way and use them purely for the benefit of the worldAnd what more could you possibly askAll phenomena the Buddha once said are rooted in desireEverything we think say or do  every experience  comes from desireEven we come from desireWe were reborn into this life because of our desire to beConsciously or not our desires keep redefining our sense of who we areDesire is how we take our place in the causal matrix of space and timeThe only thing not rooted in desire is nirvana for its the end of all phenomena and lies even beyond the Buddhas use of the word all But the path that takes you to nirvana is rooted in desire  in skillful desiresThe path to liberation pushes the limits of skillful desires to see how far they can goThe notion of a skillful desire may sound strange but a mature mind intuitively pursues the desires it sees as skillful and drops those it perceives as notBasic in everyone is the desire for happinessEvery other desire is a strategy for attaining that happinessYou want an iPod a sexual partner or an experience of inner peace because you think it will make you happyBecause these secondary desires are strategies they follow a patternThey spring from an inchoate feeling of lack and limitation they employ your powers of perception to identify the cause of the limitation and they use your powers of creative imagination to conceive a solution to itBut despite their common pattern desires are not monolithicEach offers a different perception of whats lacking in life together with a different picture of what the solution should beA desire for a sandwich comes from a perception of physical hunger and proposes to solve it with a SwissonryeA desire to climb a mountain focuses on a different set of hungers  for accomplishment exhilaration selfmastery  and appeals to a different image of satisfactionWhatever the desire if the solution actually leads to happiness the desire is skillfulIf it doesnt its notHowever what seems to be a skillful desire may lead only to a false or transitory happiness not worth the effort entailedSo wisdom starts as a metadesire to learn how to recognize skillful and unskillful desires for what they actually areUnskillful desires can create suffering in a variety of waysSometimes they aim at the impossible not to grow old or dieSometimes they focus on possibilities that require distasteful means  such as lying or cheating to get ahead in your jobOr the goal when you get it may not really keep you happyEven the summit of Everest can be a disappointmentEven when its not you cant stay there foreverWhen you leave youre left with nothing but memories which can shift and fadeIf you did mean or hurtful things to get there their memory can burn away any pleasure that memories of the summit might holdIn addition desires often pull in opposite directionsYour desire for sex for instance can get in the way of your desire for peaceIn fact conflict among desires is what alerts us to how painful desire can beIts also what has taught each desire how to speak to persuade to argue or bully its way into powerAnd just because a desire is skillful doesnt mean its more skillful at arguing its case than the unskillful ones for those can often be the most intransigent the most strident the slickest in having their wayThis means that wisdom has to learn how to strategize too to strengthen skillful desires so that less skillful desires will listen to themThat way desires can be trained to work together toward greater happinessThis is how a mature and healthy mind works conducting a dialogue not so much between reason and desire as between responsible desires and irresponsible onesBut even in a mature mind the dialogue often yields compromises that dont really go to the heart snatches of sensual pleasure glimpses of spiritual peace nothing really satisfying and wholeSome people growing impatient with compromise turn a deaf ear to prudent desires and tune into demands for instant gratification  all the sex power and money they can grabBut when the rampage of gratification wears itself out the damage can take lifetimes to set rightOther people try their best to accept the compromise among desires trying to find a measure of peace in not reaching for what they see as impossibleBut this peace too depends on a deaf inner ear denying the underlying truth of all desires that a life of endless limitations is intolerableBoth sorts of people share a common assumption that true unlimited happiness lies beyond reachTheir imaginations are so stunted that they cant even conceive of what a true unlimited happiness in this lifetime would beWhat made the Buddha special was that he never lowered his expectationsHe imagined the ultimate happiness  one so free from limit and lack that it would leave no need for further desire  and then treasured his desire for that happiness as his highest priorityBringing all his other desires into dialogue with it he explored various strategies until finding one that actually attained that unlimited goalThis strategy became his most basic teaching the four noble truthsMost of us when looking at the four noble truths dont realize that theyre all about desireWere taught that the Buddha gave only one role to desire  as the cause of sufferingBecause he says to abandon the cause of suffering it sounds like hes denying any positive role to desire and its constructive companions creativity imagination and hopeThis perception though misses two important pointsThe first is that all four truths speak to the basic dynamic of desire on its own terms perception of lack and limitation the imagination of a solution and a strategy for attaining itThe first truth teaches the basic lack and limitation in our lives  the clinging that constitutes suffering  while the second truth points to the types of desires that lead to clinging desires for sensuality becoming and annihilationThe third truth expands our imagination to encompass the possibility that clinging can be totally overcomeThe fourth truth the path to the end of suffering shows how to strategize so as to overcome clinging by abandoning its causeThe second point thats often missed is that the noble truths give two roles to desire depending on whether its skillful or notUnskillful desire is the cause of suffering skillful desire forms part of the path to its cessationSkillful desire undercuts unskillful desire not by repressing it but by producing greater and greater levels of satisfaction and wellbeing so that unskillful desire has no place to standThis strategy of skillful desire is explicit in the path factor of right effortWhat is right effortThere is the case where a monk generates desire endeavors arouses persistence upholds and exerts his intent for the sake of the nonarising of evil unskillful mental qualities that have not yet arisen for the sake of the abandoning of evil unskillful qualities that have arisen for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the maintenance nonconfusion increase plenitude development and culmination of skillful qualities that have arisenThis is called right effortAs this formula shows the crucial elements for replacing unskillful mental qualities with skillful ones are desire persistence and intentDesire gives the initial impetus and focus for right effort while persistence provides staying powerIntent is the most complex factor of the threeThe Pali word here citta also means mind and in this context it means giving your whole mind to the work at hand all your powers of sensitivity intelligence discernment and ingenuityYou dont want your mind to be split on this issue you want all of its powers working together on the same sideThese three qualities  desire persistence and intent  underlie every attempt to master a skillSo its useful in undertaking the path to reflect on how youve used these qualities to master skills in the pastThe Buddha made this point in his many similes comparing the person on the path to a master craftsman  a musician carpenter surgeon acrobat cookAs with any skill there are many steps to developing the path but four stand outThe first is to use your ingenuity to fight off the chorus of inner voices trying to dissuade you from making the effort to be skillful in the first placeThese voices are like devious lawyers representing strongly entrenched interests all your threatened unskillful desiresYou have to be quick and alert in countering their arguments for they can come from all sides sounding honest and wise even though theyre notHere are some of the arguments these voices may propose along with a few effective responsesTrying to manipulate your desires like this is unnaturalActually youre already manipulating your desires all the time when you choose one desire over another so you might as well learn to do it skillfullyAnd there are plenty of people out there only too happy to manipulate your desires for you  think of all the advertisements clamoring for your attention  so its better to put the manipulation in more trustworthy hands your ownTrying to change your desires is an attack on your very selfThis argument works only if you give your sense of self  which is really just a grab bag of desires  more solidity than it deservesYou can turn the argument on its head by noting that since your self is a perpetually changing lineup of strategies for happiness you might as well try changing it in a direction more likely to achieve true happinessTo think of skillful and unskillful desires is dualistic and judgmentalYou dont want nondualistic mechanics working on your car or nondualistic surgeons operating on your brainYou want people who can tell whats skillful from whats notIf you really value your happiness youll demand the same discernment in the person most responsible for it yourselfIts too goalorientedJust accept things as they are in the presentEvery desire tells you that things in the present are limited and lackingYou either accept the desire or accept the lackTo accept both at once is to deny that either has any real truthTo try to dwell peacefully in the tension between the two  in a path of no craving to be rid of either  is what the Buddha called limited equanimity and what one Thai forest master called the equanimity of a cowIts a futile attempt to resist such a divine and mysterious powerDesire seems overwhelming and mysterious simply because we dont know our mindsAnd where would we be if we kept slapping the term divine or cosmic on forces we didnt understandArguing with unskillful desires is too much workConsider the alternative an endless wandering from one set of limitations to another continually seeking happiness and yet finding it always slipping from your grasp repeatedly taking a stance for one desire one moment and shifting to another desire the nextRight effort at least gives you one steady place to standIts not adding a more demanding desire to the chaotic mix its offering a way to sort out the messAnd the Buddhas path holds open the hope of an unlimited happiness preceded by increasingly refined and reliable levels of happiness all along the pathIn short his alternative is actually the one thats more enjoyable and involves less workOnce youve silenced these voices the next step is to take responsibility for your actions and their consequencesThis requires being willing to learn from your mistakesSeveral years ago a sociologist studied students in a neurosurgery program to see what qualities separated those who succeeded from those who failedHe found ultimately that two questions in his interviews pointed to the crucial differenceHe would ask the students Do you ever make mistakesIf so what is the worst mistake youve ever made Those who failed the program would inevitably answer that they rarely made mistakes or else would blame their mistakes on factors beyond their controlThose who succeeded in the program not only admitted to many mistakes but also volunteered information on what they would do not to repeat those mistakes in the futureThe Buddha encouraged this same mature attitude in his first instructions to his son RahulaHe told Rahula to focus on his intentions before acting and on the results of his actions both while he was doing them and after they were doneIf Rahula saw that his intentions would lead to harm for himself or others he shouldnt act on themIf he saw that his thoughts words or deeds actually produced harm he should stop them and resolve never to repeat them without at the same time falling into remorseIf on the other hand he saw no harmful consequences from his actions he should take joy in his progress on the path and use that joy to nourish his continued practiceAlthough the Buddha aimed these instructions at a sevenyearold child the pattern they outline informs every level of the practiceThe whole path to awakening consists of sticking to the desire always to do the most skillful thing it develops as your sense of skillful gets more refinedIf you act on an unskillful desire take responsibility for the consequences using them to educate that desire as to where it went wrongAlthough desires can be remarkably stubborn they share a common goal  happiness  and this can form the common ground for an effective dialogue If a desire doesnt really produce happiness it contradicts its reason for beingThe best way to make this point is to keep tracing the thread from the desire to its resulting actions and from the actions to their consequencesIf the desire aimed at a happiness that caused suffering to others notice how their corresponding desire for happiness leads them to undermine the happiness you soughtIf the desire aimed at a happiness based on things that can age grow ill die or leave you notice how that fact sets you up for a fallThen notice how the distress that comes from acting on this sort of desire is universalIts not just youEveryone who has acted is acting or will act on that desire has suffered in the past is suffering right now and will suffer in the futureTheres no way around itReflecting this way helps to weaken the why me tendency that aggravates suffering and makes you cling fiercely to the desire causing itIt also helps develop two important attitudes that strengthen skillful desires a sense of dismay over the universality of suffering and an attitude of heedfulness to avoid being duped by that particular type of desire againUnskillful desires dont really give way though until you can show that other less troublesome desires actually can produce greater happinessThis is why the Buddha emphasizes learning how to appreciate the rewards of a virtuous generous life the joy in fostering the happiness of others the solid dignity and selfworth in doing the hard but the right thingIts also why his path centers on states of blissful refreshing concentrationAccessing this refreshment in your meditation gives you immediate visceral proof that the Buddha was no killjoyThe desires he recommends really do produce a happiness that can give you the strength to keep on choosing the skillful pathThats the next step patiently and persistently sticking with the desire to do the skillful thing in all situationsThis isnt a matter of sheer effortAs any good sports coach will tell you hours of practice dont necessarily guarantee resultsYou have to combine your persistence with intent sensitivity discernment ingenuityKeep an eye out for how to do things more efficientlyTry to see patterns in what you doAt the same time introduce play and variety into your practice so that the plateaus dont get boring and the downs dont get you downThe Buddha makes similar points in his meditation instructionsOnce youve mastered a state of concentration see where it still contains elements of stressThen look for patterns to that stress what are you doing to cause itFind ways to gladden the mind when its down to liberate it from its confinements to steady it when it gets restlessIn this way as you learn to enjoy rising to the challenges of meditation you also gain familiarity with subtle patterns of cause and effect in the mindThe fourth step once youve mastered those patterns is to push their limitsAgain this isnt simply a matter of increased effortIts more a rekindling of your imagination to explore the unexpected sidealleys of cause and effectA famous cellist once said that his most exhilarating concert was one in which he broke a string on his cello and decided to finish the piece he was playing on the remaining strings refingering it on the spotThe most obvious strings in meditation are the specific techniques for fostering stillness and insight but the more interesting ones are the assumptions that underlie the quest for skill lack strategy dialogue your sense of selfCan you learn to do without themThere comes a point in your meditation when the only way for greater happiness is to begin questioning these assumptionsAnd this leads to some intriguing paradoxes If desire springs from a sense of lack or limitation what happens to desire when it produces a happiness with no lack or limitation at allWhats it like not to need desireWhat would happen to your inner dialogue your sense of selfAnd if desire is how you take your place in space and time what happens to space and time when desire is absentThe Buddha encouraged these queries by describing the awakened person as so undefined and unlimited that he or she couldnt be located in the present life or be described after this life as existing not existing neither or bothThis may sound like an abstract and unreachable goal but the Buddha demonstrated its human face in the example of his personHaving pushed past the limits of cause and effect he was still able to function admirably within them in this life happy in even the most difficult circumstances compassionately teaching people of every sortAnd theres his testimony that not only monks and nuns but also lay people  even children  had developed their skillful desires to the point where they gained a taste of awakening as wellSo imagine thatAnd listen to any desire that would take you in that direction for thats your path to true happinessWhen the Buddha told Ananda that the entirety of the practice lies in having an admirable friend he wasnt saying something warm and reassuring about the compassion of othersHe was pointing out three uncomfortable truths  about delusion and trust  that call for clear powers of judgmentThe first truth is that you cant really trust yourself to see through your delusion on your ownWhen youre deluded you dont know youre deludedYou need some trustworthy outside help to point it out to youThis is why when the Buddha advised the Kalamas to know for themselves one of the things he told them to know for themselves was how wise people would judge their behaviorWhen he advised his son Rahula to examine his own actions as he would his face in a mirror he said that if Rahula saw that his actions had caused any harm he should talk it over with a knowledgeable friend on the pathThat way he could learn how to be open with others  and himself  about his mistakes and at the same time tap into the knowledge that his friend had gainedHe wouldnt have to keep reinventing the dharma wheel on his ownSo if you really want to become skillful in your thoughts words and deeds you need a trustworthy friend or teacher to point out your blind spotsAnd because those spots are blindest around your unskillful habits the primary duty of a trustworthy friend is to point out your faults  for only when you see your faults can you correct them only when you correct them are you benefiting from your friends compassion in pointing them outIn passing judgment on your faults an admirable friend is like a trainerOnce when a horse trainer came to see the Buddha the Buddha asked him how he trained his horsesThe trainer said that some horses responded to gentle training others to harsh training others required both harsh and gentle training but if a horse didnt respond to either type of training hed kill the horse to maintain the reputation of his teachers lineageThen the trainer asked the Buddha how he trained his students and the Buddha replied In the same way Some students responded to gentle criticism others to harsh criticism others to a mixture of the two but if a student didnt respond to either type of criticism hed kill the studentThis shocked the horse trainer but then the Buddha explained what he meant by killing He wouldnt train the student any further which essentially killed the students opportunity to grow in the practiceSo the first prerequisite in maintaining an admirable friend is being willing to take criticism both gentle and harshThis is why the Buddha told his disciples not to teach for money for the person paying is the one who determines whats taught and people rarely pay for the criticism they need to hearBut even if the teacher is teaching for free you run into the Buddhas second uncomfortable truth You cant open your heart to just anyoneOur powers of judgment really do have power and because that power can cause longterm help or harm you have to take care in choosing your friendDont fall into the easy trap of being judgmental or nonjudgmental  judgmental in trusting your kneejerk likes or dislikes nonjudgmental in trusting that every dharma teacher would be equally beneficial as a guideInstead be judicious in choosing the person whose judgments youre going to take on as your ownThis of course sounds like a Catch You need a good teacher to help develop your powers of judgment but welldeveloped powers of judgment to recognize who a good teacher might beAnd even though theres no foolproof way out of the catch  after all you can master a foolproof way and still be a fool  there is a way if youre willing to learn from experienceAnd fortunately the Buddha advised on how to develop your powers of judgment so that you know what to look for along the wayIn fact his recommendations for how to choose an admirable friend are a preliminary exercise in discernment learning how to develop judicious powers of judgment so that you too can become an admirable friend first to yourself and then to the people around youThe first step in being judicious is understanding what it means to judge in a helpful wayThink not of a Supreme Court justice sitting on her bench passing a final verdict of guilt or innocence but of a piano teacher listening to you playShes not passing a final verdict on your potential as a pianistInstead shes judging a work in progress listening to your intention for the performance listening to your execution of that intention and then deciding whether it worksIf it doesnt she has to figure out if the problem is with the intention or the execution make helpful suggestions and then let you try againShe keeps this up until shes satisfied with your performanceThe important principle is that she never directs her judgments at you as a personInstead she has to stay focused on your actions to keep looking for better ways to raise them to higher and higher standardsAt the same time youre learning from her how to judge your own playing thinking more carefully about your intention listening more carefully to your execution developing higher standards for what works and learning to think outside of the box for ways to improveMost important of all youre learning to focus your judgment on your performance and not on yourselfThis way  when theres less you invested in your habits  youre more willing to recognize unskillful habits and to drop them in favor of more skillful onesOf course when you and your teacher are judging your improvement on a particular piece its part of a longer process of judging how well the relationship is workingShe has to judge over time if youre benefiting from her guidance and so do youBut again neither of you is judging the worth of the other personShes simply deciding  based on your progress  whether its worth her while to continue taking you on as a studentYoure judging the extent to which her recommendations are actually helping you perform more effectivelyIf either of you decides to terminate the relationship it shouldnt be because shes a bad teacher or youre a bad student but simply that shes not the teacher for you or youre not the student for herIn the same way when youre evaluating a potential dharma teacher remember that theres no Final Judgment in BuddhismYou want someone who will evaluate your actions as a work in progress and you have to apply the same standard to him or herAnd youre not trying to take on the superhuman role of evaluating that persons essential worthYoure simply judging whether his or her actions embody the kinds of skills youd like to develop and the types of mental qualities  which are also a kind of action  that youd trust in a trainer or guideAfter all the only way we know anything about other people is through their actions so thats as far as our judgments can fairly extendAt the same time though because were judging whether we want to internalize another persons standards its not unfair to pass judgment on what theyre doingIts for our own protectionAnd its for the sake of our protection that the Buddha recommended looking for two qualities in a teacher wisdom and integrityTo gauge these qualities though takes time and sensitivity which is why the Buddha also advised that you be willing to spend time with the person and try to be really observant of how that person actsOnce when King Pasenadi came to see the Buddha a group of naked ascetics passed nearbyThe king went over got down on one knee and offered them homageThen he returned to the Buddha and asked Are those ascetics worthy of homage The Buddha replied that you could fairly answer that question only after having spent time with them and only if you were really observantThe king praised the Buddhas caution and added Those men are actually my spiesTheyre on the way back from having scouted out the enemy and soon  after bathing and clothing themselves  theyll be back enjoying themselves with their wives So you cant judge people just by first impressionsThe appearance of wisdom is easy to fakeIn the past people were impressed by extreme austerities at present the ads for dharma books and retreats show that were attracted to other surface criteria but the principle is the sameTo save time and needless pain in the search however the Buddha noted four early warning signs indicating that potential teachers dont have the wisdom or integrity to merit your trustThe warning signs for untrustworthy wisdom are twoThe first is when people show no gratitude for the help theyve received  and this applies especially to help from their parents and teachersPeople with no gratitude dont appreciate goodness dont value the effort that goes into being helpful and so will probably not put out that effort themselvesThe second warning sign is that they dont hold to the principle of karmaThey either deny that we have freedom of choice or else teach that one person can clear away another persons bad karma from the pastPeople of this sort are unlikely to put forth the effort to be genuinely skillful and so are untrustworthy guidesLack of integrity also has two warning signsThe first is when people feel no shame in telling a deliberate lieAs the Buddha once said Theres no evil that such a person might not do The second warning sign is when they dont conduct arguments in a fair and aboveboard manner misrepresenting their opponents pouncing on the other sides minor lapses not acknowledging the valid points the other side has madePeople of this sort the Buddha said arent even worth talking to much less taking on as teachersAs for people who dont display these early warning signs the Buddha gave advice on how to gauge wisdom and integrity in their actions over timeOne question hed have you ask yourself is whether a teachers actions betray any of the greed anger or delusion that would inspire him to claim knowledge of something he didnt know or to tell another person to do something that was not in that persons best interestsTo test for a teachers wisdom the Buddha advised noticing how a potential teacher responds to questions about whats skillful and not and how well he or she handles adversityTo test for integrity you look for virtue in daytoday activities and purity in the teachers dealings with othersDoes this person make excuses for breaking the precepts bringing them down to his level of behavior rather than lifting his behavior to theirsDoes he take unfair advantage of other peopleIf so youd better find another teacherThis however is where the Buddhas third uncomfortable truth comes in You cant be a fair judge of another persons integrity until youve developed some of your ownThis is probably the most uncomfortable truth of all for it requires that you accept responsibility for your judgmentsIf you want to test other peoples potential for good guidance you have to pass a few tests yourselfAgain its like listening to a pianistThe better you are as a pianist the better your ability to judge the other persons playingFortunately the Buddha also gave guidance on how to develop integrity and it doesnt require that you start out innately goodAll it requires is a measure of truthfulness and maturity the realization that your actions make all the difference in your life so you have to take care in how you act the willingness to admit your mistakes both to yourself and to others and the willingness to learn from your mistakes so you dont keep repeating themAs the Buddha taught Rahula before you act in thought word or deed look at the results you expect from your actionIf its going to harm you or anyone else dont do itIf you dont foresee any harm go ahead and actWhile youre acting check to see if youre causing any unforeseen harmIf you are stopIf not continue until youre doneAfter youre done look at the longterm results of your actionIf it caused any harm talk it over with someone else on the path develop a sense of shame around the mistake and resolve not to repeat itIf it caused no harm take joy in the fact and keep on trainingAs you train yourself in this way you learn four important principles about exercising judgment in a healthy wayFirst youre judging your actions not yourselfIf you can learn to separate your sense of self from your actions you tend to be more willing to admit your mistakes to yourself and less defensive when other people point them out to youThis principle also applies to the sense of shame the Buddha recommends you feel toward your mistakesIts directed not at you but at the action  the sort of shame felt by a person of high selfesteem whos realized shes done something beneath her and doesnt want to do it againShame of this sort is not debilitatingIt simply helps you remember the lesson youve learnedThis relates to the second important principle about healthy judgment that it requires mindfulness in the original meaning of the term keeping something in mindMindfulness of this sort is essential in developing your judgment for it helps you remember the lessons youve learned over time as to what works and what doesntBecause we often try our best to forget our mistakes we have to train our mindfulness repeatedly to remember the lessons we learned from those mistakes so that we dont have to keep learning them over and over againSometimes you hear mindfulness defined as a nonjudging state of mind but thats not how the Buddha understood itHe often compared mindfulness to a gatekeeper in the way it helps you judge what should and shouldnt be doneSo mindfulness actually plays an essential role in developing your powers of judgmentAs you keep trying to apply the lessons youve learned you discover the third principle about healthy judgment that the lessons you learn from your mistakes if you act on them really do make a differenceThe present moment is not so arbitrarily new that lessons from yesterday are useless todayYou may keep finding new subtleties in how to apply past lessons but the general outlines of how suffering is caused and how it can be ended always remain the sameThe fourth principle is that you learn how to benefit from the judgments of othersWhen youve chosen a person to confide in you want to be open to that persons criticisms but you also want to put his or her suggestions for improvement to the testAs the Buddha told his aunt Gotami you can test genuine dharma by seeing the results it gives when put it into actionIf it leads to such admirable qualities as being dispassionate modest content energetic and unburdensome its the genuine thingThe person who teaches you this dharma has passed at least that test for being a genuine friendAnd youre learning more and more how to judge for yourselfSome people might object that its selfish to focus on finding friends you can benefit from and inhumane to keep testing people to see if they fit the billBut thats missing the pointThe benefits that come from this sort of friendship dont end with you and in testing your friend youre also testing yourselfAs you assimilate the qualities of an admirable friend you become the sort of person who can offer admirable friendship to othersAgain its like practicing under a good piano teacherAs you improve as a pianist youre not the only one who can enjoy your playingThe better you get the more joy you bring to othersThe better you understand the process of playing the more effectively you can teach anyone who sincerely wants to learn from youThis is how teaching lineages of high caliber get established for the benefit of the worldSo when you look for an admirable friend youre tapping into a long lineage of admirable friends stretching back to the Buddha and helping it to extend into the futureJoining this lineage may require accepting some uncomfortable truths such as the need to learn from criticism and to take responsibility for your actionsBut if youre up for the challenge you learn to take this human power of judgment  which when untrained can so easily cause harm  and train it for the greater goodMany people tell us that the Buddha taught two different types of meditation  mindfulness meditation and concentration meditationMindfulness meditation they say is the direct path while concentration practice is the scenic route that you take at your own risk because its very easy to get caught there and you may never get outBut when you actually look at what the Buddha taught he never separates these two practicesThey are both parts of a single wholeEvery time he explains mindfulness and its place in the path he makes it clear that the purpose of mindfulness practice is to lead the mind into a state of Right Concentration  to get the mind to settle down and to find a place where it can really feel stable at home where it can look at things steadily and see them for what they arePart of the two practices issue centers on how we understand the word jhana which is a synonym for Right ConcentrationMany of us have heard that jhana is a very intense trancelike state that requires intense staring and shutting out the rest of the worldIt sounds nothing like mindfulness at allBut if you look in the Canon where the Buddha describes jhana thats not the kind of state hes talking aboutTo be in jhana is to be absorbed very pleasurably in the sense of the whole body altogetherA very broad sense of awareness fills the entire bodyOne of the images the Buddha used to describe this state is that of a person kneading water into dough so that the water permeates throughout the flourAnother is a lake in which a cool spring comes welling up and suffuses the entire lakeNow when youre with the body as a whole youre very much in the present momentYoure right there all the timeAs the Buddha says the fourth jhana  in which the body is filled with bright awareness  is the point where mindfulness and equanimity become pureSo there should be no problem in combining mindfulness practice with the wholebody awareness that gets very settled and stillIn fact the Buddha himself combines them in his description of the first four steps of breath meditation being aware of long breathing being aware of short breathing being aware of the whole body as you breathe in and breathe out and then calming the sensation of the breath within the bodyThis as the texts tell us is basic mindfulness practiceIts also a basic concentration practiceYoure getting into the first jhana  Right Concentration  right there at the same time that youre practicing Right MindfulnessTo see how Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration help each other in the practice we can look at the three stages of mindfulness practice given in the Foundations of Mindfulness SuttaTake the body as an exampleThe first stage is to keep focused on the body in and of itself putting aside greed and distress with reference to the worldWhat this means is taking the body as a body without thinking about it in terms of what it means or what it can do in the worldIt could be either good or bad lookingIt could be strong or weakIt could be agile or clumsy  all the issues we tend to worry about when we think about ourselvesThe Buddha says to put those issues asideJust be with the body in and of itself sitting right hereYou close your eyes  what do you haveTheres the sensation of bodiness that youre sitting withThats your frame of referenceTry to stay with itKeep bringing the mind back to this sense of the body until it gets the message and begins to settle downIn the beginning of the practice you find the mind going out to grasp this or that so you note it enough to tell it to let go return to the body and hold on thereThen it goes out to grasp something else so you tell it to let go come back and latch onto the body againEventually though you reach a point where you can actually grasp hold of the breath and you dont let go okayYou keep holding onto itFrom that point on whatever else that happens to come into your awareness is like something coming up and brushing the back of your handYou dont have to note itYou stay with the body as your basic frame of referenceOther things come and go youre aware of them but you dont drop the breath and go grasping after themThis is when you really have established the body as a solid frame of referenceAs you do this you develop three qualities of mindOne is mindfulnessThe term mindfulness means being able to remember to keep something in mindIn the case of establishing the body as a frame of reference it means being able to remember where youre supposed to be  with the body  and you dont let yourself forgetThe second quality alertness means being aware of what is actually going on in the presentAre you with the bodyAre you with the breathIs the breath comfortableSimply notice whats actually happening in the present momentWe tend to confuse mindfulness with alertness but actually they are two separate things mindfulness means being able to remember where you want to keep your awareness alertness means being aware of whats actually happeningThe third quality ardency means two thingsOne if you realize that the mind has wandered off you bring it right backImmediatelyYou dont let it wander around sniffing the flowersTwo when the mind is with its proper frame of reference ardency means trying to be as sensitive as possible to whats going on  not just drifting in the present moment but really trying to penetrate more and more into the subtle details of whats actually happening with the breath or the mindWhen you have these three qualities focused on the body in and of itself you cant help but settle down and get really comfortable with the body in the present momentThats when youre ready for the second stage in the practice which is described as being aware of the phenomenon of origination and the phenomenon of passing awayThis is a stage where youre trying to understand cause and effect as they happen in the presentIn terms of concentration practice once youve got the mind to settle down you want to understand the interaction of cause and effect in the process of concentration so that you can get it to settle down more solidly for longer periods of time in all sorts of situations on the cushion and offTo do this you have to learn about how things arise and pass away in the mind not by simply watching them but by actually getting involved in their arising and passing awayYou can see this in the Buddhas instructions for dealing with the hindrancesIn the first stage he says to be aware of the hindrances as they come and goSome people think that this is an exercise in choiceless awareness where you dont try to will the mind in any direction where you simply sit and watch willynilly whatever comes into the mindIn actual practice though the mind isnt yet ready for thatWhat you need at this stage is a fixed point of reference for evaluating the events in the mind just as when youre trying to gauge the motion of clouds through the sky You need to choose a fixed point  like a roof gable or a light pole  at which to stare so that you can get a sense of which direction and how fast the clouds are movingThe same with the coming and going of sensual desire ill will etc in the mind You have to try to maintain a fixed reference point for the mind  like the breath  if you want to be really sensitive to when there are hindrances in the mind  getting in the way of your reference point  and when there are notSuppose that anger is interfering with your concentrationInstead of getting involved in the anger you try simply to be aware of when its there and when its notYou look at the anger as an event in and of itself  as it comes as it goesBut you dont stop thereThe next step  as youre still working at focusing on the breath  is recognizing how anger can be made to go awaySometimes simply watching it is enough to make it go away sometimes its not and you have to deal with it in other ways such as arguing with the reasoning behind the anger or reminding yourself of the drawbacks of angerIn the course of dealing with it you have to get your hands dirtyYouve got to try and figure out why the anger is coming why its going how you can get it out of there because you realize that its an unskillful stateAnd this requires that you improviseExperimentYouve got to chase your ego and impatience out of the way so that you can have the space to make mistakes and learn from them so that you can develop a skill in dealing with the angerIts not just a question of hating the anger and trying to push it away or of loving the anger and welcoming itThese approaches may give results in the short run but in the long run theyre not especially skillfulWhats called for here is the ability to see what the anger is composed of how can you take it apartOne technique I like to use  when anger is present and youre in a situation where you dont immediately have to react to people  is simply to ask yourself in a goodnatured way Okay why are you angry Listen to what the mind has to sayThen pursue the matter But why are you angry at that Of course Im angryAfter all Well why are you angry at that If you keep this up the mind will eventually admit to something stupid like the assumption that people shouldnt be that way  even though they blatantly are that way  or that people should act in line with your standards or whatever the mind is so embarrassed about that it tries to hide from youBut finally if you keep probing itll fess upYou gain a lot of understanding of the anger that way and this can really weaken its power over youIn terms of the positive qualities like mindfulness serenity and concentration its a similar sort of thingFirst youre aware of when theyre there and when theyre not and then you realize that when theyre there its much nicer than when theyre notSo you try to figure out how they come how they goYou do this by consciously trying to maintain that state of mindfulness and concentrationIf youre really observant  and this is what its all about being observant  you begin to see that there are skillful ways of maintaining the state without getting all tied up in failure or success in doing it without letting the desire for a settled state of mind actually get in the way of the minds settling downYou do want to succeed but you need a balanced attitude toward failure and success so that you can learn from themNobodys keeping score or taking gradesYoure here to understand for your own sakeSo this process of developing your foundation of mindfulness or developing your frame of reference is not just watching Its more a participation in the process of arising and passing away  actually playing with the process  so that you can learn from experience how cause and effect work in the mindOnce when I was in college I wrote home complaining about the food and my mother sent me a Julia Child cookbookIn the book was a section on dealing with eggs in which she said that the sign of a really good cook is knowing eggsAnd so I took an egg outYou can watch an egg  you can learn certain things just by watching it but you dont learn very muchTo learn about eggs you have to put them in a pan and try to make something out of themIf you do this long enough you begin to understand that there are variations in eggs and there are certain ways that they react to heat and ways that they react to oil or butter or whateverAnd so by actually working with the egg and trying to make something out of it you really come to understand eggsIts similar with clay you really dont know clay until you become a potter and actually try to make something out of the clayAnd its the same with the mind unless you actually try to make something out of the mind try to get a mental state going and keep it going you dont really know your own mindYou dont know the processes of cause and effect within the mindThere has to be a factor of actual participation in the processThat way you can understand itThis all comes down to being observant and developing a skillThe essence of developing a skill means two thingsOne youre aware of a situation as it is given and two youre aware of what you put into itWhen the Buddha talks about causation he says that every situation is shaped from two directions  the causes coming in from the past and the causes youre putting into the presentYou need to be sensitive to bothIf you arent sensitive to what youre putting into a situation youll never develop any kind of skillAs youre aware of what youre doing you also look at the resultsIf something isnt right you go back and change what youve done  keeping at this until you get the results you wantAnd in the process you learn a great deal from the clay the eggs or whatever youre trying to deal with skillfullyThe same holds true with the mindOf course you could learn something about the mind by trying to get it into any sort of a state but for the purpose of developing really penetrating insight a state of stable balanced mindful concentration is the best kind of souffl or pot you want to make with the mindThe factors of pleasure ease and sometimes even rapture that arise when the mind really settles down help you stay comfortably in the present moment with a low center of gravityOnce the mind is firmly settled there you have something to look at for a long period of time so that you can see what its made up ofIn the typical unbalanced state of the mind things are appearing and disappearing too fast for you to notice them clearlyBut as the Buddha notes when you get really skilled at jhana you can step back a bit and really see what youve gotYou can see say where theres an element of attachment where theres an element of stress or even where theres inconstancy within your balanced stateThis is where you begin to gain insight as you see the natural cleavage lines among the different factors of the mind and in particular the cleavage line between awareness and the objects of awarenessAnother advantage to this mindful concentrated state is that as you feel more and more at home in it you begin to realize that its possible to have happiness and pleasure in life without depending on things outside of yourself  people relationships approval from others or any of the issues that come from being part of the worldThis realization helps pry loose your attachments to things outsideSome people are afraid of getting attached to a state of calm but actually its very important that you get attached here so that you begin to settle down and begin to undo your other attachmentsOnly when this attachment to calm is the only one left do you begin work on loosening it up as wellStill another reason why solid concentration is necessary for insight is that when discernment comes to the mind the basic lesson it will teach you is that youve been stupidYouve held onto things even though deep down inside you should have known betterNow try telling that to people when theyre hungry and tiredTheyll come right back with Youre stupid too and thats the end of the discussionNothing gets accomplishedBut if you talk to someone who has had a full meal and feels rested you can broach all kinds of topics without risking a fightIts the same with the mindWhen it has been well fed with the rapture and ease coming from concentration its ready to learnIt can accept your criticisms without feeling threatened or abusedSoThis is the role that concentration practice plays in this second stage of mindfulness practice It gives you something to play with a skill to develop so you can begin to understand the factors of cause and effect within the mindYou begin to see the mind as just a flux of causes with their effects coming back at youYour ideas are part of this flux of cause and effect your emotions your sense of who you areThis insight begins to loosen your attachments to the whole processWhat finally happens is that the mind reaches a third level of mindfulness practice where the mind comes to a state of perfect equilibrium  where youve developed this state of concentration this state of equilibrium to the point where you dont have to put anything more into itIn the Foundations of Mindfulness Sutta this is described as simply being aware  if you are using the body as your frame of reference being aware that There is a body just enough for knowledge and mindfulness without being attached to anything in the worldOther texts call this the state of nonfashioning The mind reaches the point where you begin to realize that all causal processes in the mind  including the processes of concentration and insight  are like tar babiesIf you like them you get stuck if you dont like them you get stuckSo what are you going to doYou have to get to the point where youre not really contributing anything more to the present momentYou unravel your participation in itThats when things open up in the mindMany people want to jump right in and begin at this level of not adding anything to the present moment but it doesnt work that wayYou cant be sensitive to the subtle things the mind is habitually adding to the present until youve consciously tried to alter what youre addingAs you get more and more skilled you get more sensitive to the subtle things you didnt realize you were doingYou reach a point of disenchantment where you realize that the most skillful way of dealing with the present is to strip away all levels of participation that cause even the slightest bit of stress in the mindYou start dismantling the levels of participation that you learned in the second stage of the practice to the point where things reach equilibrium on their own where theres letting go and releaseSo its important to realize that there are these three stages to mindfulness practice and to understand the role that deliberate concentration practice plays in taking you through the first twoWithout aiming at Right Concentration you cant develop the skills needed for understanding the mind  for its in the process of mastering the skill of mindful concentration that true insight arisesJust as you dont really understand a herd of cattle until youve successfully herded them  learning from all your failures along the way  you cant get a sense of all the causeandeffect currents running through the mind until youve learned from your failures and successes in getting them to gather in a state of concentrated mindfulness and mindful concentrationAnd only when youve really understood and mastered these currents  the currents of craving that cause suffering and stress and the currents of mindfulness and concentration that form the Path  can you let them go and find freedom from themWe all know what happens when a fire goes outThe flames die down and the fire is gone for goodSo when we first learn that the name for the goal of Buddhist practice nibbana literally means the extinguishing of a fire its hard to imagine a deadlier image for a spiritual goal utter annihilationIt turns out though that this reading of the concept is a mistake in translation not so much of a word as of an imageWhat did an extinguished fire represent to the Indians of the Buddhas dayAnything but annihilationAccording to the ancient Brahmans when a fire was extinguished it went into a state of latencyRather than ceasing to exist it became dormant and in that state  unbound from any particular fuel  it became diffused throughout the cosmosWhen the Buddha used the image to explain nibbana to the Indian Brahmans of his day he bypassed the question of whether an extinguished fire continues to exist or not and focused instead on the impossibility of defining a fire that doesnt burn thus his statement that the person who has gone totally out cant be describedHowever when teaching his own disciples the Buddha used nibbana more as an image of freedomApparently all Indians at the time saw burning fire as agitated dependent and trapped both clinging and being stuck to its fuel as it burnedTo ignite a fire one had to seize itWhen fire let go of its fuel it was freed released from its agitation dependence and entrapment  calm and unconfinedThis is why Pali poetry repeatedly uses the image of extinguished fire as a metaphor for freedomIn fact this metaphor is part of a pattern of fire imagery that involves two other related terms as wellUpadana or clinging also refers to the sustenance a fire takes from its fuelKhandha means not only one of the five heaps that define all conditioned experience but also the trunk of a treeJust as fire goes out when it stops clinging and taking sustenance from wood so the mind is freed when it stops clinging to the khandhasThus the image underlying nibbana is one of freedomThe Pali commentaries support this point by tracing the word nibbana to its verbal root which means unbinding What kind of unbindingThe texts describe two levelsOne is the unbinding in this lifetime symbolized by a fire that has gone out but whose embers are still warmThis stands for the enlightened arahant who is conscious of sights and sounds sensitive to pleasure and pain but freed from passion aversion and delusionThe second level of unbinding symbolized by a fire so totally out that its embers have grown cold is what the arahant experiences after this lifeAll input from the senses cools away and heshe is totally freed from even the subtlest stresses and limitations of existence in space and timeThe Buddha insists that this level is indescribable even in terms of existence or nonexistence because words work only for things that have limitsAll he really says about it  apart from images and metaphors  is that one can have foretastes of the experience in this lifetime and that its the ultimate happiness something truly worth knowingSo the next time you watch a fire going out see it not as a case of annihilation but as a lesson in how freedom is to be found in letting goIf youre born into an Asian Buddhist family the first thing your parents will teach you about Buddhism is not a philosophical tenet but a gesture of respect how to place your hands in añjali palmtopalm over your heart when you encounter a Buddha image a monk or a nunObviously the gesture will be mechanical at firstOver time though youll learn the respectful attitude that goes with itIf youre quick to pick it up your parents will consider it a sign of intelligence for respect is basic to any ability to learnAs you get older they may teach you the symbolism of the gesture that your hands form a lotus bud representing your heart which you are holding out to be trained in how to become wiseUltimately as you grow more familiar with the fruits of Buddhist practice your parents hope that your respect will turn into reverence and venerationIn this way they give a quick answer to the old Western question of which side of Buddhism  the philosophy or the religion  comes firstIn their eyes the religious attitude of respect is needed for any philosophical understanding to growAnd as far as theyre concerned theres no conflict between the twoIn fact theyre mutually reinforcingThis stands in marked contrast to the typical Western attitude which sees an essential discrepancy between Buddhisms religious and philosophical sidesThe philosophy seems so rational placing such a high value on selfrelianceThe insight at the heart of the Buddhas awakening was so abstract  a principle of causalityThere seems no inherent reason for a philosophy with such an abstract beginning to have produced a devotionalism intense enough to rival anything found in the theistic religionsYet if we look at what the Pali canon has to say about devotionalism  the attitude it expresses with the cluster of words respect deference reverence homage and veneration  we find not only that its theory of respect is rooted in the central insight of the Buddhas awakening  the causal principle called thisthat conditionality  but also that respect is required to learn and master this causal principle in the first placeOn the surface it may seem strange to relate a theory of causality to the issue of respect but the two are intimately entwinedRespect is the attitude you develop toward the things that matter in lifeTheories of causality tell you if anything really matters and if so what matters and howIf you believe that a supreme being will grant you happiness youll naturally show respect and reverence for that beingIf you assume happiness to be entirely selfwilled your greatest respect will be reserved for your own willfulnessAs for the how If you view true happiness as totally impossible totally predetermined or totally random respect is unnecessary for it makes no difference in the outcome of your lifeBut if you see true happiness as possible and its causes as precarious contingent and dependent on your attitude youll naturally show them the care and respect needed to keep them healthy and strongThis is reflected in the way the canon treats the issue of respectIt details the varied ways in which lay people of the Buddhas time showed respect to the Buddha and the monastic Sangha and the more standardized ways in which the members of the Sangha showed respect to the Buddha and to one anotherEspecially interesting is the protocol of respect for the DhammaBuddhist monks and nuns are forbidden from teaching the Dhamma to anyone who shows disrespect and the Buddha himself is said to have refused to teach his first sermon to the five brethren until they stopped treating him as a mere equalThis protocol of course may have been a cultural accident something picked up willynilly from the society of the Buddhas time but there are passages in the canon suggesting otherwiseBuddhism was one of the samana movements in ancient India which claimed to follow truths of nature rather than mainstream cultural normsThese movements were very free in choosing what to adopt from prevailing customsBuddhist descriptions of other samana movements often criticized them for being disrespectful not only to outsiders but also among themselvesStudents are shown being disrespectful to their teachers  their group meetings raucous noisy and out of controlAll of this is then contrasted with the way Buddhists conduct their meetings in mutual courtesy and respectThis suggests that the Buddhists were free to reject the common customs of respect but made a conscious choice not toThis choice is based on their insight into respect as a prerequisite for learningIts easier to learn from someone you respect than from someone you dontRespect opens the mind and loosens preconceived opinions to make room for new knowledge and skillsAt the same time people who value their knowledge feel more inclined to teach it to someone who shows respect than to someone who doesntHowever the type of learning the Buddha emphasizes is not simply the acquisition of informationIts a skill leading to total release from suffering and stressAnd this is where the issue of respect connects with causality for the Buddhist theory of causality centers on the question of how its possible to learn a skillAs cybernetics theory shows learning in general is possible only where there is feedback learning a skill requires the further ability to monitor feedback and choose how to use it to modify behaviorThe Buddhas discoveries in causality explain the how and the what that allow for these factorsThe how he expressed as a causal formula the what as an analysis of action the factors that shape it together with the range of results it can giveThe causal formula simply put states that each moment is composed of three things results from past actions present actions and the immediate results of present actionsAlthough this principle seems simple its consequences are very complexEvery act you perform has repercussions in the present moment that also reverberate into the futureDepending on the intensity of the act those reverberations can last for a very short or a very long timeThus every conditioned experience is shaped by the combined effects of past actions coming from a wide range over time together with the effects of present actsCausality over time places certain limitations on each momentThe present is not a clean slate for its partially shaped by influences from the pastImmediate causality in the present however makes room for free willNot everything is determined by the pastAt any moment you can insert new input into the process and nudge your life in a new directionStill theres not so much room for free will that causality becomes arbitraryEvery this put into the system produces a particular type of thatEvents follow discernible patterns that can be masteredThe what that keeps this process in motion is the factor allowing for feedback and the monitoring of feedbackThe central element in that what is intention which the Buddha identified as the essence of action or kammaIntention in turn is shaped by acts of attention which ask questions about perceptions and create views from those questionsBecause you can attend to the results of your intentions there is an internal feedback loop allowing you to learnBecause attention can ask questions it can monitor that feedback to determine how best to put it to useAnd because your intentions  guided by views and offering new input into the present  can then reshape your experience your ability to learn can make a difference you can change your behavior and reap the results of your improved skills in terms of greater and greater happinessHow far can that happiness goIn the course of his Awakening the Buddha discovered that the pursuit of skillfulness can ultimately lead beyond time and space beyond the realm of conditionality and rebirthFrom this discovery he identified four types of kamma the first three giving pleasant painful or mixed results in the round of rebirth and the fourth leading beyond all kamma to the end of rebirthIn other words the principle of causality works so that actions can either continue the round or bring it to an endBecause even the highest pleasure within the round is inconstant and undependable he taught that the most worthy course of action is the fourth kind of kamma  the type that led to his Awakening  to put an end to kamma once and for allThe skill needed for this form of kamma comes from coordinating the factors of attention and intention so that they lead first to pleasant results within the round of rebirth and then  on the transcendent level  to total release from suffering and stressThis in turn requires certain attitudes toward the principle of causality operating in human lifeAnd this is where the quality of respect becomes essential for without the proper respect for three things  yourself the principle of causality operating in your life and other peoples insights into that principle  you wont be able to muster the resolve needed to master that principle and to see how far your potential for skillfulness can goRespect for yourself in the context of thisthat conditionality means two things Because the fourth kind of kamma is possible you can respect your desire for unconditional happiness and dont have to regard it as an unrealistic ideal Because of the importance of intention and attention in shaping your experience you can respect your ability to develop the skills needed to understand and master causal reality to the point of attaining true happinessBut respect for yourself goes even further than thatNot only can you respect your desire for true happiness and your ability to attain it you must respect these things if you dont want to fall under the sway of the many religious and secular forces within society and yourself that would pull you in other directionsAlthough most religious cultures assume true happiness to be possible they dont see human skillfulness as capable of bringing it aboutBy and large they place their hopes for happiness in higher powersAs for secular cultures they dont believe that unconditional happiness is possible at allThey teach us to strive for happiness dependent on conditions and to turn a blind eye to the limitations inherent in any happiness coming from money power relationships possessions or a sentimental sense of communityThey often scoff at higher values and smile when religious idols fall or religious aspirants show feet of clayThese secular attitudes foster our own unskillful qualities our desire to take whatever pleasures come easily and our impatience with anyone who would tell us that were capable of better and moreBut both the secular and the common religious attitudes teach us to underestimate the powers of our own skillful mind statesQualities like mindfulness concentration and discernment when they first arise in the mind seem unremarkable  small and tender like maple seedlings growing in the midst of weedsIf we dont watch for them or accord them any special respect the weeds will strangle them or we ourselves will tread them underfootAs a result well never get to know how much shade they can provideIf however we develop strong respect for our own ability to attain true happiness two important moral qualities take charge of our minds and watch out for our good qualities concern for the suffering well experience if we dont try our best to develop skillfulness and shame at the thought of aiming lower than at the highest possible happinessShame may seem a strange adjunct to selfrespect but when both are healthy they go togetherYou need selfrespect to recognize when a course of action is beneath you and that youd be ashamed to follow itYou need to feel shame for your mistakes in order to keep your selfrespect from turning into stubborn prideThis is where the second aspect of respect  respect for the principle of causality  comes inThisthat conditionality is not a freeform processEach unskillful this is connected to an unpleasant thatYou cant twist the connection to lead to pleasant results or use your own preferences to design a customized path to release from causal experienceSelfrespect thus has to accommodate a respect for the way causes actually produce effectsTraditionally this respect is expressed in terms of the quality the Buddha stressed in his very last words heedfulnessTo be heedful means having a strong sense that if youre careless in your intentions youll sufferIf you truly love yourself you have to pay close attention to the way reality really works and act accordinglyNot everything you think or feel is worthy of respectEven the Buddha himself didnt design Buddhism or the principle of thisthat conditionalityHe discovered themInstead of viewing reality in line with his preferences he reordered his preferences to make the most of what he learned by watching  with scrupulous care and honesty  his actions and their actual effectsThis point is reflected in his discourse to the KalamasAlthough this discourse is often cited as the Buddhas carte blanche for following your own sense of right and wrong it actually says something very different Dont simply follow traditions but dont simply follow your own preferences eitherIf you see through watching your own actions and their results that following a certain mental state leads to harm and suffering you should abandon it and resolve never to follow it againThis is a rigorous standard which requires putting the Dhamma ahead of your own preconceived preferencesAnd it requires that you be very heedful of any tendency to reverse that priority and put your preferences firstIn other words you cant simply indulge in the pleasure or resist the pain coming from your own actionsYou have to learn from both pleasure and pain to show them respect as events in a causal chain to see what they have to teach youThis is why the Buddha called dukkha  pain stress and suffering  a noble truth and why he termed the pleasure arising from the concentrated mind a noble truth as wellThese aspects of immediate experience contain lessons that can take the mind to the noble attainmentsThe discourse to the Kalamas however doesnt stop with immediate experienceIt goes further and states that when observing the processes of cause and effect in your actions you should also confirm your observations with the teachings of the wiseThis third aspect of respect  respect for the insights of others  is also based on the pattern of thisthat conditionalityBecause causes are sometimes separated from their effects by great expanses of time its easy to lose sight of some important connectionsAt the same time your chief obstacle to discernment  delusion  is the mental quality you have the hardest time detecting in yourselfWhen youre deluded you dont know youre deludedSo the wise approach is to show respect to the insights of others in the event that their insights may help you see through your own ignoranceAfter all intention and attention are immediately present to their awareness as wellTheir insights may be just what you need to cut through the obstacles youve created for yourself through your own acts of ignoranceThe Buddhist teachings on respect for other people point in two directionsFirst the obvious one respect for those ahead of you on the pathAs the Buddha once said friendship with admirable people is the whole of the holy life for their words and examples will help get you on the path to releaseThis doesnt mean that you need to obey their teachings or accept them unthinkinglyYou simply owe it to yourself to give them a respectful hearing and their teachings an honest tryEven  especially  when their advice is unpleasant you should treat it with respectAs Dhammapada statesAt the same time when you show respect for those who have mastered the path youre also showing respect for qualities you want to develop in yourselfAnd when such people see that you respect the good qualities both in them and in yourself theyll feel more inclined to share their wisdom with you and more careful about sharing only their bestThis is why the Buddhist tradition places such an emphasis on not only feeling respect but also showing itIf you cant force yourself to show respect to others in ways theyll recognize theres a resistance in your mindThey in turn will doubt your willingness to learnThis is why the monastic discipline places so much emphasis on the etiquette of respect to be shown to teachers and senior monasticsThe teachings on respect however go in another direction as wellBuddhist monks and nuns are not allowed to show disrespect for anyone who criticizes them regardless of whether or not that person is awakened or the criticism wellfoundedCritics of this sort may not deserve the level of respect due to teachers but they do deserve common courtesyEven unawakened people may have observed valuable bits and pieces of the truthIf you open yourself to criticism you may get to hear worthwhile insights that a wall of disrespect would have repelledBuddhist literature  from the earliest days up to the present  abounds with stories of people who gained Awakening after hearing a chance word or song from an unlikely sourceA person with the proper attitude of respect can learn from anything  and the ability to put anything to a good use is the mark of true discernmentPerhaps the most delicate skill with regard to respect is learning how to balance all three aspects of respect for yourself for the truth of causality and for the insight of othersThis balance is essential to any skillIf you want to become a potter for example you have to learn not only from your teacher but also from your own actions and powers of observation and from the clay itselfThen you have to weigh all of these factors together to achieve mastery on your ownIf in your pursuit of the Buddhist path your selfrespect outweighs your respect for the truth of causality or the insights of others youll find it hard to take criticism or to laugh at your own foolishnessThis will make it impossible for you to learnIf on the other hand your respect for your teachers outweighs your selfrespect or your respect for the truth you can open yourself to charlatans and close yourself to the truth that the canon says is to be seen by the wise for themselvesThe parallels between the role of respect in Buddhist practice and in manual skills explains why many Buddhist teachers require their students to master a manual skill as a prerequisite or a part of their meditationA person with no manual skills will have little intuitive understanding of how to balance respectWhat sets the Buddhas apart from other skills though is the level of total freedom it producesAnd the difference between that freedom and its alternative  endless rounds of suffering through birth after birth death after death  is so extreme that we can easily understand why people committed to the pursuit of that freedom show it a level of respect thats also extremeEven more understandable is the absolute level of respect for that freedom shown by those who have attained itThey bow down to all their inner and outer teachers with the sincerest most heartfelt gratitudeTo see them bow down in this way is an inspiring sightSo when Buddhist parents teach their children to show respect for the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha they arent teaching them a habit that will later have to be unlearnedOf course the child will need to discover how best to understand and make use of that respect but at least the parents have helped open the door for the child to learn from its own powers of observation to learn from the truth and to learn from the insights of othersAnd when that door  when the mind  is opened to what truly deserves respect all things noble and good can come inWhat exactly is vipassanaAlmost any book on early Buddhist meditation will tell you that the Buddha taught two types of meditation samatha and vipassanaSamatha which means tranquillity is said to be a method fostering strong states of mental absorption called jhanaVipassana  literally clearseeing but more often translated as insight meditation  is said to be a method using a modicum of tranquillity to foster momenttomoment mindfulness of the inconstancy of events as they are directly experienced in the presentThis mindfulness creates a sense of dispassion toward all events thus leading the mind to release from sufferingThese two methods are quite separate were told and of the two vipassana is the distinctive Buddhist contribution to meditative scienceOther systems of practice predating the Buddha also taught samatha but the Buddha was the first to discover and teach vipassanaAlthough some Buddhist meditators may practice samatha meditation before turning to vipassana samatha practice is not really necessary for the pursuit of AwakeningAs a meditative tool the vipassana method is sufficient for attaining the goalOr so were toldBut if you look directly at the Pali discourses  the earliest extant sources for our knowledge of the Buddhas teachings  youll find that although they do use the word samatha to mean tranquillity and vipassana to mean clearseeing they otherwise confirm none of the received wisdom about these termsOnly rarely do they make use of the word vipassana  a sharp contrast to their frequent use of the word jhanaWhen they depict the Buddha telling his disciples to go meditate they never quote him as saying go do vipassana but always go do jhana And they never equate the word vipassana with any mindfulness techniquesIn the few instances where they do mention vipassana they almost always pair it with samatha  not as two alternative methods but as two qualities of mind that a person may gain or be endowed with and that should be developed togetherOne simile for instance compares samatha and vipassana to a swift pair of messengers who enter the citadel of the body via the noble eightfold path and present their accurate report  Unbinding or nibbana  to the consciousness acting as the citadels commanderAnother passage recommends that anyone who wishes to put an end to mental defilement should  in addition to perfecting the principles of moral behavior and cultivating seclusion  be committed to samatha and endowed with vipassanaThis last statement is unremarkable in itself but the same discourse also gives the same advice to anyone who wants to master the jhanas be committed to samatha and endowed with vipassanaThis suggests that in the eyes of those who assembled the Pali discourses samatha jhana and vipassana were all part of a single pathSamatha and vipassana were used together to master jhana and then  based on jhana  were developed even further to give rise to the end of mental defilement and to bring release from sufferingThis is a reading that finds support in other discourses as wellTheres a passage for instance describing three ways in which samatha and vipassana can work together to lead to the knowledge of Awakening either samatha precedes vipassana vipassana precedes samatha or they develop in tandemThe wording suggests an image of two oxen pulling a cart one is placed before the other or they are yoked sidebysideAnother passage indicates that if samatha precedes vipassana  or vipassana samatha  ones practice is in a state of imbalance and needs to be rectifiedA meditator who has attained a measure of samatha but no vipassana into events based on heightened discernment should question a fellow meditator who has attained vipassana How should fabrications be regardedHow should they be investigatedHow should they be viewed with insight and then develop vipassana in line with that persons instructionsThe verbs in these questions  regarding investigating seeing  indicate that theres more to the process of developing vipassana than a simple mindfulness techniqueIn fact as we will see below these verbs apply instead to a process of skillful questioning called appropriate attentionThe opposite case  a meditator endowed with a measure of vipassana into events based on heightened discernment but no samatha  should question someone who has attained samatha How should the mind be steadiedHow should it be made to settle downHow should it be unifiedHow should it be concentrated and then follow that persons instructions so as to develop samathaThe verbs used here give the impression that samatha in this context means jhana for they correspond to the verbal formula  the mind becomes steady settles down grows unified and concentrated  that the Pali discourses use repeatedly to describe the attainment of jhanaThis impression is reinforced when we note that in every case where the discourses are explicit about the levels of concentration needed for insight to be liberating those levels are the jhanasOnce the meditator is endowed with both samatha and vipassana heshe should make an effort to establish those very same skillful qualities to a higher degree for the ending of the mental fermentations This corresponds to the path of samatha and vipassana developing in tandemA passage in MN describes how this can happenOne knows and sees as they actually are the six sense media their objects consciousness at each medium contact at each medium and whatever is experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain based on that contactOne maintains this awareness in such a way as to stay uninfatuated by any of these things unattached unconfused focused on their drawbacks abandoning any craving for them this would count as vipassanaAt the same time  abandoning physical and mental disturbances torments and distresses  one experiences ease in body and mind this would count as samathaThis practice not only develops samatha and vipassana in tandem but also brings the Wings to Awakening  which include the attainment of jhana  to the culmination of their developmentSo the proper path is one in which vipassana and samatha are brought into balance each supporting and acting as a check on the otherVipassana helps keep tranquillity from becoming stagnant and dullSamatha helps prevent the manifestations of aversion  such as nausea dizziness disorientation and even total blanking out  that can occur when the mind is trapped against its will in the present momentFrom this description its obvious that samatha and vipassana are not separate paths of practice but instead are complementary ways of relating to the present moment samatha provides a sense of ease in the present vipassana a cleareyed view of events as they actually occur in and of themselvesIts also obvious why the two qualities need to function together in mastering jhanaAs the standard instructions on breath meditation indicate such a mastery involves three things gladdening concentrating and liberating the mindGladdening means finding a sense of refreshment and satisfaction in the presentConcentrating means keeping the mind focused on its object while liberating means freeing the mind from the grosser factors making up a lower stage of concentration so as to attain a higher stageThe first two activities are functions of samatha while the last is a function of vipassanaAll three must function togetherIf for example there is concentration and gladdening with no letting go the mind wouldnt be able to refine its concentration at allThe factors that have to be abandoned in raising the mind from stage x to stage y belong to the set of factors that got the mind to x in the first placeWithout the ability clearly to see mental events in the present there would be no way skillfully to release the mind from precisely the right factors that tie it to a lower state of concentration and act as disturbances to a higher oneIf on the other hand there is simply a letting go of those factors without an appreciation of or steadiness in the stillness that remains the mind would drop out of jhana altogetherThus samatha and vipassana must work together to bring the mind to right concentration in a masterful wayThe question arises if vipassana functions in the mastery of jhana and jhana is not exclusive to Buddhists then what is Buddhist about vipassanaThe answer is that vipassana per se is not exclusively BuddhistWhat is distinctly Buddhist is the extent to which both samatha and vipassana are developed and the way they are developed  ie the line of questioning used to foster them and the way they are combined with an arsenal of meditative tools to bring the mind to total releaseIn MN the Buddha advises a monk who has mastered jhana to further develop samatha and vipassana so as to master six cognitive skills the most important of them being that through the ending of the mental fermentations one remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease and discernmentrelease having known and made them manifest for oneself right in the here and now This is a description of the Buddhist goalSome commentators have asserted that this release is totally a function of vipassana but there are discourses that indicate otherwiseNote that release is twofold awarenessrelease and discernmentreleaseawarenessrelease occurs when a meditator becomes totally dispassionate toward passion this is the ultimate function of samathaDiscernmentrelease occurs when there is dispassion for ignorance this is the ultimate function of vipassanaThus both samatha and vipassana are involved in the twofold nature of this releaseThe Sabbasava Sutta states that ones release can be fermentationfree only if one knows and sees in terms of appropriate attentionAs the discourse shows appropriate attention means asking the proper questions about phenomena regarding them not in terms of selfother or beingnonbeing but in terms of the four noble truthsIn other words instead of asking Do I existDont I existWhat am I one asks about an experience Is this stressThe origination of stressThe cessation of stressThe path leading to the cessation of stress Because each of these categories entails a duty the answer to these questions determines a course of action stress should be comprehended its origination abandoned its cessation realized and the path to its cessation developedSamatha and vipassana belong to the category of the path and so should be developedTo develop them one must apply appropriate attention to the task of comprehending stress which is comprised of the five clingingaggregates  clinging to physical form feeling perception mental fabrications and consciousnessApplying appropriate attention to these aggregates means viewing them in terms of their drawbacks as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness notselfA list of questions distinctive to the Buddha aids in this approach Is this aggregate constant or inconstant And is anything inconstant easeful or stressful And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I amThese questions are applied to every instance of the five aggregates whether past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near In other words the meditator asks these questions of all experiences in the cosmos of the six sense mediaThis line of questioning is part of a strategy leading to a level of knowledge called knowing and seeing things as they actually are where things are understood in terms of a fivefold perspective their arising their passing away their drawbacks their allure and the escape from them  the escape here lying in dispassionSome commentators have suggested that in practice this fivefold perspective can be gained simply by focusing on the arising and passing away of these aggregates in the present moment if ones focus is relentless enough it will lead naturally to a knowledge of drawbacks allure and escape sufficient for total releaseThe texts however dont support this reading and practical experience would seem to back them upAs MN points out individual meditators will discover that in some cases they can develop dispassion for a particular cause of stress simply by watching it with equanimity but in other cases they will need to make a conscious exertion to develop the dispassion that will provide an escapeThe discourse is vague  perhaps deliberately so  as to which approach will work whereThis is something each meditator must test for him or herself in practiceThe Sabbasava Sutta expands on this point by listing seven approaches to take in developing dispassionVipassana as a quality of mind is related to all seven but most directly with the first seeing ie seeing events in terms of the four noble truths and the duties appropriate to themThe remaining six approaches cover ways of carrying out those duties restraining the mind from focusing on sense data that would provoke unskillful states of mind reflecting on the appropriate reasons for using the requisites of food clothing shelter and medicine tolerating painful sensations avoiding obvious dangers and inappropriate companions destroying thoughts of sensual desire ill will harmfulness and other unskillful states and developing the seven factors for Awakening mindfulness analysis of qualities persistence rapture serenity concentration and equanimityEach of these approaches covers a wide subset of approachesUnder destroying for instance one may eliminate an unskillful mental state by replacing it with a skillful one focusing on its drawbacks turning ones attention away from it relaxing the process of thoughtfabrication that formed it or suppressing it with the brute power of ones willMany similar examples could be drawn from other discourses as wellThe overall point is that the ways of the mind are varied and complexDifferent fermentations can come bubbling up in different guises and respond to different approachesOnes skill as a meditator lies in mastering a variety of approaches and developing the sensitivity to know which approach will work best in which situationOn a more basic level however one needs strong motivation to master these skills in the first placeBecause appropriate attention requires abandoning dichotomies that are so basic to the thought patterns of all people  beingnot being and menot me  meditators need strong reasons for adopting itThis is why the Sabbasava Sutta insists that anyone developing appropriate attention must first must hold the noble ones in high regardIn other words one must see that those who have followed the path are truly exemplaryOne must also be wellversed in their teaching and disciplineAccording to MN being wellversed in their teaching begins with having conviction in their teachings about karma and rebirth which provide intellectual and emotional context for adopting the four noble truths as the basic categories of experienceBeing wellversed in the discipline of the noble ones would include in addition to observing the precepts having some skill in the seven approaches mentioned above for abandoning the fermentationsWithout this sort of background meditators might bring the wrong attitudes and questions to the practice of watching arising and passing away in the present momentFor instance they might be looking for a true self and end up identifying  consciously or unconsciously  with the vast open sense of awareness that embraces all change from which it all seems to come and to which it all seems to returnOr they might long for a sense of connectedness with the vast interplay of the universe convinced that  as all things are changing  any desire for changelessness is neurotic and lifedenyingFor people with agendas like these the simple experience of events arising and passing away in the present wont lead to fivefold knowledge of things as they areTheyll resist recognizing that the ideas they hold to are a fermentation of views or that the experiences of calm that seem to verify those ideas are simply a fermentation in the form of a state of beingAs a result they wont be willing to apply the four noble truths to those ideas and experiencesOnly a person willing to see those fermentations as such and convinced of the need to transcend them will be in a position to apply the principles of appropriate attention to them and thus get beyond themSo to answer the question with which we began Vipassana is not a meditation techniqueIts a quality of mind  the ability to see events clearly in the present momentAlthough mindfulness is helpful in fostering vipassana its not enough for developing vipassana to the point of total releaseOther techniques and approaches are needed as wellIn particular vipassana needs to be teamed with samatha  the ability to settle the mind comfortably in the present  so as to master the attainment of strong states of absorption or jhanaBased on this mastery samatha and vipassana are then applied to a skillful program of questioning called appropriate attention directed at all experience exploring events not in terms of menot me or beingnot being but in terms of the four noble truthsThe meditator pursues this program until it leads to a fivefold understanding of all events in terms of their arising their passing away their drawbacks their allure and the escape from themOnly then can the mind taste releaseThis program for developing vipassana and samatha in turn needs the support of many other attitudes mental qualities and techniques of practiceThis was why the Buddha taught it as part of a still larger program including respect for the noble ones mastery of all seven approaches for abandoning the mental fermentations and all eight factors of the noble pathTo take a reductionist approach to the practice can produce only reduced results for meditation is a skill like carpentry requiring a mastery of many tools in response to many different needsTo limit oneself to only one approach in meditation would be like trying to build a house when ones motivation is uncertain and ones tool box contains nothing but hammersThe two crucial aspects of the Buddhas Awakening are the what and the how what he awakened to and how he did itHis awakening is special in that the two aspects come togetherHe awakened to the fact that there is an undying happiness and that it can be attained through human effortThe human effort involved in this process ultimately focuses on the question of understanding the nature of human effort itself  in terms of skillful kamma and dependent coarising  what its powers and limitations are and what kind of right effort can take one beyond its limitations and bring one to the threshold of the DeathlessAs the Buddha described the Awakening experience in one of his discourses first there is the knowledge of the regularity of the Dhamma  which in this context means dependent coarising  then there is the knowledge of nibbanaIn other passages he describes the three stages that led to insight into dependent coarising knowledge of his own previous lifetimes knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of all living beings and finally insight into the four Noble TruthsThe first two forms of knowledge were not new with the BuddhaThey have been reported by other seers throughout history although the Buddhas insight into the second knowledge had a special twist He saw that beings are reborn according to the ethical quality of their thoughts words and deeds and that this quality is essentially a factor of the mindThe quality of ones views and intentions determines the experienced result of ones actionsThis insight had a double impact on his mindOn the one hand it made him realize the futility of the round of rebirth  that even the best efforts aimed at winning pleasure and fulfillment within the round could have only temporary effectsOn the other hand his realization of the importance of the mind in determining the round is what led him to focus directly on his own mind in the present to see how the processes in the mind that kept the round going could be disbandedThis was how he gained insight into the four noble truths and dependent coarising  seeing how the aggregates that made up his person were also the impelling factors in the round of experience and the world at large and how the whole show could be brought to cessationWith its cessation there remained the experience of the unconditioned which he also termed nibbana consciousness without surface or feature the DeathlessWhen we address the question of how other enlightenment experiences recorded in world history relate to the Buddhas we have to keep in mind the Buddhas own dictum First there is the knowledge of dependent coarising then there is the knowledge of nibbanaWithout the first  which includes not only an understanding of kamma but also of how kamma leads to the understanding itself  any realization no matter how calm or boundless that does not result from these sorts of understanding cannot count as an Awakening in the Buddhist senseTrue Awakening necessarily involves both ethics and insight into causalityAs for what the Buddhas Awakening means for us now four points stand out The role that kamma plays in the Awakening is empoweringIt means that what each of us does says and thinks does matter  this in opposition to the sense of futility that can come from reading say world history geology or astronomy and realizing the fleeting nature of the entire human enterpriseThe Awakening lets us see that the choices we make in each moment of our lives have consequencesWe are not strangers in a strange landWe have formed and are continuing to form the world we experienceThe fact that we are empowered also means that we are responsible for our experiencesThis helps us to face the events we encounter in life with greater equanimity for we know that we had a hand in creating them and yet at the same time we can avoid any debilitating sense of guilt because with each new choice we can always make a fresh start The Awakening also tells us that good and bad are not mere social conventions but are built into the mechanics of how the world is constructedWe may be free to design our lives but we are not free to change the underlying rules that determine what good and bad actions are and how the process of kamma works itself outThus cultural relativism  even though it may have paved the way for many of us to leave our earlier religious orientations and enter the Buddhist fold  has no place once we are within that foldThere are certain ways of acting that are inherently unskillful and we are fools if we insist on our right to behave in those ways As the Buddha says at one point in describing his Awakening Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent and resolute In other words he gained liberating knowledge through qualities that we can all develop heedfulness ardency resolutionIf we are willing to face the implications of this fact we realize that the Buddhas Awakening is a challenge to our entire set of valuesThe fact that the Unconditioned can be attained forces us to reevaluate any other goals we may set for ourselves whatever worlds we want to create in our livesOn an obvious level it points out the spiritual poverty of a life devoted to wealth status or sensual pursuits but it also forces us to take a hard look at other more worthwhile goals that our culture and its subcultures tend to exalt such as social acceptance meaningful relationships stewardship of the planet etcThese too will inevitably lead to sufferingThe interdependence of all things cannot be for any truly sensitive mind a source of security or comfortIf the Unconditioned is available and it is the only trustworthy happiness around it only makes sense that we invest our efforts and whatever mental and spiritual resources we have in its direction Even for those who are not ready to make that kind of investment the Awakening assures us that happiness comes from developing qualities within ourselves that we can be proud of such as kindness sensitivity equanimity mindfulness conviction determination and discernmentAgain this is a very different message from the one we pick up from the world telling us that in order to gain happiness we have to develop qualities we cant take any genuine pride in aggressiveness selfaggrandizement dishonesty etcJust this much can give an entirely new orientation to our lives and our ideas of what is worthwhile investment of our time and effortsThe news of the Buddhas Awakening sets the standards for judging the culture we were brought up in and not the other way aroundThis is not a question of choosing Asian culture over AmericanThe Buddhas Awakening challenged many of the presuppositions of Indian culture in his day and even in socalled Buddhist countries the true practice of the Buddhas teachings is always counterculturalIts a question of evaluating our normal concerns  conditioned by time space and the limitations of aging illness and death  against the possibility of a timeless spaceless limitless happinessAll cultures are tied up in the limited conditioned side of things while the Buddhas Awakening points beyond all culturesIt offers the challenge of the Deathless that his contemporaries found liberating and that we if we are willing to accept the challenge may find liberating ourselvesHow can I ever repay you for your teachingGood meditation teachers often hear this question from their students and the best answer I know for it is one that my teacher Ajaan Fuang gave every time By being intent on practicing Each time he gave this answer I was struck by how noble and gracious it wasAnd it wasnt just a formalityHe never tried to find opportunities to pressure his students for donationsEven when our monastery was poor he never acted poor never tried to take advantage of their gratitude and trustThis was a refreshing change from some of my previous experiences with runofthemill village and city monks who were quick to drop hints about their need for donations from even stray or casual visitorsEventually I learned that Ajaan Fuangs behavior is common throughout the Forest TraditionIts based on a passage in the Pali Canon where the Buddha on his deathbed states that the highest homage to him is not material homage but the homage of practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the DhammaIn other words the best way to repay a teacher is to take the Dhamma to heart and to practice it in a way that fulfills his or her compassionate purpose in teaching itI was proud to be part of a tradition where the inner wealth of this noble idea was actually lived  where as Ajaan Fuang often put it we werent reduced to hirelings and the act of teaching the Dhamma was purely a giftSo I was saddened when on my return to America I had my first encounters with the dana talk the talk on giving and generosity that often comes at the end of a retreatThe context of the talk  and often the content  makes clear that its not a disinterested exerciseIts aimed at generating gifts for the teacher or the organization sponsoring the retreat and it places the burden of responsibility on the retreatants to ensure that future retreats can occurThe language of the talk is often smooth and encouraging but when contrasted with Ajaan Fuangs answer I found the sheer fact of the talk illmannered and demeaningIf the organizers and teachers really trusted the retreatants goodheartedness they wouldnt be giving the talk at allTo make matters worse the typical dana talk  along with its companion the meditationcenter fundraising letter  often cites the example of how monks and nuns are supported in Asia as justification for how dana is treated here in the WestBut theyre taking as their example the worst of the monks and not the bestI understand the reasoning behind the talkLay teachers here aspire to the ideal of teaching for free but they still need to eatAnd unlike the monastics of Asia they dont have a longstanding tradition of dana to fall back onSo the dana talk was devised as a means for establishing a culture of dana in a Western contextBut as so often is the case when new customs are devised for Western Buddhism the question is whether the dana talk skillfully translates Buddhist principles into the Western context or seriously distorts themThe best way to answer this question is to take a close look at those principles in their original contextIts well known that dana lies at the beginning of Buddhist practiceDana quite literally has kept the Dhamma aliveIf it werent for the Indian tradition of giving to mendicants the Buddha would never have had the opportunity to explore and find the path to AwakeningThe monastic sangha wouldnt have had the time and opportunity to follow his wayDana is the first teaching in the graduated discourse the list of topics the Buddha used to lead listeners stepbystep to an appreciation of the four noble truths and often from there to their own first taste of AwakeningWhen stating the basic principles of karma he would begin with the statement There is what is givenWhats less well known is that in making this statement the Buddha was not dealing in obvious truths or generic platitudes for the topic of giving was actually controversial in his timeFor centuries the brahmans of India had been extolling the virtue of giving  as long as the gifts were given to themNot only that gifts to brahmans were obligatoryPeople of other castes if they didnt concede to the brahmans demands for gifts were neglecting their most essential social dutyBy ignoring their duties in the present life such people and their relatives would suffer hardship both now and after deathAs might be expected this attitude produced a backlashSeveral of the samana or contemplative movements of the Buddhas time countered the brahmans claims by asserting that there was no virtue in giving at allTheir arguments fell into two campsOne camp claimed that giving carried no virtue because there was no afterlifeA person was nothing more than physical elements that at death returned to their respective spheresThat was itGiving thus provided no longterm resultsThe other camp stated that there was no such thing as giving for everything in the universe has been determined by fateIf a donor gives something to another person its not really a gift for the donor has no choice or free will in the matterFate was simply working itself outSo when the Buddha in his introduction to the teaching on karma began by saying that there is what is given he was repudiating both campsGiving does give results both now and on into the future and it is the result of the donors free choiceHowever in contrast to the brahmans the Buddha took the principle of freedom one step furtherWhen asked where a gift should be given he stated simply Wherever the mind feels inspired In other words  aside from repaying ones debt to ones parents  there is no obligation to giveThis means that the choice to give is an act of true freedom and thus the perfect place to start the path to total releaseThis is why the Buddha adopted dana as the context for practicing and teaching the DhammaBut  to maintain the twin principles of freedom and fruitfulness in giving  he created a culture of dana that embodied particularly Buddhist idealsTo begin with he defined dana not simply as material giftsThe practice of the precepts he said was also a type of dana  the gift of universal safety protecting all beings from the harm of ones unskillful actions  as was the act of teaching the DhammaThis meant that lavish giving was not just the prerogative of the richSecondly he formulated a code of conduct to produce an attitude toward giving that would benefit both the donors and the recipients keeping the practice of giving both fruitful and freeWe tend not to associate codes of conduct with the word freedom but thats because we forget that freedom too needs protection especially from the attitude that wants to be free in its choices but feels insecure when others are free in theirsThe Buddhas codes of conduct are voluntary  he never coerced anyone into practicing his teachings  but once they are adopted they require the cooperation of both sides to keep them effective and strongThese codes are best understood in terms of the six factors that the Buddha said exemplified the ideal gift The donor before giving is glad while giving hisher mind is inspired and after giving is gratifiedThese are the three factors of the donorThe recipients are free of passion or are practicing for the subduing of passion free of aversion or practicing for the subduing of aversion and free of delusion or practicing for the subduing of delusionThese are the three factors of the recipientsAlthough this passage seems to suggest that each side is responsible only for the factors on its side the Buddhas larger etiquette for generosity shows that the responsibility for all six factors  and in particular the three factors of the donor  is sharedAnd this shared responsibility flourishes best in an atmosphere of mutual trustFor the donors this means that if they want to feel glad inspired and gratified at their gift they should not see the gift as payment for personal services rendered by individual monks or nunsThat would turn the gift into wages and deprive it of its emotional powerInstead theyd be wise to look for trustworthy recipients people who are training  or have trained  their minds to be cleaned and undefiledThey should also give their gift in a respectful way so that the act of giving will reinforce the gladness that inspired it and will inspire the recipient to value their giftThe responsibilities of the recipients however are even more stringentTo ensure that the donor feels glad before giving monks and nuns are forbidden from pressuring the donor in any wayExcept when ill or in situations where the donor has invited them to ask they cannot ask for anything beyond the barest emergency necessitiesThey are not even allowed to give hints about what theyd like to receiveWhen asked where a prospective gift should be given they are told to follow the Buddhas example and say Give wherever your gift would be used or would be wellcared for or would last long or wherever your mind feels inspired This conveys a sense of trust in the donors discernment  which in itself is a gift that gladdens the donors mindTo ensure that a donor feels inspired while giving a gift the monks and nuns are enjoined to receive gifts attentively and with an attitude of respectTo ensure that the donor feels gratified afterward they should live frugally care for the gift and make sure it is used in an appropriate wayIn other words they should show that the donors trust in them is well placedAnd of course they must work on subduing their greed anger and delusionIn fact this is a primary motivation for trying to attain arahantship so that the gifts given to one will bear the donors great fruitBy sharing these responsibilities in an atmosphere of trust both sides protect the freedom of the donorThey also foster the conditions that will enable not only the practice of generosity but also the entire practice of Dhamma to flourish and growThe principles of freedom and fruitfulness also govern the code the Buddha formulated specifically for protecting the gift of DhammaHere again the responsibilities are sharedTo ensure that the teacher is glad inspired and gratified in teaching the listeners are advised to listen with respect to try to understand the teaching and  once theyre convinced that its genuinely wise  to sincerely put it into practice so as to gain the desired resultsLike a monk or nun receiving a material gift the recipient of the gift of Dhamma has the simple responsibility of treating the gift wellThe teacher meanwhile must make sure not to regard the act of teaching as a repayment of a debtAfter all monks and nuns repay their debt to their lay donors by trying to rid their minds of greed aversion and delusionThey are in no way obligated to teach which means that the act of teaching is a gift free and clearIn addition the Buddha insisted that the Dhamma be taught without expectation of material rewardWhen he was once offered a teachers fee for his teaching he refused to accept it and told the donor to throw it awayHe also established the precedent that when a monastic teaches the rewards of generosity the teaching is given after a gift has been given not before so that the stain of hinting wont sully whats saidAll of these principles assume a high level of nobility and restraint on both sides of the equation which is why people tried to find ways around them even while the Buddha was aliveThe origin stories to the monastic discipline  the tales portraying the misbehavior that led the Buddha to formulate rules for the monks and nuns  often tell of monastics whose gift of Dhamma came with strings attached and of lay people who gladly pulled those strings to get what they wanted out of the monastics personal favors served with an ingratiating smileThe Buddhas steady persistence in formulating rules to cut these strings shows how determined he was that the principle of Dhamma as a genuinely free gift not be an idle idealHe wanted it to influence the way people actually behavedHe never gave an extended explanation of why the act of teaching should always be a gift but he did state in general terms that when his code of conduct became corrupt over time that would corrupt the Dhamma as wellAnd in the case of the etiquette of generosity this principle has been borne out frequently throughout Buddhist historyA primary example is recorded in the Apadanas which scholars believe were added to the Canon after King Asokas timeThe Apadanas discuss the rewards of giving in a way that shows how eager the monks composing them were to receive lavish giftsThey promise that even a small gift will bear fruit as guaranteed arahantship many eons in the future and that the path from now to then will always be filled with pleasure and prestigeAttainments of special distinction though require special donationsSome of these donations bear a symbolic resemblance to the desired distinction  a gift of lighted lamps for instance presages clairvoyance  but the preferred gift of distinction was a weeks worth of lavish meals for an entire monastery or at least for the monks who teachIts obvious that the monks who composed the Apadanas were giving free rein to their greed and were eager to tell their listeners what their listeners wanted to hearThe fact that these texts were recorded for posterity shows that the listeners in fact were pleasedThus the teachers and their students acting in collusion skewed the culture of dana in the direction of their defilementsIn so doing they distorted the Dhamma as wellIf giftgiving guarantees Awakening it supplants the noble eightfold path with the onefold path of the giftIf the road to Awakening is always prestigious and joyful the concept of right effort disappearsYet once these ideas were introduced into the Buddhist tradition they gained the stamp of authority and have affected Buddhist practice ever sinceThroughout Buddhist Asia people tend to give gifts with an eye to their symbolic promise of future reward and the list of gifts extolled in the Apadanas reads like a catalog of the gifts placed on altars throughout Buddhist Asia even todayWhich goes to show that once the culture of dana gets distorted it can distort the practice of Dhamma as a whole for many centuriesSo if were serious about bringing the culture of dana to the West we should be very careful to ensure that our efforts honor the principles that make dana a genuinely Buddhist practiceThis means no longer using the tactics of modern fundraising to encourage generosity among retreatants or Buddhists in generalIt also means rethinking the dana talk for on many counts it fails the testIn pressuring retreatants to give to teachers it doesnt lead to gladness before giving and instead sounds like a plea for a tip at the end of a mealThe frequent efforts to pull on the retreatants heartstrings as a path to their purse strings betray a lack of trust in their thoughtfulness and leave a bad tasteAnd the entire way dana is handled for teachers doesnt escape the fact that its payment for services renderedWhether teachers think about this consciously or not it pressures them subtly to tell their listeners what they think their listeners want to hearThe Dhamma cant help but suffer as a resultThe ideal solution would be to provide a framework whereby serious Dhamma practitioners could be supported whether or not they taughtThat way the act of teaching would be a genuine giftIn the meantime though a step in the direction of a genuine culture of dana would be to declare a moratorium on all dana talks at the end of retreats and on references to the Buddhist tradition of dana in fundraising appeals so as to give the word time to recover its dignityOn retreats dana could be discussed in a general way in the context of the many Dhamma talks given on how best to integrate Dhamma practice in daily lifeAt the end of the retreat a basket could be left out for donations with a note that the teacher hasnt been paid to teach the retreatThats allNo appeals for mercyNo flashcardsSensitive retreatants will be able to put two and two together and will feel glad inspired and gratified that they were trusted to do the math for themselvesOne of the first stumbling blocks that Westerners often encounter when they learn about Buddhism is the teaching on anatta often translated as noselfThis teaching is a stumbling block for two reasonsFirst the idea of there being no self doesnt fit well with other Buddhist teachings such as the doctrine of kamma and rebirth If theres no self what experiences the results of kamma and takes rebirthSecond it doesnt fit well with our own JudeoChristian background which assumes the existence of an eternal soul or self as a basic presupposition If theres no self whats the purpose of a spiritual lifeMany books try to answer these questions but if you look at the Pali canon  the earliest extant record of the Buddhas teachings  you wont find them addressed at allIn fact the one place where the Buddha was asked pointblank whether or not there was a self he refused to answerWhen later asked why he said that to hold either that there is a self or that there is no self is to fall into extreme forms of wrong view that make the path of Buddhist practice impossibleThus the question should be put asideTo understand what his silence on this question says about the meaning of anatta we first have to look at his teachings on how questions should be asked and answered and how to interpret his answersThe Buddha divided all questions into four classes those that deserve a categorical answer those that deserve an analytical answer defining and qualifying the terms of the question those that deserve a counterquestion putting the ball back in the questioners court and those that deserve to be put asideThe last class of question consists of those that dont lead to the end of suffering and stressThe first duty of a teacher when asked a question is to figure out which class the question belongs to and then to respond in the appropriate wayYou dont for example say yes or no to a question that should be put asideIf you are the person asking the question and you get an answer you should then determine how far the answer should be interpretedThe Buddha said that there are two types of people who misrepresent him those who draw inferences from statements that shouldnt have inferences drawn from them and those who dont draw inferences from those that shouldThese are the basic ground rules for interpreting the Buddhas teachings but if we look at the way most writers treat the anatta doctrine we find these ground rules ignoredSome writers try to qualify the noself interpretation by saying that the Buddha denied the existence of an eternal self or a separate self but this is to give an analytical answer to a question that the Buddha showed should be put asideOthers try to draw inferences from the few statements in the discourse that seem to imply that there is no self but it seems safe to assume that if one forces those statements to give an answer to a question that should be put aside one is drawing inferences where they shouldnt be drawnSo instead of answering no to the question of whether or not there is a self  interconnected or separate eternal or not  the Buddha felt that the question was misguided to begin withWhyNo matter how you define the line between self and other the notion of self involves an element of selfidentification and clinging and thus suffering and stressThis holds as much for an interconnected self which recognizes no other as it does for a separate selfIf one identifies with all of nature one is pained by every felled treeIt also holds for an entirely other universe in which the sense of alienation and futility would become so debilitating as to make the quest for happiness  ones own or that of others  impossibleFor these reasons the Buddha advised paying no attention to such questions as Do I exist or Dont I exist for however you answer them they lead to suffering and stressTo avoid the suffering implicit in questions of self and other he offered an alternative way of dividing up experience the four Noble Truths of stress its cause its cessation and the path to its cessationRather than viewing these truths as pertaining to self or other he said one should recognize them simply for what they are in and of themselves as they are directly experienced and then perform the duty appropriate to eachStress should be comprehended its cause abandoned its cessation realized and the path to its cessation developedThese duties form the context in which the anatta doctrine is best understoodIf you develop the path of virtue concentration and discernment to a state of calm wellbeing and use that calm state to look at experience in terms of the Noble Truths the questions that occur to the mind are not Is there a selfWhat is my self but rather Am I suffering stress because Im holding onto this particular phenomenonIs it really me myself or mineIf its stressful but not really me or mine why hold on These last questions merit straightforward answers as they then help you to comprehend stress and to chip away at the attachment and clinging  the residual sense of selfidentification  that cause it until ultimately all traces of selfidentification are gone and all thats left is limitless freedomIn this sense the anatta teaching is not a doctrine of noself but a notself strategy for shedding suffering by letting go of its cause leading to the highest undying happinessAt that point questions of self noself and notself fall asideOnce theres the experience of such total freedom where would there be any concern about whats experiencing it or whether or not its a selfWhat does it mean to be mindful of the breathSomething very simple to keep the breath in mindKeep remembering the breath each time you breathe in each time you breathe outThe British scholar who coined the term mindfulness to translate the Pali word sati was probably influenced by the Anglican prayer to be ever mindful of the needs of othersin other words to always keep their needs in mindBut even though the word mindful was probably drawn from a Christian context the Buddha himself defined sati as the ability to remember illustrating its function in meditation practice with the four satipatthanas or establishings of mindfulnessAnd what is the faculty of satiThere is the case where a monk a disciple of the noble ones is mindful highly meticulous remembering  able to call to mind even things that were done  said long agoHe remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldHe remains focused on feelings in  of themselves the mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldThe full discussion of the satipatthanas starts with instructions to be ever mindful of the breathDirections such as bring bare attention to the breath or accept the breath or whatever else modern teachers tell us that mindfulness is supposed to do are actually functions for other qualities in the mindTheyre not automatically a part of sati but you should bring them along wherever theyre appropriateOne quality thats always appropriate in establishing mindfulness is being watchful or alertThe Pali word for alertness sampajañña is another term thats often misunderstoodIt doesnt mean being choicelessly aware of the present or comprehending the presentExamples in the Canon shows that sampajañña means being aware of what youre doing in the movements of the body the movements in the mindAfter all if youre going to gain insight into how youre causing suffering your primary focus always has to be on what youre actually doingThis is why mindfulness and alertness should always be paired as you meditateIn the Satipatthana Sutta theyre combined with a third quality ardencyArdency means being intent on what youre doing trying your best to do it skillfullyThis doesnt mean that you have to keep straining and sweating all the time just that youre continuous in developing skillful habits and abandoning unskillful onesRemember in the eight factors of the path to freedom right mindfulness grows out of right effortRight effort is the effort to be skillfulMindfulness helps that effort along by reminding you to stick with it so that you dont let it dropAll three of these qualities get their focus from what the Buddha called yoniso manasikara appropriate attentionNotice Thats appropriate attention not bare attentionThe Buddha discovered that the way you attend to things is determined by what you see as important the questions you bring to the practice the problems you want the practice to solveNo act of attention is ever bareIf there were no problems in life you could open yourself up choicelessly to whatever came alongBut the fact is there is a big problem smack dab in the middle of everything you do the suffering that comes from acting in ignoranceThis is why the Buddha doesnt tell you to view each moment with a beginners eyesYouve got to keep the issue of suffering and its end always in mindOtherwise inappropriate attention will get in the way focusing on questions like Who am I Do I have a selfquestions that deal in terms of being and identityThose questions the Buddha said lead you into a thicket of views and leave you stuck on the thornsThe questions that lead to freedom focus on comprehending suffering letting go of the cause of suffering and developing the path to the end of sufferingYour desire for answers to these questions is what makes you alert to your actionsyour thoughts words and deedsand ardent to perform them skillfullyMindfulness is what keeps the perspective of appropriate attention in mindModern psychological research has shown that attention comes in discrete momentsYou can be attentive to something for only a very short period of time and then you have to remind yourself moment after moment to return to it if you want to keep on being attentiveIn other words continuous attentionthe type that can observe things over timehas to be stitched together from short intervalsThis is what mindfulness is forIt keeps the object of your attention and the purpose of your attention in mindPopular books on meditation though offer a lot of other definitions for mindfulness a lot of other duties its supposed to fulfillso many that the poor word gets totally stretched out of shapeIn some cases it even gets defined as Awakening as in the phrase A moment of mindfulness is a moment of Awakeningsomething the Buddha would never say because mindfulness is conditioned and nirvana is notThese are not just minor matters for nitpicking scholars to argue overIf you dont see the differences among the qualities youre bringing to your meditation they glom together making it hard for real insight to ariseIf you decide that one of the factors on the path to Awakening is Awakening itself its like reaching the middle of a road and then falling asleep right thereYou never get to the end of the road and in the meantime youre bound to get run over by aging illness and deathSo you need to get your directions straight and that requires among other things knowing precisely what mindfulness is and what its notIve heard mindfulness defined as affectionate attention or compassionate attention but affection and compassion arent the same as mindfulnessTheyre separate thingsIf you bring them to your meditation be clear about the fact that theyre acting in addition to mindfulness because skill in meditation requires seeing when qualities like compassion are helpful and when theyre notAs the Buddha says there are times when affection is a cause for suffering so you have to watch outSometimes mindfulness is defined as appreciating the moment for all the little pleasures it can offer the taste of a raisin the feel of a cup of tea in your handsIn the Buddhas vocabulary this appreciation is called contentmentContentment is useful when youre experiencing physical hardship but its not always useful in the area of the mindIn fact the Buddha once said that the secret to his Awakening was that he didnt allow himself to rest content with whatever attainment he had reachedHe kept reaching for something higher until there was nowhere higher to reachSo contentment has to know its time and placeMindfulness if its not glommed together with contentment can help keep that fact in mindSome teachers define mindfulness as nonreactivity or radical acceptance If you look for these words in the Buddhas vocabulary the closest youll find are equanimity and patienceEquanimity means learning to put aside your preferences so that you can watch whats actually therePatience is the ability not to get worked up over the things you dont like to stick with difficult situations even when they dont resolve as quickly as you want them toBut in establishing mindfulness you stay with unpleasant things not just to accept them but to watch and understand themOnce youve clearly seen that a particular quality like aversion or lust is harmful for the mind you cant stay patient or equanimous about itYou have to make whatever effort is needed to get rid of it and to nourish skillful qualities in its place by bringing in other factors of the path right resolve and right effortMindfulness after all is part of a larger path mapped out by appropriate attentionYou have to keep remembering to bring the larger map to bear on everything you doFor instance right now youre trying to keep the breath in mind because you see that concentration as a factor of the path is something you need to develop and mindfulness of the breath is a good way to do itThe breath is also a good standpoint from which you can directly observe whats happening in the mind to see which qualities of mind are giving good results and which ones arentMeditation involves lots of mental qualities and you have to be clear about what they are where theyre separate and what each one of them can doThat way when things are out of balance you can identify whats missing and can foster whatever is needed to make up the lackIf youre feeling flustered and irritated try to bring in a little gentleness and contentmentWhen youre lazy rev up your sense of the dangers of being unskillful and complacentIts not just a matter of piling on more and more mindfulnessYouve got to add other qualities as wellFirst youre mindful enough to stitch things together to keep the basic issues of your meditation in mind and to observe things over timeThen you try to noticethats alertnessto see what else to stir into the potIts like cookingWhen you dont like the taste of the soup youre fixing you dont just add more and more saltSometimes you add onion sometimes garlic sometimes oreganowhatever you sense is neededJust keep in mind the fact that youve got a whole spice shelf to work withAnd remember that your cooking has a purposeIn the map of the path right mindfulness isnt the end pointIts supposed to lead to right concentrationWere often told that mindfulness and concentration are two separate forms of meditation but the Buddha never made a clear division between the twoIn his teachings mindfulness shades into concentration concentration forms the basis for even better mindfulnessThe four establishings of mindfulness are also the themes of concentrationThe highest level of concentration is where mindfulness becomes pureAs Ajaan Lee a Thai Forest master once noted mindfulness combined with ardency turns into the concentration factor called vitakka or directed thought where you keep your thoughts consistently focused on one thingAlertness combined with ardency turns into another concentration factor vicara or evaluation You evaluate whats going on with the breathIs it comfortableIf it is stick with itIf its not what can you do to make it more comfortableTry making it a little bit longer a little bit shorter deeper more shallow faster slowerSee what happensWhen youve found a way of breathing that nourishes a sense of fullness and refreshment you can spread that fullness throughout the bodyLearn how to relate to the breath in a way that nourishes a good energy flow throughout the bodyWhen things feel refreshing like this you can easily settle downYou may have picked up the idea that you should never fiddle with the breath that you should just take it as it comesYet meditation isnt just a passive process of being nonjudgmentally present with whatevers there and not changing it at allMindfulness keeps stitching things together over time but it also keeps in mind the idea that theres a path to develop and getting the mind to settle down is a skillful part of that pathThis is why evaluationjudging the best way to maximize the pleasure of the breathis essential to the practiceIn other words you dont abandon your powers of judgment as you develop mindfulnessYou simply train them to be less judgmental and more judicious so that they yield tangible resultsWhen the breath gets really full and refreshing throughout the body you can drop the evaluation and simply be one with the breathThis sense of oneness is also sometimes called mindfulness in a literal sense mindfullness a sense of oneness pervading the entire range of your awarenessYoure at one with whatever you focus on at one with whatever you doTheres no separate you at allThis is the type of mindfulness thats easy to confuse with Awakening because it can seem so liberating but in the Buddhas vocabulary its neither mindfulness nor AwakeningIts cetaso ekodibhava unification of awarenessa factor of concentration present in every level from the second jhana up through the infinitude of consciousnessSo its not even the ultimate in concentration much less AwakeningWhich means that theres still more to doThis is where mindfulness alertness and ardency keep digging awayMindfulness reminds you that no matter how wonderful this sense of oneness you still havent solved the problem of sufferingAlertness tries to focus on what the mind is still doing in that state of onenesswhat subterranean choices youre making to keep that sense of oneness going what subtle levels of stress those choices are causingwhile ardency tries to find a way to drop even those subtle choices so as to be rid of that stressSo even this sense of oneness is a means to a higher endYou bring the mind to a solid state of oneness so as to drop your normal ways of dividing up experience into me vsnotme but you dont stop thereYou then take that oneness and keep subjecting it to all the factors of right mindfulnessThats when really valuable things begin to separate out on their ownAjaan Lee uses the image of ore in a rockStaying with the sense of oneness is like being content simply with the knowledge that theres tin silver and gold in your rock If thats all you do youll never get any use from themBut if you heat the rock to the melting points for the different metals theyll separate out on their ownLiberating insight comes from testing experimentingThis is how we learn about the world to begin withIf we werent active creatures wed have no understanding of the world at allThings would pass by pass by and we wouldnt know how they were connected because wed have no way of influencing them to see which effects came from changing which causesIts because we act in the world that we understand the worldThe same holds true with the mindYou cant just sit around hoping that a single mental qualitymindfulness acceptance contentment onenessis going to do all the workIf you want to learn about the potentials of the mind you have to be willing to playwith sensations in the body with qualities in the mindThats when you come to understand cause and effectAnd that requires all your powers of intelligenceand this doesnt mean just book intelligenceIt means your ability to notice what youre doing to read the results of what youve done and to figure out ingenious ways of doing things that cause less and less suffering and stress street smarts for the noble pathMindfulness allows you to see these connections because it keeps reminding you always to stay with these issues to stay with the causes until you see their effectsBut mindfulness alone cant do all the workYou cant fix the soup simply by dumping more pepper into itYou add other ingredients as theyre neededThis is why its best not to load the word mindfulness with too many meanings or to assign it too many functionsOtherwise you cant clearly discern when a quality like contentment is useful and when its not when you need to bring things to oneness and when you need to take things apartSo keep the spices on your shelf clearly labeled and learn through practice which spice is good for which purposeOnly then can you develop your full potential as a cookHe showed me the brightness of the worldThats how my teacher Ajaan Fuang once characterized his debt to his teacher Ajaan LeeHis words took me by surpriseI had only recently come to study with him still fresh from a school where I had learned that serious Buddhists took a negative pessimistic view of the worldYet here was a man who had given his life to the practice of the Buddhas teachings speaking of the worlds brightnessOf course by brightness he wasnt referring to the joys of the arts food travel sports family life or any of the other sections of the Sunday newspaperHe was talking about a deeper happiness that comes from withinAs I came to know him I gained a sense of how deeply happy he wasHe may have been skeptical about a lot of human pretenses but I would never describe him as negative or pessimisticRealistic would be closer to the truthYet for a long time I couldnt shake the sense of paradox I felt over how the pessimism of the Buddhist texts could find embodiment in such a solidly happy personOnly when I began to look directly at the early texts did I realize that what I thought was a paradox was actually an irony  the irony of how Buddhism which gives such a positive view of a human beings potential for finding true happiness could be branded in the West as negative and pessimisticYouve probably heard the rumor that Life is suffering is Buddhisms first principle the Buddhas first noble truthIts a rumor with good credentials spread by wellrespected academics and Dharma teachers alike but a rumor nonethelessThe truth about the noble truths is far more interestingThe Buddha taught four truths  not one  about life There is suffering there is a cause for suffering there is an end of suffering and there is a path of practice that puts an end to sufferingThese truths taken as a whole are far from pessimisticTheyre a practical problemsolving approach  the way a doctor approaches an illness or a mechanic a faulty engineYou identify a problem and look for its causeYou then put an end to the problem by eliminating the causeWhats special about the Buddhas approach is that the problem he attacks is the whole of human suffering and the solution he offers is something human beings can do for themselvesJust as a doctor with a surefire cure for measles isnt afraid of measles the Buddha isnt afraid of any aspect of human sufferingAnd having experienced a happiness totally unconditional hes not afraid to point out the suffering and stress inherent in places where most of us would rather not see it  in the conditioned pleasures we cling toHe teaches us not to deny that suffering and stress or to run away from it but to stand still and face up to it to examine it carefullyThat way  by understanding it  we can ferret out its cause and put an end to itTotallyHow confident can you getA fair number of writers have pointed out the basic confidence inherent in the four noble truths and yet the rumor of Buddhisms pessimism persistsI wonder whyOne possible explanation is that in coming to Buddhism we subconsciously expect it to address issues that have a long history in our own cultureBy starting out with suffering as his first truth the Buddha seems to be offering his position on a question with a long history in the West is the world basically good or badAccording to Genesis this was the first question that occurred to God after he had finished his creation had he done a good jobHe then looked at the world and saw that it was goodEver since then people in the West have sided with or against God on his answer but in doing so they have affirmed that the question was worth asking to begin withWhen Theravada  the only form of Buddhism to take on Christianity when Europe colonized Asia  was looking for ways to head off what it saw as the missionary menace Buddhists who had received their education from the missionaries assumed that the question was valid and pressed the first noble truth into service as a refutation of the Christian God look at how miserable life is they said and its hard to accept Gods verdict on his handiworkThis debating strategy may have scored a few points at the time and its easy to find Buddhist apologists who  still living in the colonial past  keep trying to score the same pointsThe real issue though is whether the Buddha intended his first noble truth to answer Gods question in the first place and  more importantly  whether were getting the most out of the first noble truth if we see it in that lightIts hard to imagine what you could accomplish by saying that life is sufferingYoud have to spend your time arguing with people who see more than just suffering in lifeThe Buddha himself says as much in one of his discoursesA brahman named Longnails comes to him and announces that he doesnt approve of anythingThis would have been a perfect time for the Buddha if he had wanted to chime in with the truth that life is sufferingInstead he attacks the whole notion of taking a stand on whether life is worthy of approvalThere are three possible answers to this question he says nothing is worthy of approval everything is and some things are and some things arentIf you take any of these three positions you end up arguing with the people who take either of the other two positionsAnd where does that get youThe Buddha then teaches Longnails to look at his body and feelings as instances of the first noble truth theyre stressful inconstant and dont deserve to be clung to as selfLongnails follows the Buddhas instructions and in letting go of his attachment to body and feelings gains his first glimpse of the Deathless of what its like to be totally free from sufferingThe point of this story is that trying to answer Gods question passing judgment on the world is a waste of timeAnd it offers a better use for the first noble truth looking at things not in terms of world or life but simply identifying suffering so that you can comprehend it let it go and attain releaseRather than asking us to make a blanket judgment  which in effect would be asking us to be blind partisans  the first noble truth asks us to look and see precisely where the problem of suffering liesOther discourses show that the problem isnt with body and feelings in and of themselvesThey themselves arent sufferingThe suffering lies in clinging to themIn his definition of the first noble truth the Buddha summarizes all types of suffering under the phrase the five aggregates of clinging clinging to physical form feelings perceptions thought constructs and consciousnessHowever when the five aggregates are free from clinging he tells us they lead to longterm benefit and happinessSo the first noble truth simply put is that clinging is sufferingIts because of clinging that physical pain becomes mental painIts because of clinging that aging illness and death cause mental distressThe paradox here is that in clinging to things we dont trap them or get them under our controlInstead we trap ourselvesWhen we realize our captivity we naturally search for a way outAnd this is where its so important that the first noble truth not say that Life is suffering If life were suffering where would we look for an end to sufferingWed be left with nothing but death and annihilationBut when the actual truth is that clinging is suffering we simply have to look for the clinging and eliminate its causesThis process takes time though because we cant simply tell the mind not to clingIts like a disobedient child if you force it to let go while youre looking itll search for a blind spot where you cant see it and will start to cling thereIn fact the minds major blind spot  ignorance  is the prime cause that gives rise to clingings proximate cause cravingSo as the fourth noble truth the Buddha recommends a path of practice to get rid of the blind spotThe path has eight factors right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationIn a more abbreviated form the Buddhas term for the practice is abandoning and developing abandoning activities that hinder awareness and developing qualities that expand its clarity and rangeThe abandoning  in which you refrain from unskillful thoughts words and deeds inspired by craving  is obviously an antidote to clingingThe developing though plays a more paradoxical role for you have to hold to the skillful qualities of mindfulness concentration and discernment that foster awareness until theyre fully matureOnly then can you let them goIts like climbing a ladder to get on a roof you grab hold of a higher rung so that you can let go of a lower rung and then grab onto a rung still higherAs the rungs get further off the ground your view gets more expansive and you can see precisely where the minds clingings areYou get a sharper sense of which parts of experience belong to which noble truth and what should be done with them the parts that are suffering should be comprehended the parts that cause suffering should be abandoned the parts that form the path to the end of suffering should be further developed and the parts that belong to the end of suffering should be verifiedThis helps you get higher and higher on the ladder until you find yourself securely on the roofThats when you can finally let go of the ladder and be totally freeSo the real question we face is not Gods question passing judgment on how skillfully he created life or the worldIts our question how skillfully are we handling the raw stuff of lifeAre we clinging in ways that serve only to continue the round of suffering or are we learning to hold to the ladderlike qualities that will eliminate craving and ignorance so that we can grow up and not have to clingIf we negotiate life armed with all four noble truths realizing that life contains both suffering and an end to suffering theres hope hope that well be able to sort out which parts of life belong to which truth hope that someday in this life well discover the brightness at the point where we can agree with the Buddha OhYesThis is the end of suffering and stressKarma is one of those words we dont translateIts basic meaning is simple enough  action  but because of the weight the Buddhas teachings give to the role of action the Sanskrit word karma packs in so many implications that the English word action cant carry all its luggageThis is why weve simply airlifted the original word into our vocabularyBut when we try unpacking the connotations the word carries now that it has arrived in everyday usage we find that most of its luggage has gotten mixed up in transitIn the eyes of most Americans karma functions like fate  bad fate at that an inexplicable unchangeable force coming out of our past for which we are somehow vaguely responsible and powerless to fightI guess its just my karma Ive heard people sigh when bad fortune strikes with such force that they see no alternative to resigned acceptanceThe fatalism implicit in this statement is one reason why so many of us are repelled by the concept of karma for it sounds like the kind of callous mythmaking that can justify almost any kind of suffering or injustice in the status quo If hes poor its because of his karma If shes been raped its because of her karma From this it seems a short step to saying that he or she deserves to suffer and so doesnt deserve our helpThis misperception comes from the fact that the Buddhist concept of karma came to the West at the same time as nonBuddhist concepts and so ended up with some of their luggageAlthough many Asian concepts of karma are fatalistic the early Buddhist concept was not fatalistic at allIn fact if we look closely at early Buddhist ideas of karma well find that they give even less importance to myths about the past than most modern Americans doFor the early Buddhists karma was nonlinear and complexOther Indian schools believed that karma operated in a simple straight line with actions from the past influencing the present and present actions influencing the futureAs a result they saw little room for free willBuddhists however saw that karma acts in multiple feedback loops with the present moment being shaped both by past and by present actions present actions shape not only the future but also the presentFurthermore present actions need not be determined by past actionsIn other words there is free will although its range is somewhat dictated by the pastThe nature of this freedom is symbolized in an image used by the early Buddhists flowing waterSometimes the flow from the past is so strong that little can be done except to stand fast but there are also times when the flow is gentle enough to be diverted in almost any directionSo instead of promoting resigned powerlessness the early Buddhist notion of karma focused on the liberating potential of what the mind is doing with every momentWho you are  what you come from  is not anywhere near as important as the minds motives for what it is doing right nowEven though the past may account for many of the inequalities we see in life our measure as human beings is not the hand weve been dealt for that hand can change at any momentWe take our own measure by how well we play the hand weve gotIf youre suffering you try not to continue the unskillful mental habits that would keep that particular karmic feedback goingIf you see that other people are suffering and youre in a position to help you focus not on their karmic past but your karmic opportunity in the present Someday you may find yourself in the same predicament that theyre in now so heres your opportunity to act in the way youd like them to act toward you when that day comesThis belief that ones dignity is measured not by ones past but by ones present actions flew right in the face of the Indian traditions of castebased hierarchies and explains why early Buddhists had such a field day poking fun at the pretensions and mythology of the brahmansAs the Buddha pointed out a brahman could be a superior person not because he came out of a brahman womb but only if he acted with truly skillful intentionsWe read the early Buddhist attacks on the caste system and aside from their antiracist implications they often strike us as quaintWhat we fail to realize is that they strike right at the heart of our myths about our own past our obsession with defining who we are in terms of where we come from  our race ethnic heritage gender socioeconomic background sexual preference  our modern tribesWe put inordinate amounts of energy into creating and maintaining the mythology of our tribe so that we can take vicarious pride in our tribes good nameEven when we become Buddhists the tribe comes firstWe demand a Buddhism that honors our mythsFrom the standpoint of karma though where we come from is old karma over which we have no controlWhat we are is a nebulous concept at best  and pernicious at worst when we use it to find excuses for acting on unskillful motivesThe worth of a tribe lies only in the skillful actions of its individual membersEven when those good people belong to our tribe their good karma is theirs not oursAnd of course every tribe has its bad members which means that the mythology of the tribe is a fragile thingTo hang onto anything fragile requires a large investment of passion aversion and delusion leading inevitably to more unskillful actions on into the futureSo the Buddhist teachings on karma far from being a quaint relic from the past are a direct challenge to a basic thrust  and basic flaw  in our cultureOnly when we abandon our obsession with finding vicarious pride in our tribal past and can take actual pride in the motives that underlie our present actions can we say that the word karma in its Buddhist sense has recovered its luggageAnd when we open the luggage well find that its brought us a gift the gift we give ourselves and one another when we drop our myths about who we are and can instead be honest about what were doing with each moment  at the same time making the effort to do it rightMany people who dont know much about old Buddhist texts often know one passage from the Pali Canon the part of the Kalama Sutta stating that old texts cant be trustedQuotes from this passage come in many shapes and sizesSome of them are short sound bites like the message that was rubberstamped on the envelope of a letter I once received The BuddhaTheres also the desktop wallpaper The BuddhaEven scholarly citations of the sutta give the same messageHeres the entire quote from the sutta in a recent book The BuddhaTaken together these quotes justify our tendency to pick what we like from the old texts and throw the rest awayNo need to understand the larger context of the dhamma they teach the Buddha seems to be sayingYoure better off rolling your ownBut if you look at the entire passage in the Kalama Sutta you discover that these quotes give only part of the pictureThe Buddhas skepticism toward reliable authorities extends inside as well as outNotice the words in bold face the ones that usually get dropped from the quote or sloughed over when theyre includedWhen the Buddha says that you cant go by logical deduction inference or analogies hes saying that you cant always trust your sense of reasonWhen he says that you cant go by agreement through pondering views or by probability hes saying that you cant always trust your common senseAnd of course you cant always trust teachers scriptures or traditionsSo where can you place your trustYou have to put things to the test in your own thoughts words and deeds to see what actually leads to suffering and what leads to its endWhen you know for yourselves that These dhammas are unskillful these dhammas are blameworthy these dhammas are criticized by the wise these dhammas when adopted  carried out lead to harm  to suffering  then you should abandon themWhen you know for yourselves that These dhammas are skillful these dhammas are blameless these dhammas are praised by the wise these dhammas when adopted  carried out lead to welfare  to happiness  then you should enter  remain in themThe word dhamma in these passages means three things in one teaching mental quality and actionTeachings are naturally related to the mind states and actions they inspire so they should be judged by the results they give when put into actionTrue dhamma is what works in leading to genuine wellbeingFalse dhamma is what doesntBut even when judging the results of your own actions you cant simply take your own ideas of what works as a trustworthy standardAfter all you can easily side with your greed aversion or delusion setting your standards too lowSo to check against this tendency the Buddha recommends that you also take into consideration the views of the wise for youll never grow until you allow your standards to be challenged by theirsNow if youre expecting quick access to a totally reliable authority this may sound like a catch If youre not wise enough to trust your own judgment how can you recognize whos really wiseBut its not a catchIts simply the way we have to operate when developing any kind of skill  your appreciation of good carpentry for example grows as you master carpentry yourself  and the Buddha is making the point that this is how to approach the dhamma as a skill to be masteredAs with any skill your inner sensitivity and assurance as to whos truly wise in the skill grows only through your willingness to learnIn giving advice on how to learn this skill the Buddha is speaking not with the authority of your creator who can tell you what you have to believe but with the authority of an expert in his field one who knows from experience what does and doesnt workIf you want to learn from him youre wise to accept his observations on how its best doneThe first thing to recognize is that there are others who have mastered the skill before you and that they have some important things to teachAmong the things theyll teach you of course is what theyve learned from the wise before them going back to the BuddhaSome of this knowledge can be passed on in words but in a list of the qualities to look for in the wise  and to learn from them  the Buddha shows that theres more to wisdom than just wordsA person worthy of respect he says at AN should have a sense of seven things the dhamma its meaning oneself enough the right time and place social gatherings and how to judge individual peopleWhats striking about this list is that only the first two qualities deal with verbal knowledgeHaving a sense of the dhamma means knowing what the Buddha did and didnt say having a sense of meaning means knowing how to explain the dhammas difficult concepts and ideas the general principles that express its values and the basic techniques for implementing themThese are things we can pick up from dhamma talks and booksBut the Buddha didnt teach a onesizefitsallineverysituation techniqueEven his seemingly abstract principles are meant for particular stages in the trainingNotself for example is useful in some instances and harmful in othersThis is why the Buddha added the last five members of the list the sensitivities that turn the techniques and principles into genuine skillsHaving a sense of oneself means knowing your strengths and weaknesses in terms of conviction virtue learning generosity discernment and quickwittednessIn other words you know which qualities are important to focus on and can assess objectively where you still have more work to doHaving a sense of enough applies primarily to your use of the requisites of life  food clothing shelter and medicine  but it can also apply to intangibles such as when you need less desire effort concentration or thinking in your practice and when you need moreHaving a sense of time means knowing when to listen when to memorize what youve heard when to ask questions and when to go off into seclusion and practice on your ownHaving a sense of social gatherings means knowing how to speak and behave with people from different backgrounds and classes of societyHaving a sense of individuals means knowing how to judge which people are worthy of emulation in their pursuit of the dhamma and which ones are notEven though we can talk about these last five qualities we cant embody them through wordsTheyre habits and the only way to pick up good habits is by being around good examples people whove already been trained to embody these qualities in the way they liveThis is why the Buddha  in trying to establish the dhamma for future generations  didnt just leave a body of teachingsHe also set up the monastic sangha and organized it to carry on the tradition of all seven of these qualities his habits as well as his wordsTo ensure that the standard of the dhamma would last over time he first made it clear that he didnt want anyone tampering with his teachingsMonks these two slander the TathagataWhich twoOne who explains what was not said or spoken by the Tathagata as said or spoken by the TathagataAnd one who explains what was said or spoken by the Tathagata as not said or spoken by the TathagataThese are the two who slander the TathagataIts easy to understand why the Buddha phrased this so stronglyHe had chosen his words with great care and wanted the same level of care in those who quoted himFidelity in his eyes was an act of compassionHe intended his words to be taken as a standard for what was and wasnt dhamma  anything consistent with his words was to be accepted as dhamma anything inconsistent to be rejected as not  so its only natural that hed warn his followers not to muddy the standardOtherwise later generations would have no trustworthy guide in their search to end sufferingSo in addition to establishing principles for determining what he did and didnt teach he also set up protocols for how the sangha should settle disagreements on this issue when they aroseTo ensure that the meaning of the dhamma would be passed on he established the principle that teachers should be open to questioningHe didnt want them to engage in what he called bombast empty words the work of poets the work of outsiders artful in sound artful in expression He encouraged his students to focus on teaching the end of suffering and to encourage their students to dissect those teachings to make their meaning clearUnderstanding occurs best when theres an opportunity for an open dialogue in good faithTo transmit the habits of the dhamma the Buddha designed the ideal teacherstudent relationship on the model of an apprenticeshipYou live with the teacher for a minimum of five years attending to the teachers needs as a way of observing  and being observed by  the teacher in all sorts of situationsTo allow for the fact that your sense of judgment develops over time the Buddha didnt force you to commit to a teacher for lifeYou look for someone who as far as you can see has integrity but if you sense with time that integrity is lacking youre free to look for a new teacherAt the same time the Buddha realized that not everyone would have the time or inclination to undergo this apprenticeship so he arranged a division of laborThe monks and nuns who had passed through apprenticeship were to live not in cloisters but in places where lay people would be free to come and learn from the fruits of their trainingSo its obvious that the Buddha didnt have a casual or cavalier attitude toward the preservation of his words and habitsKnowing the difficulties hed encountered in discovering the dhamma he didnt trust us  with our greed aversion and delusion  to discover it on our ownHe knew wed need helpAlthough he foresaw that his teachings would someday disappear he didnt simply resign himself to change or trust that it would always work out for the bestHe established a wide range of safeguards to ensure that reliable words and models of behavior would survive as long as possibleBut in the cutandpaste Buddhism developing around us in the West many of these safeguards have been droppedIn particular the idea of apprenticeship  so central in mastering the habits of the dhamma as a skill  is almost totally lackingDhamma principles are reduced to vague generalities and the techniques for testing them are stripped to a bare assemblyline minimumWe reassure ourselves that the changes weve made in Buddhism are all for the best  that Buddhism has always adapted itself to every culture it enters and we can trust it to adapt wisely to the WestBut this treats Buddhism as if it were a conscious agent  a wise amoebic force that knows how to adapt to its environment in order to surviveActually Buddhism isnt an agent and it doesnt adaptIt gets adapted  sometimes by people who know what theyre doing sometimes by people who dontJust because a particular adaptation survives and prevails doesnt mean that its genuine dhammaIt may simply appeal to the desires and fears of its target audienceCertainly we in the West are easy targets for the idea that the Buddha wants us to cut and paste his dhamma as we likeMany of us have been burned by religious authorities and we dont want to risk getting burned againTheres also our cultural pride We like to think that we can see more clearly than Asian Buddhist whats of genuine value in their traditions and whats simply cultural baggage  as if we didnt have cultural baggage of our ownAnd how do we know whats just baggageA beatup old suitcase might contain your jewelry and keysSo is a designer dhamma what we really wantAs the Buddha noted one of the natural reactions to suffering is to search for someone who can give good advice on how to put an end to itWhen offered the choice wouldnt you prefer reliable guidance on how to end your suffering rather than a doityourself kit with vague instructions and no guaranteesOr are there those who would benefit if you bought the kitPeople sometimes argue that in our diverse postmodern world we need a postmodern Buddhism in which no ones interpretation can be criticized as wrongBut thats trading the possibility of total freedom from suffering for something much less freedom from criticismAnd it ignores the other side of the postmodernist equation that our perceived wants can be overwhelmingly shaped by the interests of institutions who want something out of usOne of the common ruses of privatization is to offer us less dress it up as more so that well pay more for itIs that whats happening hereThe Buddha wasnt so nave as to think that we can always know whats in our own best interestHe saw long before the postmoderns that theres plenty to mistrust both in old texts and in our own preconceptions about what seems reasonableYet he did the postmoderns one better by offering a solution to this dilemmaIt would be a shame if sold on the idea of designing our own dhamma we let his solution dieAvijja the Pali word for ignorance is the opposite of vijja which means not only knowledge but also skill  as in the skills of a doctor or animaltrainerSo when the Buddha focuses on the ignorance that causes stress and suffering saying that people suffer from not knowing the four noble truths hes not simply saying that they lack information or direct knowledge of those truthsHes also saying that they lack skill in handling themThey suffer because they dont know what theyre doingThe four truths are stress  which covers everything from the slightest tension to outandout agony the cause of stress the cessation of stress and the path of practice leading to the cessation of stressWhen the Buddha first taught these truths he also taught that his full Awakening came from knowing them on three levels identifying them knowing the skill appropriate to each and knowing finally that he had fully mastered the skillsStress he identified with examples  such things as birth aging illness and death sorrow distress and despair  summarizing it as five clingingaggregates clinging to physical form to feelings of pleasure pain and neither pleasure nor pain to perception to thoughtconstructs and to sensory consciousnessThe cause of stress he identified as three kinds of craving craving for sensuality craving to take on an identity in a world of experience and craving for ones identity and world of experience to be destroyedThe cessation of stress he identified as renunciation of and release from those three kinds of cravingAnd the path to the cessation of stress he identified as right concentration together with seven supporting factors right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort and right mindfulnessThese four truths are not simply facts about stressThey are categories for framing your experience so that you can diagnose and cure the problem of stressInstead of looking at experience in terms of self or other for instance or in terms of what you like and dislike you look at it in terms of where theres stress whats causing it and how to put an end to the causeOnce you can divide the territory of experience in this way you realize that each of these categories is an activityThe word stress may be a noun but the experience of stress is shaped by your intentionsIts something you doThe same holds true with other truths tooSeeing this you can work on perfecting the skill appropriate for each activityThe skill with regard to stress is to comprehend it to the point where you have no more passion aversion or delusion toward doing itTo perfect this skill you also have to abandon the cause of stress to realize its cessation and to develop the path to its cessationEach of these skills assists the othersFor example when states of concentration arise in the mind you dont just watch them arise and pass awayConcentration is part of the path so the appropriate skill is to try to develop it to understand what will make it grow more steady more solid more subtleIn doing this you develop the other factors of the path as well until the doing of your concentration is more like simply being being a luminous awareness being present being nothing being one with emptinessFrom that perspective you begin to comprehend levels of stress you never noticed beforeAs you abandon the cravings causing the grosser levels you become sensitive to subtler ones so you can abandon them tooYou see more and more clearly why youve suffered from stress You didnt grasp the connection between the cravings you enjoyed and the stress that burdened you and didnt detect the stress in the activities you enjoyedUltimately when youve abandoned the causes for other forms of stress you begin to see that the being of your concentration contains many layers of doing as well  more layers of stressThats when you can abandon any craving for these activities and full Awakening occursThe path to this Awakening is necessarily gradual both because the sensitivity it requires takes time to develop and because it involves developing skills that you abandon only when theyve done their jobIf you abandoned craving for concentration before developing it youd never get the mind into a position where it could genuinely and fully let go of the subtlest forms of doingBut as your skills converge the Awakening they foster is suddenThe Buddhas image is of the continental shelf off the coast of India a gradual slope followed by a sudden dropoffAfter the dropoff no trace of mental stress remainsThats when you know youve mastered your skillsAnd thats when you really know the four noble truthsCraving for instance is something you experience every day but until you totally abandon it you dont really know itYou can experience stress for years on end but you dont really know stress until youve comprehended it to the point where passion aversion and delusion are goneAnd even though all four skills as youre developing them bring a greater sense of awareness and ease you dont really know why theyre so important until youve tasted where their full mastery can leadFor even full knowledge of the four noble truths is not an end in and of itselfIts a means to something much greater Nirvana is found at the end of stress but its much more than thatIts total liberation from all constraints of time or place existence or nonexistence  beyond all activity even the activity of the cessation of stressAs the Buddha once said the knowledge he gained in Awakening was like all the leaves in the forest the knowledge he imparted about the four noble truths was like a handful of leavesHe restricted himself to teaching the handful because thats all he needed to lead his students to their own knowledge of the whole forestIf he were to discuss other aspects of his Awakening it would have served no purpose and actually gotten in the waySo even though full knowledge of the four noble truths  to use another analogy  is just the raft across the river you need to focus full attention on the raft while youre making your way acrossNot only does this knowledge get you to full Awakening but it also helps you judge any realizations along the way
