limitMay all vajra holders also bless you Speak wellThey renounce happiness after already renouncing suffering Because both mental happiness and mental displeasure decline there is neither happiness nor sufferingHis intention pledged he said So long as I have not found an undefiled state I shall not uncross my legslikewise they do not consider whether the ears nose tongue body and mental faculty are entities or nonentitiesUnstable and fleeting they move like the windSubhūti do you think that the real nature of physical forms can be terminated or abandoned or does it ceaseIt contains all sorts of jewels and all manner of precious stones can be found thereand both types of feeling conjoinedMonks then the Great TopKnotted Brahmā surrounded and escorted by six million eight hundred thousand BrahmāsNoble son because they perceive such objectives the thusgone ones may praise themselvesTo him I will grant accomplishmentHer hair is soft clean and sweetly scented Black like the excellent bee and arranged in braids beings in the meditation of equanimityWhat is skill in gaining certainty concerning phenomena It is the inexpressibility of all phenomenaWith the second third enthrallment is achievedDo not take the lives of living beingsNoble son in the past that is what I heard from the Tathāgata the arhat the Samyaksaṃbuddha PadmottamaSimilarly physical forms have been taught without apprehending anythingYoung brahmins listenPāpīyān moreover when a bodhisattva with superior intent dons the great armor for the sake of liberating all beings such a bodhisattva will have set out with superior intentThe fivepronged vajra is the five gnosesIn each mansion were emanated  goddessesOh What is the use of practicing the vinaya of individual liberation ethical discipline and good conductAll those beings in all their lifetimes became renunciants with those sixteen gazed upon them and heard the Dharma from themHe is called the one who sends light rays equally to all sentient beings in a limitless manner through his love care and great compassionWhy is it the knowledge of those who have reached happiness Because it is the cessation of all distressHe gave him a jewel of great valueThe whole of The Chapter on Going Forththerefore it is called appropriating desireit is devoid of concepts it is devoid of creationFacing Directly Going Far ImmovableAs soon as he cried out the guardians of hell lifted their maces and clubbed him on the headMay we also obtain the prophecy of our attainment of the highest complete enlightenmenttMoreover not only should one keep the resolve not to have harsh or angry feelings toward such beings one should have an attitude of loving kindness for them as welland are reborn among godsVenerable Lord if the notion of the eyes as arising is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of the eyes as ceasing become a bodhisattvaVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is emptinessThe gods then said to the Blessed Onehe can prevent that first arrow from falling to the ground as long as he wishesThey had listened to the Bodhisattvas words and had prepared to make offerings to him Now they hurried quickly to the city of Kapilavastunoble son I cannot calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvaras accumulation of meritshe thought Now I shall by all means make him act according to my desire I shall seduce himThis universe of a thousand million worlds shook in six ways it trembledFearlessly use words that are like echoes And that are analogous to dreams Their downpour of flowers covered the wide earth up to knee heightand then perfect the pristine cognition of omniscience are endowed with that cognitionThat has four corners four doorsYoung man when bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have great compassion andTen thousand million devas Who were residing in the skyI have today saved them all And therefore today I am perfectly happyI saw the form of a very attractive woman together with pleasure groves filled with a thousand peopleHe replied This is owing to the absence of attachment and absence of obstruction with respect to all knowledgeI request that the Bhagavān teach I request that the Sugata teachJust as their love extends to one being so does it reach all others pervading throughout all the realms of sentient beingsTake these ornaments and my horse Kaṇṭhaka and return to the palacePristine One purified by Brahmā Master of all forms of knowledge Delighter of beings king of physicians Healer of all worldsāriputra the tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas who in the future will appear in countless innumerable worlds in the ten directionsHe demonstrated the method of subsisting on A single berry sesame seed or rice grainThey say I have understood these teachings with my own intelligence I teach them to you in this way because I am compassionateNoble son you may wonder about the character of the bodhisattvas excellent power of not being subjugatedso in this Great Vehicle also coming going and abiding are not discernibleThe ThusGone One replied I am a worthy one of the world I am the unsurpassed teacherWithout dedicating these roots of virtue to the level of the śrāvakas or to the level of the pratyekabuddhas they master all these roots of virtue andYou will honor many millions of buddhas You will accomplish powerful conduct It is possessed by the sons of the buddhas It is the path taught for those who seek enlightenmentThe demons cannot conquer him For those of skillful means he is the measure of timeany thought of noncomposure and any thought of stupidityIf separated from you I will perishI will eat all the food Even what is mixed with the five impure foodsthey do not speak harshlyOut of compassion for the two brothersThere is no such field of activity among the tathāgatas let alone among the bodhisattvasDesire can never cause harm To the bodhisattvas who possess this samādhiguard protect look after and bring peace and wellbeing to the realms of the great trichiliocosmIt is as follows Mañjuśrī if all sentient beings included in the three world spheres were to be born in the hells or as animals or as pretas in the world of YamaVenerables I shall remain right hereThe transcendent perfection of generosity has the defining characteristic of renunciationThis Dharma has been discovered today By one who renounces all mad carelessnessThen the bodhisattva mahāsattva Akṣayamati took from around his own neck a long necklace of pearls of the value of a hundred thousand silver coinsThere were also countless bodhisattva mahāsattvas who possessed the Dharmaāradvatīputra just as the notion of an illusory person engaging in the emptiness of internal phenomena is without foundationāradvatīputra do you think that the eyes constitute a bodhisattvaKāśyapa the Dharma is taught in this wayThey will hear where they are the beautiful songs Of cuckoos peacocks and avadavats Partridges and other birds Living in the mountains or in cavesin the same way Venerable Lord the transcendent perfection of wisdom also acts according to the objective for which it is emanated but all the doorways to their rebirth in lower existences are closed  it is not difficult for them to be reborn in the paradise of BrahmāThe Buddha declared In the same way āriputraSome replied As a human in the form of a young brahminThat is how the element of consciousness experiences nonmeritand the utterly unborn on the ultimate level is also ultimately the same as viewsTeach the Dharma that we requestThis is not the level of the numerous śrāvakas When you have attained this level of peaceYet until I attain awakening so hard to find even through many eonsAgain they will be incinerated by an inferno and having been incinerated they will pass awayHaving submerged him face down in waterAccomplish your own good qualities And have equanimity toward the conduct of others Here I attained the absorption of pristine mindfulness And struck down with a strong blow of the sword of knowledge The enemies of conceptual mind and actions And the hostile way they reinforce existenceFor example Subhūti space is neither apprehensible nor is it not apprehensibleThe palaces are to be painted With red ocher or sindhuraAlas The transcendent perfection of wisdom is flaccid insignificant and pointlessNaravīrā and so forthWhen the Bodhisattva knew that they were settled he taught them a Dharma teaching and instructed them inspired them and delighted themShe entered homelessness in all their teachings And obtained the supreme peace of this samādhi To this the response came This is not a worthy place for these people are malicious and violentif they do not understand the limitations of perception they have not been favored by the transcendent perfection of generositythe features of awakened body speech and mindpeople continued to remark on how my previously beautiful complexion had disappearedThe entire army of Māra was felled in a confrontationfocusing on the notion that senses are illusory and grant their gifts without apprehending the giver the gift and the recipientthose beings would not become liberated through those dharmasOne should visualize ones own bodyknow accurately the motivation conduct and thoughts of other beings and individualsIt is our wish that we turn back todayIf you ask what are the four formless meditative absorptionsall the sentient beings in Jambūdvīpa think Here there is not a cloudthey do not consider whether these are permanent or impermanent imbued with happiness or suffering a self or not a self empty or not empty with signs or signless having aspirations or lacking aspirations calm or not calm void or not afflicted or purified arising or ceasing and entities or nonentitiesthen Venerable Lord how do great bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections andVenerable Lord This sacred doctrine is compatible with all thingsnor with any of the other fruits up to and including that of the level of the pratyekabuddhasThis will have a longlasting purpose and bring you benefit and happinessThey remain within the four noble families The wise ones are neither hypocritical nor boastfulSenior Subhūti then said to the Blessed Onefulfilled the wishes of those who had aspirations and never abandoned those who came to him for refugeLikewise though it is seen in a pool The moon never enters any waterWith regard to these and all the other sensory elements up to and including the sensory element of the mental faculty the sensory element of mental phenomena and the sensory element of mental consciousnessIn the same way they dispense generosity toward human beings and likewise they dispense generosity toward nonhuman beingsWhat is not forsaking the solitary life It is not abandoning dedication to good actions and delighting in residing in a remote placeThe foolish conceptualize Through consciousness and perceptionand thought So those rogues have come hereMoreover āradvatīputra the bodhisattvas who apprehend the transcendent perfections without attention endowed with omniscienceHowever on the relative level the vinaya of the bodhisattva great beings gathers all accumulations of roots of virtue comforts all beings and tames them by taking birth in the three realmsLike lions they are unafraid fearless and undisturbedThis is false viewdivide the alms setting aside one fourth for those who maintain pure conduct another fourth for those who suffer another fourth for those who have fallen into error and the final fourth for themselvesthe sense field of neither perception nor nonperception has been completely transcended in all respects andWhoever possesses this sūtra after my nirvāṇa Will become a friend for beingshave served many hundred thousand quintillions of buddhasEven if the beings governed by them are critical gossip or speak inappropriatelyThere is nothing but fixation There is nothing at all that can be apprehended in terms of inherent existencethese are specific phenomena these are nonspecific phenomenaWhen Vimalakīrti had spoken this discourse eight thousand of the gods in the company of the crown prince Mañjuśrī conceived the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenmentVimalatejā what is truly meant by the qualities of ordinary beingsThey were expert in knowing the spiritual faculties of all living beingsAnd they will never have any confusion These are the benefits from possessing this sūtraThey will be arrogant conceited wicked and reckless They will associate with sinners and be greedy for foodLikewise the lord buddhas of the future also will acquire their sacred doctrines that are equal to the unequaled after practicing this transcendent perfection of wisdomwho sees affliction as purity and who sees saṃsāric realms as the sphere of nirvāṇa will attain purification of karmic obscurationsEven if the universe were filled with fireflies They could be destroyed and eclipsed by a single sundo not habitually engage in the ways of the ten nonvirtuous actions even in their dreams let alone when they are awakenanda over the course of a hundred thousand cycles of three incalculable eons the mighty strongman Vimalatejā will fully awaken to unsurpassed and completely perfect buddhahoodWith great courage the venerable Saṅgharakṣita set out but he could see no trailThe thrones descended from the sky and came to rest in the house of the Licchavi VimalakīrtiI myself will never hurt anyone with harsh cruel insulting or defamatory words order someone to be so hurt or rejoice in anyone being so hurt The lord buddhas are endowed with coppercolored nailsand a sentient being makes a wish sentient beings will perceive corresponding words coming forth from the jewel However that great precious jewel does not form mental constructs or conceptswhen a householder living in rāvastī took a wife of equal casteNoble son such are the kiṃnaras that live thereBlessed One what food do those beings seekIn the same way āriputra a tathāgata arhat perfectly enlightened buddha has the wisdom strengths and fearlessnesses of a tathāgataBrother Rāhula alsoreceives this queen of incantations Great Upholder of the Secret Mantra andHow come this jewel parasol appeared Whose karmic result is thisIt is born of patience and gentlenessFriends behold the splendors of the universe Abhirati the Tathāgata Akṣobhya the array of his buddhafield and the splendors of these disciples and bodhisattvasThe ones who will read this sūtra Because of their compassion for beingsConsider also the analogy of someone intoxicated by liquorlikewise Mañjuśrī a bodhisattva who is skilled in this Dharma discourse dispels the afflictions of all sentient beings and thus causes the light of exalted wisdom to manifestThese childish beings are cut up like sheep on a slaughtering logThis is the conduct associated with cyclic existence butFriends for these reasons you should pay homage to the Bodhisattva and joyfully assist him in every way possibleIt becomes conscious of coming into existence there where it was attracted with that thoughtso on until there is the cessation of the great mass of sheer sufferingThis son of noble family possesses the perfect buddhas primordial wisdom complete with all adornments including the eighteen unique qualities of a buddhaNoble son thinking in such ways bodhisattvas gain knowledge of themselvesAt that point this verse was heard from the jewel canopyAt the time of this great gathering light rays shone in the great Avīci hellperceiveThe threepronged vajra signifies the three buddha bodiesThose śrāvakas both those in training and those who had passed beyond trainingIt teaches the direct cognition of phenomena and is a gateway to the absence of constructs with respect to all phenomenaand until their final rebirth great bodhisattva beings purify the negativity of others including their negativity of body their negativity of speech and their negativity of mindCountless beings developed the aspiration for attaining the result of becoming an arhatShe must be free from anger jealousy and greedyou should see that the transcendent perfection of wisdom is not endowed with the powers of the tathāgatasthe illuminator Named ālendrarājaI was told Why should we attend upon an indolent And now this The king sat and reflected thusI was that bhikṣu Yaśaḥprabha Who meditated on patience in previous livesWhen the sages looked down belowOn the third ground their minds are free of anger and ill will Hence they attain the body that is free of woundsWith a smiling and trusting face free from anger she spoke to King uddhodana in these versesThe Sage pure and stainless washes himself in the river out of love for the worldfor as long as I live seek refuge in the Buddha supreme among menthose two holy beingsHis daughters wailed and cried out Oh no father oh no fatherThen the two do not go togetherAs the sun and moon appear from behind cloudsSenior āradvatīputra the transcendent perfection of generosity is empty of the transcendent perfection of generosityneither form nor no formThey then behold other noble sons accepting becoming vessels for and teaching this profound teachingMoreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of perseveranceOne is without avarice and speaks profusely Laughs and is prone to angernanda this strong and powerful secret mantra which has been practiced for a long timeWhy is it the cessation of suffering Because it brings the elimination of desire anger and ignoranceThe reduction in the prosperity of ones family possessions and wealth the loss of facilities and having to rely on othersWhen her limbs have been sprinkled with this powder She runs her body swooning with every stepHe then said to the Blessed Oneand who relentlessly persevere until unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment is attainedThey support the severance from desires befit noble beings and are commended by the thusgone ones praised by the thusgone onesFrom the supreme realm of Sukhāvatī For this questionI asked it How do you know she is a rākṣasīMoreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections see sentient beings lacking luminosityso who will slay this bhikṣuVenerable Lord he asked with respect to what will they attain emancipation owing to their nonapprehensiontheir dharmas will not diminishthe bhagavat ikhin looked at the great gathering and began to speak of the Dharma within that assemblythose whose roots of virtue have matured to the receptive to those who have served the victorious ones in the pastPractice the roots of virtue that is the noble eightfold pathO Protector please liberate sentient beings that have attained this opportunityCome back As the householder reached out to grab at him the monk saidMañjuśrī repliedAnd at that time I was the dharmabhāṇaka Noble one what is this Have a closer look he repliedOne should say After eating this may all fevers and diseases quickly go awayas well as the element of dharmasAs for the outer perimeter It is adorned with a garland of utpalasThey will make offerings to me With bherī drums conches and mṛdaṅga drumsIt harbors no wish to harm any being is free of strife and inflicts no injury with body speech or mindsome mansions were made of flowers

may then wonder do bodhisattvas apply the remedy for dullness and how do they abandon the conditions for dullness to ariseSome arrive with eyes blazing like the fire at the end of an eon Showing the dissolution and the creationāriputra declared Bhagavān ākyamuni king of the ākyas you have fully awakened to unsurpassable completely perfect enlightenment in this Sahā world You have taught the Dharma that the whole world was reluctant to accept at the time of the degeneration of the eonSeeing this the thusgone ones wish to teach them the Dharma so that their livelihood may become pureVenerable Lord if the notion of the eyes as a self is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of the eyes as a nonself become a bodhisattvaIn the west is a hand showing the mudrā of fearlessness And in the north one draws a lotusThey will honor venerate show respect for and make offerings to buddha bhagavāns as numerous as the atoms in fifty worlds and be holders of their DharmaI rejoice in those who live in the forest Always alone and solitary like a rhinoceros Always with pureThey walk into ravines fire and desolate areas Naked they smear themselves in soil and ashesThe entire assembly also beheld throughout the ten directions numerous as the sands of the River Ganges the Lord Buddha who taught this doctrinal sūtra on the chapters of the transcendent perfection of wisdom which had been requested by the fully ordained monks āradvatīputra and Subhūti in its entirety without omitting or adding any words and syllablesThe yakṣas and rākṣasas lead him to a lion throne of divine gold and jewels upon which he sitsTherefore noble son relinquish your diligenceAlso present wasCompletely obliterating them all it turns them into the nature of space Such is the unimpeded force with which the wind risesand neither is it associated with anything nor is it disassociated from anythingNoble son it is like this As a comparison if for a year of twelve monthsThroughout all ten directions in all these worldsThe ordinand responds I have lived it properly If the ordinand says he has lived the holy life properly the inquirer asks himspeaking appropriately and giving up inappropriate speechThe Bodhisattva exclaimed How sad that old age destroys youth How sad that health is destroyed by various sicknessesThey set in place and protect sentient beings andThey will practice celibacy with their immaterial bodies They will emit their own light They will have miraculous powers They will fly through the airJust as the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha ākyamuniComfortable and free from afflictionsDecorate them with gold and gems and cover them with lattices of goldThat is what I heard Krakucchanda saytheir conduct ritual purity and observancesAs such they consider how the Blessed One has taughtAs bodhisattvas unafflicted She always maintained homelessness They will have dressed ākyamuni in Dharma robeswhen a brahmin living in Rājagṛha took a wife of equal caste and together they sportedThere are two obstacles first to life And second to liberationDear boy Kolita Come home There is pleasure to be had while living here tooThose who have been prophesied by the Buddha Will be born into the Ikṣvāku familyHe is overjoyed to see themWhat are those ten They are stainlessness nonattachment peace infinite insight infinite wisdom accord with the sameness of the realm of phenomena conceiving of all phenomena as being of the nature of the field of space absence of individual supports transcendence of the sphere of marks and transcendence of the logicians sphere of engagement Noble son bodhisattvas possessing ten such qualities are similar to spaceHe rose from his seat prostrated at the feet of the Bodhisattva and spoke this verseWhat is the natural result of good qualities It is being near to the highest complete enlightenmentProstrations to the category of special accountsThey are volition feeling and the element of dharmasSome ate human flesh and drank blood chewing on human arms legs heads and livers and slurping entrails feces and vomitBy the union of vajra and lotusCompared to the merit he would produce the production of merit in the first instance would not even amount to a hundredth partāradvatīputra just as the notion of the eyes of a tathāgata arhat and completely perfect buddha is without foundationfortytwo eons after the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya entered the pathWe supplicate you to explain to us the nāga kings our purposeexclusively dispense generosity at all timesWhen he attains enlightenment living beings who give away all their possessions will be born in his buddhafieldfeeling volition and the element of dharmas are all transferred and migrate there tooThey crush pride by thinking Like the lowliest outcast I move humbly in pursuit of almsIf there is any being among the infinite numbers Counted one by oneat the monks feet and askedSome had ugly hollow eyes like wellsto the youth CandraprabhaTo all those shaken buddha realmsLikewise in the north the bhagavān buddhas of the north such as the Tathāgata Mahārciskandha the Tathāgata Vaiśvānaranirghoṣa the Tathāgata Duṣpradharṣa the Tathāgata dityasaṃbhava the Tathāgata Jālinīprabha the Tathāgata PrabhākaraThey should also encourage others to acquire those fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasWithin that pore the ground is silver and the mountains are gold with silver peaks adorned by rubiesTell me O Spiritual HeroThey also take refuge in the elements such as earth water fire wind and spaceI will teach extensively The Dharma that liberates from sufferingYoung man what is being skilled in the wisdom of the nonexistent nature of all phenomenaThe youth was their leader In this vast holding of the supreme sūtra In order to behold honor venerate and serve the Blessed One the thusgone worthy completely perfect Buddha ākyamuni and also to hear his Dharma teaching let us travel to the Sahā worldand they do not make assumptions about dreams and so onBut once you are in that realm be carefulThis holy being is arriving here accompanied by one hundred sextillion other bodhisattvas and what you perceive are the signs of their arrivalSince they are without false imaginations they are without erroneous viewsSo bhikṣus have no fear in these circumstancesVenerable Lord if the notion of the eyes as with signs is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of the eyes as signless become a bodhisattvaLikewise in the nadir the bhagavān buddhas of the nadir such as the Tathāgata Siṃha the Tathāgata Yaśas the Tathāgata Yaśaḥprabhāsa the Tathāgata Dharma the Tathāgata Dharmadhara the Tathāgata Dharmadhvajadisciplining body speech and mind thus maintaining constant spiritual progressWho live in solitude dwelling at the foot of trees And who are heirs of the sugatas focused upon liberation I am an obstacle and I am an accomplishmentThey know the absorptions and associated spheres that the hearers engage inEye and form are dualisticThe first is made of gold The second is made of silver The third is made of beryl The fourth is made of pure crystal The fifth is made of red pearl The sixth is made of emerald The seventh is made of ruby The eighth is made of all seven precious substancesthese all constitute the fourth root transgressionin harmony with relativitySuch are they who teach the supreme nature of phenomena They will before long reach the highest enlightenmentYour Majesty I will not act immorallyThe yakṣas and rākṣasas bowed down at the feet of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara and returnedMañjuśrī likewise through this Dharma discourse all the bodhisattvas afflictions will be dispelled andHe has praised those who have gone forth and greeted them respectfully shaved their hair and anointed their heads with scented oilsSūkṣmā dropped like a felled tree at the pratyekabuddhas feet and saidBodhisattvas are not patient for the sake of certain purposesIn the presence of the Lord of the World I will pronounce their punishmentThey should engage in conduct related to anger and be free of angerThis refrain should be extensively applied to the sense fields just as it has been juxtaposed here in the context of the psychophysical aggregatesNo one is able to know The nature of their strengths Liberations fearlessnesses Or the nature of the buddhas other dharmas foreign traders who have settled there sing the praises of the young head merchant Bhadrapāla and speak well of himIn order to benefit those women Who dont know me as present In the body of every womanIf it bursts into flames one will become a vidyādhara by applying it as a tilaka on ones forehead or an ointmentIn the same way Mañjuśrī the Tathāgata the Arhat the Perfect and Complete Buddha does not movevisiting the cityAwakening Mañjuśrī is a consistent basisRather bodhisattvas minds are familiar with defilement by means of roots of virtueBlessed One when a noble child comprehends the Dharma with the understanding that comes from receiving the teachings or from reflecting upon them is that not a personal understanding asked the bodhisattva SarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhinEverything taught above Should also be understood as fourfold Each one moreover is fourfoldAs the Bhagavān had given him the opportunityHe wept and cried Oh no my only sonsyād yathedam khaṅge khaṅge khaṅgeghoṣe uṣodhane sārathi prabhede vipulaprabhe saṃkarṭhaṇi vikarṭhaṇi viśagravate śuddhasādhani varuṇavate vāsa vibhūṣeṇe vesaṃgame paśupati puspagarbheAs was natural given their junior status they were always expected to perform errandsThey will promulgate this sūtra And will guard the treasure of the buddhasThen the Blessed One instructed the venerable AśvajitHe gave up all of the four continents He abandoned pleasures and left his home Now monks what is this extensive discourse on the Dharma known as The Play in FullSentient beings are not born miraculouslywho searches for a spiritual friend should possess these four qualitiesA mother a sister a wifeThis sacred doctrine is compatible with omniscienceIf you ask what are the thirtytwo major marks of a superior man that the tathāgatas possess they are as followsIf you ask what are the four immeasurable aspirationsIn that time the wise one proclaimed enlightenmentEven should he go into the states of the animals he remains free of darkness and ignorancewho was always by his side instructed the king in a dreamThe great ocean the nāga kings abode would never bow down to a puddleHe keeps a count of it all And keeps all that wealth in mindpromulgate it and make it widely known to othersSimilarly the sensory element of sights is also free from contaminants and not included within the three world systemsThey have emerged victorious in battle over their foes This is a fitting place for the Bodhisattva to be conceivedSuch is the bodhisattvas excellent patience that is not temporaryThis is some sign that has appeared in this world We must seek well for the meaning of thisVenerable Lord Similarly the transcendent perfection of generosity is empty of the transcendent perfection of generosityinseparably hear the sacred doctrine from the tathāgatasHow are physical forms without limitsWith joy and inspiration toward the infinite Dharma they have no concern for material thingsThe sum total of the merit of all those beings with as much merit as a solitary buddha would then match the merit of a bodhisattva a bodhisattva who achieves this absorption that encapsulates all meritThe road was shaded with silk canopies in many colorsLord Vajrasattva spoke this tantra andLike an elephant he was gentleRūpavatī Beautiful OneThus free from any outer marks and free from the marks of the body they practice to give up inner marks finding great joy in their practiceSimilarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are neither fettered nor liberatedthey destroy their boat of faith and part from the vital force of wisdom when they lie out of jealousy correct livelihoodIt is the dhāraṇī entranceway that has the characteristic of irreversibility Does the Jina teach this samādhi the thusgone ones would still hear and fully understand each of them individuallyTherefore Nakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña I entrust you with this chapter on the history of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana so that in the future in the later times during the final five hundred years it will be practiced in Jambudvīpa and will not vanish so that Māra the evil one will find no opportunity to attack it and so that the devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas and mahoragas who belong to the class of māras will find no opportunity to attack itOne should place that on top of seven leaves from the bodhi tree andHe has attested that he is utterly free of impedimentsSimilarly owing to their utter purity they do consider the nonarising of all the meditative stabilities and all the gateways of mnemonic incantationHow many qualities must a bodhisattva have to go safe and sound to a pure buddhafield after he transmigrates at death away from this Sahā universe Vimalakīrti repliedstudded with the seven types of precious substancesMonks the ThusGone One then engendered great compassion starting with the sentient beings situated in the undetermined groupThe realm will be level delightful made of crystal adorned by jewel treesAmong the gods who had faith in āradvatīputra and the gods who had faith in the factions of the māras there were thirtytwo thousand beings who aroused the mind set upon unexcelled and perfect awakeningOh no sonSo it is that they perceive the arising of physical formscauses one to transcend all lower existence and be freed from all illnessMonks once the god Santuṣita and his entourage had praised the ThusGone One with palms joinedI belong to the Solitary Sage Vehicle when I teach the twelve links of dependent origination to those who need themWe are bringing the jeweled structure that delighted the Bodhisattva and we are taking it into the presence of the Blessed One Those among you who would like to see it should come quicklyBut when the inner sense source the eye is not deficient and likewise when form light space and appropriate attention are not deficient then from the coming together of all these factors the eye consciousness arisesOn the other hand Subhūti you should have conviction in the transcendent perfection of wisdom because physical forms are nonapprehensibleProstrations to the tathāgata Ratnākara buddha of the eastthe knowledge of the cessation of sufferingThey do not preoccupy themselves with talk of diverse mattersthe bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Candrasūryavimalaprabhāsaśrī having thus instructed the bodhisattva mahāsattva SarvasattvapriyadarśanaIn time the brahmin Tiṣya went to see King BimbisāraBoys where are your parentsit is because when their own minds are purified they also purify the worthy recipients of the bodhisattvas generosityWhat are you He replied Im a hermaphroditeat the same time will be reborn in this buddhafieldWhen Prasenajit the King of Kosala heard this debtor had gone forth and attained a store of qualitiesHe is the great Dharma king who shines the bright light of knowledgea gentleman since he had eradicated afflictionsIn this way noble son bodhisattvas are involved in endless activitiesMany marvelous phenomena such as these occurred in the worldand as all sentient beings are at peace understand that all phenomena are at peaceThe Tathāgata has inconceivable qualities so that in this way the Tathāgatas body is within the kūṭāgāra and is resplendent beautiful and has the perfect colorIf they develop their perceptions in that manneronepointedness of mind based on the aspects of emptinessand in the same way since a genuinely perfect buddha is nonapprehensible it is nothing but a mere name or conventional termThe beings in my care are of good character have good understanding are easily guided and are easily purifiedAll the while although they are pained by the excruciating fierce and burning suffering of beingsGreat fortunate one As soon as you have risen in this world enfold me in your compassionHow should they train in the second the third and in all the other settings of their mind on enlightenment up to and including the tenth setting of their mind on enlightenmentThey cannot describe it Through using profound words Bondage is broken by the mindOr has a powerful rākṣasa been born who rivals great RāvaṇaIn this billionworld universe there is not to be found Any being superior to them Or who is their equal in the accumulation of merit And unrivaled inconceivable wisdom This earth supports all beings She is impartial and unbiased toward all whether moving or stillThe airborne palaces of the Brahmās who were in the fifty hundred thousand quintillion worlds in the east became very beautiful bright radiant glorious and majesticVenerable Lord How do great bodhisattva beings after abiding in the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration acquire the transcendent perfection of generosityThoroughly understanding that the mind is emptyOn the relative level tranquility is a gateway to peaceNoble son imagine if all beings had become bodhisattvas dwelling on the tenth levelthe inconceivably numerous appellations for kleśas and the inconceivably numerous appellations for purificationthey may become equipoised in and arise from the eight aspects of liberation either sequentially or in reverse orderThen concerning the recitation or meditationBhagavān these dhāraṇīmantra wordsThis is due to the meritorious actions Of this great sagewhen there is no consciousness arising that apprehends feelings that apprehends perceptions that apprehends formative predispositions and that apprehends consciousnessO Prajvala Hū phaṭI am the creator the destroyer a powerful lord full of blissThey should praise the eight aspects of liberation and the nine serial steps of meditative equipoisehe will obtain grassThat which is the characteristic of those words Is the characteristic that all phenomena have But King and Lord of Humans you are remaining silent As if to say It is not yet time for me to teach the DharmaThis monks verses express the real meaning of brahmin If he falls then all fallChildren of noble family to find out where you are being led to and from where you are being led look with your equipoiseHis mind is calm and free from anger Come lets pay him homageAnd you my Lord are still young You are in the prime of your lifeIt fondly believes that the painful is pleasantBhagavat did Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara leaveAnd whatever eloquence wisdom and qualities I may haveAll the way to

Bodhisattvas power and the displays that he performed his mind was disturbed with jealousy and avariceIn the realm of the conditioned there are no allies No friends no relatives and no retinuewith holdings both vast and extensive with riches to rival VaiśravaṇaBenefit many millions of beings They kindly teach the Dharma to assembliesWith their knowledge of phenomena actualized they observe phenomena At that point they are free from mindfulness and contemplation and so they understand the intrinsic natureThe gods and humans who heard this were delighted and thought Soon he shall become the god of humans and godsHe shows the wayin relation to the knowledge of phenomenaFor those lacking in such particulars who are immature denseInasmuch as we also wish to hear this very teaching on the transcendent perfection of wisdomThen when he sees that they have become old Covered in wrinkles and their hair has turned whiteAnd is in accordance with the ritual To be granted the secretsThey have no desire for material gain through their reputationAre all not difficult to attain for someone Who has trained in this restraint of the body And will have attained the state of pacificationCamphor is the flesheating ḍākinīHe is a place of rest for the persecutedDivine being moreover when bodhisattvas understand the teaching of disengagement from all contemplation and are free of superimpositions their diligence will have equanimity and they will truly observe that whatever exertion they might undertake is itself disengagementThey know that all phenomena have but a single meaning And that is solely emptinessEncouraged even more by these verses which emerged out of the sounds of the instruments through the blessings of the buddhas in the ten directionsand the same goes for all the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and deathāriputra know them to be arrogantFrom a long way off Kolita saw Upatiṣya approachingBy calling them by

realmTherefore they are all called saṃyaksaṃbuddhas tathāgatas and buddhasThose bhikṣus and bhikṣunīs Upāsakas and upāsikāsThreads of various colors should be tied to the passagewaysThat noble son is how Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara completely ripens beings and teaches them the Dharma of nirvāṇathe inconceivably numerous kinds of action concerning the kleśasI then pondered what was needed for contact to occur and what conditions contribute to the occurrence of contactYoung man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of recitation What are the four kinds of recitationYoung man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of pertinent speech What are the four kinds of pertinent speechI have fulfilled my duties I will not experience other rebirths apart from this oneBecause he has realized equality in relation to dependent origination he is the one who abides in emptinessThese childish beings are swallowed like ships by huge sea monsterstraining in the transcendent perfection of generosityAll her ornaments fall off and are scattered about and carried off by waterThey were disturbed by my words and asked Great head merchant is it true that they are the rākṣasīs who live on Siṃhala IslandBhagavat how did Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara enter the great Avīci hellShe has little attachment anger and ignoranceSuch is the bodhisattvas expertise concerning the conditioned I shall manifest ponds and riversIf you ask why it is because there is nothing at all that could arise or cease nothing that could be afflicted or purified and nothing that could be retained or forsakenHe will be honored by the world and its devasThe postulant repeats this a second and a third time but in the third recitation says instructorThen I lord of the asuras said to himWith no root seen they are at peace from the firstI myself will never speak about anyone in a defamatory way order someone to speak so or rejoice in anyone being so spoken aboutbodhisattva mahāsattavas as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges River attained the power of mental retention called a trillion convergencesCompassionate one you have the voice of Brahmā For what reason did you smile The king touches his head to the Bodhisattvas feet As they discuss many issues the king says I will give you half my kingdom Enjoy the sense pleasures here I will give you all you needThey are carried along on a river of actions And their actions will have no endWhile they prepared their very precious chariots and weaponsāradvatīputra do you think that the designation of physical forms as afflicted or purified constitutes a bodhisattvaFrom the sky above there has resounded The beautiful sound of drums without their being beatenThe strength of ten bodhisattvas who have been definitively emerged for one thousand eons is the same as the strength of one bodhisattva who has been definitively emerged for ten thousand eonshand gestures turbans offering praise and salutationsThose who wish to teach in some way The endless millions of sūtrasIt neither bestows nor withholds the transcendent perfection of ethical disciplineSo too are feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessHe taught the Dharma without seeking rewardsIn the truth of suchness It is the final end yet it is without an end This nondual teaching of the Dharma That is what we call the wheel of DharmaThey have eliminated without remainder Every conception of cessation and noncessation Reverend Saṅgharakṣita they replied the people of Jambudvīpa are skeptical so you will not believe usThus my name is Precious Mind And he is Perfect Wealththrough their purposeful activity and through their harmonyThese are the attributes of genuinely perfect buddhasThe way he wore his robes and his offering bowl was delightful to seeHow is transcendent perfection of wisdom to be actualized due to the nonactualization of all these other attributes and attainments up to and including omniscienceAnd give counsel to those without guidethe piśāca Pīlupāla made of the wood of toothbrush treeThe bodhisattva is empty of the bodhisattvaor rivaling the brilliance of his wisdomdo you think Subhūti that this illusionist or this apprentice of an illusionist would have established any sentient beings on the path of the ten virtuous actionsBefore the Blessed One millions of nāga girls burst out with their nāga criessome of them become bowls that hold ghee and some of them become bowls that hold curds or milk some of them become bowls that hold bad and impure substancesthat you have accepted to undergo such hardship in searching for food and clothingāradvatīputra in this regard there are some persons whose minds are without omniscienceSince those who have been taught in this way those who have been instructed in this way and those who have been trained in this way have not attained omniscienceMoreover Venerable Lord great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom should investigateBecause mind mentality and consciousness are not perceived Mañjuśrī there is no dharma whatsoever that could be thoroughly cognized dispelled cultivated or directly realizedHe is not a conventional expressionThis is my physical frame and is aware of itSuch is the bodhisattvas aspiration free of wearinessNīlakroṇṇa flower as has been explained Is known as the blue citrakaNoble sons the Tathāgatas intention is to send down a great Dharma rainAnd those who with delight make stūpas of jinas From bricks or build them from claynanda I applied ardent diligence and so I quickly realized supreme perfect enlightenment and became a buddhaCountless hundreds of thousands of musical instrumentsHe will not teach the sacred doctrine according to the notions that physical forms are a self and that they are not a selfI replete with the ten powers and emboldened by the four types of fearlessness will perfectly roar out a great lions roar like the leader of the pack amid the assemblyHe walked with the stride of someone whose feet level off the terrain be it sloping up or sloping downThe completion of the millionfold universe can be aligned with the perfections of the bodhisattvasThe Bodhisattva answered Māra the evil one with words that were firm profound vast gentle and sweetConditioned states are impermanent Conditioned states are miserable Conditioned states are burningWhat are these thirtytwo ways They are as followsIt is so insubstantial perishable shortlived painful filled with diseases and subject to changesThey will all avoid rebirth as an asuraneither living in the world nor abiding in liberationor the physical pains that are intolerable oppressive intense dreadful and lifethreateningAnd thus they are established in the qualities of a buddha Those are the benefits of being devoted to wisdom King Prasenajit and the others by means of many great more and more powerful supernatural powers made an offering to the Tathāgata of five hundred divine garmentsand all the eldest of elder monks then also dismissed him with the snap of their fingersAt that time the Bhagavān then taught that topic in detail by speaking these versesThe threefold practice is said to be essentially mantra appearance and realitysaying Bhikṣus in the past in a time gone bythey would become dedicated to maintaining the Dharma taught by the bhagavān tathāgata RaśmiprabhāsaWith bountiful harvests it is both delightful and populous Indeed it is filled with peoplePerceiving the three realms to be ablaze with the shortcomings of existence his wish was to free himself from themSince these people are brahmins I should recite a verse the brahmins themselves take to be trueThose who have committed the fault of defaming the sacred doctrineWhy Because the Tathāgata Jewel Moon Performing Enlightened Actions was the monk Vīradatta at that time the love that is enlightenment because it is unity of experiencegreat compassion because of never tiring of ripening all sentient beingsBrahmā responded Blessed One it is in the Brahma realmOne should steep bitter cucumber in goats urine for seven daysthis transcendent perfection of wisdom is the great transcendent perfection possessed by great bodhisattva beingsMay you erect the great sacrificial post of the DharmaAt that time too the Blessed Ones complexion shone like a blossoming lotus garden There is the meditative stability named Definitive Engagement in Precise Etymology  There are the meditative stabilities named Entry into Designations and Observation of Spatial Directionsperformed a miraculous feat such that the Lord Tathāgata Merupradīparāja in the universe Merudhvaja sent to this universe thirtytwo hundred thousand thronesThere were also eight thousand goddesses who were adorned with loose hanging jewelry and carried bhadraṃkara gems They went ahead of the Bodhisattva cleansing his way Therefore we are employing skill in methods Through a compilation of causes The beauty of this bhikṣu Is like a painting in goldHe is not involved in the three worldsEven the names of the six outer sense fields do not exist internally nor do they exist externally and nor do they abide between these twoBhagavān therefore our thoughts were of nirvāṇa the level of the arhat tWhen practicing generosity by offering flowers and flower garlandsBecause of their discernment their generosity is free of flaws stains or obstaclesThen the ThusGone One announced to venerable Mahākāśyapa venerable nanda and the bodhisattva great being MaitreyaTherefore Bhagavān Tathāgata Arhat perfectly enlightened BuddhaAnd because those friends of the ThusGone One speak genuinely and tell no liesAs neighboring armies present no imminent danger tomorrow we shall know moreSo instead I went on to think that the prince Sundarananda would conquer and become king of the worldFor those who have overcome the kleśas Enlightenment is not hard to attain Father for one who is set in the midst of a great army What is the use of excessive fearSubhūti these constitute the eighty minor marksand kneeling on their right knees with palms placed together recited these verses to the bhikṣuYoung man bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have completely pure physical conductleading a following of a hundred thousand quintillion kumbhāṇḍasPadmaśrīgarbha King Glorious Splendor also had seventysix thousand pleasure groves for his enjoyment while each of his sons had ten thousand pleasure grovesthe bhikṣus rejoiced andThe Blessed One replied to Senior nanda as follows nanda it is so It is just as you have saidSimilarly the transcendence of the sensory element of the eyes the sensory element of sights and the sensory element of visual consciousness is always without fearThey are a light for beings And they are not afraid of the lower existences I will give a large dowry and take her as my bride said the brahmin They who possess this supreme samādhi Will attain extraordinary visionAlways place your hands together in homage As you would for the Lord of Jinas the SelfArisen Onethe tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha named Siṃhadhvajaontinually teaching sentient beings in this world about the elixir of the gods praising its sweet fragrance purity excellence exquisite taste attractive feel and so onThe strength of ten clever maned lions is the same as the strength of one strongmanOnce I have attained final nirvāṇa should I bring to final nirvāṇa those sentient beings who have not attained final nirvāṇaThe Blessed One replied Subhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom do not dream dreams and they are not dreamers of dreamsThey should not form concepts about things being meritorious or unmeritorious whether they are immoral or moral conditioned or unconditioned mundane or supramundaneWhen he had accepted it he divided it into twoThe Hayagrīva chakra destroys the aggregatesA crowd of bystanders saw the two and askedBy the touch of the vajra their bodies released the juiceand is able to allay unhappiness or enlist others to do so wherever he is should wards or apprentices feel sadSimilarly the transcendence of sights is not sightsThus knowing the value they serve spiritual teachers attend to them venerate them and listen to their teachingsdo not see anything apart from the expanse of realityOf a hundred and sixty million bhikṣus with higher cognitions Who had completely attained the power of the discernmentsOne made a footrestThey give the levels of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas a wide berth and approach unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentHe is known as the firelike one because he burns away all disturbing emotions having given up all pretenseand sat down in order of seniorityWithout harming any living creature and always with pure feelingsSo is he Rāhu an image of the vajra holder the sun or the moonGreat King the five aggregates are painted by ones own karma As an analogy O Great King there is no painter who paints the peacocks fivecolored tail and neither is there any paint involvedHow can they be without enmity toward any being and thus become free of angerFinally one becomes a thusgone one a worthy one a perfectly awakened one free from all unvirtuous dharmas and endowed with all the virtuous onesWhen the people of Rājagṛha saw me they were amazed andResorting to the true utterance of the Three Jewels Give an oblation to the bhūtasNoble son although we know of the various areas of Jambudvīpa by different names still they are all included within Jambudvīpathe gods of the Caturmahārājakāyika realm along with the gods of the Trayastriṃśa realmEven if you could destroy Mount Meru with your stareThis is the expanse devoid of accepting and rejectingIt will be filled there with many devas and humans beautified by many hundred thousands of śrāvakas and adorned by many hundred thousands of bodhisattvasCome son of enlightened heritage or daughter of enlightened heritageWhether walking standing or sitting Whether seated on a cushion or lying on a bed I never give rise to wearinessWe grew up together playing in the dirt with our peer the noble SaṅgharakṣitaJust so the element of consciousness carries that volition to one or another kind of sentient beingVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is the genuinely perfect buddhaThere you will rest and attain relief from miseryHaving annihilated all bodies they crush incorrect thinking and bring about the inconceivable complete transcendence of the world and the excellent merit without formIf it does not begin to rain they should be washed with wine and tormented with the fire of khadira woodEven though they may have maintained ethical discipline they have not conceptualized itWhen the six sources of perception cease contact ceasesBecause this supreme highest enlightenment is not attainedTo those who recite in this way kāśagarbha grants mindfulness and entrance into meditative concentration Lord of humans speaker of the truth preeminent among humansIt is distinguished by an understanding of the nonduality of Dharma and nonDharmadisplaying the form of Māra to sentient beings who are to be trained by the form of MāraRejecting my care for the body I will accomplish benefit for beings mastery of birth as one displays birth in all realms of the worldIf you ask why it is because they do not consider the nature of the truth of the paththen at that time young man those bodhisattva mahāsattvas have become skilled in the wisdom of the nonexistent nature of all phenomenaAbiding in the three realms one becomes The husband of all women the supreme lordBuddhas riding in various vehicles These are seen by the ones who are compassionate by natureIt blocks the orifice of the one with the belleclipsing even the sun and the moonso well known for their great miraculous ability great strength and great powerto the point of invisibilityBhagavān if the evil Māra deliberately tries to make this Dharma discourse declinethat involve reference pointsWhen the Jina placed his foot on the gateways threshold Hundreds of bulls lowed with joyAnd that sound of Dharma occurs to pacify all misfortunes troubles and afflictions of all sentient beingsIn that way for many endless eons I held the Dharma of the jinasThey went to King Mahāpadma and saidand offer sweetsmelling flowers in the three periods of the dayThinking that he should set out to gather many goods he rounds up many people and without fear or panicāradvatīputra he replied it is just as you have saida Prajñāpāramitā textI shall forsake the kingdom and practice celibacyWhen he said the letter ū out came the statement The world is of little substance ūnasattvaṃ jagatin the same way Venerable Lord although great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom they do not think I am near or far from the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhas and I am approaching unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentThis entire realm shook terrifyingly In six different ways The four ways of attracting students are gateways to the light of the Dharmado not impose a narrow path upon those who aspire to a great pathWhoevers name one recites while facing the sun one will bring that person into ones presencesome goddesses were holding vessels of powdered black aloeswood and sandalwoodand then instantaneously traveled to this Sahā world arriving as quickly as it takes a strong person to extend and retract his armHe is the chief king the lord of the world The world makes offerings to him the source of the bhikṣus DharmaI would not be able to fully awaken to unexcelled and complete buddhahoodThis will be the supreme offering to the buddhas During the future dreadful timeshe understands how their minds have to be trainedThen the Bhagavān knowing Brother āriputra had made this request for the third timeThereupon the Bhagavān taught extensively in verse what he had previously said about the samādhi doorway taught by many buddhasTherefore if beginner bodhisattvas who have gained this hardtoachieve human birth live with a spiritual friend and wish to enter the Mahāyāna yetHe then said to them You have just conceived the spirit of enlightenmentWhere he establishes a residence And possesses the five sensory pleasuresthey will increase enrich and expand those virtuous factors that are conducive to the transcendence of suffering the accumulations on the path of awakening and the perfection of the aspects of awakeningfreedom from unexamined neutralityThey have also come to venerate Mañjuśrī and rejoice in this Dharma teachingWhy is it the subjugation of adversaries by those who have the DharmaNatural joyWhen the Tathāgata teaches the Dharma thereMany merchants come to see him And through many activities pay him serviceGreat King you are so fortunate to have a son whose eloquent selfconfidence is so swift nimble subtle and potent in the face of questionsand in the same vein the transcendence of all the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death is not aging and death and the restThings smeared with this mixture will glow at nightExamining things by means of their own insightThey will always have great unshakable strength And a majesty that outshines that of kings Rather bodhisattvas are born in civilized lands among people of sharp and clear facultiesThis completes The Sūtra of the Wheel of DharmaBut turning them away from such indulgence the bodhisattvas then commit them to ethical disciplinewill become wise in the teaching of the inconceivable Dharma of the BuddhaPreviously during the time of the ThusGone One Dīpaṃkara there was no virtuous practice I had not already performedin the same way they will have fewer ideas about foodMañjuśrī Kumārabhuta and the bodhisattva great beings each sat down on their own miraculously emanated seatThey have crossed over to the other side They have reached dry landThose who do not know that way Those focused on perceptions will perish which uproots saṃsāra and the five existences which brings the hells and afflictions to an endWith excellent lights and incense Always make excellent offerings to the unequaled one iThe Blessed One is endowed with a crown protuberanceThey are harmless and emptyVenerable Lord This transcendent perfection of wisdom is profound and it is hard to aspire to itWith their sweet and fragrant aromas Protect yourself and do not leave There were in all those worlds the unfortunate existences in between worlds where there was complete darknesslike a wishfulfilling tree for those who have achieved the meditative concentration of brave progressionHe is skilled in teaching the Dharma with its infinite modalities within the uniform ultimateBlessed One the bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin inquired to which sentient beings do the buddhas and bodhisattvas then teach the DharmaThis vehicle is equal to spaceGrasping at matter immature ones dissect and constructat that time in that era in the Vinirbhoga eon in the world realm MahāsaṃbhavāNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities follow the Dharmaand will also attain nonobscuration with regard to all phenomenaIn the past I had little wisdom and little insighthis mind must have been impureMaitreya if bodhisattvas possess these seven qualities they will abandon all evil rebirths and not fall into the clutches of sinful associates but swiftly realize supreme perfect enlightenment and become a buddhaThis completes The Practice Manual of Noble Tārā Kurukullāproceeded to teach the Dharma he needed to hear in order to fully realize each of the Noble Ones four truthsOne should serve to a woman the root of vernonia together with the five impuritiesSimilarly although virtue and nonvirtue reside in the body neither is visible in the bodyO enemy of snakes Destroyer of Vāmana phaṭThe Blessed One replied Subhūti it is so It is soThe Blessed One replied It is so āradvatīputra It is just as you have saidWhoever is unmistaken in terms of the ultimate does not form concepts or thoughtsJust as were the perfect bodhisattvas and the perfect environment belonging to the Blessed One the thusgone worthy perfect Buddha SamantaraśmyabhyudgataśrīkūtarājaHowever Subhūti the gods of the Caturmahārājakāyika realm do not reciprocally perceive the divine clairvoyance of the bodhisattvas nor do the gods up to and including those of the Akaniṣṭha realm perceive itThe world with its gods humans and demigods will only bring them painFrying these in sesame oil will make one the enthraller of peopleThere were no longer any villages towns market towns districts countries or capitalsand his inspired speech would still continueShould train in this kind of restraint of the body And become a shrine for the entire world would the expanse of reality not be disruptedMonks I will lay out the appropriate conduct of a monk ward or apprenticeThe intrinsic nature of all such actions is voidnessyou will be afflicted and futile in your efforts to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentThen Brahmā master of the world asked the Blessed OneThrough this skill in means though they may traverse all the world systems in the ten directions numerous as the sands of the River GangesNoble son the light rays came from Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara who is in the palace of Bali the lord of the asurasSo it is that the bodhisattvas who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom should not appropriate or become fixated on physical formsIn the same vein the cultivation of the transcendent perfection of wisdom is the noncultivation of the fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasand yet we do not understand these explanations statements teachings interpretations elucidations instructions and expressions of the transcendent perfection of wisdom which Senior Subhūti has just givenIt has not been revealed so that the sensory element of the nose the sensory element of odors and the sensory element of olfactory consciousness might be grasped or not graspedie ones such as ignorance craving karma and consciousnessJust as the buddhas of the three times rejoiced in unsurpassable merit I whose name is also rejoice in all worldly and beyondworldly meritAt another time when he was reciting the Vedas with his father he askedbeating threatening severing impaling It is seeking the ten strengths It is the omen of the coming of buddha wisdomThere he will be born upon a lion throne in the center of a lotus where the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Amitāyus encircled by an assembly of bodhisattvas lives is present and remainsIt is a wheel that is unconfused regarding the realm of phenomena a wheel that is undisturbed concerning authentic limitwith the light of wisdom they dispel all darknessHomage to Tathāgata IndraketudhvajarājaśrīIf one plays dice one will winBefore him were assembled devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kinnaras mahoragas humans and nonhumans who were gazing upon him andIn that way the dharmabhāṇaka bhikṣus Cannot be shaken by any opponent For those drowning in the pitch black darkness of ignorance and those tormented by their negative views he is like the sunThese childish beings are carried away like wooden logs taken off by the riverHow do they have knowledge of themselves What does their knowledge of the world consist ofThe escort can turn back nowI wish to praise him and offer him worshipand with a gentle and pleasing voice a uniquely superior vocabulary and a continuity of words and lettersIn reply to the bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin the Blessed One saidJust as the Tathāgata sees the various beings of an impure nature who are to be converted by means of parinirvāṇa or by relics who have no faith in the Tathāgata and who are irreverent toward the master so in each such case the Tathāgata displays his parinirvāṇafear of evilVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is nondepartinghe is the One with Pure White TeethThey destroy the embryos of children In the first week or the first trimester They cause miscarriage And ensure that no placenta growsThen the venerable āriputra said to the Licchavi VimalakīrtiFriends all coproducing factors are without selfthey become inclined toward the DharmaFrom their camps they sacked merchant caravans traveling between Magadha and KosalaThey had been consecrated with the anointment of the peerless gnosis of the BuddhaWhen practicing generosity by offering residencesNone of these constructions existBhikṣus the guide who has skill in methods knowing that the people wish to turn back thinksCome now tell me quick what did you hear or witnessOther bodhi trees were made of all sorts of jewels and were one trillion leagues highWhen contact ceases feeling ceasesnanda as soon as the man drank it his illness was curedIn fact the bodhisattva great beings all thought that they

wisdomdon the saffroncolored robes and with true faith leave their homes and become homelessfor those who have mistaken the precepts like the opening of their eyesThey teach various kinds of Dharma continually teaching the humans who live in JambudvīpaStill far greater than this is the quantity of merit gathered when the seven steps are taken by a bodhisattva who is immersed in altruism without hypocrisy or pretense striving to liberate beings engrossed in great compassion and established in great loveHead in hands he sat and sat absorbed in thoughtTruly knows the enlightenment Of the bhagavāns of the buddhasI do desire it BhagavatWe pay homage to you with palms joined Homage to you king of DharmaIt should ooze fragrant fluids from its temples and have a glorious bodyIf one consumes it for just one monthDevas and humans never tire of gazing In that way upon this dharmabhāṇaka These are called unconditioned phenomenaAt that time Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta who was seated upon a lotus that had a thousand petals and was the size of a cartwheelNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities ensure that the mind of awakening is not lostSimilarly they will hear the analysis of the meaning of the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasThis heart mantra of Locanā will remove all fearWhen I had heard this sublime samādhi I experienced a noble nonworldly joyI possess all forms there is no doubtnanda one should never attempt to measure the thusgone onesYou burn up all bad karma like a fire burns a forest just through being seenProstrations to the bodhisattva MahāsthāmaprāptaI will give beings who are veiled by the darkness of delusion and ignorance A vision of many hundred doors to the DharmaAlas my refuse rags are infested with liceConclusion of the twentyfourth chapter The Inconceivable TathāgataMisled by demons this priest developed immense pride and so he did not make visits to the ThusGone One On top of this so overcome was he with pride he would stay around spiritual teachers both priests and laypeople to fight quarrel and dispute with themYou the Guide practiced for millions of eons As numerous as the grains of sand in the GangesDo not go anywhere elseWhen he saw this monk the Bodhisattva turned to the charioteer and asked him the followinghe and the gods all settled down on the seats that had been arranged for themwhile the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas also originated from themMoreover it might cause those nonBuddhist carakas and parivrājakasHe remembered the former lives of himself and others in the greatest detailIt is hard to live the holy life It is hard to live in solitudeBhagavān how does the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara move around in this Sahā world realmWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas excellent wisdom that is not temporary consist inIf I were to engage in that there would be no benefit to me or to others And I delight in being useful to both myself and to othersIn that respect Mañjuśrī how is it without outflows and how is it without clingingthen the seconds minutes hours days nights seasons and years will be imperceptible as wellWhat are those ten They have full knowledge of the discipline full knowledge of the way of discipline full knowledge of the profound discipline full knowledge of the detailed discipline full knowledge of what is right and wrong full knowledge of natural evils full knowledge of prohibited evils full knowledge of the circumstances that led to the regulations for individual liberation full knowledge of the discipline of the hearers and full knowledge of the discipline of the bodhisattvastBodhisattvas should bow before all beings and overcome their prideDivine One know first that our place of work is completely destroyedThis is the ripening of actions I did in the past I created this karma so now it ripens on meMātṛnandā is in the form of a catCast your gaze upon the great family with whom you will live Observe the precious exalted family among whom you will take birth For this is where you will manifest the conduct of a bodhisattvaEven the names of the formless meditative absorptions do not exist internally nor do they exist externally and nor do they abide between these twoThen at that time the daughter of Sāgara the king of the nāgas appeared before themthey serve all sentient beings with physical acts of loving kindnessWhen it is in that condition It means the water is not farThey do not inspire beings to an enlightenment that is other than consciousnessBe my refuge holder of beautiful lotuses Has no attachment to saṃsāraYou should place your trust in this Dharma discourse called Complete Embrace by all Buddhas which praises inconceivable qualitiesThey obtain from all the buddhas the higher cognitions of the buddhasVenerable Lord if the notion of the sensory element of the eyes as a self is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of the sensory element of the eyes as a nonself become a bodhisattvaWas not thrilled and did not trust these wordswhere you will find the Tathāgata Gandhottamakūṭa taking his mealAll these they dedicate making common cause with all sentient beings toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentThe king of nāgas can see your splendor Since it illumines even his abodeThen when my body was destroyed I fell into the terrible Avīci HellThus concludes The Chapter on Going Forthnot focusing on the transcendence of suffering although the mind has gone beyond suffering but instead pursuing reaching and merging with awakeningFor she has abstained from sexual activity for thirtytwo monthsHave for a long time been teaching this highest meaning One gains power over everything within the whole of the three worldsOf apprehended objects and apprehending subjectsto a person who first escapes his own threatened execution and then returns to the place where execution was threatened telling the executioners Dont kill anyone else Kill me insteadSenior Subhūti as I understand the meaning of your words physical forms are nonarising Similarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are nonarisingThere is no greater deception And no greater delusionwho does not distinguish between the phenomena of distraction and the phenomena of meditationIf you ask why Subhūti it is because they will lack certain circumstances and lack certain opportunitiesthat is to say there are no circumstances in which great bodhisattva beings who do not lack the transcendent perfection of wisdom will turn away from omniscienceWho hear them becomes irreversible training in the transcendent perfection of toleranceThe Great Bodhisattva was followed by a fourfold retinue like the moon by the four continents and he was endowed with the jewels of the seven branches of awakeningHaving mastered all the roots of virtuedie among gods only to be reborn among hell realm beingsThey should always avoid bhikṣunīs Whose behavior is talking and laughingShould any bud float against the streamThere we dwell surrounded by hundreds of thousands of girls fully embroiled in the five sense pleasuresWhat is their investigationUpon that which is infused with the sun of sulfur One should recite the mantraIt does not dwell on physical formsSince hundreds of buddha realms are filled with beautiful golden lightBy offering medicine one will be affected by few illnessesAt that time even though great bodhisattva beings become equipoised in the meditative stability of emptiness as a gateway to liberation as far as the realization of the finality of existence is concernedI will now explain about The purities that purify everythingform aspiration prayersAs they exert themselves in diligence they praise themselves and disparage othersNārāyaṇa bodhisattvas who practice in this way are carrying out the bodhisattva practicesWhy would I not believe what I have seen with my own eyesWhen consciousness ceases there is the cessation of name and formreveals and cleanses all negative actions and all stainsHe attained the knowledge of the joy and happiness that is described by the noble onesa yogin Should visualize my form With onepointed mind day and nightAnd so destroy the enemies the afflictions rend asunder the net of viewsThe cymbals and musical instruments of gods and humans sounded without being played by anyoneI will give away my flesh to those who want flesh my blood to those who want blood my marrow to those who want marrow all parts of my body to those who want them and even my head to those who want a headHis fellow student then also rejoiced as did the saṅghaAlso while they lack understanding and perception they will hear talk about the path of enlightenment regarding the nature of things that is emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessnessMoreover Mañjuśrī that great Brahmā without falling down from that Brahmā PalaceThen the bodhisattva mahāsattva Pradānaśūra

ethical learned and attracted a following with the DharmaMañjuśrī a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the state of one who follows the DharmaEven while frightened of existence Due to craving after existence beings continue to pursue existenceWhat happened We were sacked by banditsHe taught this samādhi of peace In which there is no human soul or personJust as an illusionist in order to trick others Will produce many illusory manifestationsIf one pierces its feet one will stop him movingGentlemen though I have done much for this king he has not taken care of methrough skill in means they dispense their generosity toward sentient beings having acquired the five desirable attributes of the senses for the sake of sentient beingsMañjuśrī when some water is taken as a point of reference for an unreal cloudAre you not a eunuch Are you not a paṇḍakaMonks this is how you should trainThat makes you remain crosslegged For

same as the strength of one fearsome elephantLikewise while the Bodhisattva was residing in the womb of his mother the glory brilliance and color of the Bodhisattva illuminated the south the west and the north below and above In fact all the ten directions were bathed in light for several miles in each directionNoble son through genuine insight bodhisattvas examine and abandon the unvirtuous and

textures which do not disturb those who are free from fear of the passions inherent in the constructive worldThe ten powers the unique qualities the distinct realizationsBodhisattvas recognize this correctlyFor you will not be able to accomplish the auspicious teachings By the mere sound of your voice and speech Please adopt the right conductSubhūti if you ask how this transcendent perfection of

Calm said to the Blessed OneI am given food mixed with poisonAlternatively one should engrave the mantra with a chisel on a stone tablet and bury it It is not accumulating karma  It is not paying attention to the internal āyatanasThey never perceive as frighteningSubhūti there is nothing at all in which great bodhisattva beings should not trainIt was sparkling with the light of many gems and jewelsHaving spoken these words the goddess scattered divine flowers over the Bodhisattva and disappearedAt that time the Blessed One recounted the following to the bodhisattva great being Delighted

those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritageThis family should be steadfast in its friendships and safeguard the lives of all the beings throughout the animal kingdomBut a person who has done wrong finds no serenityThe bodhisattva Puṣya declaredsome mansions were made of danuskari flowers some mansions were made of māndārava and mahāmāndārava flowersThis is merely an example for in reality nothing could compare to itLord it is wonderful that this food accomplishes the work of the BuddhaThe monks asked the Blessed One about it and he said to the monksLikewise it applies to the sensory element of the eyes and in the same vein to all the other sensory elements up to and including the sensory element of mental consciousnessWith swollen bellies and vaseshaped ears With hanging ears or no ears With long arms and long ears Long noses and long handsWhy bother pulling off the branches petals and leaves while leaving the rootThen take barley grains and white mustard seeds Combined with clarified butter And pour them into the fireSimilarly the emptiness of the sensory element of the ears the sensory element of sounds and the sensory element of auditory consciousness is not the sensory element of auditory consciousness and the aforementioned sensory elementsIf they were thinking of Avalokiteśvara Not even a pore would be harmedThey will smell the scents of the bodies of men and of womenand the defining characteristic of the truth of the path is emancipationThe Buddhas voice reaches the noblebornall those sentient beings in the world systems of the great trichiliocosm as many as they are who have become followers through faithThey abide in the characteristics of the essential nature of all viewsAnd with that he sat down at the base of a tree

endure and does not disintegrateAttained the patience that corresponded to those words And were established in irreversible progress toward buddha wisdom undertake training while observing production and disintegration with respect to the five psychophysical aggregatesthere are two reasonsmeditate on the singular nature of formsAny sentient being who holds this Dharma teaching in their hands or hears it and subsequently feels devotion for it will give rise to roots of virtue before ten thousand buddhasThey who possess this supreme stainless samādhi Would voice sounds that were even more numerous One of the eight hundred students yearned for gain yearned for honor yearned for prestige and desired fameHe becomes sick when they are sick and is cured when they are curedAnd if they were in unison to contemplate Just a fraction of my superior DharmaWhoever desires the mother of the sugatas Will attain this mother of the jinasAfter Ghoṣeśvara there was a buddha A jina who was named GhoṣānanaManifestly perfect buddhahood has not been attained from any quarterThe domain of the cultivation of the aptitude for mental quiescence and transcendental analysis where one does not fall into extreme quietism such is the domain of the bodhisattvaAll formative predispositions are illusionlikeor in the same vein concepts of other postulated subjects up to and including the concept of a

so as to relieve pressure on the nervesThe bodhisattva Apratihatacakṣu declaredTheir gait is that of a lion My sons will not save me nor my family Nor my ministers nor the slaves at my feetThis concludes Facing Everywhere The Teaching of the Miracles of Avalokiteśvara the twentyfourth chapter of the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good DharmaRather having understood all the deeds of Māra they overwhelm and disperse themEven if someone knew how to reduce All the worlds into their smallest particlesThen Senior āradvatīputra Senior Mahāmaudgalyāyana Senior Mahākauṣṭhila Senior Mahākātyāyana Senior Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra and Senior Mahākāśyapa along with many hundreds of thousands of bodhisattvas addressed Senior Subhūti as followsGreat King  Prince Sarvārthasiddha has a

seesof introspective meditation consummated by attainment of the buddhagnosisAsking themselves Who is my Teacher they will thinkBhagavān it is as if there were a young man a lad of twentyfive years of age with black hair in the first phase of his adulthood who revealed that he has sons that are a hundred years oldThe bodhisattvas will know by their aromasāriputra I do not claim that there is something called phenomena  or that anything whatsoever is born or ceasessplendor and freedom from wearinessis the noncultivation of the sensory element of the mental faculty the sensory element of

had their bodies covered in poisonous snakesHe is free of a position for himself and a position for othersI have dispelled all my pride Heard your words and today I have attained nirvāṇandeed attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and passed into final nirvāṇa in the expanse beyond sorrow where there is no residue of the psychophysical aggregates

designated as the causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighty minor marksThey are  they do not create kleśas  they do not develop maliceand they are said to be fixatednor are the other transcendent perfections down to and including the transcendent perfection of generosity discernedIn that respect there is no mental construct by which one may place the mind improperlySubhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom are questioned by other great bodhisattva beings in that mannerThe bornblind man who gains sight should be seen as those who follow the rāvakayāna and the PratyekabuddhayānaThey attain the lineage of samādhis And they do not become illThus they are not hurt harmed or wounded by those types of sufferingOn account of the emptiness of their inherent existence the nonappropriation of the gateways of mnemonic incantation or the gateways of meditative stability is not the gateways of mnemonic incantation or the gateways of meditative stabilityA victorious tamer of enemies Not without cause Do you flash a smile white like a conch or lotus rootYou associate with living beings by frequenting their migrationsin that case nanda do you think that those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage would accrue much merit on that basisHe is immovable and unshakable like the great central

purpose of liberating all beings without exception May I swiftly reach perfect enlightenment They are endowed with sharp eyeteeth  Their nose is prominent  Their tongue is redBut one cannot count the number of sūtras That are uninterruptedly taught by them had planted the roots of merit with many hundred thousands of buddhasThe bhikṣus collected A droṇa of his burned bonesAlso when any great bodhisattva beings through their attention endowed with omniscience maintain their indefatigability and relentlessness in order to abandon nonvirtuous actions and adopt virtuous actionsIf you ask what constitute the five facultiesAs they cause the scales and weights of karma to moveteinote xmlidUT their behavior will follow upon pleasure and attachment so thatSon of noble family bodhisattva great

for them welcoming them and addressing them honestlyAnd that which is nonexistent unreal and nonoccurringNoble sons wherever this Dharma teaching is explained and given that location is to be seen as the seat of awakening and the event is to be understood as the turning of the wheel of Dharmaas well as through the condition of appropriating rules and observances to be paramountNo harmful influences from kṛtyās kākhordas spellcasters or vetālas will injure their bodyThen there might be some men women boys or girls with the disposition of the wise who were knowledgeable and endowed with ideation and scrutiny who would thinkThe learned ones realize that these objects emerge from conceptualizationand similarly maintaining the five acquisitive psychophysical aggregates which are like an echo like an optical aberration like a mirage like a magical display and like a phantomThis is the rite for perfecting liberation for consecration And for the maturing of studentsDuring the short eons

you teach us the vows of trainingThey will hear the millions of voices of humans Whatever they say and wherever they say itThe Bodhisattva looked at the retinue of consorts who were lying there on the floor looking utterly revolting and he had the impression that he was indeed in a cemeteryWhen a child is seized by Jāmika There is no interest in breastfeedingMonks do you see Saṅgharakṣita coming from off in the distance We do reverendIf you ask Subhūti how great bodhisattva beings are an island unto the worldswas snatched shortly after his birth by the garūḍa Suparṇi We do not know where to look for himand then encouraged secured and established sentient beings one hundred billion trillion in number in the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationTen billion other gods

Wisdom Inform All His Physical Verbal and Mental Actions and Who Possesses the Wisdom That Is Guided by Wisdombeing faultless in all activities in order to conform to all peopleBlessed One why do you give prophecies to bodhisattvas instead of to listenersThese dedications are made without engaging at all in the dualistic attitude that differentiates the subject who makes the dedication and the object to whom the dedication is madeand a modality that lacks aspirations a modality that is calm and a modality that is void a modality that is afflicted and a modality that is purifiedfor it leads to the absence of karma and the absence of ripeningthen withdraws it when they part companyThen there will be a benefit for many beings happiness for many beings compassion for the world and welfare benefit and happiness for a great multitude of beings devas and humanshis great buddha manifestations and his buddha conduct he radiated many quintillions of light raysAt that time in the Blessed Ones presence the monks felt free of any of the physical impurities and sluggishness that derive from physical lassitude and torporOne should make love following the prescribed wayIn the emptiness of inherent existence the emptiness of all intrinsic defining characteristics is not discernedThe vajra master the great ascetic Has obtained empowerment replete with secretsAlas this world has raised the banner of pride and egotism It is obsessed with clinging to I and mine Peoples minds grasp at the self and false notions of a self distort their views May I bring down this banner of pride that thinks I am by showing them the noble pathIt would leave his spiritual practice in tatters leave him ruined wrecked fallen and defeatedVenerable āradvatīputra the characteristic of past mind is that it has ceasedanother bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in the result of attaining the streamHe is said to be like the king of gems the wishfulfilling jewel because he has genuinely fulfilled his aim of attaining nirvāṇa according to the wayThen the entourage including bodhisattva Vajragarbha and others performed three circumambulations counterclockwiseVenerable Lord If great bodhisattva beings will also attain omniscienceBy their mere consumptionSubhūti do you think that the tathāgatas are creatures of the animal realmsofficiants givers of instruction and recitation

earthThey request you turn the wheelas I understand and ponder the meaning of the words spoken by the LordThereafter subsequently gold And mākṣika is infusedApproaching the Blessed One they bowed their heads to his feet sat to one side thenSuch beings must be ripened by the bodhisattvas practice of austeritiesHaving had these stūpas constructed he thoughtBut that is not so for if it were then each and every man would have a thousand sons as do the kings of the worldThose engaged in the meaning shun that which is not the meaning And are always firmly established in that restraint from the nonappropriation of the applications of mindfulness up to the noble eightfold path and in the same vein from the ten powers of the tathāgatas up to the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasIf youthful Mañjuśrī were to transform me into the form and appearance of a buddha a hearer would take the form of the Teacher which would not be appropriate I should therefore disappear from this

as the Blessed One had advisedThe tongue is empty of a self and what belongs to a selfHow should they train in all the gateways of meditative stabilityI pray that you come with your sons to my garden You will benefit an assembly of many beingsentered the absorption of the heroic gaitThese monks are exclusively arhats free from afflicted mental states who have attained the cessation of contaminantswhatever bliss is desiredand similarly those who would separate and dissuade them from the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationThere will be no rotten smell from their mouth But always a pleasant scent like a blue lotus That is the aroma that will come from their mouthThis completes the twentyfifth chapter from The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten Thousand Lines entitled Skill in MeansBlessed One how is it that the element of consciousness possesses form Bhadrapāla askedIn the same way since the emptiness of internal phenomena and the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities are nonapprehensible they are nothing but mere names or conventional termsWhoever upholds this sūtra Will be a true

not be calculated even a fraction of it could not be calculatedWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas continuous diligence consist inIn what region In a region near the borderlandsHe shaved off his hair and beard put on the orange robes and with faith left home for homelessnessFor as many eons as there are sand grains in the GangesMost of them are reborn as hell beingsSo carrying the honey gruel and stripped sugar caneIn space the emptiness of internal phenomena is not discernedThe bodhisattva without any lack of confidence will teach before the fourfold assembly which is a gathering of bodhisattvas who have entered the BodhisattvayānaAnd in order to attain enlightenment They cast down coral tree flowers In the same vein they will never develop thoughts of the transcendent perfection of generosity thoughts of the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom and thoughts of the applications of mindfulnessand some go to the sides of the mountains which are made of precious ruby jewelsThere were no Kāla mountain rangesWith your mighty unblemished gaze have you not observed The buddhas throughout the ten directions of the worldThe gods in the Heaven of the ThirtyThree collected the hair for worshipThen imagining oneself as having the form of her husbandThey profess that which is not the doctrine to be the doctrine and they abandon the sacred doctrineand having arrived he descended from the kūṭāgāra and holding a string of pearls worth a hundred thousand silver coinsOne would not have spoken of even a fraction of them It would

extreme of detachment in regard to all thingsThey also realize the means of investigation to be emptySubhūti in things which neither arise nor ceaseIt is not due to ones own skill It is not due to

appearance constantly delightful And and thereby perfected their roots of virtue and rendered irreversible their progress to unsurpassed and completely perfect awakeningno pursuit and excessive attachment will disappearIt further entails the completion of the four unhindered discernments by knowing without making assumptions that the vehicles of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas have been rejectedMañjuśrī when the demigods battle against the godsOne should visualize the templepalaceAs their aspirations are fulfilled And they have purity of conductthey do not consider anything through which they should attach importance or with respect to which they should attach importanceSenior Subhūti repliedThrough miraculous powers there is the perfection of the accomplishment of aspirations

They will comfortably digest completely Previously this renowned being Dwelt in a delightful palace When he was in the Heaven of JoyWith great wisdom I am the skillful doctorand had the following thoughtI was at that time King ūradatta My sons were subsequently protectors of the Dharmaif the ThusGone One produces an emanation is that emanation connected with somethingAfter Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara had ripened those beingsaccompanied by thought and analysisthe end of all sensationsHe may establish tall and beautiful stūpas Beautified with fine gems to the summit of existenceThey do not think about their parents spouse sons or daughtersOr else is it that having heard the sūtras explained by antigods garuḍas kiṃnaras and mahoragas tooIn the presence of all those jinas He asked about this supreme samādhi of peace They should praise and rejoice in others who comprehend the noble truth of suffering abandon the noble truth of the origin of suffering actualize the noble truth of the cessation of suffering and cultivate the noble truth of the path that leads to the cessation of sufferingIn that place I had this name this surname this family this caste this dietConclusion of the thirtyseventh chapter Teaching the Aspect of Correct ConductNo one who heard these sounds would ever turn away from attaining complete and perfect enlightenmentYou set forth the Dharma and are a source of all qualities how does this consciousness undergo transfer from the body and what type of form does it haveIn that pure environment lotus flowers the size of chariot wheels grewThe tathāgatas are called tathāgatas because they have genuinely attained manifestly perfect buddhahoodOutside the double vajra one should write eight la syllablesOn the relative level the branches of awakening are a gateway to realizing omniscienceWhy is it freedom from misery Because it is the realization that harm and suffering are meaningless and that suffering has no selfIn this case too the Elder Subhūti is undifferentiated and therefore he is the emulator of the TathāgataWhen speaking of the four truths The foolish say that they see the truthSome of the women had unpleasant features such as arms that were too longAnd have built countless thousands of stūpas That are made of jewels gold and silver Nārāyaṇa took two steps and said Give me my third stepThe crown of his head I cannot see nor can the others here in the Brahmā realmBut he will only recover quickly if you noble ones nurse him The physician then treated the invalid and he was curedThey are those who have no envy And they have a happiness higher than that of humans The eyes resemble the placenta of a jenny a sow or a bitchthe element of consciousness feels joy and its desire is inflamed when it achieves contact with the bodyThese are good verbal actionsThey retain what they have heard so that they themselves will comprehend the unsurpassable wisdom not out of an aspiration toward the Lesser Vehiclethe monks found themselves in a quandary for they did not know how to do thatThere are those who travel alone Who find peace on their ownHowever the princes maternal aunt Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī would be able to raise the prince so that he is happy and wellReverend āriputra the expression the buddhas of the past present and future is a conventional expression made up of a certain number of syllablesthe samādhi named Established in the Entry to LiberationThey will not abandon the power of love for all beings They will perceive all the tathāgatas as their fatherthe Yāma Tuṣita Nirmāṇarata and Paranirmitavaśavartin realmsAnd they say You are a fool Do not think I am wiseBut when those roots of virtuous action have been brought to maturity in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment then they do actualize the authentic finality of existenceThen the Lord ākyamuni said to the bodhisattva Maitreya the great spiritual heroRemove the ornaments Do not disturb the One Who Makes the Foolish WiseAt that time also with these words of praise Focus your mind onepointedly and offer praiseThey will venerate and respect their instructors thinking By relying on instructors I shall perfect the factors of awakening that have not yet been perfected and I shall eliminate the afflictions that have not yet been eliminatedAnd further I accurately understood the precise identity of formations the source of formations the cessation of formations and the path leading to their cessationbeing tossed down upon that bhagavānthen they are engaging in the conditioning of physical formsThus similar to how the realms of the world emerge with Mount Sumeru the oceans the four great continents the Mucilinda Mountains the Mahāmucilinda Mountains the snow mountains the circular

anyone ever been worthy of offerings on account of this revelation of the sacred doctrineHe went to Jetavana and after some timeHe then said to that assembly of fortunate godsBhagavat nonarising and noncessation have been spoken ofIn this way one attains the basis for benefiting all beingsand wish to attain quickly the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood should cultivate this samādhiRitually cleansed and well adorned She should scatter mustard seeds on the ground And decorate the ground with flowers and fragrancesIt does not transcend the world system of formlessness nor is it established in the world system of formlessnesshe is liable at the least to wind up amongst those born as animalsThey do not practice in order to go beyond cyclic existence nor in order to perfect the state of transcendence of sufferingmake such offerings He will surely become a buddhaThis insult is all due to my lack of learningAfter finding them some he gives after grinding them with his teethMonks whenever I thought I should stand up I tried to do so but my body was so hunched over that I fell every timeLikewise based on the elaborate fifth The simple sixth emergesnanda So it is that the transcendent perfection of wisdom is in the vanguard of these five other transcendent perfections andIn that way the Bhagavān with the fingers of his right hand opened the center of the great precious stūpa and revealed its interiorwill teach ten thousand million beingsmaking common cause with all sentient beings they dedicate them to unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentDeath does not exist for himThe Four Great Kings should be present on the left and right sides in postures of worshipThen with palms joined Great Brahmā said to the Lord of the WorldHere we have arrived at this most excellent mountain To worship the one who masters supreme qualitiesKnow the locations of the chakras the chakras themselves And their related practiceswill certainly put an opposing army to

continuously on the Bhagavān sitting on the BodhimaṇḍaThrough the faith they felt in the emanationand has been dedicated to ripening beingsSenior āradvatīputra the applications of mindfulness are nonexistent and nonapprehensibleNoble son bodhisattva great beings practice generosityThis is called sattvaparyaṅka postureHe is known to possess a nonclinging intellect because his mind is nonclinging unfettered and liberatedSome great bodhisattva beings when they practice this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom will not be separated from the transcendent perfection of generosityThus should I swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and having attained manifestly perfect buddhahood I should also lead forth those sentient beings who have fallen into the three inferior realmsMahāsthāmaprāpta the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sadāparibhūta proclaimed this Dharma teaching which had been taught by the Bhagavān to many hundreds of bhikṣus bhikṣunīs upāsakas and upāsikās sayingIt is amazing to see so many blessed buddhas making prophecies regarding these two holy beingsradiant with the eighty minor marksAs long as the transcendent perfection of wisdom is active in the world so long will the Precious Jewel of the Buddha not vanish from the worldalso no other details or distinctions are apprehensibleUntil the baby is born she experiences the suffering of the hell beingsIt is to be obsessed with perceiving things as being born and as ceasing and perceiving things as having a self as not having a self or as being the selfThey will enjoy śamatha and reach the bliss of dhyāna With a peaceful voice they will speak of peace where they prostrated at the feet of the Blessed One and circled him three timesor with the emptiness of the sensory element of the ears the sensory element of sounds and the sensory element of auditory consciousnessVenerable Lord Is the fruit then attained when one has cultivated the pathand Mañjuśrī Kumārabhuta is there nowIn this way those who possess great learning will have the power to satisfy the minds of their listenersBlessed One he said the hearers actualize all unconditioned phenomena whileThey who possess this supreme samādhi Have no doubts or uncertainties On hearing in detail the supreme Dharma of the BuddhaWho will abide in the real nature andnumerous excellent foods with hundreds of flavors to savor as they chewed licked sucked and drankSince the Bhagavān had granted the youth Candraprabha this opportunityO Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa let the fever seize such and such Hū phaṭWhen washed and pure Perform the practice of the deity of activityEven being in the womb produces similar regrets as those produced by the experience in the hellsand omniscience is consciousness and the other aggregatesthat they are equal to spaceThe amount of merit of all those beings would still be far less than the quantity of merit made by a bodhisattva who first aroused the mind of awakening and then embracing an attitude of altruism strove to liberate all beings while practicing great love and great compassion without hypocrisy or pretenseHe also teaches them expertise in skillful means the profound conduct of the unsurpassable MahāyānaSon of a selfimmolator in holding that all selves endure attachment will arisesimilarly how is the transcendent perfection of wisdom absolutely pure owing to the absolute purity of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessThen the gods situated throughout this world system of the great trichiliocosm that is to sayThe young god then actualized the fruit of a streamentererI obtained it asked questions about it preserved it recited it to othersSo it is Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings should never lack the transcendent perfection of wisdomthey could not through their enumeration know the number of the hundred thousands of quintillion of eons that have passed since the bhagavān tathāgata Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū passed into nirvāṇaVenerable Blessed One I request you to guard protect look after and bring peace and wellbeing to the realms of the trichiliocosmProstrations to the bodhisattva SamantabhadraThey are never apart from beholding the true nature and buddhahoodthis is the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration originating from the skillful means of great bodhisattva

awakening and conferred upon him religious giftsThey will not yet have the divine hearing Their ordinary hearing faculty will be like thisAging does not come from anywhereOr spinning the unexcelled wheel of Dharma in its twelve aspectsThey who are established in enlightenmentThey will never be conscious of unpleasant mental phenomenaThose sixteen young princes who as youths were mendicants who taught the Dharma in the Bhagavāns teaching all attained the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood andIllusion is itself the applications of mindfulness and applications of mindfulness are themselves illusionI declare that henceforth any servant who should wish to go forth shall not be prevented from doing soAlso the Paranirmitavaśavartin devas And the pure beings who dwell in Nirmāṇaratinthe bhikṣus and bodhisattvas rejoiced and greatly praised the teachings of the BhagavānHaving all circumambulated him three times they took their place in the gathering to one sideLord formerly I have heard from the Tathāgata and from Mañjuśrī the crown prince of wisdom many hundreds of thousands of teachings of the Dharma buteven with just his toe touchesconquering devils and foes and overwhelming all criticsImmediately after hearing those languages sounds terms explanations and statements they retain them and do not squander themand upon holding mastering honoring retaining venerating respecting and making offerings to itVenerable Lord How should those great bodhisattva beings who are beginners train in the transcendent perfection of wisdomRejoice for I have seen to it that the Four gamas have taken root in the land of nāgasWill they also attain the excellence of the pratyekabuddhasvenerable SubāhuGreat bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomJust as what is mixed with the five impure foods Is eaten without being adulterated Just like the burned cord May this truth manifestAs soon as the Bodhisattva stepped foot on the palace floor the entire palace became illuminated with lightAttaining the result that is the liberation of hearers and solitary buddhas is not what bodhisattvas minds are likemalicious nonhuman beings may be attractedVimalatejā what is truly meant by the qualities of the buddhasless still the mindsets of ordinary peopleMonks afterward the Bodhisattva proceeded through Magadha and eventually arrived at GayaYellow is earthA monk caretaker lives thereburied at a crossroads will stop all coming and going It will interrupt all daily activitiesYou should know that so long will the tathāgatas teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beings in the worldHis steps always make beautiful circles to the rightAnd who are patient peaceful and selfcontrolled They will all of them attain enlightenment The fifth which resembles space Should be understood as the empty sign For the intermediate state nondualitycircumambulated the Bhagavān many hundreds of thousands of times andAvadhūtī is in the central area It conducts prāṇa in the moment of innate joyThey who possess this samādhi Will have understanding and memoryTherefore young man you should train by thinking I will practice completely pure physical conduct in that wayBhagavān for the sake of showing compassion to us accept these airborne palaces of the BrahmāsBut they all sit subservient At the doorstep of the richHaving annihilated the conceptualization of phenomena They do not become proud in the Buddhas Dharma Go king look upon all that is yours Lord of shining meritVenerable Lord What skill in means do great bodhisattva beings possess whenIf all phenomena are without attributes without indications and without signsthey do not apprehend the notion that the fruitional attributes up to and including omniscience are empty or the notion that they are not emptyThe Sugata gave them all this prophecy You will in the future become buddhas They who possess this supreme samādhi Always delight gladden and enchant Devas nāgas and

kṣatriyas and their retinues and have received their offeringsSenior āradvatīputra it is so It is just as you have saidLook at glorious akra acīs husband who is at the gates with his army Look at the gods demigods and kiṃnaras who are here making offeringsAlways pacify desire through contemplating ugliness Overcome anger with the power of patienceThey perceive minds afflicted with delusion correctly as minds that are afflicted with delusion and they perceive minds free from delusion correctly as minds that are free from delusionWhere one sees relativity without entertaining any convictions there is the domain of the bodhisattvathat is called the deluded mind which great bodhisattva beings might have with respect to all thingsConsider noble son how a lion moves without bringing along anythingand the emptiness of inherent existence would indeed disintegrateUp to a distance of eighty leagues They adorned the seat of awakeningWhile saying O wind this is beautifulOnce born they also have to age and dieTherefore Virtuous One quickly leave this fine city And practice the conduct of previous sages That which arises from the mind is the goodness of the mind There is wisdoms discrimination and thus realizationNow if that father has many friendsOnes lifespan will without doubt Be equal to that of the priests of BrahmaThese fools use many different methods Trying to purify their bodiesMonks at the time of the constellation of Citrā after the constellation of Hastā had passed the chief priest of the king who was called Udayana the father of Udāyin went before King uddhodana surrounded by some five hundred priests and saidThen whatever place or direction Those birds travel Bhūtas will not dwell there Nor will any other harm doersWith fangs showing between the lips angryListen ChandaNoble son that is the kind of blessing that Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara hasIt is free of all attributes It is unwavering It has no location It completely has the nature of spaceBlessed One we will have faith in this sūtraWhen he had spoken these verses the god honored the Bodhisattva with celestial flowers and immediately thereafter disappearedThey will see the great trees that blaze with fire blaze strongly and blaze fiercelyOne should drink barley potash with curdswhose minds will not be averted from the unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and who additionally will hold and be attentive in the appropriate manner and so forth to this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomWith its magical powersSimilarly they discern that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are pure and do not focus on themSuch is the bodhisattvas skill in acceptingthe understanding of omniscienceO Prince Sarvārthasiddha you have won you have won  tOf course the same thing goes for physical possessions such as my wealth grain gold silver gems jewelry horses elephants chariots riding mounts villages cities towns countries kingdoms palaces marketplaces mountain hamlets male and female servants employees sons daughters wives or retinueIn this precious transcendent perfection there is nothing at all that arises or ceases nothing that is afflicted or purified and nothing that is to be retained or forsakenThere are gods and humans Who delight in the distorted discipline of extremistsāriputra eyes too ought to be described like thatWhatever is the same as affliction on the ultimate level is also ultimately the same as purificationpromote it proclaim it chant itThereupon the goddess employed her magical power to cause the elder āriputra to appear in her form and to cause herself to appear in his formOh Oh Compassionate Supuṣpacandra Generous guide I pray that you ariseThen the Bhagavān taught the samādhi the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomenaWhen he saw the resident monks finely dressed and well trained living peacefully in this glorious and heavenly abodein the same vein just as the utter purity of all other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas is without foundationDevas and humans will be in sufferingSimilarly emptiness is not something other than the sensory element of the eyes nor is the sensory element of the eyes something other than emptinessin the great ocean there is a great precious jewel called Fulfilling All WishesIn the same vein from the limits of past time they have not grasped any other attribute or attainment up to and including omnisciencethey encourage those sentient beings to acquire unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and establish them thereinTo enthrall an important personNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with excellent wisdom possess ten qualitiesExcellent excellent āriputra It is so āriputra It is exactly as you have saidHe knows the scope of the faculties of beingsDuring the middle part of the night he gave an eloquent talkThey had completed all the aspirations of the bodhisattvasThe man should do the deityidentification in the following wayAll the victorious ones of the three timesThis concludes The Past the seventh chapter of the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good DharmaThey would not escape from the three realms which are like a house with a dilapidated roof and rafters that are on fire and in which they will be burned roasted pained and tormentedAs soon these holy beings were approaching a net of jewels appeared bedecking the entire trichiliocosmThe ripened fruits of wholly negative actions are wholly negativeWhen the king heard these words he felt extremely sadThis army of yakṣas and other beings Which extends for eighty leaguesThe people who have faith are wise and know the practice Are always joyful when they hear The way that is correct and profound And do not become frightened or terrified It is the birth of knowledge It is the elimination of ignoranceIt is having a pure livelihood It is not forsaking the solitary lifeturned the irreversible wheel of the Dharma had attended many hundred thousands of buddhasAlternatively bathed and dressed in clean clothesNārāyaṇa bodhisattvas who practice in this way are carrying out the bodhisattva practicesOnce the Blessed One had spoken the bodhisattva great being Delighted by Victory the other bodhisattvas the monks and the rest of the assembly along with the world with its gods humans demigods and gandharvas all rejoiced and praised what the Blessed One had saidNoble son it is the thusgone worthy perfect buddha Amitābha who was known at that time as the thusgone Arisen from Flowers and who taught the Dharma in that worldThose with correct behavior who have modesty and selfrespect Who delight in the Dharma and the buddhasThey are endowed with the certainty of understandingthe bodhisattva will then sever the lifeforce of their parents and as the parents are slain the bodhisattva will display miraclesThey had miraculous powers and had attained the four dhyānas They were very learned and skilled in composing poetry and texts They achieve and maintain the third meditative concentration where joy is absent abiding in equanimity due to the absence of attachment to joy while both mindfulness and alertness are present and bliss is experienced by the body This is what sublime beings describe as mindful blissful abiding in bliss and equanimousWhen those beings witness the death of a bodhisattva who is superior to above and greater than the entire worldsomeone unequaled who is unstained by and unattached to the pleasures of the sensesand will always conquer all devilsThe devas of the Trāyastriṃśa paradise also gather thereSublime Captain please come hereI see him as not born from the pastThe yogin will succeed in every way No other action needs to be performedHave you not violated a nun Are you not an impostorKing please ornament the princethen the lord buddhas great bodhisattva beings the pratyekabuddhas the other classes of sublime individuals apart from them and the worlds of gods humans and antigods could indeed reproach them with the wordshe even gave him a pair of shoesThe tathāgatas remain for immeasurable millions of eons for utterly inexpressible eonsFor example Subhūti space is endowed neither with the level of the śrāvakasBeing insatiable in accumulating the roots of virtueAnd likewise myself upon a lion throne Teaching many kinds of DharmaThe court scribe replied There are two factors in honing ones intelligenceTantra means continuumThis Mahauṣadhi is how you should view actionsthen they have been prophesied and inspired by the thusgone onesSubhūti the transcendent perfection of generosity too is neither fettered nor liberatedjust like those of arabha Aiṇeya the king of ungulatesIf from today on Without attaining stainless awakeningGreat sage There are yakṣas and rākṣasas here That crave wombs But kings can neither see them Nor even describe themThe ākya lion the Buddha Was on Vulture Peak MountainJust as after applying compost The tree will bear more fruitthey are not at all fixated on those phenomenaHaving completed these activitiesEngulfed by fire they burn with great flamesNoble sons be seated upon your thronesand are never separated from the mind that knows all thingshaving become a god saw the truth in the Blessed Ones presence before returning to remain among the godsIf he is in the forest I will emanate as many devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kinnaras and mahoragas to listen to the DharmaVenerable Lord How do great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom observe and study production and disintegration with respect to the five psychophysical aggregates while training in these three gateways to liberationWould great bodhisattva beings who newly embark on the Great Vehicle having heard this teaching on the transcendent perfection of wisdom not possibly be afraid and terrifiedand the aspects of it through which they become absorbed are also emptyand I have exempted them alone from the vinaya guidelines I laid down for my disciplesNoble one the merit you have created cannot be burned by fire or swept away by waterremoved his upper robe from one shoulder knelt on his right kneeAt that time a hundred thousand gods led the Bodhisattvas chariotThe strength of ten bodhisattvas who have been definitively emerged for ten million eons is the same as the strength of one bodhisattva who has been definitively emerged for one hundred million eonsWhen I see that you are all Arhats who are upon this levelWhy is that Because their perception is deluded they did not like the color of the medicine did not like its smell and did not like its tasteI will now describe himthis is the profound instruction of the BuddhaHe also teaches the methods that allow beings to swiftly gain control over their own minds and abide in profound toleranceEven the sages who live for eons are not beyond Degeneration and the dreads of sickness old age and dyingrecite it to others promote it proclaim itThen Brother Subhūti Brother Mahākātyāyana Mahākāśyapa and MahāmaudgalyāyanaAt that time the great sage Asita who had the five extraordinary powers was residing on the slopes of Himavat the king of mountains together with his sisters son Naradatta When the Bodhisattva was bornSince they abide in accordance with those aspects of emptiness wherever they abide they do not apprehend anything at all that would attain the fruit of entering the stream or the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth or the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth or arhatship or individual enlightenmentNo fewer than five hundred beings Are living inside In numerous narrow roomsand performed a very elaborateJust as a seed establishes a flowers color scent and tasteForm and enlightenment are the same There is no difference that can be found However noble ones I attained the highest complete enlightenment of buddhahood many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons agoThe nature of the eyes is emptiness Emptiness is the eyeshung with diadems earrings and garlandsReverend how did the youthful shapeshifting nāga first gain faithThe daughter of Sāgara king of the nāgas said Venerable āriputra if I have great miraculous powerWhat is the teaching of the tathāgatasAll that generosity cannot be even a hundredth Of the accumulation of merit that is acquiredIt became adorned with strings of little bellsshe alone Has been the mother of the BodhisattvaThen in the quiet of the night he arrived at the palace together with an assembly of  gods in order to serve and venerate the BodhisattvaThis is not my wife This is my younger sisterPlease pacify their thirst with the downpour from the rain cloud of the eightfold pathwhy does the Tathāgata disclose his own past lives in the presence of the four assembliesthey arouse excitement through the pleasure and delight that they create with their alluring charming and pleasant conversationWhat will you achieve through the transcendent perfection of toleranceThat fruit is empty tooThe Blessed One answered the monksBodhisattvas similarly heal sentient beings suffering from the cold diseases of affliction by warming them up with their insightEmptiness is nondivisionMay he explain the transcendent perfection of wisdom most profoundlythey developed the power of love and entered into supreme and auspicious awakeningSimilarly they discern that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are empty and do not focus on themThat restraint of the mind through which wise ones Attain the vast unshakable supreme peaceThe Bhagavān was dwelling in Rājagṛha on the Vulture Peak mountain together with a great monastic assembly of  monks and a multitude of bodhisattva mahāsattvasIf you ask what are the ten recollectionsThat is so You have spoken correctlyA bodhisattvas buddhafield consists of the four means

phaṭThis is something we have never seen and never heard of beforeafter the Lord had given some brief instruction to the monksdo not hold that physical forms are either empty or not empty and they neither grasp nor disrupt themSimilarly the nāga king Kālika Came before the TathāgataSetting aside all his kingly work he lived in complete purity as if he had entered an ascetics grove With great

DharmaWith their brilliant colors they illuminated the entirety of Jeta Grove with a divine lightfor those who die and fall from here to take birth here once again is difficultHow so Because bodhisattvas are fearlessHowever you do it it will be accomplishedDivine son what do you thinkHow should they train to achieve rebirth among the householder class standing out like a tall sāl treethe young god spoke this panegyric thriceand then recite this mantra  times following the procedures of the preliminary practice as already describedThey have completely pure minds and are free of thought That is the uniqueness of this attainment of samādhi Each approached the Buddha bowed at his feetAgain they will experience the sufferings of the denizens of the hells in the great hells for many hundreds of billion trillion yearsSimilarly is this mind of the bodhisattvas unattached to feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessSome knew him as Bimbisāra of the Guilds while some knew him as Bimbisāra of the ArmyThe one who comprehends all phenomena Is said to be a perfectly enlightened buddhaAt that time I thought The fault is ours the fault is not the BhagavānsThe strength of ten bodhisattvas who have been definitively emerged for one hundred thousand eons is the same as the strength of one bodhisattva who has been definitively emerged for one million eonsHe called out to the BodhisattvaNot all sentient beings can bear to put on such armor for the purpose of enlightenmentand whose body was beautifully adorned with the thirtytwo marks of a great beingand made this special praiseHosts of devas move about the sky with delight As the pleasing and melodious songs of the gods resoundwhen their minds are purified they become pure Is this not the Dharma I taughtMañjuśrī a bodhisattva may practice thinking that form is not empty and also not nonemptyWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas excellent wisdom regarding the absence of self in phenomena consist inIn the emptiness of conditioned phenomena the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena is not discernedThey miraculously went to millions of realms And to even more as numerous as the sands of the Ganges Even if they were to consider those phenomena they would not actualize themThe Blessed One teaches that praising oneself is not the way of a holy beingWith happiness and gladness they approached the Bhagavānis identical to the purity of the fruitthose who wish to attain the genuine paths of the ten virtuous actions and those who wish to perfect them should all train exclusively in the transcendent perfection of wisdomAll the other learned renunciants śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas who have appeared alsoMaitreyaTherefore I will definitely practice generosity by offering beds and pillowsThey give forth aspects of speech That are as numerous as the Ganges sands And on it the moon born from the syllable aAnd dedicate all for the sake of enlightenmentHe then brought about the cessation of thoughts and analysis and became perfectly quietit is because the monastic community of the śrāvakas of the tathāgatas originated from the bodhisattvaswill have no fear of boils eczema

magnetizing beingsOne who does not become distracted does not oppose the dharmatāEach of the mansions was twelve leagues tall and eight leagues widetThe thusgone ones are incomparable They obtain the essentials and choose the time of passing away Those are the benefits of being without avarice We are far from these tathāgatas may we also rise up into the air through the power of the tathāgatasSon

VairocanaRenunciation is totally harmless to others and is not adulterated with evil thingsThey do not waver from their vows They maintain their practiceThey discern that this is not the time for actualization and discern that this is the time for investigationHe shining with the light of confidence in knowledge spreads the cloud of Dharma all throughout the three realmsI have said that those of the vajra family the ratna family The padma family and the karma family are permitted to observe the conductTurning the wheel of Dharma will be accomplished In an instant by the one who practices enthrallmentthe outflow of existenceKnowing venerable āradvatīputras thoughts Mañjuśrī now blessed āradvatīputra so that he appeared to the entire retinue in the form and appearance of a buddha seated upon a lion throneOne should know that those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who abide in the transcendent perfection of wisdom as it has been described will never be separated from the transcendent perfection of wisdomThe yakṣas kumbhāṇḍas and flesh eaters were terrified and ranand a physician for those long sickI then said to the two monksThe retentions become apparent to them And they have no doubts concerning their appearancePerfect Buddha you act in the worldShow yourself in my dreams that I may disclose my transgressionsIn the same vein the other sensory elements up to and including the sensory element of the mental faculty do not consider the expanse of realityIs that of bodhisattva practice It is the adornment of the Buddhas DharmaWhen I claim to have explained the path through which suffering will genuinely cease having ascertained that śrāvakas will find it conducive to the attainment of sublime emancipation if some virtuous ascetic brāhmin god demon Brahmā or anyone else in the world should say in this respect that this path will not be conducive to emancipation that there will be no definitive realization and that the sufferings of those who enact it will not ceaseThey are human strongmen They are human flowers They are human lotusesThus bodhisattvas are wide and infiniteneither liberation nor not liberationthe fruit of being no longer subject to rebirth and This putrid body of minevenerable Gavāṃpatibeing the guardian of those without a protectorAnd violent acts That would lead ordinary people to helland do not desire those two levelsthe level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhasbut accept and desire only omnisciencethe sky is called sky yet the sky cannot be expressedthe meditation of voidness consummated in effectiveness in the development of all living beings I remember the greatest number of hardships That I practiced through numerous eonsYoung man it is when the bodhisattva mahāsattvas know the nature of all phenomenaif they engage in the same manner with the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold pathHe is called the supreme being because he has no disturbing emotions caused by worldly objectsThey should praise abstention from wrong views andHis lips are red like the bimba fruitTheir bodies are cleanone should collect lampblack from a wick made of white lotus fibers burning inside a human skull with human fat This should be done at night on the eighth or the fourteenth day of the waning moonI possess such toleranceneither wisdom nor foolishnessIf at the time of intercourse a woman does not drip She will not respect her husband but want to leavethe suffering of being born in Avīciand the same goes for the other sense organs up to and including the mental facultyAt this the bodhisattva mahāsattva Prajñākūṭa and Sthavira āriputra fell silentHe never loses his mindfulness and thereforeWell venerable āradvatīputra from what mind state were those monks liberatedDevoid of wisdom following Māra They are reborn in the terrible hells ixIn this way Subhūti do great bodhisattva beings after abiding in the transcendent perfection of generosity acquire the transcendent perfection of toleranceit is therefore called visual appropriationIn this way for all those things there is a consistent basisThe drunk and intoxicated were freed from their intoxicationBhaiṣajyarāja that noble man will sit upon the Dharma seat of the TathāgataThis concludes the section of The Questions of the Merchant Bhadrapāla the thirtyninth section of The Noble Dharma Discourse the Great Heap of Jewels in one hundred thousand sectionsāradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving the sensory element of the eyes the sensory element of sights and the sensory element of visual consciousness as entitiesnor does it not cause one to know mundane phenomenaSimilarly are feelings from those conditioned by sensory contact that is visually compounded to those conditioned by sensory contact that is mentally compounded also nonconceptualAll of them will attain emancipation through the three vehiclesto the one who is a perfectly pure beingWhat is the attainment of mental retentionThat to which on the ultimate level no conventions apply divine son is ultimate truththen proceeded to the Bamboo Grove in the Kalandakanivāpa where the Blessed One was residing carryingTherefore noble one when you go to the Sahā world realm do not perceive that tathāgata those bodhisattvas or that buddha realm as inferiorIf you ask what is the way of the buddhas it is this very emptiness of inherent existencesome with form others formlessYou the shining light of wisdom the light rays of insight May you dispel the great darkness of all beings with your gazeIt entails the meditations on the eight sense fields of mastery by engaging in the cognition of a single modality without differentiationHe is the one who is praised by the lord of the kiṃnarasThen we all left the townKnowledge of extinction and knowledge of nonarisingIf you chant an incantation against a vipers venom it is possible to neutralize the snakes poisonoffer it at evening twilight in a secluded placeThose living in poverty found wealthAnd furthermore your eyes are unblemished So now please look with compassion upon the world with its godsAs long as one does not go against the true meaning it is appropriate to strive They achieve and maintain the fourth meditative concentration where even that sense of bliss is abandoned and former states of suffering have also been eliminated Here neither suffering nor bliss is present because blissful and unhappy states of mind have both subsided while equanimity and mindfulness are utterly pureobtain the three yānasthe rāvakayāna Pratyekabuddhayāna and BodhisattvayānaThey are firmly established in compassion for them These are distinctive qualities of the first patience Young man there are ten benefits for bodhisattva mahāsattvas who live by receiving alms in the austerity of the disciplines of mendicancythe bodhisattva Satatasamitābhiyukta the bodhisattva DharaṇīdharaSince unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment is also absolutely voidIt is without establishment and rejection without birth or destructionand if on the other hand someone were to teach genuinely demonstrate and so forth this transcendent perfection of wisdom to those irreversible bodhisattvas sayingBlessed One why would bodhisattvas who have a vast mind pursue such inferior conduct inquired the bodhisattva SarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhinFriends in short even if the lifespan of the ThusGone One were to last for an eonSimilarly they do not see and they are not viewers of mirages magical displays or phantomsAs the Bhagavān was teaching limitless countless beings of nine types of birth among gods and men attained various states of meditative concentration dhāraṇīs and toleranceAnd in the presence of those jinas He cultivated this samādhi Not brazen nor dejected nor selfsatisfied You have become a buddha the best of beingsLikewise because of their excellent qualities utter preeminence mastery of the Dharma and unerring speech great bodhisattva leaders will be heading the gathering of the beings with whom they travelBut the king had a cruel brother Who was persuaded by those around him baThey will not acquire anything but the sacred doctrineand provides them with all types of pleasant provisions and servicesHe is not spaceVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is dreamlikeNārāyaṇa these are the four most superior eminent and supreme ways for bodhisattvas to livehaving offered flowers and incense to all the buddhas also offer sandalwood incense to rī MahādevīOne should write the mantra with turmeric on birchbark and wear it on ones arm or neckWhen anyone abides in this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom and enters into those causal attributes from the four applications of mindfulness up to and including the three gateways to liberation for only a single day they will generate many merits greater than thoseAt that time his son the fool Is always poor and wretchedand enter into the maturity of the irreversible bodhisattvasThose who had faith and trust in the Lord of sages Those who delighted in emptiness and peaceThose who have infinite vision demonstrate miracles For the sake of bringing joy to all beingsWith those who had spoken it so gently and pleasantly And bowed down to their feet before departing Reverend āriputra the Dharma is calm and peacefulThis is called the knowledge that contaminants will not be regeneratedThey do not become angry They are never ignorantThese are called the faculties that acquire the knowledge of all thingsNot even someone who can split the supreme diamond mountain in a single instantSimilarly being unskilled they will be without the emptiness of internal phenomena the emptiness of external phenomena and the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentitiesThen the Lord withdrew his miraculous power and at once the buddhafield was restored to its usual appearanceThe light emitted by the precious jewel will illuminate the surrounding area for an entire league including all four divisions of the kings armyAre you not a convert to a tīrthika order Are you not a patricide Are you not a matricidefor pratyekas like a garlandand the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities they will subsequently attain this omniscienceshe went to where King uddhodana was seated comfortably in the music hallThe Blessed One acquiesced by remaining silentāradvatīputra it is in such ways that great bodhisattva beings who are diligent alert and mindful after eliminating worldly covetousness and sadness without apprehending anythingThe seed phrase supreme pa teaches all phenomena from the ultimate perspectivewho brings freedom from the terrors of bondage in stocks and manaclesIn the same vein they should not abide in actual reality the expanse of reality the maturity of all things and the finality of existenceSimilarly the emptiness of fundamental ignorance is not fundamental ignoranceAs the sage saw this tears streamed down his face and he sat there sobbingThe fifth great merit results in becoming SantuṣitaThe monks asked him Venerable what motivates such diligence in youHe will become a bhagavān in the Maitreya family And he will guide ten billion beings Similarly they have a view concerning the ten powers of the tathāgatas and in the same vein they have a view concerning the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasThe Bodhisattva then indicated to the bodhisattvas to take their seat on these throneswhere they hear this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom and immediately after hearing it form aspirations toward itwhile the nāga host began to suffer a throbbing headache prompting him to demand of the preceptorbeing the savior of those who have noneThese childish beings are greedy like a dog with a boneIf for millions of eons one were to describe your unequaled qualities Which are as numerous as the sands of the GangesThe wise ones know the entirety Of the dependence of phenomena āradvatīputra do you think that the designations of fundamental ignorance and in the same vein of all the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death as afflicted or purified constitute a bodhisattvaSubhūti do great bodhisattva beings abide in the transcendent perfection of wisdomit is because they do not disrupt physical forms and they do not disrupt feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness claiming thatto stretch and bend Then the Blessed One prophesied their unsurpassed and perfect awakeningwhen in Hasta the leavesthey argue for causes and they argue for diligenceI would decline in my practice of the unsurpassable DharmaThey are established in the supreme retentions And before long will become guides of the worlds In this regard the expression arms that reach down to his knees when standing without bending down means that whenThe lads friend then led him on a long detour that took the entire daythe Bodhisattva went to the great Dharmoccaya Palace where he taught the Dharma to the gods in the Heaven of JoyThereupon the entire multitude experienced the desire to behold the universe Abhirati the Tathāgata Akṣobhya his bodhisattvas and his great disciplesIt is through fear and anxiety they will have abandoned their homes And held firmly to the homeless lifeWhy O virtuous one should you abandon sympathetic joy And enter the void You have made a promise The entire world rests in your heartI rule over gods demigods humans and animals All of them fall under my controland not abiding in the present timeIn the same vein they do not pay attention with the twofold overscrupulous attentiveness of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhasWhen he attains enlightenment living beings who are destined for the ultimate will be born in his buddhafieldYet even thousands of beings like youThese attainments are all revealed in the manner of signlessnessbeheld in the eastern direction the forms of the thousand buddhas teaching the sacred doctrineThere were millions of godsAs they followed the deceased they pulled out their hair threw dust on their heads beat their chests and lamented loudlyThen suddenly Rāhu with his body trembling and in a sweat Like a sick personIt is not the level of śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhasSince the Bodhisattva had long ago realized the shortcomings of desire he now demonstrated sensual enjoyment without himself wanting it simply in order to ripen othersSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections accordingly will swiftly perfect the six transcendent perfections and approach omniscienceIn the world system called Peace abides the Tathāgata the Arhat the truly perfect Buddha called Established in PeaceInstead you will find the happiness of desirerealm gods in the vast abode of Brahmāand the inconceivably numerous accumulations of sūtras concerning purification Those are the fourmany thousands of divine yaktail whisks parasols shoes adorned with gold and bejeweled gold diademsHe is unsullied by the form realmIn this way these impertinent beings will abandon the Buddhas teachings Just consider how much nonvirtue they will accumulatesome were made of combinations of gold and silverAs I lie on my back Intoxicated from passionAnd with the supremely fragrant breath of one with the ten powers Please speak words of unadulterated truth And thus bring joy to gods and humansAccording to his or her inclinations and beliefs a sentient being perceives a Dharma teaching issuing forth from that jewelWhat is defeating opposition It is the correct presentation and teaching of the DharmaThen bodhisattva Vajragarbhaāradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving the sensory element of the ears the sensory element of sounds and the sensory element of auditory consciousness as entitiesHe becomes emaciated and seeks refuge from others His body covered by skin infections and itchesThe formations are the primary and subsidiary mental states that apprehend the particular circumstances of general thingsLikewise the present itself is also the nature of spaceBhagavān it will be great replied the bodhisattva mahāsattva AkṣayamatiI have abandoned desire like putrid snot By their power majesty and might may I have wellbeingthey would then dedicate these gifts toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment without apprehending anythingInstead they train intensively in a mind of love that is free of resentment rivalry and harm and is expansive immeasurable and nondualThe foolish examine that preeminence And subsequently continue in saṃsārathe preceptor drinks molten copper among the denizens of Avīci the Great Hell of Unrelenting TormentTwentyeight bhūtasthe possession of untaught generosity untaught discipline untaught patience untaught diligence untaught concentration and untaught insightNoble son if you know that the time has come you may leaveThey should not dwell on the notion that I am a genuinely perfect buddhaThey who hear and retain this sūtra in the degenerate times Will be endowed with memory understanding wisdom and constancyWhite wellfed strong oxen Of great size and beauty Are yoked to those precious cartsIn the future during the final five hundred years when the sacred Dharma is destroyed and the teachings disturbed when sentient beings enter evil ways when the lamp of wisdom dies out and there is no TeacherMotivated by compassion for others He sought to bring about vast benefits to the worldYou have all been practicing bodhisattva conduct andwithout knowing and without seeingThis worldly life is devoid of intrinsic nature and is just like a dancers mask or a city of gandharvasThe complete array could never be fully describedThey bowed down to the Victorious One and circumambulated himperceive that which is insubstantial as something substantialthe tathāgatas consecrate them within their aureoles extending a full arm spanIf one infuses a hempen cloth with campaka and vārṣika flowers their scent fades quicklyand attachment will not disappear aversion will arise and aversion will not disappearThere were those who aspired to attain That inconceivable supreme attainmentThe bodhisattva Suvinīta declaredbut they do not relinquish the doctrineWe prostrate to you who are like wind and space Great sage your qualities are like a treasureJagatindhara repliedSimilarly they will not construe the notion that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are empty and that emptiness is consciousness and the other aggregatesThey will never be separated from the five eyes that are neither fettered nor liberatedFor example Subhūti space neither arises nor does it cease nor is it stable and alterations are nonapprehensibleWe were never gladdened by hearing Descriptions of the realms of the buddhasSimilarly Subhūti even great bodhisattva beings who possess sublime uncontaminated pristine cognitionin order to bring sentient beings to maturityand radiantly clear and brilliant like the sphere of the sunA woman who is childless Or pregnant Should on the eighth and fourteenth days Observe the trainings go for refuge in the sublime Dharma And worship well a reliquaryAt that time the two brothers Trapuṣa and Bhallika With their caravan of merchants And carriages filled with riches Reached a grove of sāl trees in full bloomFurthermore just as one perceives the natural sensation of the wind on account of the bodyDraw a vidyādhara beneath the legs of aḍakṣarī Mahāvidyāmoreover such deeds will not be considered good qualitiesTheir minds will not be averted from the unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentHe must have left this wayI am the Tathāgata the supreme human the Jina Appearing like a cloud in this worldNoble son bodhisattvas who possess these ten qualities have a body that is solid like vajrabecause it is nonapprehensible in terms of all phenomena and so forthWith the light rays from your stainless and effulgent sublime bodyand they praised them with many kinds of bodhisattva praises and then they stood to one side with their hands together in homagehimself presented and served a series of great offeringsestablished in unsurpassable complete and perfect awakeningthe spiritual level from which there can be no relapseWith my angry mind I will destroy the fever of such and such a personMañjuśrī it is because they assume a self and something that belongs to a self that sentient beings do not transcend saṃsāraMaitreya those bodhisattvas distance themselves from desires and from sinful nonvirtuous thingsWhen ignorance ceases formations cease When formations cease consciousness ceases When consciousness ceases name and form cease When name and form cease the six sense sources cease When the six sense sources cease contact ceases When contact ceases sensation ceases When sensation ceases craving ceases When craving ceases appropriation ceases When appropriation ceases becoming ceases When becoming ceases birth ceases And when birth ceases aging and death sorrow lamentation suffering despair and anxiety ceaseI then pondered what must be absent for sensation not to occur and what must cease for sensation to ceaseHere I have purified the eye most sublime By which I see all worlds Like fruit placed In the palm of the handPadmaśrīgarbha these two beings then spoke these verses to the blessed oneThe seed planted from this has yielded buddhas pratyekabuddhas arhats and śrāvakas in the worldFor seven days and nights This embodiment of compassion has not consumed food or drinknor is it seen to have any color such as blue or whiteAs another analogyTheir bodies are lustrousturn the wheel of the sacred doctrine even though nothing at all is set in motion or reversedSomething the size of an atom cannot be found It is a term used in teaching on the worldly level Except for a bodhisattva who has reached his last existence and rests in equanimity in allpervasive absorption they are a light for beings and  they have no fear of the lower existencesWhen I claim to have explained those things which cause obstacles on the spiritual path if some virtuous ascetic brāhmin god demon Brahmā or anyone else should say in this respect that even though one might depend on those things there will be no obstaclesYou are a deep ocean of qualities and have compassionYet ultimately awakening is not the way that it is expressed through wordsand also various flowersThe same also goes for the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdomDivine son in the same way based on the circumstance of observing all beings on the relative level a bodhisattva great being speaks without speakingVenerable Lord Why does the purity of the transcendent perfection of wisdom not appropriate anything at allwhile another of his wards was distributing water to the saṅghaMonk as all phenomena are unperceived they are wide openthey will remain immutable and unchanged without any damage to their vowsWho is piercing or cutting itHe should avoid association with Beings who are women or paṇḍakasWhat are these five The first is the state of being a Brahmā the second is the state of being a akra the third is the state of being one of the four mahārājas the fourth is the state of being a cakravartin and the fifth is the state of being an irreversible bodhisattvaand yet nevertheless dullwittedAnd it illuminates shining in all directions In that way the dharmabhāṇaka is like Meru In this regard calves resembling those of an antelope means that his calves are slender and tapered just like those of arabha Aiṇeya the king of ungulatesI in going forth renounce the tokens of the householder life and fully embrace the tokens of the renunciant lifeThe charioteer repliedfor the sake of showing compassion to us enjoy these airborne palaces of the Brahmāsthey correctly perceive that the sensory element of the eyes is empty of inherent existenceFrom bhrūṃ visualize the great celestial palacebut have merely entered the stream and similarly attained the other fruits up to and including arhatshipNoble one there is no one like you in the world with its devasThus we must surely go and solicit the worthy one the perfectly and completely awakened ThusGone One to turn the wheel of Dharmafrom this world and this buddha realm they saw the ThusGone worthy completely perfect Buddha Amitābha as well as the world of Sukhāvatī which appeared in a great display of fine features

beings from the ocean of existenceYour samādhi is the peak of wisdomYou will always see me here at home and I will not departit is because he did not consider that understanding to be due to the attainment of clear realization of internal phenomenaThus noble sons a bodhisattva who aspires to such a Dharma neither rests in the uncompounded nor destroys the compoundedHolding beautiful excellent nāga pearls He remained in the sky making offerings to the king of sages they cannot compare in terms of any fraction number analogy or likenessThe ordinand prostrates to the preceptor and squats before himIf in thinking of his preceptor or instructor he develops a negative viewMañjuśrī this light of the ThusGone One reaches everywhere Just like that light this Dharma teaching will also spread and pass into the hands of noble sons and daughters who have unimpaired knowledge and concern for the Dharma of the buddhasthe inconceivably numerous ways of the kleśas and the inconceivably numerous ways of purification Those are the fourHow are the ones who resemble lotusesOthers sleep with their heads toward the ground in squatting posture or on the bare groundMay you turn away from the state of not being vigilantIf the ordinand says his parents are deceased he is askedAlthough they perform all the acts of a buddha with their buddha eye ultimately they perform nothing whatsoeverscattered

Good Qualities renowned throughout the world To you ThusGone One we pay homage with our heads bowedTo kill the target within a weekor that even the attributes of the bodhisattvas would have an essential nature of nonentityThey maintain the conception of a result And lose all their wealth of mendicancy  When there is fearlessness Emptiness is fully comprehendedFor so long he has inspired others to abandon killing living beings so he is the One with Long Fingersand asks after your healthif you have but little trouble little discomfort little unrest if you are strong well without complaint and living in touch with supreme happinessThese phenomena arise due to the condition of ignorance they emerge from ignorance are preceded by ignorance and they are dependent on ignoranceIt is the elimination of egoism and possessivenessThe bhikṣu will be freed From this black erysipelas and having become unfixated on all things then also correctly introduce secure and establish others in that definitive discernment of the nature of all thingsinspired themāradvatīputra whenever great bodhisattva beings do not apprehend the physical bodyWith his power of merit superior because of generosity he becomes the foremost on the surface of the earth a benefactor endowed with diligenceThey know the characteristics to be unreal and imaginaryI am going to teach those dharmas Listen to me as to what they are and how they arethey are without skill in means and one should know them to be without skill in meansThen noble ones King ubhavyūha descended from the skyand however the face speaks shouts moves contracts or stretches the reflected face appears to do likewiseWild elephants best horses of noble breed Best snakes hooded and venomous Crocodiles water buffaloes and rhinoceroses These they summon by the power of their mantraChild do you know how to calculate the number called ten million to the hundredth power Yes I do said the BodhisattvaAmong them sights are empty of sights because they do not endure and they do not disintegrateHe is mind the absence of mind and mental formthe nature of knowledge and what can be knownhe left his own abode and journeyed to the place where Buddha Padmanetra was residingThus they do not teach those who are hateful and blame othersHe will reduce this army to dust Just as countries are destroyed by the sagesAbandon all concepts without exception And always abide in a state without concepts After the rākṣasīs had spoken to us thus each one took a merchant home to be the master of her houseWith parasols standards and the sound of bells They would rise to the summit of existenceWithout anything to accept and reject Causeless and without characteristicsThere is not an atom of them that is to be found And that is why they are called unsurpassable By performing  homa rituals with lotuses or bilva fruitsAnd they bring forth the happiness Of all living beingsProstrations to all past buddhasHow are their perfections of insightthe ocean is  yojanas deep and it has an immeasurable expanse extending as far as Vaḍavāmukha I can count all its drops of water which are the size of the tip of a hair butIt is as you have spoken because all things are without supportNow to the east of this buddha realm beyond as many worlds as there are grains of sand in the river Gaṅgāhis mouth opened with the three gateways to liberationthe nature of physical forms is omniscienceYou terrified the assembly of evil unbelieversfor it leads one to reach the other shoreSimilarly bodhisattvas are by their very nature moist with joy faith and delight and they also moisten others with the same qualitiesFrom the solid earth sprung beautiful lotuses the nature of vajraMoreover great king the pursuit of their desires keeps beings in a state of suffering for sextillions of eons That is they will experience the suffering of arising and cessation the suffering of being in the womb the suffering of rebirth as a hell being or an animal or the suffering of the world of Yama the suffering of poverty and the suffering of being cut bruised beaten struck and burntIn fact the entire great trichiliocosm was bathed in an immense lightBut the prince insisted Your Majesty it is absolutely essential that you tell methey would not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentTheir bodies are drenched with human bloodWhen that night was over on the third morning he went back into the capital city of RatnāvatīSimilarly they discern that the applications of mindfulness are empty of the emptiness of the applications of mindfulnessI must establish this many in the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth in the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth in arhatship and in individual enlightenmentYou who are eager you should consider that these experiences are conditioned by karmaThe sugatas will give me answers For my quintillions of questionswaving millions of pieces of cloth crying out Ha Ha Ha and sending down a great rain of flowersHe went through hardship for six years and now he departs for the Bodhi treeUnderstanding the Blessed Ones silence to be assenttMañjuśrī having minds that are misguided by the four errors sentient beings do not see the four truths of the noble ones as they really are and therefore they do not transcend saṃsāra which is actually unrealNoble son bodhisattvas will go alone into the wilderness and compose themselves with their minds withdrawn and extremely weary The lord buddhas are endowed with splendor and intelligence  They are worthy of beholdingWhile passing through the Yaṣtī forestGhoṣadattaMoreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections see the four social classes namely the royal class the priestly class the mercantile class and the laboring classthose who are no longer subject to rebirthHowever monks once I had recited the four truths of the noble ones three timesWith agarwood sandalwood and magnolia Valerian fenugreek and begoniataught the Dharma in many waysSubhūti it is because those great bodhisattva beings abide in a nonabiding manner in the nonapprehension of all thingsThey delight in the actions they perform But those activities will not liberate them Whoever becomes a slave of women through desireunmatched in terms of any fraction number quantity analogy or likenessWithout a maṇḍala fire offering substances and so forth Spiritual accomplishments will not be achieved Therefore be diligent in the activity of fire offeringNoble one the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara possesses such inconceivable qualitiesMonks last night as I rested hereI pay homage to Glorious Vajrasattvathey should sprinkle him with sandalwood powder and with blue lotusesSuch is the bodhisattvas freedom from incorrect mental engagementsto fully engage in understanding the inexhaustible doctrine of the bodhisattva mahāsattvas that all phenomena are without selfand should not apprehend any phenomenon whatsoeverOur minds are filled with joy and our bodies feel at ease and soothedThose jinas those great sages teach nothing else Than exactly this kind of knowledge that I haveHe will not teach the sacred doctrine according to the notions that physical forms are fettered or that they are liberatedIn the southeastern directionThe natural mode is without dwelling is nondependent It is the level of peace the stainless domain of the jinas Likewise indeterminate physical forms are neither fettered nor liberated and similarly indeterminate feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are neither fettered nor liberatedThey shun the wrong path And are always upon the true path of peace You should keep in your mind the thought They are all going to become buddhas Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin said to the Bhagavatand likewise they do not make assumptions about the four assurances the four unhindered discernments great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasOr Sumeru the king of mountains They all stand respectfully with hands together in homage These mindful offspring of the Lord of the WorldUpatiṣya and Kolita then went to Ajita of the hair shawl and askedBrahmāif all the conditions for growth from sprouting through to completion are presentBlessed One by all means please grant your blessing so that all māras and opposing forces are overcome so that there are no obstacles and so that in the future this Dharma teaching will be practiced in JambudvīpaThe people said Who else but a rogue would allow the going forth of someone like himI considered Alas I have gone astray From inconceivable unobstructed wisdom There is no one here other than worthy recipients That is what these wise ones are likewill attain the samādhi the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomenaIt is born of learning wisdom and liberative artThey are understood to be physical forms with their bases of cognitionIf you ask why Subhūti it is because in a modality that is neither to be adopted nor to be forsaken going or coming is nonapprehensibleexamine this book of the transcendent perfection of wisdom pay homage to it and so forth and only then consider departing again for their own abodesNoble son you may wonder how bodhisattvas flood high and lowThey will obtain the treasure of the tathāgatas And see ten thousand million buddhas just as I want no one to speak about me in a defamatory way order someone to speak about me so or rejoice in someone so speaking about mePadmaśrīgarbha it is exactly as you say said the Blessed OneAnd offered me this requestSubhūti it is so It is just as you have spokenvenerable Urubilvā KāśyapaOne should write this mantra with saffron or bovine orpiment on birchbarkAh You who are honest glorious and trustworthy Where have you gone leaving us behind At that time the Blessed One outshone akra Brahmā and all the worldly protectors ThenIn samādhi within all dharmasInstead of seizing it in the sky Instantly release the lantern of creaturesBodhisattva will you explain them Venerable Lord it is because all things that are subject to affliction or purification are nonexistentI had immense compassion throughout that time And always my thoughts were of attaining buddha wisdom and yet we do not know the meaning of what the Bhagavān has saidSkillful One saying this you sought out supreme awakening And for many millions of eons you made offerings to the learnedTherefore O sons of the victorious ones you must act to benefit and give up evilThen at that time the Bhagavān in order to make the meaning clearthe rākṣasī named Puṣpadantī the rākṣasī named Makuṭadantī the rākṣasī named Keśinī the rākṣasī named Acalā the rākṣasī named Mālādhārī the rākṣasī named Kuntī the rākṣasī named Sarvasattvojohārī andWhen they have been eaten their bones are scattered around the iron fortresssettled to the north of that village

unfavorable circumstancesthe bodys fluids recede into water the bodys heat recedes into fire and the bodys vital energies recede into windAlternatively one should write the mantra and the persons name

the bases of miraculous powersthey focus on the nature of mind that benefits sentient beings thinking I should save all sentient beings they engage with households without aversion or attachment  they give the Dharma without expectation of a rewardThey will still not have divine eyes And so they will not have that knowledgeIn the buddha realm of the Blessed thusgone worthy perfect Buddha Ratnaketu there are no such instructions that involve reference pointsāradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving the applications of mindfulness and in the same vein all the aforementioned causal attributes as far as the noble eightfold path as entitiesBeneath a tree inhabited by piśācashung with one hundred and eightstring and sixtyfourstring necklacesso he ascended into the sky to the height of seven palm treesThis profound sacred doctrine is neither diminished even when it is not explained nor is it enhanced even when it is explainedHow can it be that this goddess has heard this Dharma teaching so many times and served that many thusgone ones and still she has but a female bodyThe faculty of mindfulness is a gateway to the light of the DharmaThey do not teach a path that is associated with a self a sentient being a lifeforce a soul a human being or a personto perceive all rebirths as though they were hellish statesBased on it they will be able to exert themselves in the four means of magnetizing live by not forsaking any beingBy anointing ones eyes with this lampblack one will be adored by everyonehe sat and sat absorbed in thoughtand the inconceivably numerous words concerning illumination in regard to purification Those are the fourWhat are those ten They are not being fixated on generosity although they aspire to generosity and similarly not being fixated on discipline patience diligence concentration insight the three realms awakening the path or the transcendence of suffering although they aspire to each of themHe then approaches a tree intending to eat of the great fruit it bearsThey continuously remain within tranquility and special insightI will realize the Dharma the state of peace That the best of men realized in the Bodhimaṇḍa Now what is the meaning of aggregatef a woman hears and possesses this Dharma teachingVenerable Lord That is why this is the Great Vehicle of great bodhisattva beingsIf this is his Dharma What for him is antithetical to DharmaThere was a young brahmin who desiring and in search of esoteric instruction left the Middle Country and went to the Southone should swallow it without touching it with ones teethThe bodhisattvas askedSimilarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness also do not come from anywhere they do not go anywhere and they do not abide anywherethey who are immersed in yogic sleep They concentrate upon the pill Their torso resembles that of a lionthe śrāvakas devas nāgasWhere has the child gone I do not see himFor many eons with many kinds of offeringsNo Venerable Lord It would descend to Jambudvīpa absolutely wounded and injured and die or experience mortal sufferingsOn the relative level liberation is a gateway to the absence of obscurationThe fourfold assembly and the worlds of devas alsoVast and pleasing is his arrayThe four main elements are themselves the nature of spaceso I shall name this prince Prasenajit Supreme Lightthey also achieve and maintain the four immeasurable aspirations and so forth up to and including absorption in the cessation of perceptions and feelings HoweverI am cultivating the applications of mindfulnessyou should go to that Sahā worldWith respect to everything it is the same free from conceptswill be made with seven precious attributesIf there were any such apprehensible phenomenaThinking I shall ask the Bhagavān Have I strayed or have I not and the expanse of reality is itself consciousness and the restThose individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas will only achieve an interim state and owing to inappropriate conduct they will incur great misfortune and suffer a decline with respect to the doctrineSimilarly they neither associate the sensory element of the mental faculty the sensory element of mental phenomena and the sensory element of mental consciousness with omniscience nor do they disassociate them therefromThe four great kings understood the greeting and thought We have been dismissed by the BodhisattvaWhen they sit they do so with the motivation May all beings be relieved of the pains of desire anger and dullnessSeeing such a situationWhen he said the letter pa out came the statement The absolute paramārthaHe will do this to benefit many beings to bring happiness to many beings to compassionately care for the world for the welfare betterment and happiness of gods humans and the majority of beingsOur beautiful eyes are as pure and large as lotusesSome had their heads uncovered while the heads of others were coveredbeing impervious to the eight worldly concernsNoble son you may wonder about the character of the bodhisattvas expertise concerning the absence of selfFully understood as false these dogmas are severed at the root and wither like the head of a palm tree never to arise or cease in the futurethey could play the role of a male for me while I could play the role of a female for themSimilarly śrāvakas do not apprehend the sameness of the three timesSimilarly there are views concerning the ten powers of a tathāgata the assurances the unhindered discernments great loving kindness great compassion the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas the understanding of all phenomena the understanding of the aspects of the path and omniscienceIn this way he strove for the benefit of othersThe village girl Sujātā who has done much good in the past Continuously makes offerings thinking May this guide complete his disciplineThe scent of jasmine and royal jasmine Sandalwood and bay leavesThey do not hold them to be pure owing to their sacred threads and auspicious ceremoniesHe states in the middle of that assembly This is my son whom I lost a long time agoYoung man the Bhagavān will always give you the opportunityThey are the inconceivably numerous sūtra words concerning the compositewho commit this transcendent perfection of wisdom to writing or have it committed to writing andThat going forth is for the gracious And ordination for the pureThrough incorrect thought There will be numerous countless thoughtsTherefore Maitreya listen well and retain in your mind what I shall explain to youThese dedications are made without engaging at all in the dualistic attitude that differentiates the subject who makes the dedication and the object to whom the dedication is madeonce born there they suffer from unbearable and savage experiences as well as burningI can calculate noble son the number parts and groups of how many palas are in those mountains how many hundreds of palas or thousands of palas or millions of trillions of palas butMañjuśrī the Tathāgata does not think This sentient being has belief in givingHow do they expound on the teachings using the words prescribed by the BuddhaIn that way in future times There will be those who have no wisdom Yet they who do not engage in it Will make their living by praising it When your gem fell in the ocean You dried out the ocean As the strong and firm leader of human beings you recovered the valuable gemAnd every woman is a vajra yoginīSo it is Kauśika that the transcendent perfection of wisdom is designated as beyond these five lower transcendent perfectionsRather the bodhisattvas themselves are the meditative stabilities and the meditative stabilities are themselves the bodhisattvasWhen the consciousness has just undergone transfer its actions become connected with beings of the hell realmsSees a lake that is a mirage Know that all phenomena are like that In order to benefit delight and satisfy many sentient beingsIt is the absence of yearning for respect It is indifference to lack of respectthey know their meanings exactly as they areEntered homelessness in the presence of the Sugata Seeking to receive the Dharma of that Jina I rejoice in the bodhisattvas overwhelmed by compassion Who give away their wealth grain and jewelsIf he takes it otherwise all his efforts will be in vainIn the morning the sword will burst into flamesThen Sundarananda placed an iron drum six times shoutingdistance away as his targetYoung man that which is called physical restraintWith all his heart he stopped striving after compounded phenomena as well as all kinds of grasping and clingingif they perfect the nine serial steps of meditative absorption exclusively by way of signlessnessThen the man saw that they had come out safe and wellYou shall beautify this entire world and meOne should in turn kill Green Acalawhich is an instruction for bodhisattvas that is possessed by all the buddhasasked the ThusGone One for forgiveness sayingO Vauherī may such and such come to me Hū phaṭAs he made his alms round he arrived at a prostitutes home not knowing whose it wasAs for the substantial offering With the stages of red and yellow firewood and so forthRipens thousands of millions of beings In this supreme unsurpassable yānaAnd the windows and pavilions bent out of shapeSimilarly the real nature of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessāriputra there came a time When I saw infinite thousands of quintillions Of offspring of the highest of humans Who had set out for the supreme highest enlightenment There are many flowering trees growing around the lakes such as mango aśoka campaka amaranth and saffron treesThere is the meditative stability named Devoid of Darknesswhy is it you are collecting tributes and taxes hereSarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin Your eloquence and your teaching of this kind of Dharma to a gathering of devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kiṃnaras mahoragas humans nonhumans upāsakas and upāsikās is excellent ExcellentThey do not ripen upon the element of water upon the element of fire nor upon the element of windThey should don the armor of the emptiness of internal phenomena and don the armor of the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentitiesthe love that is great compassion because it infuses the Mahāyāna with radianceWhen he said the letter a out came the statement Every composite phenomenon is impermanent anityaḥ sarvasaṃskāraḥAnd bestrewn with the petals of various kinds of flowers That is the kind of merit the one with ten strengths had The two nephews began to apply themselves to their studies with diligenceYou are not disturbed at samenessIt is like clothing for the nakedFrom the great hells they will once again proceed to the great hellsāradvatīputra do you think that the designations of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness as void or not void constitute a bodhisattvaThen a god from the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations approached King uddhodana and spoke to himbut they do so without apprehending anythingAnd where with wisdom sentient beings are established That place is the sphere of activity of meditative concentrationAnd because I will not see this delightful sight I cryIf you love me kill your suitor with this poisonNor will I be able to smell any longer the divine scentsThose who understand the meaning Do not say he exists or he does notWhen this fine intellect was questionedThe Buddha the Dharma and the Saṅgha These are the Three JewelsSon of noble family when you use this dhāraṇī of the majestic lion turning backwards which overwhelms everyone who sees him at the time of deathWe bow to you who are dauntless knowing no fearThey fell on that bhagavān throughout the entire ten intermediate eonsBut the elder āriputra has both constructual thought and discriminationDo not say such things to othersHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor endHe will be honored by all beingsBlessed One how do a dying persons sensory fields follow himEach group of parasites has its own respective eighty parasites that have both beaks and mouthsThe Blessed One has said that women are filthy foulsmelling disagreeable and not worthy of being looked uponand shook Meru the king of mountainsAnd likewise over the lord of death and the demon of afflictionsWhen practicing generosity by offering beds and pillowsSome of the goddesses held conches drums clay kettle drums wooden kettle drums lutes and flutes while others sang melodiously and yet others held up reed pipes onestringed lutes and threestringed lutesThey will be reborn in wealthy families for ninety thousand eons and as a universal monarch for eighty thousand eonsThey ask Who is that being whom we have never seen beforethe second door was made of acacialike dreamvisions seen after wakingNone of the gods nor the nāgas akra Brahmā or the guardians of the world Nor any other being in the trichiliocosm could accept such offerings as theseWhen those deities had come from Avalokiteśvaras bodyI dont recall that replied the physicianbody hairs risingsimilarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness of the past are neither fettered nor liberatedtI did not succeed but out of altruism and without hypocrisy I engendered compassion for beings andBecause they do not know the cycle of dependent origination Their path is the river of sufferingthen they would not be intent on unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentThe seasons and the stars all moved in a balanced mannerāradvatīputra it is in this way that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomWe are delighted and overjoyed to have heard Such a supreme reassurance as this The prophecy of our highest complete enlightenmentand he said to the venerable āriputraAt the same time Lalitavyūha made it so that the Bodhisattva who was sitting at the seat of awakening became visible to all sentient beings living in the five types of existencesAgain Subhūti there are great bodhisattva beings who can indeed see with their eyes of flesh across an entire trichiliocosmWe pray that you grant the gift of the DharmaIf even the four great kings show their faces when one holds this sūtra Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosmso I will teach him the Pratyekabuddha Vehiclehe is neither worthy of offerings nor unworthy of offeringsSimilarly the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path are neither heard nor seen owing to the nature of phenomena being inanimatebodhisattvas respect and pursue all the points of training and all the prescriptionsOne should place in her right hand a knife of iron or other materialWhat is the knowledge of the minds condition It is not objectifying the mindthe joints of their limbs do not protrudeand which is neither identified with the mindset of the śrāvakas nor with the mindset of the pratyekabuddhasanger enmity hypocrisy annoyance violence jealousy miserliness and prideSuch fools will not hear the Dharma They will be deaf and without thoughta virtuous spiritual friendWhen the Bhagavān was teaching this teaching of this chapter Facing EverywhereThe lamp saidI am the Dharma King who has appeared in the world I am the crusher of existencethat those phantom persons emanated by the tathāgatasso when practicing the transcendent perfection of wisdom they perceive that all things are gathered within this transcendent perfection of wisdomWill become free of terrible fears will be fearless Will never abandon the aggregate of correct conduct Noble son it consists in the bodhisattvas making others retain and understand the teachings without any concern for material thingsThe priests had their meal in the royal palaceTheir eyes gouged out they are deprived of happinessSeated there the Bodhisattva attained a onepointed state of mindat the time of bowel evacuationThe bodhisattva mahāsattva who has those higher cognitions manifests all the manifestations of samādhi and teaches the Dharma to beingsLet alone obtaining the entire sūtra If you see that there are many present Among your followers who have bad conductEven those sentient beings who suffering in the desolate place of saṃsāra have become polluted by their negative views and do not know the means to reach the higher realms and liberationand those people in the four continents were to do no other work than growing mustard and from time to time the king of the nāgas would send down rainDwelling as mighty lords in the family of a universal monarch they will establish sentient beings many hundreds of billion trillions in number on the path of the ten virtuous actionsowing to the fact that sentient beings are uncreatedNoble son you may wonder how bodhisattvas move in a flow of virtuous qualitiesProstrations to all the saṅgha dwelling in the ten directionsRākṣasas with copper hair and teeth Copper eyes and arms Copper hammers for feet Copper noses and mouthsFor the sake of accomplishing the benefit of beings There is nothing that has not been done beforeThey will always follow in pursuit from whence they came to hear this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomBut it is impossible that someone like me would ever move from the king of treesIf all living beings were to eat for an eon an amount of this food equal to Mount Sumeru in size it still would not be depletedYou however should be at the forefrontThough I have done much for this king he has not taken care of meI set my mind on the enlightenment of a buddhabut who nonetheless lack the transcendent perfection of wisdomYour work to achieve awakening exalted by the force of your perseverance was infiniteIf one abides by them the monk who has gone forth and been ordained in the wellproclaimed Dharma and Vinaya will be a genuine monkJoining his hands in devotion toward the Bhagavān he asked himThey have no longing for women and have unconfused minds They are peaceful completely peaceful and undefiled Their wife is the joy in the DharmaLike a celestial maiden in the garden of Indra Māyādevī lives in King uddhodanas female quarters She is fit to be the mother of the Bodhisattva Thus it appears that the purity of the family described by the Bodhisattva can be seen only in the ākya clanMoreover Kauśika fundamental ignorance is empty of fundamental ignorance Similarly the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death are empty of aging and death and the restthis is formationand then it lit up the place where the arrow was at the outer periphery of this buddhafield They will attain the throne of Brahmā The throne of a king and the throne of akraOffering ones hands represents the offering of the bodhisattvas Dharma hands to all beings ThereforeBut then on reflection it occurred to them The noble Saṅgharakṣita possesses miraculous powers and great mightThe suns rays fall on foulsmelling thingsThe meaning of the scripture is vast And therefore it is called vast and the bodhisattva mahāsattva Padmaśrī attained the white lotus of the good Dharma samādhiAll Doubts DiminishedThey are studded with a variety of jewels and hung with a variety of adornmentsThis is the door of the Dharma called The Inexhaustible LampOnly then would he cater to his own needs It was as a result of this activity that the great Brahmā offered the Bodhisattva this drop of nectarāriputra in this regard the birthlessness of all phenomena is the primary sense of a section of the DharmaFor those who are careful in the Buddhas teaching For those who have perfect aspirationsand the ripened fruits of mixed actions are mixedit is the termination of all conceptual elaborationas residing on the level of nirvāṇathat is called the unproduced purified of the three spheresI should go find this monk GautamaSeeing him in that way she was satisfied elated and delighted She felt extremely happy buoyant and joyfulHaving impaired training They saw this wrong of theirsI entrust to you these bodhisattva mahāsattvas these great śrāvakas this enlightenment of buddhahood this world realm these precious platforms these precious trees and these devas who are honoring menanda struck his drum target twice shoutingdistance away but he could not shoot any fartherI destroyed ignorance With blazing vajrahard wisdom And attained the state of the ten powers That is why I now abandon the crosslegged postureThey sat on a bed of grassYoung brahmin as we are wellknown brahmins we cannot join just any renunciant orderBecause of his love the body of this sage Is inaccessible to poison weapons and fire Since the love that he feels transcends the worldO Lavaṇāmbha You are fierce You are vast O terrifying one Burn the limbs of suchandsuch Burn his flesh Burn his skin Burn even his nails Burn his bones and the marrow in his bones He cuts the salt breaks the salt and cooks the salt When the salt of the earth is being seized how could one sleep how could one find pleasure If suchandsuch dwells a hundred leagues away behind a hundred rivers in a city surrounded by iron walls and protected by cobrasat that very place enthrall that person having first bound the salt O ciṭi ciṭi Vikloli Please bring here suchandsuch a person SvāhāBurning his arm he made an offering to those stūpas of the Tathāgata for seventytwo thousand yearsSubhūti it is because the essential nature of the emptiness of internal phenomena will not attain emancipation from the three world systems and will not come to rest in omniscienceFor all of them he was someone who had attained discernmentjust as this the aggregatesnanda leave aside this description of the physical states of those individuals who will be reborn in the inferior realms having defamed the sacred doctrineand the other causal attributes from there up to and including the noble eightfold path and up to the three gateways to liberation are all empty of notions of I and mineWhy have you gone forth amongst these thieving sons of the ākyaWho will become a buddha excellent among humans Named BodhyaṅgapuṣpakaraLesser anger is when ones anger causes one to accumulate negative acts through mere words and unpleasant or harsh expressionsWith his special insight he outshines the entire world of gods humans and demigods including Māra Brahmā and all the gods mendicants and brahminsThis body is like grass a tree a wall or the scenery along a road it is inactive actionless inanimate insubstantial and composed of elementsSubhūti the buddhas the nature of the buddhas the real nature of the buddhas the essential nature of the buddhas and the defining characteristics of the essential nature of the buddhasSo it is Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings should never lack the transcendent perfection of wisdomthe great king Vaiśravaṇa the great king Dhṛtarāṣṭra the great king Virūḍhaka and the great king Virūpākṣa each surrounded by his respective attendantsAlthough I will not pass into nirvāṇa I state that I am going to pass into nirvāṇaThey will also smell the scents of the bodies of the deva maidens and the deva wivesFor all actions recite a hundred thousand mantrasthe eyeconsciousnessbase do not swerve from the tathatāthey will not attain emancipation in the state of omniscienceYou have an excellent body like a clear skyConsidering what ought to be done to train those monks youthful Mañjuśrī projected an emanation in the form of a monk on the road in front of themAnd the jinas attained their qualities Through seeking this supreme samādhi of peace Thusgone ākyamuni Blessed One who has brought us to this Jewel WorldAnd I asked him questions The newly cured monk said Preceptor I have achieved the aim I had in going forthWhat is ultimately destroyed does not become destroyed hence it is called indestructible Secondly those who are pratyekabuddhas And also śrāvakas with miraculous powersNoble son all the tathāgatas have spent sixteen eons wandering in search of this sixsyllable mahāvidyā so therefore how could bodhisattvas know itThey have a body that is the color of gold And emanate countless manifestationsThe Bodhisattva asked the god My friendJoyous auspicious imperishable and without sorrowāriputra it is because all phenomena are characterized as being unborn and unceasingKing uddhodana had a seat prepared for the sage Asita and said to the gatekeeperKnowing this they demonstrate the sacred doctrine accordingly to sentient beingsone will not have to fear the lower realmsdefeat the hordes of demons and awaken to unexcelled and complete buddhahoodsentient beings do not understandSimilarly in numerous ways the windlike bodhisattvas employ their unhindered and unobstructed wisdom with respect to correct understandings and eloquenceSinglefaced with elongated eyesneither originated nor unoriginatedThe Blessed One replied It is the prayers he made What did he pray forStill in doubt the monks questioned him who severs all doubts the Blessed BuddhaHe teaches the Dharma in the form of śvara to those beings who are to be guided by śvaraWhat god nāga or yakṣa can frighten meTo perfect the marks of buddhahood he does not rest in the uncompounded andhe proclaimed these satisfying words in lionlike fashionsimilarly Subhūti the vehicle does not come to restI shall never part from the path of training that the Blessed One has prescribed even if it were to cost my lifewhose results have matured which follow their course like an irrigation channelIn that respect Mañjuśrī there is no duality by which emptiness and awakening could be made into twoWho in the future Will listen to this samādhi Bhagavān I have reprimanded myself for that day and nightBhikṣus at that time the sixteen young princes having faith together renounced home for homelessnessThe bodhisattvas bowed to the Blessed Ones feet sat down before himWith the application of the samaya seal They should enter by the open pathwayBuilding a boat he frees himself and can save others He takes them to the best of shores the one that is free from fear and sufferingAs they saw the structure they were satisfied uplifted and full of rejoicing In a joyful mood they were happy and delightedIn this connection the Bhagavān concisely taught the characteristics of dependent arising as followsThey will have become vessels for the Buddhas Dharmaall the lord buddhas who reside thereinThose who come with clods and sticks And likewise abuse and threatsSon of noble family through these two instructions will one attain the absorption that encapsulates all meritAnd attained the supreme goalWhat is the root of unreal constructionIt would not even count for one thousandth or onebillionth of it It would not even count as any part any number worthy of consideration simile or approximation of any kindHe is the one with a voice like the roar of a lion or a bullAs it was before so it is afterward Know that all phenomena are like that Therefore I request that the Blessed One teach this mantra so that other beings too may be protected by itWhen he has put them on he performs various actions and experiences happiness and sufferingWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas trust in the teachings on the principle of the various ways consist ineither in the usual way or by visiting them in their own dwellingshe is the One with the Power That Comes from Knowing the Cause and Effect of All Actions in the Past Present and the FutureHere with the sun of wisdom I dispelled the fog of delusion debased with impurities Thick with views of arrogance and anger Thus illuminating what was darkened for so longEloquent one with earlobes like golden plumb lines this is excellentOnce Im gone the spoils Ive won in debate will be taken awayand similarly the more they wish to teach and grant instruction in the aspects of emptiness from the emptiness of internal phenomena up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentitiesSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomWithout anyone asking you to speak of it You are praising your own conductYou are a physician who removes pain and a guide for those who need guidanceThey have no true meaning there is nothing designated and no conceptThis is what we call a heapthey train without training in the powersThat king had that degree of dedication That for a full thousand eons without weariness He did no other work in the ten directions Until he obtained that which was called the DharmaThey are devoid of mind their nature is not mind They are momentary and are devoid of sound Likewise sons of the Victorious One the Tathāgata understands beings who are obscured by various kinds of suffering as well as the conduct of beings who are to be converted in keeping with their various dispositionsSo also do I empower youA second time and a third time the Bhagavān with his right hand took hold of the right hands of those in the entire gathering of bodhisattvas and saidare noble onesKauśika do you think you can guard protect and offer sanctuary to the tathāgatas or to an emanation of the tathāgatasThey do not apprehend the emptiness of ultimate reality as the emptiness of ultimate realitySome give as places for resting during the dayit is because dreams have an essential nature of nonentity and the essential nature of nonentity is nonapprehensiblewhereby the king or his minister could rightly say to himSimilarly Senior āradvatīputra feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are also nonexistent and nonapprehensibleImbued with renunciation dwelling in solitude maintaining detachment and remaining in a state of cessation they should cultivate the support for miraculous ability combining meditative stability of scrutiny with the formative force of exertionDivine son when a bodhisattva great beingThese beings had their suffering pacified And experienced feelings of happinessWhy Because the appearance of the buddhas does not benefit anyoneThe bodhisattva Satyananda declaredWhen he said the letter gha out came the statement Eradicating the darkness of delusion and the thick veils of ignorance ghanapaṭalāvidyāmohāndhakāravidhamanaDuring the period of his teachings there was a priest named Wealthy as the Great Sal TreeAn ocean of wisdom with power both vast and pureThere is no mundane or supramundane virtuous accumulation that is not practiced by bodhisattvasOh you think that light is darknesswith the sweetest scent and the most beautiful colorHe sat there for a second intermediate eon but still did not attain the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahooda hundred thousand eons and so on up to remembering many quintillions of eonsThey do not wish for fame Those who remain in the disciplines of mendicancyTherefore monks you should exclude from this Dharma and Vinaya those persons who have killed an arhatThen when they are reborn they will again proceed from great hells to great hellsIt is to be without frowns It is to be pleasant It is to have correct conduct It is to be friendlyThese are called contaminated phenomenathat some people took those individual seeds and split each single one into as many pieces as there were seedswhere it spends its time until deathIn the ocean they become one flavorthey do not dedicate it to the level of the śrāvakasThis concludes Skill in Methods the second chapter of the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good DharmaRather bodhisattvas minds knowingly take birth to ripen sentient beingsthe inconceivably numerous kinds of comprehension of names concerning the kleśasSo do not instruct them in the Disciple VehicleFrom plants trees bushes mountains and rocks There came the words phenomena have no existence and so illuminates all the surrounding areas within the distance of one two or three leaguesSister you just cant leave it be You must want me to be kicked outBlessed One the praises of the ocean could be incredibly numerousBecause ultimately all phenomena are utterly unarisengreat coral tree flowers spider lily flowers great spider lily flowers and divine flowers which were scattered upon the Bhagavān and his assemblyand with her sportedat any location that is free from harmHow is desire purifiedThe real nature of the Tathāgata is not distinct from the real nature of all thingsNoble son because they are endowed with ten qualities bodhisattvas possess a subtle intellectThe appearance of his sacred Dharma will remain for seven million five hundred thousand yearsWe just left because we did not like itAnd so having been perfectly awakened by my perception I proclaim it to an array of monks nunsNo root and no ground to stand uponThey have indeed possessed all the transcendent perfectionsThere are also some who subsist on just a single juniper berry sesame seed or grain of riceI proclaim to you and make it known to you That to the extent that a person contemplates this I was overcome with desire and envy And had this hero cut into piecesOn this seat my body may wither and rot And my skin my bones and my flesh may dissolveand the consciousness which reincarnates amongst the beings of the formless realms is empty tooAnd expellinganything at all Will one accomplish through meditation aloneWas followed by a billion devas And was praised when he came to the city Bhagavat this is extraordinarily marvelousOh the bodhisattvas great power The bodhisattvas great miracles The bodhisattvas great manifestationsFor so long he has given up laughing at and mocking others Instead he has made everyone happy guarded his words and spoken in a way that has made others happyThey had contentment great power and few desires They were free of grasping and were established in buddha qualitieswho is going to retain and recite these names of the tathāgatas should rise in the morning clean up andNoble son I remember going to as many worlds as there are atoms in the world for the sake of obtaining this sixsyllable mahāvidyāIn order to find him I came here from that townAlong the way he defeated an opponent in debate and then bound him to his chariotwho has paths to enlightenment accumulated within his bodyIn doing so they practice liberality while adhering to the ownership of propertythey do not hanker for the levels of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas and much less still for the levels of ordinary peopleThe nose is empty of a self and what belongs to a selfSome bodhi trees were made of sandalwood and were three hundred thousand leagues highFriends what is the reason why this has occurredthinking one thing but professing anotherIn their hands they proffered many types of jewelry such as necklaces bracelets armbands gold threads and pearl necklacesbeliefs were eradicatedThese are called the faculties endowed with the knowledge of all thingsit is earth alone that nurtures it to put forth a stem and green leavesShe is the source of all goddessesSimilarly in the same vein as beforeI possess mental phenomenaSimilarly they may attract by the noble eightfold path and the other causal attributes those sentient beings who are attracted by the four immeasurable aspirations the four meditative concentrations and the four formless absorptions as well as those who are attracted by the four applications of mindfulness the four correct exertions the four supports for miraculous ability the five faculties the five powers the seven branches of enlightenment and the noble eightfold pathWho verbalizes Suffering should be recognized origination should be eliminated cessation should be realized the path should be practicedThe village girl Sujātā also collected all the hair and the beard of the Bodhisattva Thinking that it must be sacredHe will explain and teach the hitherto unheard of the unprecedented the instructions of the omniscient one the deep and profound sūtras the dhāraṇīs tolerance and the groundsand the unshakable liberated mind Young man that is the restraint of the mindHero who subdues the unsubdued The unsubdued are subdued by youIt then occurred to him The six sense fields emerge when there is name and formOne should make ones mind free from indifferenceVenerable Lord if the notion of the eyes as afflicted is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of the eyes as purified become a bodhisattvaGive me the sixsyllable queen of mahāvidyāsSubhūti when great bodhisattva beings who are irreversible dwell as householdersYoung man in the past countless vast immeasurable inconceivable unfathomable asaṃkhyeya eons agoAs the group of six did whatever their selfappointed duties called for they would never leave the gate into Jetavana unattendedThe second aspect of liberation ensues when formless beings endowed with internal perception observe external physical formsProstrations to the tathāgata Buddha Joyous King VīrasenaHow many such sections are thereSimilarly the transcendence of all other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path is always without fearNot the domain of the ordinary individual and not the domain of the arhat such is the domain of the bodhisattvaThis youth appears far more beautiful than Vaiśravaṇainclude the knowledge of the fruit of entering the stream knowledge of the other fruits up to and including knowledge of the fruit of individual enlightenment andThe nasal faculty will be purifiedin the beginning they attract sentient beings exclusively through the transcendent perfection of generosityWhat you may ask is this world with its gods humans and antigodsin full possession of attentionO Vajrayoginī hū phaṭthe recollection of the Buddha the recollection of the Dharma the recollection of the SaṅghaOne should pronounce this mantra over it seven times put it in a red unbaked jar and seal it with the great sealin the same way when the element of consciousness has undergone transferNow Candrabhūti rose from his seatMoreover gathering herbs from the groundThis body is inert like the earth selfless like water lifeless like fire impersonal like the wind and nonsubstantial like spaceSir take us young women We have no husbandIt is empty of the nature of seeingThe lifespan of this bodhisattva who has attained enlightenment will be estimableHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of external and internal phenomenahow should they train in the transcendent perfection of generosityIn this regard bodhisattvas think as followsMoreover nanda when on the one hand there are some sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who for an eon a period exceeding an eon a hundred eons a thousand eons a hundred thousand eons many hundreds of eons many thousands of eons many hundred thousands of eons or many hundreds of billion trillion eons honor venerate respect and make offerings with flowers garlands perfume unguents powders religious robes clothing parasols victory banners ribbons and diverse musical sounds to the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas of the world systems of the eastern direction numerous as the sands of the River Ganges and similarly to the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas of the world systems of the southern western and northern directions along with the nadir the zenith and likewise the four intermediate directions numerous as the sands of the River Ganges andContemplate wrathful Vajrapāṇi Youthful and with majestic poisewho have impaired eyesightHe looked with his divine sight into the heavens wondering whose blessing this could beis neither afflicted nor purified and is neither enhanced nor diminishedThe aspectless is explained as the nonperception of any dharmasmonks should not grant ordination into the monkhood to persons who have not yet reached twenty yearsanother bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in the state of one who follows the meaningThan from endlessly offering numerous various worlds That are all filled with precious jewels Friends the body of a tathāgata is born of innumerable good worksDivine son understanding this utter emptiness is awakeningThey will say the words I am a bodhisattva And those words will spread in every directionThey will know the devas of bhāsvara Their deaths and rebirth and those there for the first timeSuch is the bodhisattvas excellent power of retentionThe root of virtue is always shared with others whenever a bodhisattva proclaims the words Buddha Dharma and Saṅgha to others or when he brings the Buddha Dharma and Saṅgha to mind while making a gift or when he mentally cultivates generosity discipline patience diligence concentration or insight or when he proclaims these six perfections to others and causes those beings to reflect on themIf the ash streaks downward the water jar will remain fullWill not have success In this inverted conductThe words śrāvaka and solitary buddha will not even exist there The sugatas who lived in the past Were omniscient and without outflowsIn front of the patient a buddha image a buddha reliquary or an image of Brahmā akra or the four great kings should be placed on a stool or on a casket and marked with the four sealsand what is not perceived is neither presumed nor repudiatedThe whole of rāvastī is your field and fatherland so seek out alms and live on themThey have no quarrels They live alone in the forest A great cloud filled with water rises up and having risen covers all the worlds in the allcontaining realm of a billion worldsThus noble son bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities remain in the wildand two strong men then arrive and support him on his left and right sidesIt teaches the nondual nature of all phenomena and is a gateway to the nonoccurrence of all phenomenaThen out of great craving which is impelled by the wind of ones previous karmaThe king then said to the Blessed OneThat is why it is called acceptanceThat sentient beings are afflicted has nothing to do with causes and conditionsand said to be like the moon reflected in waterśvarataught them from this Dharma teaching by chanting the following verses on entering through the doorway of the samādhi of physical restraintSenior Subhūti what is a great bodhisattva beingI rejoice in those who develop the aspirationAll the birds that there are In the deva or the human worldszincWere established in the wisdom of buddhahood When they had heard that Dharma For example I can count the drops in the vast ocean butThere noble son the sun

on a lion throne teaching such profound matterswhat a wonder this isCall our son Koṣṭhilathey entail excessive attachment and longing for the objects of the five sensesThe Lord of the World taught the true conduct Just as is practiced by wise bodhisattvasand It is difficult for all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas to understand itthey focus principally on generating compassion toward all these beings andNoble son bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities are experts on the relativeto establish them in the Dharma teachings andI will act properly and renounce flattery hypocrisy and envythey recollect These are our teachers teachings and so they apply themselves to them in a most excellent wayYoung man those are the ten benefits for the bodhisattva mahāsattvas from maintaining patience and being kindBecause we have never ceased from our prayers for omniscient wisdom Bhagavān the Tathāgata has made us understand sayingSeeing the three existences as being like a dream and becoming free of desireThe yogin adept in meditationPūraṇas teaching heard they cast it aside like an empty bottle and moved onThe domain of manifesting the attitudes of the disciples and the solitary sages without sacrificing the qualities of the Buddha such is the domain of the bodhisattvaIn the same way lesser negativity takes one to the lower realms just as great negativity doesthe sounds of emptiness signlessness and aspirationless will be stirred by the external sounds of the windRather they begin their mendicant walk at one end and proceed until they have received what they needHe does not remain in nirvāṇaBhaiṣajyarāja if in the later times after the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa a bodhisattva mahāsattva teaches this Dharma teaching to the fourfold assemblyNārāyaṇa bodhisattva great beings should train in all the  kinds of conduct of sentient beingsSubhūti when certain great bodhisattva beings lacking the transcendent perfection of wisdom over eons equal in number to the sands of the River Ganges offer their gifts of the sacred doctrine to all sentient beings do you think that they would generate many merits on this basisHaving recited that verse the bhikṣunīs said to the BhagavānDevas and asuras encircled the Jina The supreme human who entered RājagṛhaIn the past you always provided others with every comfortA paternal aunt also a motherinlawAre also the three nonreturnersYoung man it is the bodhisattva mahāsattvas evenness of mind toward all beingsAnd what practice ought to be doneBoth of these actions become root transgressions This is the seventh root transgressionIf you dont accept us now as we crave pleasure You will quickly become a loser in this worldCollected the cream from the top And respectfully prepared a mealit is not with his physical eyes but because he has inner visual consciousnesspearlsBased upon gains and honors They will desire the intellects accomplishmentsIn order to further guard the Bodhisattva each of the young ākya men had five hundred chariots at their disposal and along with each chariot were five hundred infantrymen Likewise they placed five hundred young men by the southern western and northern city gates to guard the Bodhisattva All the men were armed trained in combat skilled in archery and javelin throwing and were as strong as powerful wrestlers In order to further guard the Bodhisattva each of the young ākya men had five hundred chariots at their disposal and along with each chariot were five hundred infantrymenIt is that with respect to which there is no function of consciousnessThis is the acquisition of the five perpetuating aggregatesThey saideight were playmatesThe second resembles smokeAt that the elder āriputra fell silentthe fourteen aspects of emptiness the eight aspects of liberationMañjuśrī for what reason Did this guide of men emit this single ray of lightThey move without moving and without upsetting the characteristic purity of the nature of all phenomenaOne will not sink in waterwill split open his foreheadYoung man you should train by thinking I will practice completely pure physical conduct in that waySeated there they entertained this thoughtand with their heads bowed down and their hands placed together in homage they spoke in one voice to the bhagavān tathāgata ākyamuniThe hands fingers were connected by a webMañjuśrī the gathering here wishes to hear the Dharma from you Therefore please go ahead and speak some words to those who are gathered hereThey each kept just a single garment for themselves and offered the remaining garments and jewelry to

including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities were entities and not nonentitiesThey will think of the buddhas the supreme human beings And always conceive of the jinas as their fatherWhat boon shall I grant youThey think If I depend on those who have no wisdom There will be no higher rebirth let alone the attainment of enlightenment They quickly attain the enlightenment of

unstinting loving kindness even toward sentient beings when there are actually no sentient beingsThe extrasensory powers are not emptiness and emptiness is not the extrasensory powersThey who hear and retain this sūtra in the degenerate times Are wise individuals who possess the treasure of the sugatasyet without being arrogantThey had in fact made it appear like the gods Miśraka GardenHis

repliedThose who always meditate on this sūtra of peace Will attain power and possess the highest strengthsSome are to be converted by listening to the DharmaI shall create a beautiful wall and gates And men and women without an equalDue to their practice of special insight that sees through all phenomena they are unimpededin order to serve the sick dharmabhāṇaka for whom there was no medicine she used her own flesh and blood to heal himphysical forms are pure and all other phenomena attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are pure owing to the purity of the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationSubhūti in the same veinHe remembered the supreme sage Jina Kāśyapa And saw what an unfavorable rebirth he himself had obtained From the magnificent brilliant and resplendent uṣṇīṣa upon his head shone forth millions of circles of lightāriputra in the parable the man sees that he has brought the children out from the burning houseIn any event they will not fall

Shines with his own radianceIn her raised right hand she holds a red lotusOne who is in conformity with everything does not move from the nature of the dharmasthe samādhi of possessing faithafter extending their own lifespan through their blessingsand the second gesture is to penetrate exactly the profound principle of the Dharma without being afraidThey develop mutual attachment and cling to each otherensure the unbroken continuity of the lineage of the Three JewelsI will give to the Bodhisattva king As an act of worshipAs he was strolling through the park he saw a beautiful and pleasant rose apple treeOne effects protection from all types of fear merely by reciting the mantraMust never take placeEmanations of the BuddhaThe Dharma of that Bhagavān who had passed into nirvāṇa remained for a hundred thousand quintillion years What being in the three existences Would not give their flesh and bloodYou know well all beings actionsall the great oceans rivers bays torrents streams brooks and springs andnot to do anything negativeThere would be no way to restore his spiritual practiceWhen a donation is given to himHe is the marvelous object of offering and a great field of merit The field for those wishing for merit and the giver of the fruit of immortalityThe eyes are like water bubblesthey are enclosed in a membranein a world system called Most FragrantThey had trunks of gold and leaves of silver and were bedecked with a variety of adornmentsby the power of compassion for sentient beings you will expound various classes of Mahāyāna sūtras in the villages towns market places provinces countries and kings palaces manifesting in various forms with appropriate attire and conductand defilement will arise and purification will not occurand he will be a holder of their teachingone will interrupt the livelihood of all who live thereBut she feels the child in her womb stir at the touch of very hot food and drinkA bodhisattva may be a king or a great minister who is rich wealthy in possession of many enjoymentsWith that thought he hung his sword from his neck in surrender and came outYoung brahmin I will see that they give their consent right away and returnthey will not be controlled by the mind Rather the mind will come under their controlMoreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationIt was draped in cloth that was not woven and covered with divine clothing from Tuṣita that was as soft and pleasant to the touch as downAlas Sentient beings engage in negative physical verbal and mental conductYou should apply it and circulate it Enter into the Buddhas teachings Like an elephant in a house of reeds Whenever someone questioned me About my understanding of this samādhiThey are concerned with this life They are concerned with their next lifeShe was not afflicted by attachment anger or delusionHow are their perfections of wisdomHe must be either deluded or ignorant Since he does not rise up quickly and fleeOf qualities of a buddha And that is my distinctive characteristic Ajita those eight princes who were the sons of Bhagavān Candrasūryapradīpa had great miraculous powersTadyathā jvale mahājvale ukke mukke aḍe aḍāvati nṛtye nṛtyāvati iṭṭini viṭṭini ciṭṭini nṛtyani nṛtyāvati svāhāRuler of this land may your life be longThis being the case it is for these reasons that those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvasIn each of the mansions appeared  jewel treesA domain of introspective insight wherein one does not arrest voluntary reincarnation in the world such is the domain of the bodhisattvaBodhisattvas should maintain equanimity without any regard for the joys and delights of sensual pleasuresIf you give rise to the mind of awakening In order to help all embodied beingsThose who continuously learn the Mahāyāna are good contemplative beingsWhat is samenessThus their acquaintance will in time bear fruit He said to KolitaI will explain the wonderful and marvelous attributes of great bodhisattva beings who practice this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomHis palace with its corridors skylights and porticoes became covered in dust and crumbled downSome raised their arms and lamented loudlyLeading him we will promptly Bring him under your controlThus one will obtain successThe gods thus strewed the ThusGone One with celestial flowersthe ministers of Rājagṛha sent a message to King Bimbisāra saying Your Majesty your fathers time has comeand a cooling rain of flower petals fell on the groundOne should drink fresh ginger and cumin seeds with curds or the scum of boiled rice together with saltare śramaṇassimilarly when they have turned away from feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessThe colors of the young god filled the whole of Jetavana with a great lightHundreds of thousands of human and divine instruments soundedTake seven steps in the direction of the forests They will have the superior merit The disciple should be purified with the water in the four vases And the water of mantraEvil one you are weak Like a young bull pained by a heavy loadSubhūti this is the vehicle of the bodhisattvas which maintains sameness throughout the three timesThey were sitting crosslegged on lion thrones made of precious materials at the foot of trees made of precious materials in all eight directions from the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha ākyamuniThreatened with the punishment of yakṣas They will not be wellat a time when ten countless ages had passedAlso they teach the doctrines that the other sense organs up to and including the mental faculty are imbued with sufferingVenerable Lord So they would regress and become degenerate if they were to engage in such deeds destitute of the sacred doctrine This is why bodhisattvas should restrain their verbal actionsThus by applying himself diligently Saṅgharakṣita came to understand saṃsāras everrevolving five cyclesHe is not pastConsciousness is pure owing to the purity of formative predispositionsThey must have gratitude and know how to conduct themselves appropriatelyAs a comparison I can know the number of atoms butWhat are the six transcendent perfections and likewise those other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighty minor marksthese are conducive to individual enlightenmentA most precious wishfulfilling jewel Rests on the crown of his headComing as they do from esteemed lineages and families they bring fame and fortuneThen the bodhisattva Prajñākūṭa asked Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta questions by chanting these versesand its perfume will emanate for seven days more after that It is rejected by the foolish and ignorant It is not the level of the numerous śrāvakasakra Brahmā the guardians of the world and other gods Stand by joyfully and happily with folded handsthe aggregate of meditative stability is still discernedthe light rays circled around the trichiliocosm dispelling all darknessNo Such a woman would not really exist so what would there be to transformThus it is necessary to know king of gods that among all the worships rendered to the Tathāgata Dharmaworship is the very bestAs for ox or elephant This should be the flesh of one from which musk and the like emerges Based on the single material cause of it eating a ketaka flowerSubsequently you will not experience those sufferings associated with conduct that pertains to cyclic existencetapplauded him by chanting these verses some are on the seventh bhūmiOf the protector bodhisattvas are taughtAnd he will teach this highest enlightenmentThe brilliant white necklaces of pearl have faded and collected dustOh no It seems the young Siddhārtha is dyingFirst one should reduce the milk to one cupEstablishing innumerable sentient beings on the paths to the higher realms and liberationThey will never dedicate it so that they themselves may acquire meritTo make the offering to me and my retinue the practitioner should remain with onepointed concentration in an isolated placeVenerable Lord The transcendent perfection of wisdom is endowed with the completely perfect ten powers because it cannot be crushed by any antagonistsThis is the fourth root transgression of beginner bodhisattvasWhoever one looks at with unblinking eyes while reciting the mantra that person will become enthralledand the more they wish to benefit sentient beings with food clothing bedding mats medications which cure ailments and other useful resourcesI possess such ethical disciplinecuts it into four parts and then examines the quartered carcass as he stands or sitsThen because all phenomena are unborn Upon seeking them they do not see themMy king may you my family and the people of the kingdom forgive mewere it too weak they would become lazyTo embrace awakening altruisticallywhen I was in the street of the poor begging for my food the Licchavi Vimalakīrti came along and said to mewhen the north was down the south was upThese benefits have been taught to me By you the Lord of humans Mañjuśrī the bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have this third quality who teach this Dharma teaching after the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa in the final times when the Dharma is coming to an endAlso teach this supreme yāna For the sake of the happiness of all beings The wise ones will know them all in one instant These are the benefits from possessing this sūtraWhen he said the letter ai out came the statement The noble path is

have anklebones that do not protrude and calf bones similar to reeds or the calves of antelopes With such features on their feet may they gently and leisurely proceed to the vajra throne at the seat of awakeningDo they avoid the conduct of very strong desire Do they avoid the conduct of very strong anger Do they avoid the conduct of very strong ignoranceMonk as all phenomena are always clear they are unsulliedAdorned with parasols and banners And covered with a network of pearls and jewelsBhagavat is Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara not comingThe sāl that most wonderful of trees is now in

asked as followsThey were teachers of the pure Dharma and had attained the perfection of the supreme powers of a bodhisattvaSimilarly they do not consider whether sounds are connected with odorsBy engaging in ceaseless activity You should worship the tathāgatas by longing for the Dharma In order to liberate those who have gone to negative forms of existenceThe Bhagavān Tathāgata Amitābha fully awakened to unsurpassable completely perfect enlightenment ten eons agoWhatever it is that they try to do They will be prevented by my emanationsit goes together with spaceFor a long time they have been increasing lower existencesThe best of munis sitting on the Dharma throne Meditated in the samādhi of the supreme infinite teaching When they do not fabricate conceptions of any kind they think

Tathāgata Devarāja will be twenty intermediate eons longFor the sake of many beings and as a compendium to the tantras That elaborately teach the yogic practices Lokeśvāra Lord of the World taught this manual of practiceI can calculate the accumulation of that merit but I cannot calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvaras accumulation of meritA wheelbearing monarchs quantity of merit is not even a hundredth the amount of thatThey are a sanctuary they are a shelter They are a refuge they are eyes and a lampAt this time through the power of the thusgone onesBlessed One we too will take hold of this sūtra and grasp it read it understand it and teach it extensively to othersThey will always be dedicated to buying and selling Attached to drinking they will cast aside their shame The Blessed One said to them Come join me thereby allowing their going forthretains contact with all its facultiesThe way that they are following Is the way of those who are fraudulent in weights The way of those who are fraudulent in measuresThey who have come here on this day They also are beyond enumerationVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is undifferentiatedJoyful and pleased he rose from his seat draped his shawl over one shoulder set his right knee on the ground andit is because the five psychophysical aggregates have an essential nature of nonentity and the essential nature of nonentity is nonapprehensibleThat buddha realm will have limitless qualities of this kindYoung man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of words of boundlessness What are the four kinds of words of boundlessnessHe is utterly stainless pure and in possession of a very wholesome mindIf you ask why that is the case O child of enlightened heritage it is because all things are empty of inherent existenceand similarly where egotism possessiveness acquisition latent impulses ensnarement andHowever relatively the vinaya of the bodhisattva great beings disturbs all classes of demons in all the limitless and boundless worlds in the ten directions and conquers all hostile forces emptiness of essential naturehairs that grow from his head and the hairs of his bodyThen the Tathāgata the arhat the Samyaksaṃbuddha Padmottama having received the sixsyllable queen of mahāvidyās went to the realm named PadmottamaHave a loving mind And speak to them of austerity ultimately all phenomena are utterly unbornand because his high resolve is pure he does not destroy compounded thingsThen there appeared before him a god from the demonic legionsA cowherd a fletcherThings are unobservable and perfectly at peaceVenerable Lord The transcendent perfection of wisdom is absolutely pureBlessed One we four great kings will worship those who spread this Dharma teaching and protect those who listen to itThey remained in the middle of the sky keeping watchAnd said to all the people before himand they dedicate their roots of what is wholesome toward taking birth in the world of the great Brahmāāradvatīputra do you think that anything other than fundamental ignorance constitutes a bodhisattvaAs the poison is neutralized his pain disappearsit is because this transcendent perfection of wisdom is neither immanent nor transcendentHe examined the time of his birth the continent of his birth the country of his birth and the family of his birthThis was the circumstance and the reason why the Bodhisattva in the quiet of the night would extend his right hand and draw it back Finally he would let the hand rest while maintaining mindfulness and carefulnessHence in worshiping the Dharma they worship the thusgone onesThe ministers then prostrated at the kings feet and askedYou teach the Dharma of noself In which there is neither like nor dislike Seven bodies are not products they are not byproducts they are not apparitions they are not byproducts of apparitionssome are on the fifth bhūmiNaturally present Are eight and five characteristicsLord I am indeed reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illnessThen if you ask what constitutes contaminated phenomena they include the followingGood health however ends with sicknessWhile born in divine bodies that were like beautiful moonlightHe will abandon his retinue of consorts and leave his homeIt was anything a person could wish for full of all the things necessary for comfortable livingThey also said Hearers of the Blessed One behold how delightful the world has becomeAll of you listen with an unwavering mind For I will teach the restraint of the mindHe will discover a Dharma That will free beingsI see the nāgas yakṣas garuḍas gandharvas kinarasHe is then told Or further if you were to find shelter in a house a temple a multistory building a verandaThey clear away the suffering of those tormented by painThere is nothing that would abide in the real nature nor is there anything that would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentnanda these words will be spoken by ThusGone Ones and will be taught by themMonks once the gods of the Brahma realm led by the god Subrahman had praised the ThusGone One with these verses they bowed to him with palms joined and stood to one sideIn the form of a supreme being he is praised in infinite waysSimilarly the emptiness of the eyes is not the eyesThis wheel cannot be enumerated because it is beyond something that can be countedOn the side of that king of mountains there is an ageless immortal man who once every eon wipes the mountain one time with a Kaśika clothShe then told one of her servants a woman named UttarāThe two eyes the ears and so too the nose and the mindMonks while the Bodhisattva was still residing in the sublime Heaven of Joy he considered the time for his birth At that time he manifested eight omens at the sublime residence of King uddhodanaGiving away gold silver jewels pearls beryls conch shells moonstones coral and other precious substances represents the blue yellow red white crimson crystalline and silvery colors of the bodhisattvas light rays that shine within the infinite myriad buddha realmsEven for the buddhas themselves During a million eons Or even a hundred million eonsThey should not dwell on the notion that physical forms are calm nor should they dwell on the notion that they are not calmFor those who will be like that And who possess this sūtraTen million tathāgatas reside in each pore of that noble sonI am undertaking perseverance I possess perseveranceSo for these reasons Subhūti this transcendent perfection of wisdom is established by means of great deedsDivine being when bodhisattvas act by means of wisdom and not through pride they are bodhisattvas who are free from evil and beyond reproachHe manifests an alluring form and conjures miraclesThey can also move through space sitting with their legs crossed just like a bird on the wingthe Sāmkhya philosophical system the Yoga philosophical system ceremonies the art of courtesans the Vaiśeṣika philosophical system economics ethics hydraulicsI will go to Rudraka the son of Rāmato pursue objects while turning ones back on the transcendence of sufferingIt should be perceived as the place where all the tathāgatas turn the wheel of the Dharma and the place where all the tathāgatas pass into nirvāṇaNoble son beyond that pore are the four great oceans that come from the big toe of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvaras right footcontinuing in the same vein as far as the designation of the sensory element of mental consciousness as a self or not a self constitute a bodhisattvathe retinues of the family including Vajrapāṇi along with all the hosts of deities rejoiced and praised what the Blessed Vajradhara had saidHe is without impurityif the body should perish that will be the end of sufferingOn the relative level they do not discard the truths of saṃsāra nor of nirvāṇawho realizes the nature of the realm of phenomena by means of fearlessness and freedom from attachmentthat is an irreversible bodhisattvaNoble ones the various locations are completely pureMay this come to pass Gautama replied the jīvikaPadmaśrīgarbha bodhisattvas will dedicate any root of virtue that has been created even a single instance of the thought of awakening so that it becomes boundlessWhat were the disagreeable points in youthful Mañjuśrīs Dharma teaching that made you leave the gatheringBecause one thing exists another one arisesYou are neither one nor manyThe blind gained their sight and the deaf could hearthe four fearlessnesses and the eighteen distinct qualities of a buddhaHere I have realized the nectar For the sake of which I gave up my own flesh my eyes and many precious jewels For billions of eonsRatnamudrāhastaRevatīSeeing these flowers everyone assembled there was amazedBlessed One that Dharma teachings such as those of Mañjuśrī Kumārabhuta are not to be heard from any of the hearersFurthermore reverend āriputra all the splendors of the abodes of the gods and all the splendors of the fields of the buddhas shine forth in this houseDuring the time of Dīpaṃkara you had abandoned all defilementsin the same way Subhūti physical forms are confined by the limit of past time and the limit of future timeHere at the center of the earth I cut through the entire snare of thirtysix courses of action With the powerful sword of insight Then burned it up with the fire of wisdomListen to my story this is what I dreamedMoreover Subhūti there are individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who in former lives have heard and received clear instruction on the emptiness of internal phenomena and similarly on the emptiness of external phenomena and on all the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentitiesAlso in attendance were twenty thousand gods who had all entered the Great Vehicle such as Susīma and SupratiṣṭhitabuddhiYou have become aroused by the dance of great blissIn that way there arises a great mass of sheer sufferingdevoid of foreign savages and guided by learned menabout leaving ones home Having heard this he thoughtmay they experience such fragrances that give rise neither to physical ailments nor to imbalances of windO goddess enter enter into her heart Hū phaṭand likewise let alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with forty bodhisattva followers or thirty or twenty or ten or five or four or three or two andHowever due to Mañjuśrīs power he could not disappearHere you are without previously having come been seen or been heardso do IIt is the adornment of the bodhisattvas It is the delight of those who desire liberationIf they engage with the notion that entities exist in physical forms or that entities do not exist therein then they are merely engaging with mental imagesHis sense faculties were isolated and withdrawn He was as well trained as an elephant and as lucid limpid and clear as a lakeGathering up virtue and nonvirtue too it abandons the body undergoes transfer and migratesSubhūti Do you consider those feelings those perceptions those formative predispositions and those modes of consciousness that the transcendent perfection of wisdom could appropriate or become fixated upona precious wheel a precious elephant a precious horseWith the gait of a swan we gently approach you Soft and beautiful we talk of amorous lovethe Tathāgata Harmonious VoiceThose gathered there asked him What are the qualities of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva AvalokiteśvaraThey have faith and trust in the thusgone onesShow them respect And bow your head to their feet In the same way these light rays entered the mouth of the Blessed One and yet his mouth could not be seen to be either open or closedThose dedicated children of the Sugata Who practice kindness and whose conduct is peaceful And have no doubts about the Leader of Beings Are in this way said to be the treesso many sentient beings will I establish in enlightenment and so many sentient beings will I not establish in enlightenmentPlease bless this my ordinands names Dharma robe as a ceremonial robeWhen they give away all their limbs and organs they dedicate the merit so that all beings might possess all their limbs and organs intactMonks the Bodhisattva dwelt in the supreme realm of the Heaven of Joyin order to make offerings to the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha CandrasūryavimalaprabhāsaśrīLater the Bodhisattva arrived riding a chariot and noticed the dead elephantO Sage why do you weep Tell me the truth what good or evil do you seeyou should ask You have not caused a schism in the saṅgha have youThey have rejected the net of the māras They have pure untroubled conductthey have obtained marvelous amazing Dharma and they know the Dharma that is difficult to knowAfter King ūradatta had heard from the saṅgha what vast extensive and special qualities the dharmabhāṇaka Supuṣpacandra hadThose who remain in the dharmakāya Know that all things are nothingsimilarly if the finality of existence and the inconceivable expanse were entities and not nonentitiesAs soon as the goddess entered that absorption the great trichiliocosm became as even as the palm of a hand with a ground made of berylnanda this transcendent perfection of wisdom resembles the precious gemstone of the god realmsAs for me O Brahmā I see this great earth with its highs and lows its thorns its precipices its peaks and its abysses as if it were entirely filled with ordureIt would be very ungrateful of meAttachment and anger And other disturbing emotions that harm beings In that moment all these disturbing emotions were pacified And beings were filled with happinessSubhūti those merchants who act accordingly unskilled in means will incur great misfortune and suffer a decline in their prosperityTo know no one teaching to express nothing to say nothing to explain nothing to announce nothing to indicate nothing and to designate nothingthat is the entrance into nondualityTathāgata we pay homage to those who have turned away from all births freed all beings from suffering and attained liberationMañjuśrī imagine as many bodhisattvas as there are atomic particles in the great trichiliocosm all of them ordained disciplined and pure in their inclinations Each bodhisattva would attend as many buddhas and bodhisattvasHe cast away the kingdom like a lump of phlegm And together with eighty thousand personsRain clouds are arrayed So that body and speech may act for the welfare of beings With divine pride in the two form buddha bodies Endowed with great compassionThat which digests whatever the body eats drinks chews and tastes is called the fire elementThe supreme ritual for repelling the obstructors below Appears like a wishfulfilling jewelāradvatīputra just as when someone moves through space by the power of miraculous abilities but does not become fixated on the notion that this is spaceāriputra you should have complete aspiration For that which the tathāgatas are teaching On seeing him he thoughtVenerable Lord Those great bodhisattva beings who embark on unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment for the sake of all sentient beings are heroic and courageousSo the Bodhisattva turned his fine chariot around and returned to the citycommencing exclusively from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment until they are seated at the Focal Point of Enlightenment It is impossible for them to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment while any of these are unperfectedWhat are those ten They are as follows Bodhisattvas retain what they have heard for the sake of protecting the sacred Dharma and not for the sake of material gainYet if they nevertheless engage in neutral acts they will apply mindfulness and exertion and apply themselves diligently based on analysisThe great mathematician Arjuna was amazed and said these versesand similarly retain hold and be attentive to it in the correct mannerThe bodhisattva Ratnamudrāhasta declaredwithout being favored by the transcendent perfection of wisdom and without skill in meansWhat are these three They are emptiness the absence of attributes and the absence of aspirationQuickly kill those dreadful magicians Or afterward you will be filled with regret The Lionlike Being with disciplined conduct emerged from Māyādevīs right sideSome still holding clay kettledrums were twisting their bodies and headsMahāsthāmaprāpta if I had not previously obtained and possessed this Dharma teachingNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities have equal concern for all beingsIt is the attainment of fearlessnessnanda these auspicious signs portend that the Licchavi Vimalakīrti and the crown prince Mañjuśrī attended by a great multitudeAnd the one who abides is not in need of abidingtogether with a retinue of many trillions of nāgasAt that time they recited this verseIf among them you ask what is the transcendent perfection of generosityThey will wrap themselves in a dark monastic cloak And wear a large excellent lower robeThey wake the Supreme Being with music and songThat is to say they do not consider physical forms feelings perceptions formative predispositions or consciousnesssome are on the ninth bhūmiThey themselves should be equipoised in the eight aspects of liberation and the nine serial steps of meditative equipoiseIt is without highness and lowness It abides without movement or activityIf I were to tell everything now to the audience here You would faint and fall to the groundSenior Subhūti what is the nature of physical formsHe has attained decisiveness with regard to all questionsThey do not remember to be generousA son will be born to you his limbs adorned with the marksOne hundred hetuhilas is called a karaphūO father I will break the body of this monk Be happy and go now without delayWhat is being free of behavior caused by the kleśas It is being free of that which is caused by ignorance craving for existence and angerthat he speaks by speaking truly means he speaks by speaking truly at the appropriate timeInstead they should recollect what the Blessed One has taughtSentient beings influence one another through their company they are destroyedthat you should perfect the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdomāradvatīputra do you think that anything other than sights constitutes a bodhisattvaThey have elucidated all the transcendent perfectionsOpen up the limitless river of Dharma for sentient beingsfor it leads one to cease all pursuitsJust as a monk who has engaged in meditative union lacks strong attachment to food on arising from his meditative stabilityOnce I have conquered Māra and his armiesTheir sexual fluid is vajra One should lick it all with ones tongueHaving gone up into the air they lay down there they walked in the air they shook themselves free of dust in the airThey set forth matters indubitably with accounts that are conventional unconventional oblique inverted and so forthand similarly anything that strengthens or weakens feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessTossed flowers and circumambulated herMañjuśrī it is like this just as a monk who holds to the rules of the Vinaya is skilled in controlling all downfalls likewiseCome back As the householder reached out to grab at him the monkThe gatherings of bhūtas that remained Frightened bewildered and panickedHere I cleansed the eye of wisdom Naturally pure in all beingsThe highest of humans taught in versesAfter his going forth was allowed and he was granted ordinationThe four great oceans shookIf at the time of sexual union A lamp with lard is litlike the inhalation and exhalation of an ascetic absorbed in the meditation of cessationAt this point the Blessed One expressed his approval of Mañjuśrī Kumārabhuta Well said MañjuśrīNoble son replied the Blessed One there are no differences with respect to that which we refer to as their body because the two fulfill in the same way the characteristics of a bodyThis was the third example that he had never thought or heard of that came to the Bodhisattvas mindSubhūti if the applications of mindfulness were entities and not nonentitiessonorous and accessibleNoble son you should have no doubts when you see this dharmabhāṇakaVenerable Lord if fundamental ignorance is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of fundamental ignorance become a bodhisattvaRatnaśikharaI will give my arms to those who want armsBlessed One I will take up this Dharma teaching replied the bodhisattva VajrapāṇiFacing a bound personsmell scents as if they were like windonly a tathāgata will be able to count themNot dedicating lacking skill in method aiming for lower rebirths and associating with negative companionsthe venerable nanda the bodhisattvasEight hundred million Devas nāgas and yakṣas stood upJust as no one can know the path That a bird has flown through the airYoung man bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have these three qualities will attain this samādhiThen at that time Mahākāśyapa recited these versesGods these defining characteristics have not been conditioned by physical formsAs the Buddha you vanquished the evil gathering of demonsThose who know that supreme nature Will have an unceasing confidence in teaching The explanation of the activity is thisBlessed One why is thatOne who is free of all calculations through the extreme purity of gnosishis mind is aloof like empty space and thus he enters into nondualityand defeated all of his opponentsUltimately by not training they see insight to be utterly unarisenand the gods of the realm of pure matter attracted by the perfume also came to the house of VimalakīrtiI am maintaining ethical disciplinethe dwelling place of those who experience peaceThe arrow shot skillfully cannot be stopped by a learned oneThey know the characteristics to be illusorypaid homage to the tathāgatas and praised them with various bodhisattva praises for fifty intermediate eonsThese are called the six inner sense fieldsthey do not regress from enlightenmentbecause they are not perceived because they are nonapprehensible because they are nonarising because they are unceasing and because they are in fact emptinessThat which is the real nature of the Tathāgata is also the real nature of the Elder SubhūtiIt performs the ThusGone Ones activityThen the blessed lady Prajñāpāramitā saidSimilarly O gods this doctrine is profound owing to the profundity of the ears the nose the tongue the body and the mental facultyI shall deliver other beings from their suffering to somewhere other than the three realmsConsidering who their awakening hinged on he saw that it hinged on the monk SaṅgharakṣitaThey think of the impure as pureThe soles of their feet will be even And their range of conduct will be evenFor the one who does not see phenomena Phenomena are beyond conception If one were to ask why Venerable LordWhen this Gadgadasvara chapter was taughtand wish to attain quickly the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood should have no attachment to their life or bodyYou have the perfect body and primary signs I pay homage to you who are an ocean of qualities iThe Bhagavān addressed the youth Candraprabha sayingSubhūti this transcendent perfection of wisdom is instructive because physical forms are unseen when there is no consciousness arising that apprehends physical formsāradvatīputra the evil associates of great bodhisattva beings are those who would separate and dissuade them from the transcendent perfection of wisdomtoo spicy or too astringentāradvatīputra the immaturity of a bodhisattva manifests when great bodhisattva beings who have previously regressed descend to the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhas and fail to enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvasVenerable āradvatīputra repliedMahāsthāmaprāpta that bodhisattva mahāsattva spent many years being scolded and abused in that wayWould this man this lord of generosity this lord of great generosity have generated vast countless immeasurable merit through that as a causeThis was the fifth omenWith such persistence they accomplish the concentrations absorptions and attainmentsI shall be the slave of whoever teaches me the Dharmaafter they have cultivated the other meditative concentrations up to and including the fourth meditative concentrationSacred One you are beautiful Like the moon during the bright fortnightbe it grey white sallow mottled black or naturally changeableThough someone may try to entice them by giving them a billion gold coins or even a fourcontinent world system filled with gold coins bodhisattvas will remain vigilant and not tell liesHomage to Tathāgata RatnakusumaguṇasāgaravaiḍūryakanakagirisuvarṇakāṃcanaprabhāsaśrīO Kamalavikāsinī Kamalā Mahālakṣmī give me the kingdom You who grant boons svāhāThey will not fear enemy armies or the calamity of faminesHe was praised honored and commended by all the buddhasAlthough they speak ultimately their speech is not pronounced in the form of syllablesThere is no pure engagement with the locus of a view There is no conduct of beings and no engagement with peace Young man when bodhisattva mahāsattvas search for kalyāṇamitras and respect them and serve them without wearinessIt is in this way Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings are worthy to act as a refuge for the worldsFriends let us scatter flowers The Blessed One has reached perfect awakeningThe vinaya of the hearers does not interrupt the stream of habitual patternsTeaching the Dharma to many millions of beings With many millions of parables and reasons Bhagavān by hearing about obscuration and nonobscurationconsidering that it comprises the element of earth the element of water the element of fire and the element of windThe nature of fundamental ignorance is emptiness Emptiness is fundamental ignoranceand likewise they offer their sons they offer their daughters they offer their wives and courtesansthey have exclusively demonstrated and continue to demonstrate all those phenomena to sentient beings without transcending the reality of those phenomenaSome time later Upananda was out for a stroll when he saw a man missing his hands and saidAnd the Licchavi VimalakīrtiIt is like a pond for those who are thirstydo not toss flowers until the Blessed One has made a signThis is Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara who is arrivingIt is speech free of doubtWhat is the scope of practice of the bodhisattvas It is composed of the six perfectionsOur wish is to make offerings to the great intelligent oneHe gets up from the groundWhen the assembly saw the grand display of the bodhisattva mahāsattva kāśagarbhaThrough many hundreds of skillful methods They ripen many bodhisattvasthat these five transcendent perfections are designated as transcendent perfectionsAnd experience the suffering of death Within six monthsThe king created for them a stūpa And said I wish to make an offering to itAfter entering inside he established nine million nine hundred thousand beings in irreversible progress toward the highest enlightenmentin the early station of the night he produced the intent to actualize the knowledge that sees wisdom with the divine eye and so he directed his mind toward that purposeIn order to increase and magnetize For the activity and specific stagesWhen one has noticed with ones own senses That the pleasure given by the woman has died outa kumbhāṇḍaBrahmā master of the Sahā world bowed toward the Blessed One with palms joinedBodhisattva Mahāsattva AnikṣiptadhuraDivine being being unborn and unoriginated is not what bodhisattvas minds are likeThis should be known as the perfection of diligenceThis concludes the sixteenth chapter on the visit of King BimbisāraThen the third sage remarkedOf these eight would carry himThe Blessed One replied to Senior Subhūti as followsThe intermediate state is the fruitional tantra the total consummation of the wind elementEven if paid it will soon be lostO noble one please see that the ultimate sūtras take root among usSo it is āradvatīputra that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom who wish to pursue the path to enlightenment and who wish to enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvasto be like the rays of the sunSubhūti if all the sentient beings as many as there are in world systems as numerous as the sands of the River Ganges were to transform into malign demonic forces andI am yours and you can have the palace the servants and this whole kingdomThey are terrifying with weapons in their handsThey point out true omniscient wisdom to all beings andThen the monk Vīradatta will come to our home regularlyWith this in mind they are afraid of evil and this then is the bodhisattvas fear of evilThe mind whirls like a firebrand roams like a horse consumes like a forest fire and swells like a floodMoreover āradvatīputra great bodhisattva beings who engage in union with the transcendent perfection of wisdom do not consider whether physical forms are permanent or impermanentSome said She gives me diadems earrings and necklaceswho loves the lotusAnd likewise a girdle around ones waistlikewise they will experience the sufferings of the worlds of Yama Lord of Death over a long period of time Such should be made apparent to the sentient beings of posterityThrough that root of merit he did not fall into the lower existences for two hundred million eonsMonks when the young child had grown a little olderāradvatīputra great bodhisattva beings who engage in union accordingly are said to engage in union with the transcendent perfection of wisdomAbsence of shyness on the other hand is when the causes conditions and bases for desire make it so that even if ones parents spiritual teacher or the like object to oppose or criticize this one feels no shame about ones desire and instead shamelessly one holds the emotion to be a valuable qualityCausing its perfect illumination within a hundred milesSimilarly this same transcendent perfection of wisdom has primacy for those great bodhisattva beings who keep the vows of ethical disciplineDiligence meditation and learning Contentment few desires and austerity Bodhisattvas are skilled in reversing the mindThe three poisons based on desire Are the demon of afflictions Involving twelve attributes of desireand I heard from him the description of the qualities of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva AvalokiteśvaraIf there is a desire to mete out such an actWhatever is the same as suchnessThus while the schoolmaster taught the children the alphabet there emerged innumerable hundreds of thousands of excellent Dharma teachings due to the Bodhisattvas powerVenerables do not nurse hatred for your brethren as Kāśyapas monks didSubhūti when individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas dispense giftstasting human and divine success by purifying the path of the ten virtuesHe considers placelessness but does not abandon the place of good actionsKnowing the faults in all of saṃsāra the Stainless One repliedwhen they do not make assumptions associated with consciousness and the restWith only one lifetime remainingthat latter child of enlightened heritage would generate much greater merityet he is not consciousnesswith respect to the sounds that are objects of the ear consciousness the smells that are objects of the nose consciousness the tastes that are objects of the tongue consciousness the textures that are objects of the body consciousness and the mental phenomena that are objects of the mind consciousnessThe Chapters on Monastic Discipline includes chapters on Going forth purificationNoble ones why would you need to do thisThese are called the ten sense fields of total consummationYou who are endowed with great compassion look upon meAlso sing out a word The unsurpassable word buddha One should then swallow a single pill each dayIn the same way an oblation should be offered in the event of any disease attacks by ḍākinīs or other misfortunesAnd so without reference points they become exceedingly fragrant with the scent of omniscient wisdom endowed with the supreme of all aspectsIf one examines the Dharma of selflessness And if after examining one meditatesThey have a kartri knife and a skull cup in their handsmake use of spells lick their hands remain seated cease talking ingest various rootsYou may wonder how bodhisattvas are there for all sentient beings equallyAlas This body is like a machine a nexus of bones and tendonsThe major marks above and emptiness belowand cut off from any expressionsWhatever doubts there may be Whatever uncertainty or vacillationHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of stainsBodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin asked the BhagavatWhat is never being satisfied with the good actions one has donesome mansions were made of red sandalwoodLike Mount Meru the Sage sat there unshakable Absorbed in concentration and meditationand they should also praise and rejoice in others who act in order to cultivate the extrasensory powers of the bodhisattvasWe will preserve itSenior āradvatīputra I am also inspired to say that the statement things are nonarising things are indeed nonarising is itself nonarisingIn the meanwhile the Bodhisattvas mind was on the DharmaThey will abide within the perceptual range of their respective tathāgatasI dare not engage in sexual activity Please let me go I would rather die than engage in sexual activityHe then spoke of the qualities of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva AvalokiteśvaraThey will not know the suffering of being inside a wombwhile coming to see the Blessed One died en routeWith these acts and methods I have not been able to manifest any true knowledge that would be higher than manmade teachingsThis applies extensively also to the other sense organs up to and including the mental faculty just as it applies to the eyesThe tathatā is the basisAs they are experts with respect to the mind they do not take delight in pleasures they do not wish for pleasures and they are not attached to pleasuresOne with knowledge of yogic illusion is likewise free from disease Yogīs revel in the form of the mantras syllablesthe moonlight of the soothing branches of awakening radiated from this sphere of concentration liberation and wisdomGentlemen who wonDoes the noble one have no ascetic attendantsYou know the thoughts in the minds of beings And all beings infinite ways of conductThey joined their palms with respect And offered me this requestNumerous are their wishes that run counter to the DharmaAmong those devas there was a deva named Sukuṇḍala who was poor and suffering In this way having a completely liberated mind a noble śrāvaka will perfectly know My defilements have ceasedand arrived at King uddhodanas residence known as the Home of the Swans the great mansion that resembled the palaces of the ruler of the godsSubhūti if great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomAs for shelter it is preferable that you find shelter at the foot of a tree suitableThen the daughter of Daṇḍapāṇi ākya the ākya girl named Gopā surrounded and escorted by an entourage of female servants came into the assembly hall where the Bodhisattva was seatedHow are their perfections of diligenceCandraprabha spoke the following verses of praise directly to the Bhagavānsexual misconductThey made everything plunge into deep silenceSimilarly all the virtuous qualities that bodhisattvas gather become of the same taste the taste of omniscienceIt is the unsurpassable wealth of the bodhisattvas Does the Jina teach this samādhiThe definition of equanimity is to be neither arrogant nor timidWhen they saw that they came to the Bhagavān andThey determine which ones produce mastery or an existence in hell or as an animal or in the realm of the Lord of Death or as a human or as a god or as a universal emperorProstrations to the tathāgata Buddha Lord of the Ocean That Is the Wisdom Vajrahe called up the four branches of his armed forcesEach of the glorious great kings Then went to one of the four directionsHe served two hundred million buddhas and heard this samādhi from all those tathāgatasIt is only the wise with perfect vision who aspire to going forthFor I have myself created the worst bad karma O Sage you are unflappable faultless and ever stable like Mount MeruA bodhisattvas buddhafield is the purity of the path of the ten virtuesOne will quickly become awakenedHe does not approach families constantly thinking of teaching the Dharma to the women the girls and the wives and does not delight in doing soThe nāga disguised as the retired devotee thought I shall make this monastery disappear once the sevenday period is uprust of iron and sour gruelI have never seen nor heard of such a thing beforeAll the gate adornments and so forth Are said to be the powers and the likethe pot burst open and the inferno of fire transformed into a poolKeeping those insights in mindBodhisattvas do not suffer from the pains of desireO ākyamuni conquering the powerful host of MāraThey should teach the Dharma in the way That space is without any limit Maintaining these five extrasensory powersWhen seeing someone who is suited for and capable of receiving the DharmaUnderstanding that the factors involved in this process are virtuous they direct their minds toward those factors and apply mindfulness to themIn this way since there are many more that are mixed with the five kinds of impure food how Venerable Blessed One should we conduct ourselves in this regardand the winds blew at appropriate momentsWorthy of receiving giftsMonks the ThusGone One then looked throughout the entire world with his awakened eye andThe shopkeeper replied Noble one no one eats for freeThis is the origin of sufferingWith adoration they cast off their gold necklaces They all placed their ten fingers together in homagemastery of inspiration as one reveals all realms of the world to be full of buddhasTheir hands and feet were turned the wrong way and their heads were afireRenowned worldly protectors Reside in the northHowever they should do so without apprehending anythingThey will have infinite miraculous powers They will travel through the air unimpededNor is one liberated by perceiving them as nonentities and nor is one liberated by perceiving them as entities and nonentitiesWhen he said the letter śa out came the statement Calm abiding and insight śamathavipaśyanāOuter and inner is the meaning of mantraI will also worship those who teach it write it down hold it and read it aloudDivine son you may wonder what the five acts with immediate consequence arethe minds of great bodhisattva beings are not afraid not terrified not fearful and not frightened and if they will not become frightenedIt is designated as the foremost the best the most excellent the unsurpassed and the highestbeing expert in uttering reverse and inverse soundsImagine that the moon dissolves into the letters The letters dissolve into the sun And then the sun dissolves into the u vowel diacriticput it under water using the pair of cupped hands one below and one above If the ash streaks upwardWhy do you say that a bodhisattva is not anything other than physical forms and that nor indeed does the real nature of physical forms constitute a bodhisattvaWhy then do you practice renunciationthey never discriminateThose phenomena that arise from causes The Tathāgata himself has taught That they have a cause and also a cessationtaking care of them through the Dharma and taking care of them through material thingsThen without pride or haughtiness the gods took their seatsWe are inspiring many bodhisattvas By declaring what is the desired result The miraculous manner is to arise instantaneously Like a fish jumping out of waterSenior āradvatīputra it is for this reason that one should know great bodhisattva beings to be never separated from the transcendent perfection of wisdomThrough this all buddhas And knowledge holders will be achievedHe invites a crowd of friends and kinsmen And says On this one I shall bestow all my wealthBlessed One we heard this Dharma teaching on the indivisible nature of the realm of phenomena so now we have come here to uphold the sacred DharmaVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection constitutes the powersThey follow the Dharma but not based on the form realmThis is harsh speechBhagavān without a body we will reside in the air and we will proclaim it with our voicesAnd he will always be a holder of the supreme Dharma And then will become a selfarisen buddha in the worldwhenever they do not engage with the notions that physical forms are empty or that they are not emptyThe bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya then addressed these verses to the BhagavānThe ways beings act are vast The teachings for them are vastor the pains of lacking material meansand they make assumptions about wisdom and so forthSuch are the malevolent spirits that approachSome praised the Lord of the World Some scattered a rain of flowers on the JinaThen he was contented delighted elated and joyful and he became glad and happyWhen the Blessed One had authorized preceptors and instructors to allow going forth and grant ordinationOr even if others assailants or assassins were to demand the body of a great bodhisattva being they should not think Should I give it or not give itIf one doesnt see flashes of light when pressing ones eyes with ones fingers one will die within one hundred daysThat would not be a very difficult taskThey do not fall into wrong viewsto transcend the three realms andAll doctrines are like dreamsIf you ask what are these five formless absorptions they comprise attachment to the world system of form attachment to the world system of formlessness fundamental ignorance pride and mental agitationnanda it is because they do not consider any entity which would cause them to cower and to be intimidated or afraidBeing stable and having mindfulness And being patient with criticismThe karmic winds fan the flames Which melts the moon the central deity and so forthOcean of Good Qualities Lamp of the World to you we bow with head and heartGhoṣeśvara highest of humans Had a lifespan of ninety million years Blessed One I have surveyed the wide earthThe blessed Arisen from Flowers answered that bodhisattva great being Noble son whenever bodhisattva great beings manifest it will be in order to purify beingsReverend āriputra I have been in this house for twelve years and I have heard no discourses concerning the disciples and solitary sages but have heard only those concerning the great love the great compassion and the inconceivable qualities of the Buddhaif you are not a noble one and not a nonnoble oneAre two a syllables at the perimeter of which are nine petalsHe did not pursue pleasures and enjoyments but observed disciplineIf you do not surrender and instead take flight into the sky above I will fell you with a volley of arrowsThat son of noble family is called boundless dedicationA person may act or make another person actHe took a sword oiled with sesame oil And with it he cut the bhikṣu into eight pieces They will be like a light that dispels the darkness of perplexity uncertainty and doubt of the people of the world and the devasThe king provided the palaces with the five desirable things the likes of which had never been seen beforeThey strewed flowers up to a distance of ten yojanas from the Bodhi treeNoble son moreover what do you think I practiced whatever I taught I always valued practice above all elsend they give other gifts including all human necessities whatsoever to those who wish for any other gifts whatsoever up to and including all human resourcesThere were no Cakravāla or Mahācakravāla mountain rangesQuickly take your seat and grant your favorThen all those bodhisattvas from the buddhafield of the Tathāgata Gandhottamakūṭa joined their palms in reverence andThrough all the splendor of the victorious ones in the ten directionsIt shows that you Gopā shall quickly cut the web of affliction And remove your chain of conceptual perceptiondeveloping the good qualities that have not yet been developed and not losing the good qualities that have been developedand in their last existence looked and saw yet were not at all frightened afraid or terrifiedWho would not honor such a precious jewel of a beingPadmaśrīgarbha on another occasion King Glorious Splendor was in his pleasure groveFinally birth does not think I produce aging and deathWe bow to you who possesses the three stainless eyesThen in a sweet voice the Bodhisattva repliednever being satisfied with the roots of virtue already accumulatedAnd travel through millions of realmsYou who desire to honor the Sugata for having explained the noble Dharma to human beings Go forthSome made clinking sounds with their ankletsHe will satisfy billions of beings Through the blessing of the BuddhaSubhūti in the same way one who wishes to attain emancipation in things without defining characteristics merely wishes to attain emancipation in that which is nonarisingEven this alone will eventually cause the mountain to be worn down and vanishSublime Being what sublime qualities must a precious family have for a bodhisattva to take his final birth thereHe has attained the supreme excellence of the indivisible nondual sphere of the ultimate realmThat dharmabhāṇaka went to the kings palace and became a kalyāṇamitra who was altruistic was compassionate and wished to benefit othersIn time our ethics became lax and we became dissoluteTen million gods caused a cascade of divine flowersblue lotuses night lotuses and white lotusesto fallThe buddhas teach the Dharma Throughout the extent of spaceNārāyaṇa this was the fourth introduction to the absorption that encapsulates all meritAsk whatever you wish Maitreya What I shall say in response to your question will cause you to rejoiceAlso about the nature of the body as an instrumentGo ahead he replied On reaching the roofThat bhagavān will be constantly teaching the Dharma while being suspended in midairWealthy prosperous and free from conflictswhether it is the price of a bowl the price of a water pot the price of a cooking pot the price of wood the price of salt or the price of food or clothesYet it is impossible that you would go to the king of trees and rise before attaining awakeningOne part wind and bileThus by means of these varied explanations of the Dharma the Buddha trains the minds of those living beings who are just like wild horsesWell then Subhūti do the fruit of entering the streamPreceptor heed meSubsequently one should leave white mustard oil mixed with the powdered tail of the halāhala snake standing for seven daysapproach a bodhisattva saying O child of enlightened heritage what will you achieve through this transcendent perfection of wisdomFor those suffering on islands due to the wreckage of their merchant vessels Tārā creates boats ships and so

tathāgata orthey neither know nor see physical formsin the last division of that night he passed into nirvāṇa into the realm of nirvāṇa that has no remainderthey then dedicate these roots of virtue for the sake of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment So this was the basis of the question I askedbuildings with steps made of gold and silverthe king became pleased delighted and overjoyed he became joyful and felt happiness and pleasureThe young brahmin Kolita went to his parents and saidIt is clear that the One Who Practiced Good Conduct for Many Millions of Eons is walking toward the Bodhi tree Their body is immaculate and without unpleasant odors  Their complexion is radianthe attained the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahoodHe practiced the Dharma that he taughtIf there were no such thing as deliverance at allIf all the worlds in the billionworld universe Were to be filled with precious jewelsthe bodhisattva great being Suvikrāntamati and the bodhisattva great being AvalokiteśvaraThe Jina knowing the aspiration Of the youths who were his own sons Taught the highest supreme enlightenment Through many quintillions of parablesAll of the extremist sages from Jambūdvīpa who possessed the five extraordinary abilities came flying through the sky and arrived before King uddhodana He replied This is owing to the inanimate nature of all thingsAmong all illusionsWhy was that Among the gods those of the Brahma realm have the greatest abilityAlong with Meru king of mountains bowed to the seat of awakeningHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of all afflicted mental statesThe Bodhisattva however was calm and unhurried He playfully seized Devadatta with his right hand twirled him into a triple spin and tossed him to the ground All the while the Bodhisattvas mind was full of love He did not intend to hurt Devadatta but only to break his pride Therefore Devadatta was unharmednor is there arising of physical formstMañjuśrī what should bodhisattva great beings abide by so that they will not lose this absorption that encapsulates all merit and so that they will attain an inexhaustible amount of merit and wisdomThose detrimental to life Appear in the form of wind and shooting starsThis bodhisattva will refine the fields in which enlightenment is attained and that one will notThus they who know phenomena Realize the highest enlightenment The young prince has left Please do not be saddened When he attains awakening he will return Then you will listen to the Dharma and find peaceSo the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya having received in his mind that verse from the BhagavānO child of enlightened heritage do not generate desire for the fruit of entering the streamProstrations to the

you declare that the mind is liberated in relative termsIf they request from you The gift of the Dharma Their head is large similar to a parasol  Their speech is sweet and fully perfectedYou should absorb yourself in contemplation in such a way that you are released in liberation without abandoning the passions that are the province of the worldBut the princes refused to obey King ūradatta and he thoughtThey should also praise and rejoice in others who cultivate the emptiness of internal phenomenaWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas trust in the secret of the speech of the thusgone

else aroundThey had cottonfilled cushions covered with calico and silk and red backrests on both sidesWith a loving voice and soft compassionate speechThose who are confused about these things counsel giving while the wise counsel takingThey should not dwell on feelings conditioned by sensory contact that is visually compounded and they should not dwell on the other aspects of feeling up to and including feelings conditioned by sensory contact that is mentally compoundedI should be equipoised in meditative concentrationAfter Ghoṣānana there was a buddha A jina who was named CandrānanaWill progress irreversibly toward Buddhahoods highest wisdom The four doors are the four truthsIn the later times in the later era after the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa we also will expound this Dharma teaching in other world realms We praise the unequaled Jina the king of healing And this bhikṣu who is his heart sonThey went to inform the saṅgha That Supuṣpacandra had been slain in the

elements up to that of mental consciousnessAs soon as he taught the Dharma In infinite various waysand for the roots of nonvirtuous action to impede the attainment of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment is the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration of great bodhisattva beings when they practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomAs they consume that person will those creatures eat the person up or notand similarly that the designations of sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomena do not constitute a bodhisattvaTheir concentration is boundlessPutting down the load of the five aggregates is not what bodhisattvas minds are likeSoon you shall have happiness and fortuneand even the ten powers of the tathāgatas the four assurances the four unhindered discernments great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas which the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas possess all originate from this

all involuntary reincarnation through propensities and afflicted mental states are not entitiesVenerable where is the Blessed One nowthey will not be reborn through their powerYet before he enters his mothers womb a temple of precious materials is manifested on the right side of the mothers wombThrough honoring their husbands they praise their bodiesperfection of the sublime statesThey were gentle

a vision of phenomena through the dustless and stainless eye of the DharmaShe practiced celibacy within the teachings Of the tathāgata DīpaprabhaThey do not associate with revere or serve those other practitioners mendicants beggars and naked ones who are tīrthikas nor those who teach poetryAll world systems of the great trichiliocosm will be permeated with luminosityThen they teach those same

and roots of merit he leapt from the roof of the palace The Blessed One replied This is owing to emptiness beyond limitationsBut the love of buddhas For their disciples shall notToday you will become a leader who delivers beings from birth and old age in the three realmsFrom what ārisuta are they liberatedThe young brahmins Upatiṣya and Kolita went to where the teacher Sañjayin lived and askedSubhūti it is because those individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who have been born in the abode of Tuṣita have questioned and counterquestioned the great bodhisattva being Maitreya concerning this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomIn a future time after endless eons He will guide billions of beingsThe postulant should then kneel with palms joined and petition the saṅgha three times after whichteaching them through nirvāṇa but not teaching them this kind of Dharma teachingThe entourages of the guardians of the world Have not received the instructionAnd yet fools have desire for it Know that all phenomena are like that The king appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class will then draw his cloak back from one shoulder and lower his right knee to

in the worldAll the children are infants who crawl around unaware and unskilledShe did not entertain any desirous thoughts nor any thoughts of ill will or harmThe bodhisattvas true accomplishment of wisdom is similarly profoundSugata who has profound wisdom Make your voice resound within this assembly And he will not believe This wealth is for me He will not believe This is my fatherHe appears in the three realms that are like a house with a ruined upper story and roof burning with a great mass of suffering and he liberates from desire anger and ignorance those beings who undergo birth aging

instructs the bodhisattvas who inspires them and delights themthinking that the Licchavi Vimalakīrti had come to expose himThat evening he lit a quintillion lights before the stūpas that contained the relics of the Tathāgatathey see that some have aroused the mind of awakening and some have notHe was encircled by the assembly of bhikṣusNext is the fourth secret Related to the fourth initiationBetter is death the thief of the life force Than living an unwholesome lifelike the instincts of afflictions in a tathāgataand in the same vein this mind of the bodhisattvas is unattached to the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasIndeed it is the unborn that is bornThe Bhagavān addressed Brother nanda sayingIn that case son go forthSubhūti when great bodhisattva beings practice the six transcendent perfectionssurvey and abide in the modality of voidness the modality of quiescence the modality of the ending of contaminants and the modality of cessationAnd neither does he see The three daughters of Māra Therefore if beginner bodhisattvas who have incurred such a root transgression and are terrified by the lower realms

is a gateway to liberationO Sage you understand according to intellect who is a fitting vessel and who is not To you unique in the trichiliocosm and honored in heavens and on earth we pay homageSubhūti great bodhisattva beings will have achieved and maintained the first meditative concentration where there is freedom from desires and freedom from negative and nonvirtuous attributes while ideation and scrutiny are present alongside the joy and bliss that arise from that freedomOne should bite ones lower lip with ones teethOr the red KurukullāBut having acute desires they will proceed toward destruction Forsaking the way of the supreme humans Candrānana highest of humans Had a lifespan of one day Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings practice the six transcendent perfectionsMonks the ThusGone One then accepted the alms bowl from the great king Vaiśravaṇa regarding him with compassionIn accordance with the aspirations expressed by the buddhas through this offering of flowers and flower garlandsAnd let us suppose finally that having erected all these stūpas for the tathāgatas he or she were to devote an eon or more to offering them flowers perfumes banners and standards while playing drums and musicAlas If only beings understood how to extinguish this massive heap of pure anguish marked foremost by old age sickness and deathThen what is so amazing about the other five hundred boysThe cultivation of the transcendent perfection of wisdom is the noncultivation of physical formsThen she also paid homage to all the bodhisattva mahāsattvas

enlightenmentthey worshipped him and his surrounding retinue with the roots of virtue that arose from their own meritImagine the light gathered back in the form of hūṃ Marked with a fivepronged vajraIt is such that the bodhisattva is able to fit as many countless infinite worlds as there are grains of sand in the Ganges into a single pore of skin on his big toe without squashing even a single beingProstrations to all the tathāgatas in the World of the Glory of the Lotus the splendid noble buddhasIn order to accomplish higher knowledge You must contemplate in solitude The pure Dharma and then through that You will accomplish higher knowledgeYou know them all without impediment Guide you are sublime because of all your qualities Some of them become bowls that hold molassesThey wondered When will we attain this kind of wisdom And the Jina knowing that gave them their prophecies  Having heard this we have come to you To tell you all that has occurredOṃ nīlāmbaradharavajrapāṇi

this Sahā world realm bodhisattva mahāsattvas in groups great groups along with the teachers of those groupshundreds of thousands of quintillions of bodhisattvas as numerous as the grains of sand in sixty Ganges RiversFurthermore reverend āriputra in this house there are always four inexhaustible treasures replete with all kinds of jewelsBlocking the six faculties is not what bodhisattvas minds are likeand I would indeed establish all sentient beings in such patient enduranceAny being whether a god or a human Could never see enough of MāyāWithin that trichiliocosm all the dense darkness that exists between the worldsI lost him in the city of such and such a name And it was in search of him that I came hereNext one should take  flowers of the giant milkweed shrub andNot hearing the lions roarWhenever someone shows them respect Attending to them honoring them and making offeringsHe is the one who crossed the ocean of saṃsāra the one who came to the other shoreThey will be divided against each other They will yearn for that which is acquired inappropriatelyVenerable āradvatīputra if I were to bless them in the same manner even inanimate objects such as the trees grass and forest here would display those features and teach the Dharma with the eloquence of a buddhaThe Bodhisattva accepted the gift and out of affection for the great Brahmā he drank itThrough the power of that absorption the earth shook violently causing it to rise and sink It quivered trembled and quakedHowever due to the purity of the great berylwill die within six monthsand if perchance he should seek monkhood to go forth and be ordained in the wellproclaimed Dharma and VinayaWith serene body speech and mind They constantly recite praises to the buddhasThey always stand at the head Of those terrified with frightAre not harmed by poison or weapons And cannot be reached by enemies Similarly this same transcendent perfection of wisdom has primacy for those great bodhisattva beings who keep the vows of ethical disciplineYoung man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of doorways What are the four kinds of doorwaysNoble one the merit you have created cannot be described even by a hundred

placeIt is easy for him to make others understand and purify them He has only little desire anger or delusionOn the other hand Mañjuśrī because of variations in sentient beings inclinations to wholesome intent the light of the rays of awareness from the round sun of the Tathāgata is varied tooit is because these sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage will have been totally consecrated in the understanding that physical forms are emptinessMy śrāvakas have acted in many such waysThen the Venerable nanda inquired of the BhagavānAt these wordsemptiness as a gateway to liberation implies that all things are empty of intrinsic defining characteristicsVenerable Lord How do great bodhisattva beings after abiding in the transcendent perfection of tolerance

Blessed One saysAnd the position pressing the groundthat those who turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine are discerned in the worldhow could future and present physical forms be apprehended in emptinessThen if the king turns out to be disinclined toward such teaching one should teach on the magnificence of the thusgone ones speaking of their vast qualitiesthey will again experience the sufferings of those who frequent the world of Yama the Lord of Death for many hundreds of billion trillion yearsThe three bad perceptions Never arose in me at any time Or one should meditate on the

sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomena might be grasped or not graspedSon of a noble family whoever fully upholds this Dharma discourse of the Blessed One will obtain merit that is immeasurable inexpressible incalculable and unfathomableIntending to oppose it they defame the transcendent perfection of wisdomThe same goes for the four applications of mindfulness and so on up to and including the noble eightfold path and the three gateways to liberationThen the Bodhisattva wondered What is the prerequisite for existence to emergeThe Blessed Buddha was resident at the Jetavana Anāthapiṇḍadas grove near rāvastī when a tīrthika arrived at the JetavanaThey incessantly eat at the bodies of womenEven without fire it would be completely terrifyingMoreover it is said that when he was born he emerged from his mothers right side without being sullied by any stains of the womb But how could this be possiblewho are the specialists in the disciplineMañjuśrī the buddhas should not be seen through form through dharmas through characteristics or through the dharmadhātuThe aspect of awakening of complete agility is a gateway to the light of the Dharmaby the truth and true words of the teaching explanation and enunciation of the  sections of teachings may the  sicknesses of the person named suchandsuch come to an endNoble ones whoever among you Aspires to uphold this sūtraWith the joy of stainless faith the cognitions of the body become unmovingthat is the time of the Buddhas blessingWouldnt that be dried out as wellthinking that the bodhisattva mahāsattva

phenomena that they comprehend know and cognize the worlds also to be empty and that they indicate as much to the sentient beings inhabiting these worldsand how do they induce others to attain distinction with regard to virtuous attributes andYour Majesty you are the master and we are the subjects King may victory be yoursThey should cultivate an attitude that is free from enmity with respect to all sentient beingsBodhisattvas worship and venerate thoseA lack of concern for the roots of virtue is not what bodhisattvas minds are likeThe emptiness of perceptions does not generate perceptionsdelight in the pleasant joy of DharmaStill ordinary beings think that such insubstantial things are substantialHe who holds on to things or lets go of things is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in holding and letting goEach chakra is three fingerwidthsHomage to Tathāgata GaganapradīpābhirāmaśrīNext what is the bodhisattvas perfect giving of fearlessnessthe entire retinue and the whole world with its gods humans demigods and gandharvas rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed OneSimilar to a city of gandharvas correct ideationnanda I did not speak of the qualities and advantages that sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage will accrue in this life and in the next lifeāradvatīputra do you think that the designation of eyes as imbued with happiness or suffering constitutes a bodhisattvaMoreover Mañjuśrī after I have passed into nirvāṇa in the later times in a later era when the Dharma is being destroyedOn his right was Ajita who is named Maitraka Who has the wealth of infinite qualitiesBut his vajra mind cannot possibly be burned By the likes of you even if you were equal in number to the grains of sand in the GangesBody feelings and the cessation of the basis for feelings Understanding their origin and the likeThe service of those who keep to worldly material things Will all be for the benefit of the present lifeThey see a tathāgata in this way The Tathāgata is the fearlessness that is the nature of consciousnessThey are happy to see their father and say to him Father you have returned happily and safely Free us from this poison or venom that is destroying our bodies Save our livesFor these reasons Senior āradvatīputra the nonarising of physical forms is not physical formsindeed there is no arisingwear freshly cleaned clothes and give rise to devotionThey will not conceptualize the meditative stability of signlessness or the meditative stability of aspirationlessnessconforming to destruction is the destruction of nothing whatsoeverthey are skilled in the absolute truthnanda even though Prince Puṣpa beat his own body so thatHere too you may give generously Here too you may act meritoriouslyAs is naturalWhy do those who have the ten strengths praise itVenerable LordMaitreya if bodhisattvas possess these eight qualities they will abandon all evil rebirths and not fall into the clutches of sinful associates but swiftly realize supreme perfect enlightenment and become a buddhaIndeed those who happen to hear this Dharma teaching by the Bhagavān will not become conceitedone billion Heavens of JoyNoble one Have you found such a store of qualities  I haveThe woman invited the Bodhisattva to stay and have a mealWithin thousands of worldsTell me whatever you needI then pondered what must be absent for birth not to occur and what must cease for birth to ceaseYou turned the wheel of the DharmaWe shall protect the Sage who is well guarded by meritSon of noble family certain bodhisattvas who are not truly afflicted in their nature will nevertheless undergo the process of affliction in the three realms in order to bring beings to maturityThus concludes the chapter on magical marvels the twentyfirst in the glorious Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa tantra called The Sole HeroMoreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections see sentient beings of different colorsYet you or countless beings like you will never force me away from this treeYoung man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of knowledge of birth What are the four kinds of knowledge of birthThat is called the emptiness of nondispersalIf there were a man who stood before me And with a frowning face and with maliceThe mind is incapable of conceiving The bodies of the buddhasFurthermore what does consciousness meanYoung man those are the ten benefits for bodhisattva mahāsattvas who dwell in emptinessIn doing so he illuminated and sent tremors through the world systemWhen one has done  recitationsJust as the real nature of the Tathāgata is unobstructed in all respects the real nature of all things is also unobstructed in all respectsOne should grind the root of oṣaṇī the root of black nightshade and the downy datura seeds in camphor juiceThe Bodhisattva then had this thoughtTheir sense faculties will never be deficientVenerable Lord Having trained in this transcendent perfection of wisdom those who have become followers through faithFurthermore Mahauṣadhi after seven days the beings bound for the realms of hell come to experience their past actionsthey have no fixation on anything since all things lack any essential nature by which they would become fixated upon which they would become fixated or which would become fixatedUpananda SāgaraThere are eight goddessesSimilarly Subhūti if the world system of form and the world system of formlessness were endowed with attributes that are unmistaken inalienable incontrovertible genuine true qualitative permanent stable eternal and unchanging andmeditate on it with unadulterated meditation promulgate it and make it widely known to othersThis awakening was the same as the awakening of KrakucchandaBecause it brings the tranquility of having analyzed well and analyzed precisely all phenomenaSenior One Through this path and through this earnest applicationbut none of the women had the fortitude to provide that remedy for the bhikṣuThe Blessed One is endowed with a long and slender tongueHumans maruts rākṣasas and yakṣas make offerings With flowers perfumes and similarly with music Blessed One please give us your attentionand the other ones with the title of great lordYou should guard shelter and conceal them so that their activities are never interruptedIt is a wheel without attachment and obscurationMañjuśrī that which is called empty is an appellation for no attachment and no graspingO child of enlightened heritage You should swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentWe believe we have personal nirvāṇa And have no other wisdom than thatThere in a land not his own lived a teacher of brahmins who had mastered the Vedas and all branches of Vedic knowledgeAs youth fades awayThey resolve struggle strive persevere with tenacity and rightly aspire that virtuous attributes which have previously arisen might remain might not degenerate and might flourish further increase and reach complete perfectionIf these two boys offer the monks herbs flowers and fruitsHe lives in no country or direction He is neither good nor eviland subsequently obtained the understanding of all the aspects of omniscienceMay there be glory at your left handTheir progress is irreversibleThe great sage Supreme One himself felt tremendous happiness delight and elation and achieved indestructible courage Such was the teaching that was givenSubhūti it is because the natural expression of the transcendent perfection of generosity though without entity is still the transcendent perfection of generosityThe Blessed One has spared Senior nanda this scenarioThey hear infinite sounds Those of gods and humans And those of the victorious ones DharmaThen as they witness the bodhisattvas death they will be saddened and with such sadness they will no longer be carelessThat is the subtle practicetBlessed One toward how many thusgone ones foedestroyers completely perfect buddhas in the past did the mighty strongman Vimalatejā engender the roots of virtue in pursuit of completely perfect awakening such that now he has attained the superknowledges so swiftly These are the recipients to whom I should give the gifts Feeling perfect joy in the Dharma I cut the flesh to be given from my thighsIt has not been revealed so that the sensory element of the body the sensory element of tangibles and the sensory element of tactile consciousness might be grasped or not graspedif they are not free from wickedness of body speech and mindThen the young Licchavi Ratnākara having celebrated the Buddha with these verses further addressed himThey will never develop thoughts of the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas and of enlightenmentAll meetings end in separation All life ends in deathSince I am wholly dedicated to renunciation I will stay hereBy merely visualizing him One is provided with the company of eight yoginīsRather we should adorn the princeMy saffron robes have really aged Perhaps it would be good if I could find some cloth to cover meMaitreya at the moment when you attain ultimate liberation all living beings will also attain ultimate liberationEven seeing the multitudes of gods His sensible mind is not ecstaticHow should they be recitedMoreover āradvatīputra when great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of ethical disciplinethe samādhi of the display of miraculous powers In ones sleep one will perceive ones past and future births there is no doubtwhen they do not make assumptions based on physical forms and they do not make assumptions on account of physical formsand those intent on mundane pleasuresNor does an individual or a personanother ordained

my one meal per dayMāyādevī surrounded herself with a retinue of goddesses andand will bring them good fortuneQuick rescue those beings that have no guide Through the power of your diligence and the strength of your disciplineas well as the worlds above below and aroundWhen that night was over on the fourth morning he went back into the capital city of Ratnāvatīeven the six transcendent perfections would become nonentitiesEverything else should be infused six times It will then become equal to the light of the sunThis is the particular quality of the yogins That they delight in being alone in the forestFollowing keeping company with and serving the spiritual guides in this way they learn from them the teachings of genuine certaintyOne should drink one pala of the juice of emblic myrobalan with one karṣa of powdered bawchan seed early in the morningHaving integrated his realization with skill in liberative art he was expert in knowing the thoughts and actions of living beingsReverend if a person who has maliciously drawn blood from a tathāgata seeks monkhoodWhen this precious gemstone is set in a place where men or women are possessed by nonhuman spiritsThey crush pride as they think I have assumed a repulsive look and I wear ugly clothes My way is differentThey take as auspicious that which is not auspiciousTo have attained this absence of trepidation is to have attained fearlessnessyet bodhisattvas do not disturb the characteristics of the realm of phenomenaWhen there is no distraction there will be no attention no mentation and no mental intensityWhen he has gained sightthe nadir and the zenith numerous as the sands of the River Ganges maintain the three miracles and teach the doctrine that is to sayThrough the merit of praising you may we become like you the lion of speechUltimately they have abided definitively in nonorigination from the very beginningHowever Subhūti because this world system of desire is imagined fabricated and verbally constructedAlso heard this samādhi And with the highest joy they entered homelessness the female kiṃnara named Satataparigrahadharmakāṅkṣiṇī the female kiṃnara named Sadānukāladarśinī the female

the bodhisattvas dedication of his roots of virtue for the sake of enlightenment without taking any pride therein while forgoing all convictions passions attachments resentments and their subconscious instinctsEminent Subhūti they repliedSomeone of immaculate moral conduct attains the result of his physical and verbal actions when he reaches the point of deaththe inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of birth concerning the kleśasAt that time noble disciples experience only feelings that are neither pleasant nor painfulwhere the hallmarks of suffering impermanence emptiness and nonself are conceivedtheir fear of the disturbing emotions is not comparableMonks long ago during this fortunate eon when the lifespan of beings was twenty thousand yearsThese rites belong also to the second

Excellent pure and beautifulShe has the form of a twelveyearold girlwho will not worship it memorize it or read it aloudThey do not praise themselves or criticize others They are not upset when spoken to harshlyKnow that sons and daughters of noble family who fail to hear of this absorption who fail to retain it read it master it and expound it correctly and in detail to others must be under the influence of demonshe collects all the necessities for their happinessShe sits on a moon that rests on a lotusThen transcending the sense source of infinite consciousness they feel There is nothing whatsoeverThey have not been conditioned by feelings perceptions and formative predispositionsand when owing to the emptiness of inherent existence they neither make assumptions about nor apprehend ethical disciplineThe Tathāgata does not lieWhen it is rubbed on the eyes Of those afflicted with bhūtas It delivers those seized By the vajra and thunderbolt arrows of bhūtasThe thusgone ones feel great compassion for sentient beings since all phenomena are devoid of a life force and yet sentient beings speak of a life forceSo Mañjuśrī why do bodhisattvas carry out the practices toward awakeningBut restrained by the supernatural power of Mañjuśrī none of them volunteered to goHe gives them elephants cavalry chariots infantry male slaves and female slaves He gives them carriages and palanquins However he does not give his crest jewel to anyoneNevertheless Mañjuśrī that great Dharma drum does not have a producerHe is delightful in his speech He is lovely in his physical formLikewise the same goes for the powers of the tathāgatas and in the same vein all the other fruitional attributes and attainments up to and including omniscienceWhen they are involved with those modes of attachment they cannot practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom which is without attachmentI made this declaration in the four directionsthe last of the eight syllablesHe will not teach the sacred doctrine according to the notions that physical forms are calm or that they are not calmNoble son a buddhafield of bodhisattvas is a field of living beingsIt is so Mañjuśrī that sentient

dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion that I should attain a body endowed with the eighty minor marksand develop perfect mildness and patienceVenerable Lord The transcendent perfection of wisdom is omniscience so that all afflicted mental states and involuntary reincarnation through propensities might be abandonedBy meditating on just that andAnd through his power Our palaces have become like thisWith unsurpassable wisdom They become unsurpassable buddhas the Tathāgata the Arhat the Perfect and Complete Buddha with unobstructed brilliance comes to be counted as arisen in the

this transcendent perfection is not hatredGreat bodhisattva beings who wish to attain emancipation in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment should abide in a state of equanimity with respect to all sentient beingsThen the bhikṣunī Yaśodharā the mother of Rāhula thoughtand in the same vein when they teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beings in order that they might abandon their views of the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasThe aspect of awakening of complete absorption is a gateway to the light of the DharmaPure conduct and unalloyed conduct And maintained noble conduct that was immaculate Those who know the nature of that way of meaning Are said to be established in the restraint of the body agitationMay those humans

origination up to and including aging and deaththe eight aspects of liberationand the one who has perfected tranquility and insightThey will be profound and bring an end to the aggregates And be free from fearThrough unimpeded meditative stability this individual will develop insight into the knowledge of liberationOne hundred nonillions is called a vivāhaAs Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara arrived at the city of the pretas it cooledSince this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom is absolutely void it cannot attain anything at allAs they abide within the illusory absorptionof whatever kind of flowers may be availableSo now I must depart and search for a better practiceTherefore I shall go elsewhereNakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña in the same way this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma is like the Tathāgata for all those who have entered the BodhisattvayānaMay I realize the six supernormal powers And reach supreme enlightenmentit is neither plain nor contoured it is neither flat nor unevenWhen those who have been born in Kālasūtra Raurava Avīci and in the city of the pretas remember your name they will be freed from the great suffering of the lower existencesIt is because monks they argue for karma they argue for actionMoreover the tathāgatas definitively know through contingencies and causes the maturation of the past future and present

clothing not for food not for bedding or cushions not to be cured of an ailment and not for medicinesIn this way son of noble family the bodhisattva great beings who genuinely uphold the component of discipline will not end up in these four dangersall things are evanescentSome scattered excellent bracelets Some scattered armlets inset with jewelsYou should absorb yourself in contemplation in such a way that the thirtyseven aids to enlightenment are manifest without deviation toward any convictionsWhen they heard this teaching five hundred bodhisattvas within the gathering gained acceptance of the nonarising of phenomenaLike a fire he was shiningHis sons who have deluded perception praise their father saying Father you have returned happily and safely Heal us but they do not drink the medicineMaitreya how do such bodhisattva mahāsattvas have skill in their methodsIt is not due to a combination of ones own skill and anothers skillThat is the origin of sufferingIn the south one should draw A yellow sword inlaid with a jewelone burns even the five inexpiable actionsand if they engage in the same manner with feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessBlessed One please teach the sūtra called The King of the Array of All Dharma Qualities Their lips are red like the balsam fruit  Their mouth is compactunlike them they exclusively strive for and maintain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentAll the beings who have appeared in the past Who have cherished their own bodiesOn their limbs these sources of wealth are adorned with flower garlandsmeritorious deeds originating from generosity meritorious deeds originating from ethical discipline and meditation merits endowed with service merits endowed with skillful meansThe gatekeeper went before King uddhodana with folded hands and saidThey are in a state of transgression and will be deprived of any happiness of the god and human realmsBodhisattvas who possess continuous diligence will give up all harmful negative and unvirtuous factors that present obstacles to the path of awakeningThey will not deviate from recollecting the BuddhaWhat Your wet nurse or the woman who gave birth to youOne of his arhat wards entered into meditation to find out where his preceptor had been reborn andThe seventh great merit results in becoming Vaśavartin the king of godsYoung man the sound of those words was heard in all the worlds in the trichiliocosmowing to the emptiness of inherent existence Their body hairs are bluish black  Their body hairs are clean  Their eyes are wideVenerable Lord Furthermore when great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom are engaged in the investigation of these phenomenaI will now explain how the bodhisattva great beings can attain all these particular qualities as well as othersThese two processes are respectively said to follow and reverse the sequence in which the twelve links of dependent origination ariseMoreover āradvatīputra if great bodhisattva beings who abide in the transcendent perfection of wisdomIn this regard Subhūti no one will attain emancipation by means of this vehiclenanda There are buddhafields that accomplish the buddhawork by means of bodhisattvas those that do so by means of lights those that do so by means of the tree of enlightenment those that do so by means of the physical beauty and the marks of the Tathāgata those that do so by means of religious robes those that do so by means of food those that do so by means of water those that do so by means of gardens those that do so by means of palaces those that do so by means of mansions those that do so by means of magical incarnations those that do so by means of empty space and those that do so by means of lights in the sky Why is it so nanda Because by these various means living beings become disciplinedand who are alive at present even now teaching the sacred doctrineYour voice has all the qualities of pure speech Your beautiful voice is a gentle lions roarThis completes the sixteenth chapter from The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten Thousand Lines entitled Conceptual NotionsSuch are the faces of the approaching armyThus when they experience the feeling of pleasure it is unaccompanied it is not accompanied by experiencesDeath bondage or fearSubhūti because the transcendent perfections of ethical discipline and so on up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom are not entitiesFor a hundred and eighty billion eonsThese childish beings fall like moths flying into the candle flamethe tendons in their bodies will shrinkOne should not listen to them One should not retain themwho wish actually to behold the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhasthey do not steal that which is not givenIn that way they will see the buddhas in their bodies With their śrāvakas and other offspring of the buddhas The bodhisattvas who are dwelling alone And those teaching the Dharma among crowdsDevi Sarasvatī came from his caninesthe brahmins and householders without particular devotion toward the Buddhas teachingsThats why my body has become coldMerely by this single method of exquisite pleasureall mountain ranges and forests as well as the central mountainnone that are arisingthe monks went to make their bed in forests and at the foot of treesO You are a thief A fool An idiot A robberundiminished mindfulness undiminished absorptionSixtyfour thousand Kumbhāṇḍa pretapūtanas Dwell in the south And perpetrate harm Against those who appear thereWhoever does so will become a great master of richesThey each arranged their own throne And taught upon it this very sūtraSimilarly they achieve and maintain the mind that is endowed with loving kindness its volition permeating a single direction of space because it is vast extensive nondual immeasurable free from enmity free from harm without rivalry perfected and wellcultivatedThe Blessed One said No son of noble family it will notThe buddhas have the characteristic of spaceIf you ask what are the eighty minor marks they are as followsThose who commit this transcendent perfection of wisdom to writingThey made offerings of flowers incense garlands ointments lamps parasols victory banners flags monastic robes ornaments garments praises songs and cymbal musicbereft of any false dharmasWhat do I see I see godsshelter to the homelessBecause they might be able to end up in the realm of Brahmā but still will be left with afflictionsAnd aspires to purity even if he be bedecked in jewelry That is a brahmin an ascetic a monkhe accomplished supreme perfect enlightenmentthe Teacher then pronounced these versesThe intense hardship That I now intend to engage in Will consist of austerities discipline and adversities That no god or human can performAnd here and there they will hear This unsurpassable sūtra From each pore of the Sugata There shone hundreds of thousands of light raysAs an analogy a lotus grows in waterEven though they may have undertaken perseverance they have not conceptualized itIt is like a boat for those crossing to the opposite shoreHence the ThusGone One has no preference for any phenomenon at allBlessed One the Tathāgatas skillful means and methods that bring beings to spiritual maturity are manytheir insight will not diminishHe was honored as the merchant among merchants because he demonstrated the priority of the DharmaIf you ask why Subhūti it is because the great bodhisattva beings who act accordingly are engaged in perfectionI should attain omniscienceSubhūti that which confines all things by the limits of the past and the limits of the future is definitively calm and excellentyou may wonder how bodhisattvas pacify the torments of afflictionWherever that may be If on a day of fasting One mixes this with milk and drinks itVenerate this guide of humankindhe taught Saṅgharakṣita how Dharma practitioners conduct themselves and made him recite the Four gamasMañjuśrī when the bodhisattva follows the wrong way he follows the way to attain the qualities of the BuddhaThis bodhisattva will attain the extrasensory powers and that one will notof the meditation of signlessness consummated in the purification of all compounded thingsIt is a recitation that eliminates desire anger stupidity and the sufferings of saṃsāraand who wish to enter into the deathless expanseall of these should train in this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomhe is free from all characteristicsIn that way it has been taught that this Which is preeminent has the most excellent meritMoreover they also establish others in the same trainingSubhūti just as a man who has committed an inexpiable crimeMay all illnesses from wind bile Phlegm and their combination Be quelled And may I be safe From all perils and misfortunes SvāhāSo this is what the renunciants who come to live here in Rājagṛha are likeThis is the fruit of sloththey encouraged Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī to take on this taskAnd those who devote to this teaching of the Dharma their tolerance their zeal their intelligence their discernment their vision and their aspirationsA homa offering mantra recitationThus bodhisattvas are objects of worshipOne should enclose quicksilver inside a cowrie shell and place it in ones mouthduring which time they chose a name for the girlmay these roots of virtue sharpen my intellectWhen he came I committed the evil action of having him slain And because of his death I am going to fall down into hell vTogether with King Glorious Splendor the two beings then went before the Blessed One the thusgone worthy completely perfect Buddha King of the GoldenHued Lions PlayThat is called great loving kindnessthe Bhagavān has praised the skill in methods of the tathāgatasThe sage Asita went before King uddhodana and told himson daughter family kinsmen relatives kindred wife and so onWhat is the knowledge of the various rebirths of beings It is the knowledge of the different states of the five kinds of existenceIf so reverend what then has caused you to smileAnd were at that time to guide The bhikṣus who are my śrāvakasSimilarly the transcendence of fundamental ignorance is always without fearAfter speaking these lines the Bhagavān arose from his seatThus the inaction and noninvolvement of all things is the entrance into nondualityand also gives away their own body spouse sons and daughters as offeringsIt is for these reasons Subhūti that this supreme vehicle the Great Vehicle accommodates countless innumerable and limitless sentient beingsHe had a thousand sons and five hundred daughtersThe Blessed One replied to Senior nanda as followsThere he heard the sound of the wailing Of many millions of devas in the skyIf this mantra is written on a leaf and placed by the door the leprosy will not comewere it too assiduous they would become stressedSubhūti great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of wisdom actualize the extrasensory power of realizing the cessation of contaminantsThinking I should exclusively dispense generosity on a large scale toward all sentient beingsFinally they are fearless due to their perfect mastery in never straying from the omniscient mind and avoiding the influence of other vehicles while accomplishing the true purpose of all beingsthe inconceivably numerous words of nonmovement concerning teaching the composite the inconceivably numerous words of nonmovement concerning the kleśasA monk of ten years may allow going forth may grant ordinationThey possessed a mind with great tolerance and without animosity for any sentient beingSimilarly the emptiness of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness is not consciousness and the other aggregatesConsider noble son how the fragrance of the lotus permeates the place where it growsKing rīghoṣa who was keeping the eight poṣadha vows was in the middle of his harem of queens with his court before him seated on the roof of his palaceWhat is joyful conduct It is the contemplation of virtuous qualitiesDuring the third weekIf you remain ignorant of amorous passion And fail to enjoy these young girls who have come of their own willif neither conquering ignorance and the craving for existence nor producing knowledge and liberationhe proceeded to the seat of awakening where the Bodhisattva was sitting As a way to venerate the Bodhisattva he sheltered the entire area with a single jewel parasolMañjuśrī attaining acceptance is not to involve oneself in mundane thingsThen one should anoint him as beforeThe ḍāka is the moon diskThe Blessed One asked āradvatīputra are you inspired to say thatSon of a selfimmolator even that view you hold which views all forms of self as unable to endure does not itself enduretheir teaching knows no limit and is assimilated as realizationIt is having a mind like a mountain It is being unshakable Then I developed the intention That I would provide the food for the bhikṣuIf in turn that merit were multiplied by ten inexpressibly many times then that would be enough to manifest the hair between the eyebrows which is more radiant and delightful than a thousand stainless full moonshose who cultivate with profound wisdom The eloquently taught truths of the noble ones And consider giving away even their bodies Never encounter the eight perilsEvil one today you will be terrified by the Bodhisattva Like a jackal by a lionSuch was the result of the words spoken by the One Who Always Speaks the TruthWhat is the root of the false conceptSubhūti The transcendent perfection of wisdom gives rise to the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas and it instructs themThe sixteen uncontrolled things The eighteen elements And the twentyfive pains I eliminated while sitting at the center of the earthThose of us who could not bear this piled wood straw

meaningless waysAnd then when they are within their last bodies They will attain this supreme enlightenment Give the precious gift of the supreme Dharma And always maintain patiencemajesty of body and

faculties are clear and your complexion lustrousAs soon as the Bhagavān had taught this foundation this understanding of the Dharma to those bodhisattvasThere is the meditative stability named Pure SanctuarySimilarly emptiness is not something other than the eyes nor are the eyes something other than emptinessIn a movement like a great elephant in rut The Bodhisattva grabbed hold of the great elephant with his big toeThey illumine the infinite and endless world realms of the ten directions with continuous garlands of lightning that flash in boundless colorsIf someone at the time when the sacred Dharma is degeneratingand because he has no wishes he does not destroy compounded thingsThey will know the great secret of the supreme beings And they will soon be in meditation upon itWhat deity has manifested this powerThey notice certain beings who are involved in negative acts with body speech and mindSeeking to listen is a gateway to the light of the Dharma for it enables one to investigate the Dharma precisely and in the correct mannerproduced two streams of cool and warm water to rinse the Bodhisattvas bodyNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with insight will search for spiritual teachersor an invalid who has been delivered from all his illsEven those who do so once with a distracted mind They will all of them attain enlightenment Awakening is the nature of the realm of phenomena yet that nature cannot truly realize that natureSimilarly they neither associate the ears the nose the tongue the body and the mental faculty with the limit of future time nor do they disassociate them therefromBodhisattva Maitreya askedAll phenomena are like the moon on water Illusions bubbles mirages and lightning The whole of rāvastī is your field and fatherland so seek out alms and live on themThe bhikṣu was gentle and mild Honored by a hundred thousand beingsSuch is the bodhisattvas diligence that does not deprecatethat assembly were bodhisattva mahāsattvas and śrāvakas the lord of devasThe birds were joyful and content and they each sang happilyBeginning their search they asked Who shall we ask to comeThis āradvatīputra is called the armor of the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline offered by Great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomThey are like the children in the parable who come out of the burning house because of their longing for a goatdrawn cartSitting down he crossed his legs held his body erect and rested in mindfulnessowing Venerable Lord to the fact that an illusory person has no conceptsWith control of their own minds they gain control of all phenomenaAs they arrive they roar like bullsGods thus can one discern the aspiration of the tathāgatas of the past and be in perfect agreement with itUnproduced and nonarisingTherefore son of noble family in a distant future the Blessed One the thusgone worthy perfect Buddha Amitābha will also pass into nirvāṇaThe description of its benefits even in as many eons As there are grains of sand in the Ganges I answer him by saying An afterlife neither exists nor does it not existIs the number of sand grains In sixty Ganges Riversin the same way āradvatīputra great bodhisattva beings perceive all things distinctly but do not become fixated on all things as entitiesmastery of aspirations as one displays complete awakening at whichever time and place it may be desiredFulfill your solemn vow you with the dynamic power of truthjust as the claws and fangs of the four noble truths were extremely sharpDwell in the forest avoiding crowds And always meditate with a loving mind Waiting until midnight With mustard seeds placed on the top of her head Inspired by Brahmā she should recite What was manifested by Brahmātakes a seat on the Dharma throne and teaches the Dharma Agitated by the evil of sensory pleasures I set forth in the pleasurable company of my wivesSubhūti  great bodhisattva beings imbued with renunciation who dwell in solitude maintaining detachment and remaining in a state of cessation should cultivate the support for miraculous ability combining the meditative stability of resolution with the formative force of exertionMundane things are conditioned and since anything that is conditioned is impermanentWhen practicing the transcendent perfection of generosity and so forththe swoop of a swanGentle one explain to me today The reason why you came here ivAs counteraction to interferences devised by kākhordas or vetāḍas a man or a woman who has fasted for a single day and night and been ritually cleansed and well adorned should strew the ground with flower petals scent it with various fragrances light a fire from khadira and jujube woods and scatter seeds throughout the four directions The seeds should also be scattered into the fireIn perfect pursuit of the welfare of others they engage in the many preliminary practices for accomplishing merit and wisdomhe felt satisfied and happy and he cheerfully rejoicedHe then spoke a verse of the Blessed OnesHis final request to him was to serve as the monk who inquires into confidential mattersBut you are a religious person who has practiced a lot of DharmaTheir defilements have ceased They have no kleśasQuick go get beautiful nāga flowers fine and sweetsmelling cloths pearl necklaces Ornaments and bracelets powders and our finest incenseOh Oh You make all those beings Happy healthy and reach nirvāṇa xxiVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is emptyTo women however instead of the crown empowermentThe Buddha then said to the venerable Aniruddhaand in the same vein are the other sense organs up to and including the mental faculty free from contaminants and not included within the three world systems owing to the emptiness of inherent existenceThe lord Black Acala deeply kissed and firmly embraced Hatred Vajrī and saidWhen practicing generosity by offering perfumes fragrant powders and ointmentsHis beloved kinfolk and retinue abandoned him their faces cast down while he stood aside and broodedYoung man you should train by thinking I will engage in completely pure conduct of speech in that wayCrowned with AmoghasiddhiBut in order to make all sentient beings happyNoble ones the Tathāgata says to beings with various aspirations few roots of merit and many kleśasTherefore divine son through such a method a bodhisattva great being with disturbing emotions can awakenChanda I am miserable for I had been showed a treasure Yet now since it is like my eyes have been gouged restore my sightand similarly when they establish cognize and become fixated on the notion that the eyes are nonentitiesBecause it is the meditation on impermanence suffering and emptiness by those who have the higher motivation of desiring to attain nirvāṇaMaudgalyāyana to the east beyond as many worlds as there are grains of sand in the river GaṅgāOne is permitted to observe the conduct of wearing the six adornmentsVenerable Lord What will be the essential nature of the minds of those great bodhisattva beings who have conviction in and concur with this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomand his possessions had dwindled prompting the thoughtThey know the particular sūtra with the definitive meaning Such as the Sugatas teaching on emptinessSo now you should absorb it preserve it and cause it to be retoldSimilarly are the other nonexistent sense objects up to and including nonexistent mental phenomena unattached to nonexistent mental phenomena and the restThe thusgone ones feel great compassion for sentient beings since all phenomena are devoid of location and yet sentient beings believe that they are present at locationsThus noble sons the bodhisattva does not destroy compounded things and does not rest in the uncompoundedSubhūti can unconditioned phenomena then be eradicatedThis wise one with insight into ultimate reality Gazed at the supreme tree of awakening for seven nights You are the refuge for those beings reborn in the lower realms And for beings who are falling into the great Avīci hellKing uddhodana belongs to a royal familyPreviously I made a wholesome act of giving It was an unstinting act and you are my witnessYou can take from my branches but not my leaves orThey take as pure that which is not pure However if I now attain mastery in the prescribed practices and austerities all the opposing views will become suppressedTo the singleminded beings who have assembled And to the bhikṣus and bhikṣunīsdo you think Subhūti that this man would be able to rise from his bed unaidedand this is the time to rest inwardlyMay your daughter be given to my sonWith the aggregate of absorption this mind does not dwell anywhereHe was lauded by the nāga king Kālika and he accepted a bundle of auspicious goldencolored kūśa grass from a grassmongerMañjuśrī it is good that you think to ask the Tathāgata about this matterOn the relative level in order to individually discriminate the wisdoms of the buddhas the bodhisattva great beings meditate on the truths without meditatingDṛḍhabala was extremely pleased And accompanied by one billion six hundred million beingsSimilarly I identify with the fruit of entering the streamThe Blessed One replied Mahauṣadhi suppose some poor person were to find a precious wishfulfilling jewelIf a noble son or daughter writes this Dharma teaching down commissions it to be written memorizes itSubstances such as poison blood and black mustard seeds Should be gradually knownThe thusgone ones are profound and hard to fathomāradvatīputra do you think that the applications of mindfulness are one thing and that illusions are anotherso will they be precisely and without any difference for the Blessed One the thusgone SupratiṣṭhitaguṇamaṇikūṭarājaThe mantra holders show That anyone who transgresses Mantras medicines or incantations Is defeatedIn the expanse of space visualize the letter āḥ And the first moon the letter hūṃ Blazing with great lightThey will adopt the body that they take on and which they will experience in keeping with karmic conditions and according to their particular state of lifeand others shed tears wiping their faces with their garmentsJust as in the case of the fruit of entering the streamThe transcendent perfection of wisdom and similarly the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent perfection of generosity are all absolutely voidThe gods who have great magical powers Spoke to the One with Elongated Eyes like a Blooming Lotusbecause they do not apprehend anything at all they do not condition anything at allthe Bhagavat said to the youthful MañjuśrīThis is called the knowledge that is definitivemeditate on it with unadulterated meditationtheir fruits are conceivedin such buddhafields those bodhisattvas will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentnor is it unrevealedSo what knowledgeable person would feel any desire with respect to objects that are like a dreamYet how can eating solid foods and leading a comfortable life be of any help What an ignorant and childish manHe is going to sit upon the lion throne of the DharmaAnd so it is that boys and girls are born when those three circumstances are presentso is the venerable Subhūti unimpeded with respect to the sacred doctrineAll those beings having heard those words from the air while remaining in their worldsMaudgalyāyana say every being in every universe had the wish to awaken to complete buddhahood andThese are called uncommon phenomenaPrepare chariots for the girlsSo if bodhisattvas apprehend some phenomenon or the essential nature of some phenomenon they disappoint the thusgone ones the foedestroyers the completely perfect buddhasThe mind that has no nature of its own Has namesandform with that characteristic Divine son relatively all phenomena continuously emergehe should train himself by thinkingSimilarly they should be attentive to the notions that physical forms are calm and voidHasnt he robbed us of our livelihoodSimilarly within the wilderness of cyclic existence bodhisattvas will as great caravan leaders make sentient beings who are tormented by roaming through the afflictions journey along happily and free from wearinessHe is an immaculate light free of stains The sunlight of wisdom free of darknessSarvatathāgatābhiṣiktā She Who Was Empowered by All TathāgatasThey should not in an apprehending manner dwell on the notion that I having attained manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to all things and in all ways should renounce all afflicted mental states and involuntary reincarnation through propensitiesThey who are focused on gain and honor Will speak in this way concerning usMay you become skilled in the formation of syllablesThe guardians with their pure lotuslike hands then lifted up the supreme horseLike Mount Sumeru he was unshakableVenerable Lord How do great bodhisattva beings after abiding in the transcendent perfection of wisdom acquire the transcendent perfection of ethical disciplineHave you properly lived the holy lifeNoble son think of a jewel that has not been polished and another jewel that hasboth are jewels and both are categorized as jewelsI never felt any reluctance to give away The loveliest things that gave me pleasureThey offer large quantities of excellent gifts with delight joy and elationSenior āradvatīputra even omniscience is nonexistent and nonapprehensibleIn the same way the heroes while in this world Will smell the divine flowers that are above Which are the coral tree the spider lily And the nightflowering jasmine flowersreached unexcelled perfect and complete awakening attaining the threefold knowledgefor those fighting against Māra like armorO gods The Elder Subhūti does not emulate physical forms He does not emulate the real nature of physical formsMay all living beings come to have miraculous powers just like those of the noble Licchavi VimalakīrtiConsciousness itself is voidnessThe ocean nāgas in the guise of brahmins and householders then gathered there and he taught them the DharmaThe garuḍas that live at the oceans shore Came having transformed into the appearance of brahminsHe then gave the girl the letterLikewise all buddhas are a single buddhaSimilarly for the bodhisattvas when all the afflictions entirely disappear that time is referred to as the exhaustion of defilementThe one with great wisdom the learned one The dharmabhāṇakaA light of merit has certainly appearedHow so They recollect that the ThusGone One has taughtYour heart is thumping and your every limb is shakingit quaked quaked strongly and quaked intenselyYou may wonder noble son how bodhisattvas remain in the application of mindfulness with respect to wealth honor fame renown and praiseThe gods bestrew you with them yet they are not mixed togetherFlocks of birds came to the palace from the Himālayan mountains the king of mountain ranges There were pattraguptas parrots mynas cuckoos swans curlews peacocks wild geese painted snipes nightingales pheasants and many others The birds had beautiful and delightful wings in many colors and sang in melodious soundsWhen he began to search among the denizens of hellWhat are these threeSubhūti for these reasons this supreme vehicle the Great Vehicle too accommodates countless innumerable sentient beingsthat is to say the vehicle of the śrāvakas the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas and the vehicle of the genuinely perfect buddhas have been extensively taughtThis aspiration that you repeatedly voiced Is now fulfilled and you will liberate all beingslikewise they do not consider whether feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness have aspirations or are without aspirationsknowing that the attendants of the tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas had all arrivedand therefore have gained miraculous powersI will bring those beings to the stage of forbearanceThat restraint of the mind through which wise ones Do not associate with evil people and those with wrong viewsThose who are malicious toward each other Will not be protected by correct conduct or by learningSenior āradvatīputra I do not hold that nonarising things ariseJust as the cord cut and burned Was restored once moreSome made the chains on their hips shake and twinkleSusaṃprasthitaSitting on their respective lotus anther seats they were absorbed in the meditative concentration of brave progressionI beg you to resound like a lion O You of Drumlike VoiceWhat is speaking little It is the attainment of śamathaHe is firm with abundant knowledge diligent and detachedHowever it is an even greater wonder if even for just a momentBeyond that pore there is the pore named Sūryaprabha in which many millions of trillions of bodhisattvas dwellthe snakes the abuse hurled at them the bad that befalls them or theThe preceptor then says This is the procedureHe is not low nor middling nor highYou are the protector who grants fearlessness to beingsHe has great love great compassion and great joy and is possessed of a noble mind by virtue of its equanimityIt can be conceived of as being like the essence of riceWhen grasping ceases there is the cessation of becomingwill once again be reborn and again they will proceed from great hells to great hellsSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who possess such attributes indications and signs are revealed to be irreversibleSimilarly the nāga king Apalāla Palms together bowed to the supreme individualDejected with his head hung low he wrote on the ground with a stick He has gone beyond my rangeHārītī with her children and retinue of servantsAnd this is known By all the beings in the ten directions Homage to the seven perfectly and completely awakened buddhas along with their śrāvakasthose who have perfectly gone and those who have perfectly enteredThese childish beings are tied up and run in circles like dogs kept on a leashthat is counted as tantamount to stealing no matter how much he has stolenShould draw a beautiful maṇḍalaThe prince then smiled laughed and spoke these verses to his maternal auntThe thusgone ones know no forgetfulness their faculties are flawless and their minds are free of any disturbanceAnd how is the world of BrahmāI have been a supreme royal son so rich in power I have been a universal monarch ruling over the four continentsSvastika if it were possible to hand awakening to another being By making awakening into a lump of alms food I would surely grant this to everyone When I attain awakening you should know that I will distribute immortalitythe bull among menand on that account are no longer subject to rebirth while they also correctly introduce secure and establish others in these meditative concentrations immeasurable aspirations and formless absorptionsLose their body hair and be very weakāriputra at that time the bhagavān tathāgata Padmaprabha will have a realm named VirajāMañjuśrī that emanated great Brahmā looks upon all the classes of gods as far as the class of the gods of the Four Great KingsHe will discover the Dharma That will illuminate beingsand he went to see akra lord of the godsHere those enduring deceptions of mine Have at long last ended in destructionSimilarly I possess the emptiness of internal phenomena the emptiness of external phenomena the emptiness of both external and internal phenomenaIn those two hundred thousand million buddha realms there were no villages towns market towns districts countries or capitalsSince the mind is the cause for the arising of wisdomHe is neither true nor falseSubhūti it is because the emptiness of internal phenomena never exists and is nonapprehensible This being the case how could they possibly come or goIn sight of all the bodhisattvas he turned his face upward and was gone and they saw him no moreSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who train in this signlessnessand accompanied by the goddess Vasudharā He is of golden colorin the same vein those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage will have auspicious dreams of this typeReverend āriputra do not say that the buddhafield of the Tathāgata is impureBecause ultimately they are utterly unarisenseventytwo thousand gods gained the immaculate and stainless Dharma eye with regard to phenomenaPossessing every wealth rich in qualitiesO you with contorted face when breaking the enemys army break break Immobilize immobilize Bind such and such together with his army with a noose bind Hū phaṭ Khaḥ gaḥ ha hā hi hī phe phe O Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa hū phaṭSanction for the begging bowl May all the beings in the three existences The devas and the humansAbiding therein great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomThe eyes do not turn yellow nor is their vision distorted When the person sees the forms of tathāgatas confidence and faith arisefor ignorance is undefined incalculable and beyond the sphere of thoughtWhen birth ceases old age death grief lamentation pain despair and turmoil also ceaseThe world with its gods humans and antigods cannot turn them away from unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentThen the great sage Asita returned to his own abode by magically flying through the airHe did not consider that understanding to be inside physical forms nor inside feelings perceptions formative predispositions or consciousnessHe has no protection refuge or sanctuary and nowhere to goIf stūpas were made from precious divine gold for tathāgatas arhats and samyaksaṃbuddhas equal in number to atoms and if in one day they were all filled with their relics the result ripening from that would only equal the result that ripens from one syllable of the sixsyllable mahāvidyā

Kāṣṭhavāṭaand saw they would be captivated by disciplesThey are not aware that the house is burning they have not understood it do not know it have not realized it andIf these great bodhisattvas do not adjourn before noontime when are they going to eatEnlightenment abides at the realitylimitand they teach the perfection of wisdomThus the disciples can never appreciate those qualitiesWhat good can come from the death of the serene youth KolitaSelfawareness is secret in the wisdomgnosis initiationBhagavān since that time until today more than forty years have passedAfter hearing the Dharma they provided visiting monks and wanderer monks with all the supplies they neededEight hundred children headed by Chanda have been born to the servantswhen the other transcendent perfections up to and including wisdom are dedicated toward omniscience in a nondual mannerThe thought then occurred to him When there is no existence birth does not take placeThose bodhisattvas then asked the Licchavi VimalakīrtiThere were colors of blue yellow red white violet crystal and silverSubhūti when certain great bodhisattva beings lacking the transcendent perfection of wisdom over eons equal in number to the sands of the River Ganges offer their generosity maintain their ethical discipline practice tolerance cultivate perseverance become equipoised in meditative concentration and cultivate wisdom do you think that they would generate many merits on this basiswas seven hundred and sixty thousand million yearsthey are fixed in the six placesVenerable Lord If all things are empty of inherent existenceThe incantation disclosed by Gautama Is like a razor bladeSubhūti it is impossible that great bodhisattva beings who have first begun to set their mind on enlightenment after entering upon the unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment with higher aspiration should adopt the ways of the ten nonvirtuous actionsIn this way Subhūti do great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline acquire the transcendent perfection of perseveranceBhagavān what qualities will a bodhisattva who comprehends upholds perfectly masters and honors this Dharma discourse obtain in this very lifeThrough the adamantine meditative stability that comes from that extrasensory powerthis refers to the world system of desire the world system of form and the world system of formlessnessthe bodyconsciousnessbasethe samādhi named Many Attendantsand prostrates to the saṅgha that has assembled to ordain himlike the track of a bird in the skyThey thought Whom shall

can follow keep company with and serve themWhen they were washing the bowls some visiting monks arrived and asked the monksHence venerable āradvatīputra in the form and appearance of a buddha said to Māra Pāpīyān who likewise was present in the form of a buddhaThen in that instant I had this thought The time has come for me to teach the highest DharmaMoreover āradvatīputra when great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of toleranceBodhisattvas are expert at uplifting the mind out of such states at engendering joy and at placing the mindBecause the Blessed One the thusgone worthy completely perfect Buddha ākyamuni gave up all the many perfectly pure buddha realms and through his aspirations and great compassion manifested in that afflicted buddha realm Because he undertook austeritiesThen the gods reflected The Bodhisattva is having a heartwarming conversation with usWhen he arrived he bowed his head down to the feet of the Tathāgatabut foolish folk do not see whether its form is black yellow white or orangethe gods of the Heaven of Joy such as SaṃtuṣitaYou declare what is empty as emptyWhat is the causal condition of existenceOn the ultimate level things are not as they are expressed in wordsWith respect to nonarising and noncessation Mañjuśrī mind mentality and consciousness do not come aboutI teach the Dharma to beings Without departing from the

pleasure or displeasure He does not perceive differences and thereforeHe dedicated himself to the practice of keeping it reading it and meditating on itWhat is not forsaking the qualities of purification It is being stable in commitmentsAnd how long ago was thatThen Senior āradvatīputra replied to the Blessed OneSo father please let us all turn backThey are profound and immeasurable And therefore the buddhas are inconceivable by thinking This person is disciplined so I will be generous to themgreat bodhisattva beings who are diligent alert and mindfulIt is the seat of joy because it

numerous as the grains of sand in thirty Ganges RiversWill with dedication listen to a child of the jinas Who with enthusiasm teaches this DharmaAlways lovingly protected by Brahmā and Vāsava And by those free of outflows whose minds are liberated And also by the nāgas and yakṣasMoreover Subhūti great bodhisattva beings should themselves comprehend the noble truth of sufferingAs I understand the meaning of the words spoken by the Blessed OnePadmaśrīgarbha any woman who hears the account of how the Blessed One the thusgone King of the GoldenHued Lions Play passed into nirvāṇa and who hears the name of these two future buddhas will no longer have the identity of a womanUntil this person has put on genuine clothes that are durable and everlasting indestructible and unbreakable then though many eons pass one after another he will either have to wear such temporary clothes or throw them awayPay homage to him and touch their heads to his feetVenerable Lord If all phenomena are empty of inherent existenceapply the powersIf you ask why O child of enlightened heritage it is because physical forms are without desire and are not an object of desireHaving seen the nature of phenomena They have no intention of being reborn What is the twelveline praise with one hundred and eight names that is renowned as being stainlessfor it does not seek out holes or egressessuch as his skills in artsOne could never be able to know their number Even if one were to count with divine knowledge for eonsThe nonperception of touchable things is to have no abodeA pure and immaculate light much brighter than those of the sun and the moon appeared and produced mental and physical pleasureSince I can now clearly perceive this precious divine wheel I must certainly be a universal monarchNoble

roots of virtue and dedicates them to omniscience such a bodhisattva is endowed with skillful meansthe light encouraged the bodhisattva the great being Gagaṇagañja who resided in the Varagaṇā world of the ThusGone One Gaṇendras buddha realmFor example even if all the households in the four continents built monasteries of gold and jewels and built a thousand stūpas inside each of those monasteries and in one day inserted relics in them allHow does consciousness follow the bodyThey will not delight in disputes concerning the Dharma They will not engage in Dharma disputesYoung man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of words of inconceivability What are the four kinds of words of inconceivabilityAs birth in that buddhafield will always be miraculous Everyone there will be free from

quarters of King uddhodanathe  kinds of conduct related to angerFor as many eons as have passed Since the very beginningBut he came to see that those austerities would amount to nothingNonetheless until one possesses the qualities of nirvāṇa in the realm of nirvāṇa without remainder one will still be subject to sorrowBy so doing one will achieve the ultimate retention of semenMañjuśrī you have already been in innumerable hundreds of thousands of buddhafields throughout the universes of the ten directionsdo not consider whether or not they engage in union with physical formsdo not speak falsely inasmuch as they profess to benefit all living beingsAll other attributes up to and including the understanding of all phenomena are pure owing to the purity of the applications of mindfulness

wellpolished mirror The face has not shifted onto the surface of the mirrorHumans with inferior aspiration and lacking knowledge Will not believe us if we say You shall become buddhas Mañjuśrī what is called attaining acceptance is a reference to what is genuinely trueReverend Saṅgharakṣita we were disciples of the perfectly awakened Buddha KāśyapaEnlightenment is perfectly realized neither by the body nor by the mindIt is not permanent because the sprout and the seed are different The sprout is not the seed The sprout does not come from the seed after it has ceased nor does it come from the seed while it has not yet ceased Rather the sprout is born precisely as the seed ceasesIn order to ask about the Dharmasome are on the second bhūmiMonks then the Bodhisattva gave the pleasing items to the girls according to the order of their arrivalThe mendicant who is neither bound nor liberated does not experience any like or any dislike and thus he enters nondualityWhen those tathāgatas have passed into nirvāṇaThey are without a self sentient beings living creatures lives individuals humankind and human beingsSimilarly the transcendence of the sensory element of the nose the sensory element of odors and the sensory element of olfactory consciousness the sensory element of the tongue the sensory element of tastes and the sensory element of gustatory consciousness the sensory element of the body the sensory element of tangibles and the sensory element of tactile consciousness and the sensory element of the mental faculty the sensory element of mental phenomena and the sensory element of mental consciousness is not the sensory element of mental consciousness and the restWith reverence and for a long timePhysical forms indeed are not the expanse of realityWhat is standing up to welcome gurus and presenting them with a seat It is overcoming pride and not being lazyThe whole world including the gods forever reveres them as teachersSubhūti it is because the natural expression of their present circumstances though without entity is still physical formThe fourth in the sibilant group Is positioned atop the syllable of fireIn the center place the wrathful syllable In the second the syllable of the wealth holder In the third comes the vajra In the fourth place the first syllable of water In the fifth place the ṇi At the four borders write the essence

realize directly the three gates of liberationOh Oh You continually with the sound of the DharmaAwaken beings who are asleep deeply asleepIn what way is the mind set on enlightenment not associated with thoughts of dedicationThey do not make assumptions about the sense field of the eyesFriends whoever applauds a Dharma teacher expounding this Dharma teaching of The Play in Full will attain eight purities of speechThat which is at peace cannot in any way be prophesiedthere are no particulars at all with respect to any thingsThat is to say although bodies conducive to merit might result amongst

fulfilled my duties I will not experience other rebirths apart from this onethe earth element is empty of the earth elementand in addition to them a multitude of renowned fully ordained monksTo which the person wishing to go forth says It is excellentTiṣya you should know this today You may search in all ten directionsAnd at all times guarding the conduct of a mendicant That is the Dharma that the sage the preeminent human teaches Similarly owing to the utter purity of all things they do not apprehend the ten powers of the tathāgatas and they do not apprehend the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasand also explain the reasons for the emergence of their noble formsthe second turned his back as he sought to memorize the MadhyamāgamaThey will still not have attained unimpeded wisdom But this is what will presage itAfter entering inside he established nine hundred and ninety million beings irreversibly in the DharmaNoble son listen very carefully and keep in mind what I say I shall explain this to youthey do so attentive to the omniscient mindIn the evening one should wipe the top surface of the maṇḍala disk andPadmaśrīgarbha if any woman hears this Dharma teaching she will immediately be transformed from the state of a womanThere is no present life There is no afterlifeand truly held those correct views Because of those causes after they died they went to the higher realms and were reborn in the paradisesThereupon reverend āriputra if you are interested in the Dharma you should take no interest in anythingIf you do not abide by this teaching Then it is not the fault of the teachingSuch is the meaning of impermanenceWhen Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī saw that nobody could move the ornaments she thoughtThe Blessed One saidthen Bhaiṣajyarāja you should know that this individual who is following the rāvakayāna is conceitedVenerable Lord For these reasons I state that those who would don the great armor and seek to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment for the sake of sentient beings are actually seeking to liberate spaceIn future times there will be those Who are intent on the result of worldly dhyānasTherein there is no dream or a dreamer of dreamsMonks it felt as if someone was striking my skull with a sharp spearone does not get burned when walkingwith defective facultiesHe is neither a field of merit nor not a field of meritThe thusgone ones have prophesied that they will be reborn in SukhāvatīIt must be peerlesshe became frightened paralyzed with fear with the hairs on his body standing on end and was filled with remorseWhy did you commit this offence against a bhikṣu Who maintained correct conduct without a faultin the same way in the southWe are just human beings so we are not able to achieve that stateFor these reasons Senior āradvatīputra the nonarising of physical forms is not physical formsOn arriving they set their loads of wood off to one sideor an isolated place any place in which this Dharma teaching is heard will be kept under the care of the thusgone onesTheir path was uninterrupted and they were entirely free of obscurations hindrances or disturbancesIt is because they will be remaining in a state of happinessThey have reached the domain of the five higher cognitions Great wisdom and the retentions Subhūti for this reason I will also explain other more subtle limits of attachment So listen well and be attentiveSaṅgharakṣita you shall go on this journey across the ocean and face your fears along with what provokes themThe size of the maṇḍala Should be one cubit two cubitsIf so then reverend by what measure may we say that a follower of another tīrthika order has a sense of reverenceshould know that they will have nothing at all to fearThe group of six who awoke from their sleep on a piece of dry ground saidKnowing what had been done for him he gave the physician sprigs flowers fruits and sticks of neemThey were free from impurities and afflictionsFor so long with great skill he has paid respect and listened to the Dharma understood it memorized it recited it caused others to understand it ascertained the meaning and the words and with a mind of humility offered refuge to beings faced with old age sickness and death and respectfully explained the Dharma to them soThe five disciplines and the fastFurthermore reverend āriputra at the wish of this good man to this house come the innumerable tathāgatas of the ten directions such as the Tathāgatas ākyamuni Amitābha Akṣobhya Ratnaśrī Ratnārcis Ratnacandra Ratnavyūha Duḥprasāha Sarvārthasiddha Prabhūtaratna Siṃhanādanādī Siṃhaghoṣa and so forthKing uddhodana also gave twenty thousand girls to the Bodhisattva to serve and honor himAnd is purifying his own realmFurthermore O gods do you think that if someone were to say that such and such is the defining characteristic of space they would be speaking correctlyThey will eat the alms food of arhats And criticize the enlightenment of buddhahood The dharmabhāṇaka Brahmadatta Became my teacher at that time At that time there was a prince Puṇyamatin who had faith and trustAt that time I had taken birth as a brahmin and heard this Dharma teaching which I then taught to otherswhat is it to have no abodeSo it is Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings know that all things are without defining characteristicsAs they wish they teach the Dharma In millions of realms to millions of beings They should offer benedictions and greetings to all sentient beings with sweet and gentle wordsMany ferocious yakṣas venomous snakes Kumbhāṇḍas and pretas are living hereOr would you say that it is similar to the color of madder or of a crystalIts warmth and digestive action constitute the fire elementToday the palace will be filled with wondersMahāpratibhāna in the eastern direction beyond countless thousands of worldshear this king of samādhis the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomena obtain it and meditate on itSome showed off their firm and voluptuous breastsAt one point after the teacher Sañjayin had fallen ill Upatiṣya asked KolitaWhen there is no thinking no conceptualization no imputation no movement no arising no ideation no mental involvementNārāyaṇa consider how every spring pool pond river stream lake and waterhole is gathered together and included in the oceanWhile this exegesis on the real nature was being delivered the minds of twelve thousand fully ordained monks were liberated from contaminants without further grasping that would lead to subsequent rebirthIf one were to ask why Venerable Lord it is because all things are empty of all things Manifestly perfect buddhahood will not be attained with respect to anything at all or indeed by anything at all All things being empty anything with respect to which manifestly perfect buddhahood would be attained anything by which manifestly perfect buddhahood would be attained and anything on the basis of which manifestly perfect buddhahood would be attained is nonexistent and nonapprehensibleWhat is irreversibility It is the unimpaired six perfections and the continuous vision of the buddhas who reside in other worldsit is because they do not consider any things that are without lives and without sentienceSimilarly the emptiness of sights is not sightsWith completely pure wisdom They teach the Dharma correctlyāradvatīputra when great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom do not consider the nature of the transcendent perfection of wisdom andDivine son ultimately all phenomena are utterly unborn utterly unarisen and utterly unrealSubhūti the mundane gift of the sacred doctrine with which great bodhisattva beings are endowedGods and humans are thirsty lacking the qualities of the victorious onesWhen the allknowing Kauṇḍinya arrived he thoughtPhysical forms are not one thing and nonarising anotherthe liberations the samādhis and the samāpattis and they teach a variety of Dharma teachingsIn the same vein the same refrain should be applied extensively here just as has been presented aboveNor if someone should denigrate the Dharma will they respond in a nonspiritual mannerHe had love and compassion for the world and wished to help His protection and coat of mail was diligenceIt is good that those who are arrogant have departedoutside there is utter peaceor a pretaNoble son you may wonder how bodhisattvas grow the qualities of goodnessWithin that space there are some who have the perception Believing what their mind perceivesthe treasure of unfailing recall because of not forgettingSome are to be converted by kingsThey are all taught in the one word meditation And in the one word buddha they will fall into inferior realms and be reborn in the hellstaught King Glorious Splendor perfectly how to gain expertise in the mode of Dharma known as the

masternot to cling to the component of discipline as supremeBut the great compassion that is free of involvement with sentimentally purposive views does not exhaust the bodhisattva in all his reincarnationsTheir wisdom is liberated They are thoroughbred stallions They are great elephantsāriputra the tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas have obtained that which is a supreme marvelBhagavān I do know that The Bhagavān askedthis denotes the intrinsic defining characteristic of physical forms which is the capacity to assume physical formsEach identified by her own individual functionGives up concern for his body and life And recites this sūtra for a single day and nightAs an analogy Mahauṣadhi if fire does not arise its form warmth and color shed no lightWhat is the meaning of tantraLater still the translator Zhnnu Pal edited it by comparing it with the Sanskrit edition that had been in the possession of Choj ChagloThe prāṇa located in the heartThose dharmabhāṇakas will teach the beautiful Dharma exactly as it was spoken by the Tathāgatathey have no notions regarding self they have no notions regarding nonself and they have no notions regarding the buddhafieldswhether they are absorbed in meditation or arising from meditationSon of noble family even if one were to gather all of the hearers solitary buddhas and bodhisattvas of the Blessed AmitābhaI pray that you with your saṅgha of bodhisattvas and saṅgha of bhikṣus will assent to eat your meal tomorrow at my homenanda those individuals are not said to be superior but utterly debasedThen I went in search of Daśarathaputra one day in the form of a beggarChanda dont vacillate or delay correct effortand conclude in nirvāṇaIf beyond that such merit were multiplied by a quadrillion inexpressibly many times it would yield the crown of a thusgone one which is raised above everyone else imperceptible and adorned with the crown protrusionIt is my resolve to board that ship and cross the ocean of cyclic existence Then I will ferry innumerable beings across this ocean This sea of suffering so hard to cross with its waves of anger Monsters of passion and maelstroms of enmityThey both take the material for the Dharma robe called the ceremonial robe in their handsāriputra the name of that eon will be Adorned by Great JewelsIf it is compounded in nature it is the same as the superknowledges of the outsidersWhen abiding in liberation with respect to all phenomena they are irreproachableBecause it is the benefactor that provides the precious Dharma that is difficult to findEven the names of the sense fields of mastery do not exist internally nor do they exist externally and nor do they abide between these twoand the samādhi named Holding the Dharmachildish ordinary beings have given rise to attachment hatred and delusion   tmay I include all beings in the Great Vehiclethe supreme vehicle the unequaled vehicle the unsurpassed buddha vehicle that is the

contemplation of dependent origination abundant expertise with regard to flaws abundant contemplation of emptiness abundant contemplation of the absence of marks abundant cultivation of yogic training abundant and continuous contemplation absence of regrets and perfect disciplineThen may that truth cause my hand To be instantly restored as it was before Then Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya and the complete assembly of bodhisattvasIf someone comes to me and asks Is there an afterlifeThey can move directly through mountains without impediment as if they were moving for example through spacenot turning away from the infernoHow does it appropriate one among the helldwellersWe will also protect those who hold read aloud and master the dhāraṇīsNoble son Fb there are four deeds of Māra that create obstacles to the endeavors of writing this Dharma teaching down reading it aloud and propagating itNor does the element of consciousness think I produce the name and form of the bodyBhikṣus then those fifty hundred thousand quintillion Mahābrahmās speaking as one voice recited these verses to the BhagavānThe constellation Puṣya as well with his retinueThey are cooled by the pleasant sprinkling of water cool to the touchAnd know that phenomena are the same as space Will also not be burned by fire having bowed down one hundred thousand times at the feet of the LordHe is inconceivable imponderable essenceless and not possibly an essenceToday the time has come So please consider leaving homeAs they examine all phenomena they comprehend the sameness of all phenomenaThis concludes the fifth chapter on setting outthey do not cultivate wisdom for the sake of a limited number of sentient beingsThey who know the peace that is the nature of phenomena Have wisdom as high as Sumeru Constantly for a hundred trillion eonsand serve them with all resourcesBut those who have witnessed it in their body have no pride They are those who are freed from all such pride It also entails the completion of great loving kindness by understanding that sentient beings are not sentient beingsAs an analogy when an unripe fruit ripens it changes colorThe gods and demigods play their millions of drums and instrumentsBodhisattvas should be replete with the perfectionsThey might be able to end up at the summit of existence but they still will be left with afflictionsAll the ākya factions with King uddhodana leading the way went ahead of the BodhisattvaHe will totally destroy usand to generate out of the multitudes of seeds and elements all the grass thickets medicinal herbs and trees on earthThen at that time Brother āriputra addressed these verses to the BhagavānSeven lice eggs is one mustard seedWhy did you take life To instill fearAfter agreeing to do just that Saṅgharakṣita departedConquering all māras and opponents he remained unblemished by any mundane qualitiesI have attended to many millions of trillions of tathāgatas but I have not obtained the sixsyllable queen of mahāvidyāsOh Oh Arise Puṣpacandra the hero Who accomplishes the benefit of beingsAnd ten million vultures live inside And similarly pigeons and owlsat that time in order to protect this Dharma teachingnanda at that time and in those days many people detested sūtras like thisHe would then fill them with high palaces made of precious vaśirāja gemsThey attain those three doorways to liberationMañjuśrī this is excellent most excellentHe was selfcontrolled and restrained He had pure conduct and his eyes didnt wander but looked down ahead at a distance of six feet His behavior was beautiful and exquisite as was the way he walkedWithout being timorous in the center of the assembly They will always give the teaching of the Dharmaand installed his son in the house saying I myself will sleep on a cot by the doorThey do not attach importance to generosityReverend indeed I haveHence the objects of cognition must also be considered to have no formIn this web

hundred thousand precious seatsIn the emptiness of the unlimited the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end is not discernedTheir vehicle is the unexcelled Mahāyānafreedom from elaboration is stainlessThe first aspect of liberation ensues when corporeal beings observe physical formsFor example Subhūti space is neither blue nor yellow nor red nor white nor crimson nor pale yellow nor golden nor multicoloredTheir great income is pure practice And it is dedicated to the supreme enlightenmentvisualizing its complete garland as the nature of speech emerging from the syllable o in an unbroken streamThe monks asked the Blessed One about itIt teaches the elimination of all transmigration with respect to phenomena and is a gateway to the absence of wishes with respect to all phenomenaKing ūradatta had eightyfour thousand women in his haremIn the middle of those mountains there is a precious jewel named PadmāvabhāsaIf Subhūti sentient beings knew that all things are empty of inherent existencewhen beings are pleased and delighted to see me or hear me you can be certain that they are friends who have accompanied me for multiple lifetimesMay the quarters

wife sons and daughtersSuch is the expertise of bodhisattvas with regard to the mindOne should drink together with honey country mallow Indian mallow white sugar and sesame Then one will become pregnantTherefore Mañjuśrī it is said that all dharmas are the same as nirvāṇafor travelers to the higher realms like a staircaseWhen he bowed to the feet of the BlissGone One The god became delightedGood sirs these living beings here are hard to disciplinehas been explained to you Magnificent OneWhen the Blessed One used the analogies of the Daharopama Sūtra to subdue PrasenajitThey respectfully listen to the sacred doctrine from others andBhadrikarāja and similarly Kauṇḍinya nanda and similarly Sthavira RāhulaBlessed One before long they will themselves become vessels of such greatness of the thusgone onesIn their dreams they will forsake a kingdom And their harem and likewise crowds of kinsmenWith this knowledge they thus see The buddhas as the supreme among humans With miraculous powers in these worlds And equally throughout the ten directionsOne should place the right shin with ease Above the left shinThus in that buddha realm even the words listener or solitary buddha are unheard of as are the names of their respective vehiclesndications include sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomenaWhile there they would beg for food implore others to beg for

doubt and they will not be deludedharbor doubts hesitation and disillusionment with regard to it I have committed an evil sinful act I have slain the supreme dharmabhāṇakaHear of my inconceivable lifespan They do not reject itIn her left hand one should place a human skullThus bodhisattvas are free of tremblingThus they will perceive their instructors as preceptors and be happy faithful and delightedI have abandoned my sweet companions and come to live all alone among the denizens of hell Now I see no way to higher rebirthsAjita it was just like how these buddha realms are illuminated nowIt neither bestows nor withholds omniscienceWhen you are staying In the interior of a houseThe buddha realm of such a bodhisattva will be completely pure and such a bodhisattva will quickly awaken to unexcelled and complete buddhahoodWhen they die twelve tathāgatas will come and reassure them sayingand after that you will attain the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahoodYes it is good eminent excellent perfect supreme and unexcelledWe do not wish to be present at Mañjuśrīs Dharma teaching eitherBecause there is ultimately no scorching there is said to be peacedo not generate desire for physical forms Do not generate desire for feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessO the fourarmed and sixfaced one You with a contorted face Please summon Karṇapiśācī Hū phaṭUltimately all phenomena are the same in that they are unarisenWhy do you say that a bodhisattva is not anything other than the real nature of physical formsSubhūti since it is unfabricated and unconditioned there is no one at all who can attain manifestly perfect buddhahoodIt teaches the absence of distraction with respect to phenomena and is a gateway to tranquility with regard to all phenomenaWhen they know this the wise will be freeAwakening Mañjuśrī is a basis of nondivisionThese are called the five powersThat bodhisattva now went to the south and in a southern world realm named VimalāNoble son such are a thusgone ones marks of enormous meritBhagavān you know the thoughts of all beings andWhen great bodhisattva beings become equipoised in the meditative stability of signlessness as a gateway to liberationWhenever a bodhisattva brings forth this perspective all the realms of the demons are deeply shakenWhat need is there to say moreThis wheel is inconceivable because it is beyond the realm of conceptual mind This wheel is unequaled because it is beyond equalityThe rain of the sublime teaching will refresh those who are tormented by the flames

noble family whenever a bodhisattva no longer practices awakening to come to an end to be born not to come to an end or not to be born nor with the conceit of being perpetually at an end or unending nor disturbed at being perpetually unborn then a bodhisattva who so practices is carrying out the bodhisattva practicesTranslated and revised by the Indian paṇḍitas Jinamitra and Dānaśīla and by Yesh

noble ones is sevenfold dhanamāryāṇāṃ saptavidhamsaying Come Child of enlightened heritage you should retain this transcendent perfection of wisdom and so forthMonks at that time the Bodhisattva uttered these verses in order to bring even more joy to the assembly of godsthere were numerous gods nāgas yakṣas gandharvas demigods garuḍas kiṃnaras and mahoragas as well as akra and Brahmā and the guardians of the world who were eager to make offerings to the Bodhisattva They arrived calling out in joyous voicesand recite this very transcendent perfection of wisdom and are attentive to it in the correct manner honoring venerating respecting and making offerings to it with flowers garlands perfume unguents robes parasols victory banners ribbons and diverse musical soundsWe should be supreme universal monarchs and guardians of the world Or vajra holders like akra or the chief god in the Heaven Free from Strife Aspiring to experience the bliss of meditation in the realm of Brahmāwith palms placed together come to listen to this Dharma teaching from Bodhisattva Mahāsattva AvalokiteśvaraApart from a bodhisattva in his final existence no other being anywhere could ever receive such garmentsWhen this teaching was given the minds of eight hundred monks were liberated from defilements without any further appropriationThis brought them joy and satisfactionIn that

asurasSimilarly bodhisattvas do not become angry at those who harm them nor do they become attached to those who do them goodVāyu came from his mouthPracticing the transcendent perfection of generosity they never preoccupy themselves with miserlinessIt is forsaking bad actions through a sense of shame and dedicating oneself to seeking good qualitiesWith their thoughts on the profits derived from killingMaster allow us to go forth We pledge to live the holy life under your guidanceTrillions of gods joyfully descend into the river and infuse the waters With perfumes and scented powders so the Sacred Being can batheAnd so his wife with the help of relatives and by her own industry fed and nurtured their son as he grewContinually day and night His thoughts are of sadness over his sonthis denotes the great deeds of the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhasone should fasten the root of umbrella tree to ones headTo Yaśodatta you offered kuruṇṭa flowers and food to SatyadarśinWe have witnessed the army as terrifying it was Vanquished by the strength of your insight merit and diligenceThat which is detachment is taught To be detachment from conceptionsAbiding in this acceptance they perfect the understanding of the aspects of the pathThey are fixated on the applications of mindfulness and in the same vein they are fixated on the other causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasMañjuśrī you have spoken well and explained without explaining the acts and nonacts of bodhisattva great beingsThis signifies the destruction of the ten nonvirtues That emerge from ordinary body speech and mindThe accumulation of merit from paying homage to and possessing the names of buddha bhagavāns as numerous as the grains of sand in sixtytwo Ganges Rivers and that created by paying homage just once to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara and possessing his nameRather bodhisattvas minds sustain all beings with the result of liberation at the seat of awakeningIn the discernment that there is no birth it intentionally takes birth in order to ripen sentient beingsThose who have miraculous powers and reside in the four dhyānas Who are overjoyed to hear the teaching of emptiness And who radiate thousands of light rays Are said to be the great treesBut another bodhisattva may believe in this Dharma teaching andHow you may wonder do they not acquire things through improper avenuesBlessed One how does consciousness emerge from the body and quickly take rebirthThey are not delighted when they hear themselves praised Recipients of alms will have that contentment This dependent arising is the dharmakāya of all the tathāgataslet alone this samādhi as their natural resultIt is the seat of generosity because it has no expectation of rewardThe Saṅgha defeats the nonBuddhists Someone may be able to catch all the sounds In the entire world and put them in a boxand together they sported made love and indulged all of their desiresIt would not shine or gleam but lose its beauty and glowakra and Brahmā went in the front showing the wayIn the same way Subhūti when other individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who are endowed with faith tolerance confidence higher aspiration willingness volition and renunciationthat sound of Dharma occurs to pacify all the misfortunes troubles and afflictions of the gods of the ThirtyThreeWhat is being gentle It is being beneficial to othersOne should dry out and pulverize the root bark leaf flower and fruit of Malabar nut sweet flag Indian pennywort and long pepper andNoble son any place where this discourse is kept will become worthy of homagethe studentAnd Mañjuśrī the awareness jewel of the Tathāgata is completely pure in its intent and is fixed at the top of the banner of great compassionSubhūti it is because the natural expression of the four applications of mindfulness though without entity is still the four applications of mindfulnessand who were bound by one more lifeThrough turning the wheel of the Dharma They teach the Buddhas Dharma It cannot be disturbed by the world with its gods humans and antigodsThose various beings who are blind fools They proceed toward deathEven the names of the branches of enlightenment do not exist internally nor do they exist externally and nor do they abide between these twowho have no genuine faith or trust in the sūtras spoken by the ThusGone Onerelinquish even their own lives for the sake of acquiring the sacred doctrineWe bear witness to thisfor we are born we age we die we deteriorate and then it all happens againHe will share a teaching of pure conduct which is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the endThereupon the Bhagavān taught the following to the bhikṣusThen the Bhagavān seeing the thoughts in the mind of Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra said to the complete saṅgha of bhikṣusOne will remedy this by shavingEmbraced by Hatred Vajrī and so forthto be fully convinced about the absence of personsMañjuśrī bodhisattva mahāsattvas are always seeing phenomena in that way and by remaining in that state they maintain the bodhisattva mahāsattvas field of activityConclusion of the thirtieth chapter TejaguṇarājaWhat is skill in methods It is being skilled in confession rejoicing supplication and the dedication of the roots of goodnessSimilarly they should not dwell on the notion that I should persevere in whichever meditative stabilities are desiredHaving attained this peace this stainless samādhi Those wise people will never have Sorrow pain or mental anguishSo too are all phenomenaWhen the priests stood before Queen Māyā she saidand so with the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities which is empty of the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentitiesThe king renounced his kingdom And entered homelessness in that Jinas teachingIn this way Subhūti do great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of perseverance acquire the transcendent perfection of wisdomāradvatīputra the nonarising nonaffliction and nonpurification of the eyes are without foundationThen by the power of the Buddha venerable nanda asked the Blessed OneIf one recites the mantra seven hundred timesyou should apply yourself to this point without alarm without fear and without hesitationOnce when they were behaving like this the monks asked the Blessed One about itand similarly that the remaining designations made with respect to sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomena up to and including their designation as entities or nonentities do not constitute a bodhisattvaSir what is your approach to the Dharma What instructions do you give to your studentskarma functions as the field for the seed of consciousnessThey journey through all buddhafields In order to bring benefit to living beings Yet they see those fields as just like empty space Free of any conceptual notions of living beingsThey themselves should perfect the transcendent perfection of generosityHe was liberated through the transcendence of wisdomEvil one I will not pass away until all four of my assemblies become restrained lucid proficient and courageous and can teach the Dharma in conjunction with miraclesSubhūti it is because after the irreversible great bodhisattva beings have generated the attentions associated with the world system of desireWhen the bodhisattvas then feel that the nonBuddhists have become close students they declareGadgadasvara arrived in the sky at the height of seven palm trees leading a retinue of bodhisattvasThis body is like a ball of foam unable to bear any pressureThen Great TopKnotted Brahmā said to akra lord of the godsRather bodhisattvas think What sort of insightful person would make their own diligent activity the grounds for looking down on othersAmong them internal phenomena are empty of internal phenomena because they do not endure and they do not disintegrateShe must have an excellent figure an excellent name and excellent proportionsAll around him are his trusted people Some are counting wealth and moneyIn time the young nāga saw monks of pacific bearing diligently practicing meditation recitation and yogaAnd if for countless millions of eonsNoble son bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities fulfill the command of the thusgone onesMaking a homa offering of salt and black mustard or a chaff homaOne will become very strongI contemplated that meaning in this way And the other buddhas in the ten directionsVenerable Lord it is because all things are nonapprehensible in terms of those who would be discouraged the agent of their discouragement or the object of their discouragementthe body of the perfections The powers and the masteriesMañjuśrī there is no TathāgataBy some of the bodhi trees they also prepared a lotus throne or a throne made of fragrant substances or a throne made of various precious materialsIs this true Is this truethere is no one human or nonhuman who is capable of undergoing such hardshipsBodhisattva mahāsattvas who have the restraint of speech attain the three doorways to liberationKāśyapa the Tathāgata the Arhat the perfectly enlightened Buddha teaches the Dharma in that wayThere have been no buddhas in the past Nor will there be any in the future or now in the presentand I saw these different samādhis of Bodhisattva Samantabhadra and othersThe Dharma of the buddhas was not heardnanda if this precious gemstone were immersed in turbid water the water would become clearand some are made of crystalThinking of the bhikṣu Puṣpacandra He could not join in amusements or be happy the precious quality of skillful means and meritThe Blessed One replied Bhadrapāla in that regard there is an inner form and an outer formfree of factors connected with evil deeds and nonvirtuesFinally the divine son Maheśvara the twentyeight great yakṣa generals the thirtytwo great yakṣa warriors and Hārītī with her sons all with their entourages each took a divine parasol offered it to the śrāvakas then sat fanning them with chowriesWhen he said the letter ja out came the statement Transcending old age and death jarāmaraṇasamatikramaṇaI have been thinking of this over and over and he has arrived hereYou must give the excellent light of sacred knowledgetRegarding this it is said It is through meditation on the path that they are liberatedand thirtytwo thousand gods who had all genuinely entered into unexcelled and perfect awakeningSuch were the words that arose in the presence of the maṇḍalas of the assembly throughout all these buddhafieldsthey stood in front of these housesthe level of the tathāgatasall these levels are identical with the real nature of phenomenaThe Secret Guardian of Bliss destroys the afflictionsA thirsty person traveling At noon during the summerwealth countries palaces retinues sons daughters or spousesA householderHis nose is elegantly highThey sport in clairvoyant powersThe thorough cognition of the body is to be ungraspableIt is likewise when there are demeritorious formative factorsIn order that they might gain relief And that they would not turn back he saysWithout attachment they are skilled in teaching and the meaning of words Without attachment they teach in the middle of the assembly Who were diligent with unimpaired conduct Had faultless conduct and were like precious jewels in order to bring all beings to maturity and in order to liberate all beings they continue to do nothing but roam in those three realmsFor isnt the Supreme Being A worthy recipient of the best of offering ritesThey know the activities of all beingsIn that same way a tathāgata arhat perfectly enlightened buddha saves from all dangers all violence troubles harm suffering unhappiness the darkness of ignorance the obscuration of the dark of blindness and being in bondageThis concludes the fourth chapter on the gateways to the light of the Dharmamaking sure that they stay there joyful comfortable unharmed and uninjuredThis was the fourth omenWhen that is known there is no loss And the king attained the acceptance of birthlessness And the voices of all the buddhas of the ten directions could be heard proclaiming their teachings of the Dharma in all the worlds the sounds reverberating in the space beneath the great precious canopySimilarly when demons or demonic gods see a bodhisattva they will be utterly and completely terrifiedI will inspire the unbelieving with faith and I will guarantee my help and protection to those who believe and uphold the Dharmanor will they believe in the karmic maturation of generosity They will only be concerned with the happiness of this lifeIn this way in the teaching of the guides This skill in methods which is most excellentBy dressing a wound with this oil alone the wound will heal All these things can also be achieved by ingesting this oilthe samādhi named Being PatientEven up to the Palace of Brahmā The news went out from person to person The Protector of the World Has turned a stainless wheelOne gives rise to the notion that nonhappiness is not happiness and that nonsuffering is not sufferingSurrounded by priests townspeople merchants householders ministers local lords gatekeepers local people friends and kinfolkAs soon as Dhṛtarāṣṭra arrived he began to circumambulate the city of Kapilavastu Stopping in the east from where he had arrived he paid homage to the Bodhisattvathen the accumulation of merit of all those bodhisattvas on the tenth bhūmi would then equal the accumulation of merit through that alms givingin the abdomen of the effigy of Gaṇapati made of clay from an anthillThey delight always in generosity They give away their possessions and give happiness humankind human beings agents actors petitioners instigators experiencers experiencing subjects knowers and viewers is without foundation owing to the absence of knowers viewers and so onWith  homas of bilva fruitsHe is a refuge for the frightenedshould come And listen to the true DharmaLeft right above below the gates and so forthThese are to attain a supreme body supreme strength supreme retinue supreme presence of mind supreme renunciation supreme purity of thoughts supreme level of meditative concentration and supreme manifestation of insightFriends he said look upon the body of the Bodhisattva adorned as it is with the signs of a hundred meritsMonks I then had the knowledge that I had fully awakened to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahoodJust as a flame extinguished by the wind Cannot be taken up and counted So do the sons of the buddhas Become indemonstrable Once they have discarded all fettersthrough the wisdom of skill in methods he teaches three yānas in order to free beings from the three realms which are like a dilapidated house with its roof and rafters on fireNothing at all would happen to ones body Aside from the effects of previous actionsIt reaches and enters everywhere And stillLike a stainless jewel your discipline has been pureBecome those who save many beings From the hells and from bad karma The Dharma that is taught in all worlds by The Buddha who has the signs of hundreds of merits You did not listen to that saṅgha of bhikṣus Why venerable one did you come to the townthey also encourage all sentient beings establishing them in the acquisition of the six transcendent perfectionsthe subsequent knowledgethis brahmin boys insight would surpass my ownThese are not the real most extensive discoursesWhile reciting this mantra one should direct ones angry gaze into the skyIt is like a palmyra tree if you were to lop off its crown it would no longer be green nor would it flourish grow or expandThus consuming their alms in this way they can pursue virtueand virtuous in the endIf I too have been crowned and anointed a kṣatriya kingwho accepted them and offered them to the Tathāgata the arhat the Samyaksaṃbuddha Amitābhabodhisattvas present thereall those who are practicing austerities all those who reside at the seat of awakening all the buddhas who have attained complete buddhahood and all those who turn the wheel of Dharmathe one who grants offerings perfectly the one who accomplishes disciplined actionnor do they consider doing sosaid anotherOr bow their head for just an instant Or similarly bow their body just one time the monks filed in each carrying his own begging bowl and sat down in order of seniorityNoble son even the tathāgatas do not know the sixsyllable mahāvidyā let alone the bodhisattvasOne should surround it with an outer garland of lotuses and on the eighth or twelfth day of the month using a jar containing five types of jewels one should take it down Having washed and worshipped it one should recite the mantra one hundred and eight timesthe complete assembly and the world with its gods humans demigods and gandharvas rejoiced and highly praised what had been proclaimed by the BhagavānWhat is the causal condition for formationsHere once I attained the threefold liberationthe purity of phenomena is not subject to involuntary reincarnation due to the absolute purity of all other attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience which does not pass awayIf you are a human you dont seem to be oneKolitas relatives again entreated him a second and a third time saying each timeand their great teachings resounded like the lions roar throughout the ten directionsNoble son I know that there are innumerably many buddhas who have now passed beyond suffering whom the goddess Amartyā inspired encouraged and caused to arouse the mind of awakeningEverything is without existence without words Empty peaceful and primordially stainlessGreat King do you see these two boysrostrations to the tathāgata Jinendra buddha of the northThere one could hear the calls of geese peacocks cranes ducks cuckoos ospreys parrots grouse pheasants partridges nightingales and wild ducksRejoices and recites just one word of itwho has a hundred thousand armsThey should nonetheless focus on the most distinguished doctrines among the most distinguished doctrinesIn order to complete the accumulations for their awakening they engage in excellent conductNow that you have been given to me by Māra you should all conceive the spirit

from your travels so eat nowand I was very much ashamedBy offering  homas of whatever flowers may be availableVenerable Lord whatever is subject to afflicted mental states is not liberatedThen the goddesses saluting Vimalakīrti said to himSince his sphere of wisdom is not disturbed regarding the authentic limit he is known as the one who speaks the truthYoung man at that time within that assembly there was a bodhisattva mahāsattva named KṣemadattaHe will not teach the sacred doctrine according to the notions that physical forms are past that they are future or that they are presentI never say anything to them Of these my endless activitiesIn the future when the lifespans of beings last one hundred yearsSubhūti there are no sentient beings whatsoever among the five classes of living beings who are categorized as sentient beings who can conceive of or estimate genuinely perfect buddhahood the nature of the tathāgata selforigination or omniscienceThey do not carry out the practices toward awakening out of a desire for gain praise or eulogy nor for the higher states wealth followers fame renown or honorAll those shortcomings ensue from monks granting ordination into the monkhood to persons who have not yet reached twenty yearssimilarly when they teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beings in order that they might abandon their view of sentient beingsBliss and Joy bring accomplishmentSimilarly this mind of the bodhisattvas is unattached to the applications of mindfulnessFriends alas the sentient beings of this world called Endurance are sufferingThis is not the sacred doctrine This is not the VinayaYou should not have conviction in the emptiness of internal phenomena and you should not have conviction in the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentitiesIn the southern directionCompletely abandon thoughts and recite thisit is because resting is nonapprehensible and so all things do not come to restlike

were emptied of water and dried outTo sow hatred among othersHas practiced wholesome conduct for a thousand eons and now sets out for the Bodhi treeAlso present were some five hundred fully ordained nuns laymen and laywomen all of whom had seen the truthSubhūti if one were to ask in what way great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration encourage secure and establish sentient beings one hundred billion trillion in number in the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationit is because dreams and similarly echoes optical aberrations mirages magical displays or phantoms are the erroneous misconceptions of ordinary peopleSimilarly those who are diligent alert and mindful after eliminating worldly covetousness and sadness without apprehending anythingTo as high up as the summit of existence That is what their physical eyes will be likeSon of noble family if a minister commits any of the five root transgressions he will forfeit

characteristicsThey should not develop attachment for being wealthyemancipation in the perfection of wisdomThey do not engage with the notion that physical forms are imbued with happiness or the notion that these are imbued with sufferingI have never before Seen an omen such as thisand similarly those who apprehend the notions that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are the emptiness of internal phenomena and so on up to the notion that these are the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentitiesIt would leave his spiritual practice in tatters leave him ruined wrecked fallen and defeatedThe one meaning of the differing words Of the sūtras that have been taught by meLike the core of a plantain tree they have no strength unhindered

behold so filled with ornaments and so enchanting that all the gods of the desire and form realms came to think that their own homes seemed like charnel grounds in comparisonWhen Upatiṣya and Kolita had prostrated at the feet of Aśvajit they left and went to where the Blessed One wasWhen they hear about the Bodhisattva entering his mothers womb in such a pure wayIs it your aspirationand who consequently have actualized great compassionTheir ankles are inconspicuousand if he were to conjure up and reveal them being burned cooked and boiled by the fires of hell experiencing unbearable

the universe Sarvagandhasugandhā he bowed down at the feet of the Tathāgata Gandhottamakūṭa and saidThey will quickly attain the highest complete enlightenment and be samyaksaṃbuddhasTherefore in order to protect beings I am going to the city and the supreme palace are not attracted to profit veneration and eulogistic versesHow so Because it is free of all negative tendencies of speechand

called out May the king thriveMañjuśrī what is the gateway to the utterly unbornWhen he awakes he does not see those pleasures He knows that it was a dream to the buddhas and bodhisattvas three times during the day and three times at nightand the utterly unborn on the ultimate level is also ultimately the same as the dharmas of those who are no longer trainingAjita the accumulation of merit through generosity and establishing beings in arhathood that was previously described does not equal a hundredth of the merit of the good karma accumulated from that rejoicingWhat is the elimination of the āyatanas It is renouncing the āyatanas as being like hallucinationsO svāhā to SukhendraWhen I finally managed to get upMañjuśrī is there a method by which a bodhisattva great being who is

OneThey do not prattle incoherentlyto the one who has illuminated the worldThe miraculous powers of this excellent being do not decline His wisdom does not declineTo the one from whom we have heard of his Dharmathey had stomachs the size of mountains and Praising correct conduct and condemning bad conduct Being free of dishonesty and relying on those with correct conductJust as they do not come into being and just as they do not perish that is how I engendered themIn that way they are blinded by ignoranceWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas skill in genuinely encouraging inspiring and exhilarating beings consist inWhen such persons pass on from here and die they will be reborn in the world of BrahmāThose who see all phenomena as objects of hatred will attain purification from karmic obscurationsDivine son whoever focuses on taming disturbing emotions on the ultimate level is not ultimately focusing on anythingThe consciousness of a fly is just thatFinally abandoning both of these Those happy people delight in the Dharma whose emotions had been cooled as if treated by a balm of sandalwoodSimilarly they neither associate the truth of the cessation of suffering with omniscience nor do they disassociate it therefromexhibit himself approaching the other sense fields up to and including the sense field of neither perception nor nonperception or elseIt is like a cakravartin for all minor kingsThe Bodhisattva answered Seven of the smallest particles is one small particleForms created by the mindteeming with many people and creatures and adorned with gardens forests and mountainsFor the sake of supreme enlightenment The dharmakāya should be viewed as that which is the essence of the Tathāgatathe transcendent perfection of tolerance and the transcendent perfection of ethical disciplineNoble son this is how it is As an analogy when the faculty of the lifeforce ceases so will all the other faculties cease as wellthe nāga king Mucilinda worried that the Blessed Ones body would be harmed by the cold and the wind came out of his abodeSon of a selfimmolator regarding the view that some selves endure and other selves do not endureFrom remembering one verse from this samādhi The merit will be vastly greateras the wisest of the wise and the most confident of the confidentand consciousness arises with the intercourse of the parentsAll accumulation ends in depletion All climbs end in fallsbut are not separated from the transcendent perfection of wisdomThey replied Upatiṣya enjoys solitude so he has gone to live in the forestIt is demonstrable in the shaking and waving of treesSenior āradvatīputra  there is the meditative stability of great bodhisattva beings named Heroic ValourHaving completed their approach to monkhood they stood with the deportment of monks who had been ordained for one hundred yearsThe girls are delighted and joyfulIn a situation where saffron and so on is close by And easy to obtainthe fourth door was made of copperIt is free from existence and nonexistence Beyond self and no self A teaching that is naturally unborn That is what we call the wheel of DharmaVenerable Lord As I understand the words spoken by the Blessed OneThe names for conduct names of buddhas And names of beings are equalNor did I dwell extensively with a mind free from errorMonks this teaching I had not heard previously I understood it by intensely and introspectively focusing my mind on sufferingAt the time the Blessed One was seated teaching Dharma to a crowd of many hundreds of monk followersAlthough pleasures are enjoyed in a dream When the person awakes they are not be seenwhen any who accept this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom for but a single day wishing for it appraising it or investigating itmay establish many hundreds of thousands of living beings in enlightenment without his mindfulness being diminishedThere will be no hearers or solitary realizers only bodhisattvas will gather thereThis is how that petition is made While seated he says the followingFor the retinue just as for the main deity Worship them with their own incantationsbut from among all those many Dharma teachings BhaiṣajyarājaHaving made the offering Brahmā sat fanning the Blessed One with a chowrieThey who possess this supreme samādhi Will have the sweet and melodious voice of a cranehatred is an obscurationThey will enter into their homes And they will corrupt those families What qualitiesVenerable Lord if the notion of physical forms as a self or not a self is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of physical forms as such become a bodhisattvaAnd why Because all other vehicles emerge from this oneDesired objects never satisfyand therefore places a dry piece of wood on the ground and rubs another dry piece of wood against itIt would render humans without wisdom insaneMaheśvara in the kaliyuga when beings have bad natures you will be declared to be the primal deity who is the creator the makerAnd then merely say with words I have seen the Guide of humans Moreover many hundreds of thousands of gods came together from the east the south the west and the north The foremost among the gods then spoke these verses to the great assembly of godsFilled with water that has the eight qualities That is clear cool and unstainedBeautiful forms sweet sounds fragrant smells Delicious tastes and pleasant touchSuch is the bodhisattvas perfect giving of fearlessnessSo the Bodhisattva took the bowl and left Urubilvā Before noonhe is the One with Shanks like an AntelopeCovered with garlands of small bells And ornamented with shining jewelsDo not examine him while naked Examine him without his knowing while he is dressed only in a lower robeOh The humans in Jambudvīpa are happy They can perfectly enjoy cool shadein the same way āradvatīputra great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom also examine this same physical body in terms of its material elementsThus without any doubts or reservations about these matters they trust in the authentic accomplishment of the bodhisattvasRestraint and selfcontrol  tso when sons or daughters of noble family dedicate their merit so that such beings will pass to pleasant forms of existence and accomplish wholesome deeds instead of negative ones in order to liberate the beings born in negative forms of existence they should supplicate the tathāgatastook a place off to one side and addressed himThe Blessed One is endowed with forty teethA parasol of precious gems and two yaktail whisks also appeared from midairIn accordance with the aspirations praised by the buddhas through this offering of beveragesI pray that you free me from the suffering of the dark impurities in the womb and from always being ownedHe possessed the retention of the king of sūtras But because of my desires I had him slain Just as one is called hero when one overcomes all enemies so too one is called bodhisattva when one conquers the miseries of aging sickness and deathHis body bearing the best of the excellent marks is adorned with the thirtytwothe noble eightfold path the three gateways to liberation the ten powers of the tathāgatasāradvatīputra do you think that the designations of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness as permanent or impermanent constitute a bodhisattvaGreat brahmin where do you come fromContent with what it finds it does not searchthe inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of ignorance concerning the kleśasJust like a lotus rising up from the waterThis is how you should conceive of the transfer it undergoesSimilarly they will see him having attained manifestly perfect buddhahood turning the wheel of the sacred doctrineWith a mind possessed by anger and full of desire for the divine realms If that food is given to him And if the blood is appliedSuch is the bodhisattvas excellent power of unbreakable commandThose who seek this peaceful samādhiBrother nanda the fourfold assembly of bhikṣus bhikṣuṇīs upāsakas and upāsikāsCommitting more negative actionsThus misdeeds will not be concealed but confessed before those who maintain pure conduct andThere are some who will acquire those same attributes even on touching this basketHow are they perfect in conduct personal associations behavior and deportmentWhat are the three points They are ending the kleśas mastering meritBlessed One noble sons and daughters who have faith in this DharmaMerit fully ripened brings happiness and vanquishes all sufferingtIf he carries all this out and then dedicates it toward awakening the bodhisattva has become trained and that food has become suitable for consumptionSimilarly they will not construe the notion that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are signless and that signlessness is consciousness and the restBhikṣus there is no second yāna or nirvāṇa in this world at all let alone a thirdCool and without any flawsThey will smell the scents of the thrones of the tathāgatashas appeared from the middle of the circle of the assembly remained suspended in the air and congratulated meSo how can you be sagaciousHorse meat should come from the king among horses Whose complexion is neither white nor red With flesh that neither changes shape nor colorsome have five clairvoyancesI will choose for the prince whichever girl his eyes linger uponFriend this is excellent Beloved teacher this is excellentand being consciously aware at all times not to neglect any good qualitythis Great Vehicle is equal to spaceThose who have wicked minds Who are dreadful and accomplish terrible very low actionsOne hundred thousand beings were all liberated from suffering andIf there is consciousness there will be the imputation of name and form and if things are imputed in terms of name and form so will they be imputed in terms of the six sense sourcesāradvatīputra the twelve links of dependent origination are merely conceptualizedThe city is in turmoil and full of terrified cries May the Gentle One not departThen he said to his ministersThe three realms are like that house Dreadful and filled with sufferingLord out of compassion for all beings I will adopt the eight precepts Which include disciplined and moral conduct as well as fastingI have heard that they may reveal things directly or in secret and that they may teach sentient beings with a concealed intentionIn the worlds of this billionworld universeAnd vyāna in the entire bodyEven witnessing Māras army His mind is unperturbedThat which distinguishes between individual objects is consciousnessThrough this many bodhisattvas are trained This is the skillful method of the jinasthey should reflect in the same vein as before Alas When I have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment in this buddhafield I will practice the six transcendent perfections until they possess an inestimable life span and so on in the same vein as before down to they will also approach omniscienceThe Blessed One responded to these words from nanda by proclaimingSimilarly they neither know nor see feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessWhen the Sugata spoke to teach With compassion for the people in the streetsthe hopes I had for conquering and for becoming king of the world were dashed toowhere he was honored by offeringsone will come to know all the treatises clearly within six months as regards both their meaning and composition even if one has never heard them beforeAt that point Mahauṣadhi saw that the face of the Blessed One had become radiant like a garden of lotus flowers in autumnThrough this fully concentrated recitation All desired spiritual accomplishments will surely be accomplishedThe rays of light then unfurled through the worlds of the great billionfold universeWhen liberation is experienced All thoughts become nonthoughtMonks the cold season had passed and it was the third month of springit is because in the emptiness of inherent existence self sentient beings living creatures lives individuals humankind human beings actors agents experiencers experiencing subjects knowers and viewers are all nonapprehensibleThey crush pride as they think I accept the most despicable and meager almsFor even if as many beings as there are in a kalpaand went to the great city of Vijaya in order to beg for almsHowever ignoring the tree with its fine aroma and delicious fruitThey have no attachment do not hope for anything do not focus on anything and do not truly observe anythingHe left the village of Kāṣṭhavāṭa and set out for the village of Nāladathey would all become freed from that mass of sufferingwhy did I insult himSubhūti the acceptance of great bodhisattva beings includes the cognition and correct exertion of those who enter the streamCreating everything and destroying everythingThrough the disengagement of awakening they understand the disengagement of all phenomenaNoble ones if I were to go forth would you put me to work tooIt cancels out the entire sphere of operation of the sensefaculties and piercing to the quick it alters the color of the bloodSuch is the bodhisattvas excellent wisdom that observes the activities of all sentient beingsAt other times they partake of it themselvesblaze with light and splendoryet the nectar that nourishes each one differs according to the differences of the merits each has accumulatedThen after he had died during the time of the teaching of the bhagavān the

accruethose who rejoice in the minds of great bodhisattva beings who are beginners entering the vehicle and similarly who rejoice in the minds of great bodhisattva beings who have been practicing over a long period of time and similarly who rejoice in the minds of irreversible great bodhisattva beings and similarly who rejoice in the minds of those great bodhisattva beings who are tied to only one

prevented to eliminate birthThey sleep mindfully and with alertness keeping a sense of light and of being awakeThe domain where one turns the wheel of the holy Dharma and manifests the magnificence of ultimate liberation yet never forsakes the career of the bodhisattva such is the domain of the bodhisattvaAfterward however once liberated from those hellish states they will be excited by desire and forget the suffering they endured in the hell realmsAnd her knees have a shapely formMañjuśrī how does a beginner bodhisattva abideshould first bathe and then pay homage to the bodhisattva kāśagarbha at the break of dawnAlas My harem has gone astray and so has the populaceGreat bodhisattva beings should rather think When I have attracted these impoverished sentient beings by my generosityThey should excellently adorn that locale in many waysSome priests who were gluttonous by nature saidthey further reflectHe dismounts from his chariot and proceeds on footWithin that temple all the most excellent and exquisite pleasures and amusements came together manifesting due to the maturation of the Bodhisattvas previous actionsIf one abides by that the monk who has gone forth and been ordained

āriputra for a second time made his request to the Bhagavān sayingone should pull out the root of white wild indigo when the moon is in the asterism of PuṣyaLikewise they may speak of the elements of fire water wind space and consciousnessThose smallest particles of dust In those worlds would be uncountableWhat were the previous actions that prepared the Bodhisattva for digesting this drop of vital energyYou subdued clawed demonsThen nanda King Candraprabha saw the man againthen divine son one knows disturbing emotions in a manner free from knowingHow are view and conduct unitedThey neither associate physical forms with present events nor do they disassociate them therefromAnd as one body they quickly came running out of the burning houseThe vajra the wheel and so forthThe words they speak will be remembered Those are the benefits that come from dedication to mendicancy And knowledgeholder fully ordained monksthere were many bhikṣus who held the view of objective existenceSimilarly it has not been revealed so that the sensory element of the mental faculty the sensory element of mental phenomena and the sensory element of mental consciousness might be grasped or not graspedThen Bhagavān the poor man seeking food and clothesWhen the blessed Bodhisattva was bornAt that time the constellation of Puṣya had arisen And the moon and the stars were shining in the skyFather give to us the various kinds of toys for playing with such as an oxdrawn cart a goatdrawn cart and a deerdrawn cartone who wishes to attain emancipation in things without defining characteristics merely wishes to attain emancipation in the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentitiesSearching for food in a state of distressSimilarly he will not teach the sacred doctrine according to the notions that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are utterly pure or that they are not utterly pure
