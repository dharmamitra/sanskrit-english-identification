These two qualities have a share in clear knowingWhich twoTranquillity  insightWhen tranquillity is developed what purpose does it serveThe mind is developedAnd when the mind is developed what purpose

that there were a royal frontier fortress with strong ramparts strong walls  arches and six gatesIn it would be a wise competent knowledgeable gatekeeper to keep out those he didnt know and to let in those he didA swift pair of messengers coming from the east would say to the gatekeeper Where my good man is the commander of this fortress He would say There he is sirs sitting in the central square The swift pair of messengers delivering their accurate report to the commander of the fortress would then go back by the route by which they had comeThen a swift pair of messengers coming from the west the north the south would say to the gatekeeper Where my good man is the commander of this fortress He would say There he is sirs sitting in the central square The swift pair of messengers delivering their accurate report to the commander of the fortress would then go back by the route by which they had comeI have given you this simile to convey a messageThe message is this The fortress stands for this body  composed of four elements born of mother  father nourished with rice  barley gruel subject to constant rubbing  abrasion to breaking  falling apartThe six gates stand for the six internal sense mediaThe gatekeeper stands for mindfulnessThe swift pair of messengers stands for tranquillity and insightThe commander of the fortress stands for consciousnessThe central square stands for the four great elements the earthproperty the liquidproperty the fireproperty  the windpropertyThe accurate report stands for UnbindingThe route by which they had come stands for the noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationOn one occasion VenAnanda was staying in Kosambi at Ghositas monasteryThere he addressed the monks FriendsYes friend the monks respondedVenAnanda said Friends whoever  monk or nun  declares the attainment of arahantship in my presence they all do it by means of one or another of four pathsWhich fourThere is the case where a monk has developed insight preceded by tranquillityAs he develops insight preceded by tranquillity the path is bornHe follows that path develops it pursues itAs he follows the path developing it  pursuing it  his fetters are abandoned his obsessions destroyedThen there is the case where a monk has developed tranquillity preceded by insightAs he develops tranquillity preceded by insight the path is bornHe follows that path develops it pursues itAs he follows the path developing it  pursuing it  his fetters are abandoned his obsessions destroyedThen there is the case where a monk has developed tranquillity in tandem with insightAs he develops tranquillity in tandem with insight the path is bornHe follows that path develops it pursues itAs he follows the path developing it  pursuing it  his fetters are abandoned his obsessions destroyedThen there is the case where a monks mind has its restlessness concerning the Dhamma well under controlThere comes a time when his mind grows steady inwardly settles down and becomes unified  concentratedIn him the path is bornHe follows that path develops it pursues itAs he follows the path developing it  pursuing it  his fetters are abandoned his obsessions destroyedWhoever  monk or nun  declares the attainment of arahantship in my presence they all do it by means of one or another of these four pathsMonks these four types of individuals are to be found existing in the worldWhich fourThere is the case of the individual who has attained internal tranquillity of awareness but not insight into phenomena through heightened discernmentThen there is the case of the individual who has attained insight into phenomena through heightened discernment but not internal tranquillity of awarenessThen there is the case of the individual who has attained neither internal tranquillity of awareness nor insight into phenomena through heightened discernmentAnd then there is the case of the individual who has attained both internal tranquillity of awareness  insight into phenomena through heightened discernmentThe individual who has attained internal tranquillity of awareness but not insight into phenomena through heightened discernment should approach an individual who has attained insight into phenomena through heightened discernment and ask him How should fabrications be regardedHow should they be investigatedHow should they be seen with insight The other will answer in line with what he has seen  experienced Fabrications should be regarded in this wayFabrications should be investigated in this wayFabrications should be seen in this way with insight Then eventually he will become one who has attained both internal tranquillity of awareness  insight into phenomena through heightened discernmentAs for the individual who has attained insight into phenomena through heightened discernment but not internal tranquillity of awareness he should approach an individual who has attained internal tranquillity of awareness and ask him How should the mind be steadiedHow should it be made to settle downHow should it be unifiedHow should it be concentrated The other will answer in line with what he has seen  experienced The mind should be steadied in this wayThe mind should be made to settle down in this wayThe mind should be unified in this wayThe mind should be concentrated in this way Then eventually he will become one who has attained both internal tranquillity of awareness  insight into phenomena through heightened discernmentAs for the individual who has attained neither internal tranquillity of awareness nor insight into phenomena through heightened discernment he should approach an individual who has attained both internal tranquillity of awareness  insight into phenomena through heightened discernmentand ask him How should the mind be steadiedHow should it be made to settle downHow should it be unifiedHow should it be

wayFabrications should be investigated in this wayFabrications should be seen in this way with insight Then eventually he will become one who has attained both internal tranquillity of awareness  insight into phenomena through heightened discernmentAs for the individual who has attained both internal tranquillity of awareness  insight into phenomena through heightened discernment his duty is to make an effort in establishing those very same skillful qualities to a higher degree for the ending of the fermentationsThese are four types of individuals to be found existing in the worldNot

go to the culmination of their developmentThe four right exertions the four bases of power the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors for awakening go to the culmination of their developmentfor him these two qualities occur in tandem tranquillity  insightHe comprehends through direct knowledge whatever qualities are to be comprehended through direct knowledge abandons through direct knowledge whatever qualities are to be abandoned through direct knowledge develops through direct knowledge whatever qualities are to be developed through direct knowledge and realizes through

the qualities that are to be realized through direct knowledgeIf a monk would wish May I attain  whenever I want without strain without difficulty  the four jhanas that are heightened mental states pleasant abidings in the herenow then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness who does not neglect jhana who is endowed with insight and who frequents empty dwellingsVisakha Now what is concentration what qualities are its themes what qualities are its requisites and what is its developmentSister Dhammadinna Singleness of mind is concentration the four frames of reference are its themes the four right exertions are its requisites and any cultivation development  pursuit of these qualities is its developmentMay the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma in briefMay the One Wellgone teach me the Dhamma in briefIt may well be that I will understand the Blessed Ones wordsIt may well be that I will become an heir to the Blessed Ones

comfortWherever you sit you will sit in comfortWherever you lie down you will lie down in comfortThen that monk having been admonished by the admonishment from the Blessed One got up from his seat and bowed down to the Blessed One circled around him keeping the Blessed One to his right side and leftThen dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus he became another one of the arahantsHaving abandoned the five hindrances  imperfections of awareness that weaken discernment  the monk

order to break it of its forest habits its forest memories  resolves its distraction fatigue  fever over leaving the forest to make it delight in the town and to inculcate in it habits congenial to human beings in the same way these four frames of reference are bindings for the awareness of the disciple of the noble ones to break him of his household habits his household memories  resolves his distraction fatigue  fever over leaving the household life for the attainment of the right method and the realization of UnbindingThen the Tathagata trains him further Come monk remain focused on the

a person were to say He has attained mastery  perfection in noble virtuenoble concentrationnoble discernmentnoble release he would be rightly describing Sariputta Sariputta takes the unexcelled wheel of Dhamma set rolling by the Tathagata and keeps it rolling rightlyI tell you the ending of the effluents depends on the first jhanathe second jhanathe thirdthe fourththe dimension of the infinitude of spacethe dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessthe dimension of nothingnessthe dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionI tell you the ending of the effluents depends on the first jhana Thus it has been saidIn reference to what was it said Suppose that an archer or archers apprentice were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay so that after a while he would become able to shoot long distances to fire accurate shots in rapid succession and to pierce great massesIn the same way there is the case where a monkenters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born of withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluationHe regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perceptions fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration a void notselfHe turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation UnbindingStaying right there he reaches the ending of the mental effluentsOr if not then  through this very dhammapassion this very dhammadelight and from the total wasting away of the first of the five Fetters  he is due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that worldI tell you the ending of the effluents depends on the first jhana Thus it was said and in reference to this was it saidThus as far as the perceptionattainments go that is as far as gnosispenetration goesAs for these two dimensions  the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception  the attainment of the cessation of feeling  perception  I tell you that they are to be rightly explained by those monks who are meditators skilled in attaining skilled in attaining  emerging who have attained  emerged in dependence on themThen Dasama the householder from the city of Atthaka went to where VenAnanda was staying and on arrival having bowed down sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenAnanda Is there venerable sir any one condition explained by the Blessed Onewhereby a monk  dwelling heedful ardent  resolute  releases his mind that is as yet unreleased or whereby the effluents not yet brought to an end come to an end or whereby he attains the unsurpassed security from bondage that he has not yet attainedAnanda Yes householder there isThere is the case where a monkenters  remains in the first jhanaHe notices that This first jhana is fabricated  willed He discerns Whatever is fabricated  willed is inconstant  subject to cessation Staying right there he reaches the ending of the effluentsOr if not then  through passion  delight for this very phenomenon and from the total ending of the first five Fetters  he is due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that worldSariputta This Unbinding is pleasant friendsThis Unbinding is pleasantUdayin But what is the pleasure here my friend where there is nothing feltSariputta Just that is the pleasure here my friend where there is nothing feltThere are these five strands of sensualityWhich fiveForms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing soundssmellstastestactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingWhatever pleasure or joy arises in dependence on these five strands of sensuality that is sensual pleasureNow there is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhanaIf as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with sensuality that is an affliction for himJust as pain arises as an affliction for a healthy person even so the attention to perceptions dealing with sensuality that beset the monk is an affliction for himNow the Blessed One has said that whatever is an affliction is stressSo by this line of reasoning it may be known how Unbinding is pleasantFurthermore there is the case where a monkenters  remains in the second jhanaIf as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with directed thought that is an affliction for himFurthermore there is the case where a monkenters  remains in the third jhanaIf as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with rapture that is an affliction for himFurthermore there is the case where a monkenters  remains in the fourth jhanaIf as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with equanimity that is an affliction for himFurthermore there is the case where a monkenters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of spaceIf as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with form that is an affliction for himFurthermore there is the case where a monkenters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessIf as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with the dimension of the infinitude of space that is an affliction for himFurthermore there is the case where a monkenters  remains in the dimension of nothingnessIf as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness that is an affliction for himFurthermore there is the case where a monkenters  remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionIf as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with the dimension of nothingness that is an affliction for himwhatever is an affliction is stressSo by this line of reasoning it may be known how Unbinding is pleasantFurthermore there is the case where a monkenters  remains in the cessation of perception  feelingAnd having seen with discernment his effluents are completely endedSo by this line of reasoning it may be known how Unbinding is pleasant there remains only equanimity pure  bright pliant malleable  luminousJust as if a skilled goldsmith or goldsmiths apprentice were to prepare a furnace heat up a crucible and taking gold with a pair of tongs place it in the crucibleHe would blow on it periodically sprinkle water on it periodically examine it periodically so that the gold would become refined wellrefined thoroughly refined flawless free from dross pliant malleable  luminousThen whatever sort of ornament he had in mind  whether a belt an earring a necklace or a gold chain  it would serve his purposeIn the same way there remains only equanimity pure  bright pliant malleable  luminousHe discerns that If I were to direct equanimity as pure  bright as this toward the dimension of the infinitude of space I would develop the mind along those lines and thus this equanimity of mine  thus supported thus sustained  would last for a long timeHe discerns that If I were to direct equanimity as pure  bright as this toward the dimension of the infinitude of space and to develop the mind along those lines that would be fabricated He neither fabricates nor wills for the sake of becoming or unbecomingThis being the case he is not sustained by anything in the worldUnsustained he is not agitatedUnagitated he is totally unbound right withinHe discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThe technique Ill be teaching is breath meditationIts a good topic no matter what your religious backgroundAs my teacher once said the breath doesnt belong to Buddhism or Christianity or anyone at allIts common property that anyone can meditate onAt the same time of all the meditation topics there are its probably the most beneficial to the body for when were dealing with the breath were dealing not only with the air coming in and out of the lungs but also with all the feelings of energy that course throughout the body with each breathIf you can learn to become sensitive to these feelings and let them flow smoothly and unobstructed you can help the body function more easily and give the mind a handle for dealing with painSo lets all meditate for a few minutesSit comfortably erect in a balanced positionYou dont have to be ramrod straight like a soldierJust try not to lean forward or back to the left or the rightClose your eyes and say to yourself May I be truly happy and free from suffering This may sound like a strange even selfish way to start meditating but there are good reasons for itOne if you cant wish for your own happiness there is no way that you can honestly wish for the happiness of othersSome people need to remind themselves constantly that they deserve happiness  we all deserve it but if we dont believe it we will constantly find ways to punish ourselves and we will end up punishing others in subtle or blatant ways as wellTwo its important to reflect on what true happiness is and where it can be foundA moments reflection will show that you cant find it in the past or the futureThe past is gone and your memory of it is undependableThe future is a blank uncertaintySo the only place we can really find happiness is in the presentBut even here you have to know where to lookIf you try to base your happiness on things that change  sights sounds sensations in general people and things outside  youre setting yourself up for disappointment like building your house on a cliff where there have been repeated landslides in the pastSo true happiness has to be sought withinMeditation is thus like a treasure hunt to find what has solid and unchanging worth in the mind something that even death cannot touchTo find this treasure we need toolsThe first tool is to do what were doing right now to develop good will for ourselvesThe second is to spread that good will to other living beingsTell yourself All living beings no matter who they are no matter what they have done to you in the past  may they all find true happiness too If you dont cultivate this thought and instead carry grudges into your meditation thats all youll be able to see when you look insideOnly when you have cleared the mind in this way and set outside matters aside are you ready to focus on the breathBring your attention to the sensation of breathingBreathe in long and out long for a couple of times focusing on any spot in the body where the breathing is easy to notice and your mind feels comfortable focusingThis could be at the nose at the chest at the abdomen or any spot at allStay with that spot noticing how it feels as you breathe in and outDont force the breath or bear down too heavily with your focusLet the breath flow naturally and simply keep track of how it feelsSavor it as if it were an exquisite sensation you wanted to prolongIf your mind wanders off simply bring it backDont get discouragedIf it wanders times bring it back timesShow it that you mean business and eventually it will listen to youIf you want you can experiment with different kinds of breathingIf long breathing feels comfortable stick with itIf it doesnt change it to whatever rhythm feels soothing to the bodyYou can try short breathing fast breathing slow breathing deep breathing shallow breathing  whatever feels most comfortable to you right nowOnce you have the breath comfortable at your chosen spot move your attention to notice how the breathing feels in other parts of the bodyStart by focusing on the area just below your navelBreathe in and out and notice how that area feelsIf you dont feel any motion there just be aware of the fact that theres no motionIf you do feel motion notice the quality of the motion to see if the breathing feels uneven there or if theres any tension or tightnessIf theres tension think of relaxing itIf the breathing feels jagged or uneven think of smoothing it out Now move your attention over to the right of that spot  to the lower righthand corner of the abdomen  and repeat the same process Then over to the lower lefthand corner of the abdomen Then up to the navel right left to the solar plexus right left the middle of the chest right left to the base of the throat right left to the middle of the headIf you were meditating at home you could continue this process through your entire body  over the head down the back out the arms  legs to the tips of your finger  toes  but since our time is limited Ill ask you to return your focus now to any one of the spots weve already coveredLet your attention settle comfortably there and then let your conscious awareness spread to fill the entire body from the head down to the toes so that youre like a spider sitting in the middle of a web Its sitting in one spot but its sensitive to the entire webKeep your awareness expanded like this  you have to work at this for its tendency will be to shrink to a single spot  and think of the breath coming in  out your entire body through every poreLet your awareness simply stay right there for a while  theres no where else you have to go nothing else you have to think about And then gently come out of meditationThe daily schedule at Metta Forest Monastery includes a group interview in the late afternoon and a chanting session followed by a group meditation period later in the eveningThe Dhamma talks included in this volume were given during the evening meditation sessions and in many cases covered issues raised at the interviews  either in the questions asked or lurking behind the questionsOften these issues touched on a variety of topics on a variety of different levels in the practiceThis explains the range of topics covered in individual talksI have edited the talks with an eye to making them readable while at the same time trying to preserve some of the flavor of the spoken wordIn a few instances I have added passages or rearranged the material to make the treatment of specific topics more coherent and complete but for the most part I have kept the editing to a minimumDont expect polished essaysThe people listening to these talks were familiar with the meditation instructions included in Method  in Keeping the Breath in Mind by Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo and my own essay A Guided Meditation If you are not familiar with these instructions you might want to read through them before reading the talks in this bookFurther Dhamma talks are available on the Metta Forest Monastery websiteI would like to thank Bok Lim Kim for making the recording of these talks possibleShe more than anyone else is responsible for overcoming my initial reluctance to have the talks tapedI would also like to thank the following people for transcribing the tapes andor helping to edit the transcriptions Paul and Debra Breger Richard Heiman Jane Yudelman Dhammattho Bhikkhu Gunaddho Bhikkhu Susuddho Bhikkhu and Khematto BhikkhuMay they all be happyWhatever merit there may be to these talks comes from the training I received from my teachers Ajaan Fuang Jotiko and Ajaan Suwat SuvacoThis book is dedicated to their memory with utmost gratitudeSeveral years ago when Ajaan Suwat was teaching a retreat at IMS I was his interpreterAfter the second or third day of the retreat he turned to me and said I notice that when these people meditate theyre awfully grim Youd look out across the room and all the people were sitting there very seriously their faces tense their eyes closed tightIt was almost as if they had Nirvana or Bust written across their foreheadsHe attributed their grimness to the fact that most people here in the West come to Buddhist meditation without any preparation in other Buddhist teachingsThey havent had any experience in being generous in line with the Buddhas teachings on givingThey havent had any experience in developing virtue in line with the Buddhist preceptsThey come to the Buddhas teachings without having tested them in daily life so they dont have the sense of confidence they need to get them through the hard parts of the meditationThey feel they have to rely on sheer determination insteadIf you look at the way meditation virtue and generosity are taught here its the exact opposite of the order in which theyre taught in AsiaHere people sign up for a retreat to learn some meditation and only when they show up at the retreat center do they learn theyre going to have to observe some precepts during the retreatAnd then at the very end of the retreat they learn that before theyll be allowed to go home theyre going to have to be generousIts all backwardsOver in Thailand childrens first exposure to Buddhism after theyve learned the gesture of respect is in givingYou see parents taking their children by the hand as a monk comes past on his alms round lifting them up and helping them put a spoonful of rice into the monks bowlOver time as the children start doing it themselves the process becomes less and less mechanical and after a while they begin to take pleasure in givingAt first this pleasure may seem counterintuitiveThe idea that you gain happiness by giving things away doesnt come automatically to a young childs mindBut with practice you find that its trueAfter all when you give you put yourself in a position of wealthThe gift is proof that you have more than enoughAt the same time it gives you a sense of your worth as a personYoure able to help other peopleThe act of giving also creates a sense of spaciousness in the mind because the world we live in is created by our actions and the act of giving creates a spacious world a world where generosity is an operating principle a world where people have more than enough enough to shareAnd it creates a good feeling in the mindFrom there the children are exposed to virtue the practice of the preceptsAnd again from a childs point of view its counterintuitive that youre going to be happy by not doing certain things you want to do  as when you want to take something or when you want to lie to cover up your embarrassment or to protect yourself from criticism and punishmentBut over time you begin to discover that yes there is a sense of happiness there is a sense of wellbeing that comes from being principled from not having to cover up for any lies from avoiding unskillful actions from having a sense that unskillful actions are beneath youSo by the time you come to meditation through the route of giving and being virtuous youve already had experience in learning that there are counterintuitive forms of happiness in the worldWhen youve been trained through exposure to the Buddhas teachings youve learned the deeper happiness that comes from giving the deeper happiness that comes from restraining yourself from unskillful actions no matter how much you might want to do themBy the time you come to the meditation youve developed a certain sense of confidence that so far the Buddha has been right so you give him the benefit of the doubt on meditationThis confidence is what allows you to overcome a lot of the initial difficulties the distractions the painAt the same time the spaciousness that comes from generosity gives you the right mindset for the concentration practice gives you the right mindset for insight practice  because when you sit down and focus on the breath what kind of mind do you haveThe mind youve been creating through your generous and virtuous actionsA spacious mind not the narrow mind of a person who doesnt have enoughIts the spacious mind of a person who has more than enough to share the mind of a person who has no regrets or denial over past actionsIn short its the mind of a person who realizes that true happiness doesnt see a sharp dichotomy between your own wellbeing and the wellbeing of othersThe whole idea that happiness has to consist either in doing things only for your own selfish motives or for other people to the sacrifice of yourself  the dichotomy between the two  is something very Western but its antithetical to the Buddhas teachingsAccording to the Buddhas teachings true happiness is something that by its nature gets spread aroundBy working for your own true benefit youre working for the benefit of othersAnd by working for the benefit of others youre working for your ownIn the act of giving to others you gain rewardsIn the act of holding fast to the precepts holding fast to your principles protecting others from your unskillful behavior you gain as wellYou gain in mindfulness you gain in your own sense of worth as a person your own selfesteemYou protect yourselfSo you come to the meditation ready to apply the same principles to training in tranquillity and insightYou realize that the meditation is not a selfish projectYoure sitting here trying to understand your greed anger and delusion trying to bring them under control  which means that youre not the only person whos going to benefit from the meditationOther people will benefit  are benefiting  as wellAs you become more mindful more alert more skillful in undercutting the hindrances in your mind other people are less subject to those hindrances as wellLess greed anger and delusion come out in your actions and so the people around you suffer lessYour meditating is a gift to themThe quality of generosity what they call caga in Pali is included in many sets of Dhamma teachingsOne is the set of practices leading to a fortunate rebirthThis doesnt apply only to the rebirth that comes after death but also to the states of being the states of mind you create for yourself moment to moment that you move into with each momentYou create the world in which you live through your actionsBy being generous  not only with material things but also with your time your energy your forgiveness your willingness to be fair and just with other people  you create a good world in which to liveIf your habits tend more toward being stingy they create a very confining world because theres never enoughTheres always a lack of this or a lack of that or a fear that something is going to slip away or get taken away from youSo its a narrow fearful world you create when youre not generous as opposed to the confident and wideopen world you create through acts of generosityGenerosity also counts as one of the forms of Noble Wealth because what is wealth aside from a sense of having more than enoughMany people who are materially poor are in terms of their attitude very wealthyAnd many people with a lot of material wealth are extremely poorThe ones who never have enough Theyre the ones who always need more security always need more to stash awayThose are the people who have to build walls around their houses who have to live in gated communities for fear that other people will take away what theyve gotThats a very poor kind of life a confined kind of lifeBut as you practice generosity you realize that you can get by on less and that theres a pleasure that comes with giving to peopleRight there is a sense of wealthYou have more than enoughAt the same time you break down barriersMonetary transactions create barriersSomebody hands you something you have to hand them money back so theres a barrier right thereOtherwise if you didnt pay the object wouldnt come to you over the barrierBut if something is freely given it breaks down a barrierYou become part of that persons extended familyIn Thailand the terms of address that monks use with their lay supporters are the same they use with relativesThe gift of support creates a sense of relatednessThe monastery where I stayed  and this includes the lay supporters as well as the monks  was like a large extended familyThis is true of many of the monasteries in ThailandTheres a sense of relatedness a lack of boundaryWe hear so much talk on interconnectedness Many times its explained in terms of the teaching on dependent coarising which is really an inappropriate use of the teachingDependent coarising teaches the connectedness of ignorance to suffering the connectedness of craving to sufferingThats a connectedness within the mind and its a connectedness that we need to cut because it keeps suffering going on and on and on over and over again in many many cyclesBut theres another kind of connectedness an intentional connectedness that comes through our actionsThese are kamma connectionsNow we in the West often have problems with the teachings on kamma which may be why we want the teachings on connectedness without the kammaSo we go looking elsewhere in the Buddhas teachings to find a rationale or a basis for a teaching on connectedness but the real basis for a sense of connectedness comes through kammaWhen you interact with another person a connection is madeNow it can be a positive or a negative connection depending on the intentionWith generosity you create a positive connection a helpful connection a connection where youre glad that the boundary is down a connection where good things can flow back and forthIf its unskillful kamma youre creating a connection youre creating an opening that sooner or later youre going to regretTheres a saying in the Dhammapada that a hand without a wound can hold poison and not be harmedIn other words if you dont have any bad kamma the results of bad kamma wont come to youBut if you have a wound on your hand then if you hold poison it will seep through the wound and kill youUnskillful kamma is just that a woundIts an opening for poisonous things to come inThe opposite principle also worksIf theres a connection of skillful behavior a good connection is formedThis sort of positive connection starts with generosity and grows with the gift of virtueAs the Buddha said when you hold to your precepts no matter what with no exceptions its a gift of security to all beingsYou give unlimited security to everyone and so you have a share in that unlimited security as wellWith the gift of meditation you protect other people from the effects of your greed anger and delusionAnd you get protected as wellSo this is what generosity does It makes your mind more spacious and creates good connections with the people around youIt dissolves the boundaries that otherwise would keep the happiness from spreading aroundWhen you come to the meditation with that state of mind it totally changes the way you approach meditatingSo many people come to meditation with the question What am I going to get out of this time I spend meditating Particularly in the modern world time is something were very poor inSo the question of getting getting getting out of the meditation is always there in the backgroundWere advised to erase this idea of getting yet you cant erase it if youve been cultivating it as a habitual part of your mindBut if you come to the meditation with experience in being generous the question becomes What do I give to the meditation You give it your full attentionYou give it the effort youre happy to put in the effort because youve learned from experience that good effort put into the practice of the Dhamma brings good resultsAnd so that internal poverty of What am I getting out of this meditation gets erasedYou come to the meditation with a sense of wealth What can I give to this practiceYou find of course that you end up getting a lot more if you start with the attitude of givingThe mind is more up for challenges How about if I give it more timeHow about meditating later into the night than I usually doHow about getting up earlier in the morningHow about giving more constant attention to what Im doingHow about sitting longer through pain The meditation then becomes a process of giving and of course you still get the resultsWhen youre not so grudging of your efforts or time you place fewer and fewer limitations on the process of meditationThat way the results are sure to be less grudging more unlimited as wellSo its important that we develop the Noble Wealth of generosity to bring to our meditationThe texts mention that when you get discouraged in your meditation when the meditation gets dry you should look back on past generosityThis gives you a sense of selfesteem a sense of encouragementOf course what generosity are you going to look back on if there is noneThis is why its important that you approach the meditation having practiced generosity very consciouslyMany times we ask How do I take the meditation back into the world But its also important that you bring good qualities of the world into your meditation good qualities of your daytoday life and that you develop them regularlyThinking back on past acts of generosity gets dry after a while if theres only been one act of generosity that happened a long time agoYou need fresh generosity to give you encouragementSo this is why when the Buddha talked about the forms of merit he said Dont be afraid of merit for merit is another word for happiness The first of the three main forms of merit is dana giving which is the expression of generosityThe gift of being virtuous builds on the simple act of giving and the gift of meditation builds on bothOf course a large part of the meditation is letting go letting go of distractions letting go of unskillful thoughtsIf youre used to letting go of material things it comes a lot easier to begin experimenting with letting go of unskillful mental attitudes  things that youve held on to for so long that you think you need them but when you really look at them you find you dontIn fact you see that theyre an unnecessary burden that causes sufferingWhen you see the suffering and the fact that its needless you can let goIn this way the momentum of giving carries all the way through the practice and you realize that its not depriving you of anythingIts more like a tradeYou give away a material object and you gain in generous qualities of mindYou give away your defilements and you gain freedomTwo important questions you have to answer about meditation are how and why  how to do it and why you are doing it  because meditation is not just a techniqueTheres a context for the practice and only when you see the practice in context can you really understand what youre doing and get the most out of itThe how is pretty simpleWith breath meditation sit straight hands in your lap right hand on top of your left hand your legs crossed right leg on top of the left leg your eyes closedThats getting your body into positionGetting your mind into position means focusing it in on the present momentThink about the breath and then notice how the breath feels as it comes in how it feels as it goes outBe aware of the breathingThat means you have two qualities at work the thinking or mindfulness which reminds you where to stay and the alertness which tells you whats happening with the breathThose are two of the qualities you wantThe third quality is what the Buddha called atappa or ardency which means you really put an effort into itYou really focus on what youre doingYoure not just playing aroundYou give it your whole attentionYou try to be ardently mindful and ardently alertArdently mindful means that you try to keep your mindfulness as continuous as possible without any gapsIf you find that your mind has slipped off the breath you bring it right backYou dont let it dawdle here or sniff at the flowers thereYouve got work to do and you want to get it done as quickly as thoroughly as possibleYou have to maintain that kind of attitudeAs the Buddha said its like realizing that your head is on fireYou put it out as fast as possibleThe issues were dealing with are serious issues urgent issues aging illness and deathTheyre like fires burning away inside usSo you have to maintain that sense of ardency because you never know when these fires are going to flare upYou want to be as prepared as possible as quickly as possibleSo when the mind wanders off be ardent in bringing it backArdently alert means that when the mind is staying with the breath you try to be as sensitive as possible in adjusting it to make it feel good and in monitoring the results of your effortsTry long breathing to see how it feelsTry short breathing heavy breathing light breathing deep shallowThe more refined you can make your awareness the better the meditation goes because you can make the breath more and more refined a more and more comfortable place for the mind to stayThen you can let that sense of comfort spread throughout the bodyThink of the breath not simply as the air coming in and out the lungs but as the flow of energy throughout the whole bodyThe more refined your awareness the more sensitive you can be to that flowThe more sensitive you are the more refined the breath becomes the more gratifying the more absorbing it becomes as a place to stayThis is the basic trick in getting the mind to settle down in the present moment  youve got to give it something that it likes to stay withIf its here against its will its going to be like a balloon you push under the waterAs long as your hand has a good grasp on the balloon its not going to pop up but as soon as you slip a little bit the balloon pops up out of the waterIf the mind is forced to stay on an object that it really finds unpleasant its not going to stayAs soon as your mindfulness slips just a little bit its goneOr you can compare it to parents raising a childIf the parents are constantly beating the child the child is going to run away from home as soon as it finds the chanceEven if they lock the windows and doors its going to look for an openingAs soon as they turn their backs its goneBut if the parents are kind to the child  give it good things to play with interesting things to do at home lots of warmth and love  the child will want to stay home even if the windows and doors are left wide openSo it is with the mindBe friendly with itGive it something good to stay with in the present moment  like comfortable breathingMaybe you cant make the whole body comfortable but make at least part of the body comfortable and stay with that partAs for the pains let them be in the other partThey have every right to be there so make an arrangement with themThey stay in one part you stay in anotherBut the essential point is that you have a place where the mind feels stable secure and comfortable in the present momentThese are the beginning steps in meditationThis kind of meditation can be used for all sorts of purposes but the Buddha realized that the most important purpose is to get the mind out of the whole cycle of aging illness and deathAnd when you think about it theres nothing more important than thatThats the big problem in life and yet society tends to slough off the problems of aging illness and death tends to push them off to the side because other things seem more pressingMaking a lot of money is more importantHaving fulfilling relationships is more importantWhateverAnd the big issues in life  the fact that youre headed for the sufferings and indignities that come with an aging ill or dying body  get pushed off pushed out of the wayNot yet not yet maybe some other time And of course when that other time does arrive and these things come barging in they wont accept your not yet wont be pushed out anymoreIf you havent prepared yourself for them youll really be up the creek at a total lossSo these are the most important things you need to prepare forA lot of other things in life are uncertain but a couple of things are certainAging comesIllness comesDeath is going to come for sureSo when you know something is going to come for sure you have to prepare for itAnd when you realize that this is the most important issue in life you have to look at the way you live your lifeMeditation  the practice of the Buddhas teachings  is not just a question of sitting with your eyes closed every now and thenIts about how you order your prioritiesAs the Buddha said when you see theres a greater level of happiness that can be found by sacrificing lesser forms of happiness you sacrifice the lesser onesLook at your life and the things you hold onto the little places where the mind finds its pleasure but doesnt gain any real fulfillment Are those the things you really want to hold ontoAre you going to let them be the factors governing your lifeAnd then you can think of larger issuesThe chance for a happiness that goes beyond aging illness and death Will that be the first priority in your lifeThese are questions we all have to ask within ourselvesThe Buddha doesnt force our answersHe simply sets out what the situation isHe says that there is a possibility for happiness lying beyond the happiness that comes from simply eating and sleeping looking after the body and having a comfortable timeThis possibility is the good news in the Buddhas teachings especially since most of the world says Well this is all there is to life so make the most of itSatisfy yourself with these immediate pleasures and dont think about other thingsDont let yourself get dissatisfied with what youve got When you think about this attitude its really depressing because all it means is that you grab at what you can before you dieAnd when you die you cant take it with youBut the Buddha said theres a form of happiness theres a form of knowing in the mind that goes beyond aging illness and death and that can be attained through human effort if youre skillful enoughSo thats both good news and a challengeAre you going to let yourself just live an ordinary life frittering your time awayOr are you going to accept the challenge to devote yourself to more important things devote yourself to this possibilityThe Buddha was the sort of person who put his life on the lineHe didnt have anyone telling him that this was a possibility but he thought that the only way life would have any dignity any honor would be if you could find a happiness that doesnt age doesnt grow ill doesnt dieAnd he ran up against all the things he would have to sacrifice in order to find that happinessSo he made those sacrifices  not because he wanted to sacrifice those things but because he had toAs a result he was able to find what he was looking forSo the story of his life and his teachings are meant as a challenge for us  how are we going to lead our livesHere we are sitting together meditatingWhat are you going to do with a still mind once its become stillIf you wanted to you could simply use concentration practice as a method of relaxation or a way of calming the nervesHowever the Buddha says that theres more to it than thatWhen the mind is really still you can dig deep down into the mind and begin to see all the currents that lie underground within itYou can start sorting them out understanding what drives the mindWhere is the greedWhere is the angerWhere are the delusions that keep you spinning aroundHow can you cut through themThese are the questions these are the issues that can be tackled in the meditation  as long as you have a sense of their importance that theyre your real prioritiesIf you dont have that sense you dont want to touch them because theyre big issues and they snarl at you when you get nearBut if you really dig down you find that theyre just paper tigersI once saw a meditation manual that contained a drawing of a tigerThe face of a tiger was very realistic  all the details were very scary  but its body was made out of folded paperAnd thats what a lot of issues are in the mindThey come at you looking really intimidating but if you face them down they turn into origamiBut in order to face them down youve got to have a sense that these are the really important issues in life and youre willing to give up an awful lot for their sakeYoure willing to give up whatever you have to give upThats what makes the difference between a practice that goes someplace that really knocks down the walls in the mind and a practice that simply rearranges the furniture in the roomSo when you practice meditation you realize there is both the how and the why and the why is really importantOften the why gets pushed off to the sideYou simply follow this or that technique and then what you want to do with it is up to you  which is true in a way but doesnt take into account the possibilitiesWhen you put the possibilities into the context of the Buddhas teachings you see the values that underlie the practiceYou see how deep the practice goes how much it can accomplish and what an enormous job youre taking onIts enormous but the results are enormous as wellAnd the issues are urgentAging illness and death can come at any time and you have to ask yourself Are you preparedAre you ready to die Ask yourself in all honesty and if youre not ready whats the problemWhat are you still lackingWhere are you still holding onWhy do you want to hold onWhen the mind settles down and is still you can start digging into these issuesAnd the more you dig the more you uncover within the mind  layers and layers of things that you didnt suspect that have been governing your life since who knows whenYou dig them out you see them for what they are and youre free from themYou realize all the stupid things that have been running your life picked up from who knows whereYou cant blame anyone elseYoure the one who picked them up and you played along with themNow when you realize that nothing is accomplished by playing along  that its better not to play along with these things and you dont have to  then you can let them goAnd they let you goWhats left is total freedomThe Buddha said that its so total it cant even be described by wordsSo thats the possibility the meditation points to and its up to each of us to decide how far we want to go in that direction how much we do really care for our true happiness for our own true wellbeingYou would think that everyone would say Of course I care for my happiness and true wellbeing But if you look at the way people live their lives you can see that they really dont put that much energy or thought into the quest for true happinessPeople usually see other people do things in this or that way so they follow along without looking for themselves as if true happiness were so unimportant that you could leave it up to other people to make your choices for youMeditation though is a chance to look for yourself at whats really important in life and then do something about itDays and nights fly past fly past What am I doing right nowThe Buddha has you ask that question every day both to keep yourself from being complacent and to remind yourself that the practice is one of doingEven though were sitting here very still theres still a doing going on in the mindTheres the intention to focus on the breath the intention to maintain that focus and the intention to keep watch over how the breath and the mind are behavingMeditation as a whole is a doingEven when you practice nonreactivity or being the knowing theres a still an element of intentionThats what the doing isThat was one of the Buddhas most important insights that even when youre sitting perfectly still with the intention not to do anything theres still the intention and the intention itself is a doingIts a sankhara a fabricationIts what we live with all the timeIn fact all of our experience is based on fabricationThe fact that you sense your body feelings perceptions thoughtconstructs consciousness  all of these aggregates To be able to experience them in the present moment you have to fabricate a potential into an actual aggregateYou fabricate the potential for form into an actual experience of form the potential for feeling into an actual experience of feeling and so onThis element of fabrication lies in the background all the timeIts like the background noise of the Big Bang which hums throughout the whole universe and doesnt go awayThe element of fabrication is always there shaping our experience and its so consistently present that we lose sight of itWe dont realize what were doingWhat youre trying to do as you meditate is to strip things down so you can see the very elemental fabrications going on in the mind the kamma youre creating with every momentWere not making the mind still simply to have a nice restful place to be a nice experience of ease to soothe our stressedout nervesThat may be part of it but its not the whole practiceThe other part is to see clearly whats going on to see the potential of human action What are we doing all the timeWhat are the potentials contained in this doingThen we apply that understanding of human action to see how far we can go in stripping away the unnecessary stress and suffering that come from acting in unskillful waysIts important that we always keep this in mind as we meditateRemember Were here to understand human action in particular our own human actionsOtherwise we sit here hoping that we dont have to do anything that we can just wait for some Imax experiences to come whap us upside the head or some nice glowing sense of oneness to come welling up insideAnd sometimes things like that can come unexpectedly but if they come without your understanding how or why they came theyre not all that helpfulTheyre restful for a while or amazing for a while but then they go away and you have to deal with your desire to get them backAnd of course no amount of desire is going to get them back if its not accompanied by understandingYou cant totally drop human action until you understand the nature of actionThis is really importantWe like to think that we can simply stop doing stop doing stop doing and things will settle down get calm and open up to emptinessBut thats more like zoning out than meditatingThere is an element of stopping in the meditation an element of letting go but you cant really master it until you understand what youre trying to stop what youre letting goSo try to watch out for thatWhen you come out of a good meditation dont simply get up and go back to the kitchen have a cocoa and go back to sleepReflect on what you did so as to understand the pattern of cause and effect to see exactly what you fabricated in the process of bringing the mind down to a state of calmAfter all the path is a fabricated pathIts the ultimate fabricationAs the Buddha said of all the fabricated phenomena there are in the world the highest is the noble eightfold pathThis is the path were trying to follow right nowIts something put together and you wont understand it until you see the puttingtogether as youre doing itSo always have that in the back of your mind that you are doing something hereSometimes it seems frustrating that the whole hour may be spent just pulling back pulling back pulling the mind back to the breathIt wanders off so you pull it back again and then it wanders  when is the peace and calm going to comeWell before it can come you have to develop some understandingSo when you pull it back try to understand what youre doingWhen it wanders off try to understand whats happening what you did to encourage or allow it to wander offIn particular try to uncover all the skillful and unskillful intentions that go into this backandforth processWhen you understand how the mind goes back and forth youll reach the point where you can keep it from going back and forthAt the same time youll develop the kind of insight we want in the meditation insight into actionsThe Buddha said discernment involves comprehending the process of fabrication the process of action thats going on in the mind all the timeAnd all the basic building blocks of action are right hereTheres the physical fabrication that leads to action  in other words the breathWithout the breath you couldnt do any other physical actions at allThen theres verbal fabrication directed thought and evaluationWithout those you wouldnt be able to speakAnd then theres mental fabrication perceptions and feelingsWithout those the process of mental fabrication wouldnt have any building blocks to build withThese are all the most basic forms of activity physical verbal and mentalSo we bring them all together right here when weve got the mind with the breathWere focused on the breath directing our thoughts to the breath evaluating the breath aware of all the mental labels that label the breath and all the feelings that come with the breath pleasant or unpleasantAll the basic building blocks are right hereThese building blocks are not things theyre activitiesYou might call them basic activity unitsThese are the things you have to bring together in order to get the mind to settle downOtherwise it goes off and elaborates all kinds of other worlds to inhabit pulling its attention away from the basic activity units and hoping to live in their endproductsSo you keep reminding yourself to come back to this level this level this level where things are basic and you try to manipulate these things skillfully so as to still the mindIts an intentional stilling so theres an element of doing even in the being still but its a doing for the purpose of knowingMost of our doing is for the purpose of ignoranceIt comes out of ignorance and heads toward ignorance covering up our intentions so that we can forget the effort that goes into the doing and simply enjoy the endproduct experiences that our doing createsSome people think that Buddhism is a religion of experiencesWe want to have a religious experience when we come here we want to have an experience of release or an experience of peaceActually though the Dhamma is meant to take us beyond our incessant habit of producing and consuming experiencesAnd to do that we have to understand the nature of action that underlies the producing and consuming to see exactly what it is to be a human being who actsWhat does it mean to actHow does the mind actWhat is an intentionWhy does the mind have intentionsAre these processes really pleasant or are they burdensomeWhat would it be like if we didnt have to do themWe need to look into these things we need to understand these processes before we can get to where we really want to goIf you dont understand human action you wont be able to explore the full limits of human actionYou wont be able to understand how far human action can take youSo were here to study were here to learn from our actionsThis teaching on action is something particular to the Buddhas teachings  this sense of what an action is and how far an action can goIts easy to say that all the great religions focus on having experiences beyond what words can describeSounds niceVery friendlyVery ecumenicalBut when you compare what the various religions say about action  what it means to act what the potentials of human action are  you see that they differ greatlySome teachings say that we dont really act at all that theres an outside force acting through us that everythings predeterminedOthers say that we do act but our actions have no real consequencesOr that there are lots of limitations on what we can do to produce true happiness so we need some outside power to help usYou cant lump these various teachings on action together and pretend that the differences dont countThe fact is They dont jibeTheyre diametrically opposedThey get in one anothers wayThis was why the early Buddhists kept insisting that the teaching on action was what set Buddhism apart that it was the most important issue where people have to make a choice and take a standAnd this was why the Buddhas last words were that we need to be heedfulHe didnt end his teaching career with some nice platitudes on emptiness or nibbanaHe said to be heedful  to see our actions as important and to keep that importance in mind at all timesSo this is where you have to make a choice Which theory of action are you planning to place your hopes onThats what youre asked to commit to when you take refuge in the Triple Gem the teaching on action the teaching on kammaTaking refuge is not a warm fuzzy cowardly copoutIts the act of taking on full responsibility for your choices and intentionsHow far are you planning to go with your actionsHow far are you willing to push the envelopeThese are questions that we all have to answer for ourselves and no one can force the answer on usBut just remember The Buddha said that its possible for human action to go to the end of action  in other words to go to a dimension in the mind where ultimately there is no more intentionHe says that thats the highest happinessNow we can take that statement merely as an historical curiosity or we can take that as a personal challengeIts up to usAt the very least when youre sitting here meditating and things dont seem to be going right dont blame it on the weatherDont blame it on the time of dayJust look at what youre doingLook at the raw material you have to work with and your skill in fashioning that raw material into a state of calmFrom the Buddhist point of view that raw material comes from past actionsYou cant change the fact that this is the raw material you have at hand but you can fashion that raw material in different waysThat freedom of choice is always presentSo if things arent going well in your meditation look at your intentions to see what you might changeLook at your perceptions at the questions youre posing in the mindExperimentImproviseSee what makes a differenceWhen things are going well try to maintain them wellSee how you can develop that sense of wellness even furtherThis is Right EffortThis is where we encounter the element of intention the element of action directly in our own mindsIf you sit here complaining about how things arent going well in your meditation thats your choice You chose to complainIs that the most skillful thing to doIf its not try something elseYouve always got that freedomWhen things are going well you can always choose to get complacentIf you get complacent where does that take youYou can choose to manipulate things too much too little or just rightThe choices are hereIts important that we keep that in mindOtherwise we find ourselves trapped in a particular situation and cant think our way out because we dont realize the range of available possibilitiesTry to keep your sense of those possibilities as alive as possible so that the doing of the meditation becomes a skillful doing and not just a thrashing aroundYou observe you watch you look into this question What does it mean to have an intentionHow can I see the results of my intentionsWhere do they show their results They show their results both in your state of mind and in your breathing so look right here make your adjustments right hereAnd even if youre not consciously thinking about the nature of human action youre learning a lot about your own actions as you work with the breath trying to keep the mind with the breath trying to make the breath a good place for the mind to stayYoure muddling around here in the basic elements of human action like a young kid fooling around with a guitar After a while if the kid is observant the fooling around turns into musicThe more observant you are in the way you relate to the breath the more your muddle will turn into a process of discoveryWhen you try to settle into the present moment sometimes you find sticks rocks and thornsThey can be either in the body or in the mind and you have to do your best to deal with themIt would be nice if you could simply follow some easy stepbystep instructions first you do this and then you do that and then the results come without your having to figure anything out on your ownAnd sometimes there are instructions like that in meditation books  but often the mind doesnt fall in line with themIdeally you should be able to let the mind settle down and grow calm and then deal with difficult issues but sometimes before you can settle down youve got to deal with some difficulties firstIts not only the case that discernment requires concentrationConcentration also requires discernment  learning how to bypass whatever issues you can bypass and how to deal directly with the ones you have to deal with before you can get the mind to settle downIf theres rampant lust or anger in the mind youve got to deal with itYou cant pretend its not thereYou cant shove it off into the corner for itll keep jumping out of the corner back at youSo you remind yourself of the drawbacks of that kind of thinking you look to see where theres a lack of reasoning or a lack of logic in that kind of thinkingMany times that thinking simply comes at you with a lot of force just as a belligerent person comes at you with a lot of force to make up for his lack of reasonSo you look at your lust look at your anger look at your fears and try to see What are they actually saying Sometimes you have to listen to themIf you listen really carefully youll see that after a while they dont make any senseWhen you can see that its a lot easier to put them asideWhen they come back at you say Youre not making any sense at all Then youve got a handle on themThe same with physical painSometimes when you sit down to meditate theres pain in the body and it has nothing to do with the meditation postureIts simply there no matter what your postureSo you have to learn how to deal with itFocus on other parts of the body so you get at least some sense of having a beachhead in the present moment a place where you can stay and youre okayThen you work from that position of strengthOnce you get a sense of the breath going smoothly and comfortably you let it expand from that spot into other parts of the body moving through the part where theres pain and out the feet and out the handsYou begin to realize that those thorns in the present are not just a givenThere has to be a part of you thats playing along with them thats making them a problemOnce you see that the thorns are a lot easier to deal withSometimes theres a pain in the body and the way youre breathing is actually maintaining itSometimes the problem is your fear that its going to spread which makes you build a little shell of tension around it  and while that shell of tension may keep the pain from spreading it also keeps it in existenceThe breath energy doesnt flow smoothly there and that helps maintain the painWhen you catch yourself doing this you get an interesting insight The present moment is not just something givenYoure participating in itAn element of your intention is shaping itThen you can turn around and use this same principle with the mindWhen theres lust or anger part of it may be coming from past habit but another part from your present participationIts easy to understand this in the case of lustYoure enjoying it and so you want to continue itActually part of the mind is enjoying it while another part is sufferingWhat you want to do is bring the suffering part out give it voice give it some space to express itselfThis is especially needed in our culturePeople who dont submit to their lust are said to be repressed and have all kinds of warped beasts in the basementSo the part of the mind that thrives when its freed from lust doesnt get a chanceIt gets pushed into the corner of the basementIt becomes the repressed partBut if you can ferret out the part of the mind thats really enjoying the lust and say Hey wait a minute what kind of enjoyment is thisHow about that stress over thereHow about that discomfort over thereThe sense of dissatisfaction that comes along with the lust the cloudiness that comes into the mind because of the lust  how about that You can start to highlight the part of the mind that really doesnt enjoy the lustThen you have a better chance of dealing with the lust and working your way out from under its thumbThe same with anger Try to find the part of the mind thats enjoying the angerSee what kind of happiness it gets from indulging in the angerSee how piddling and miserable that happiness isThat way you strengthen the part of the mind that really doesnt want to play alongThe same goes with other emotions such as fear or greed Once you catch the part of the mind thats enjoying it  participating keeping it going right now  learn to undercut itLearn how to emphasize the part that doesnt want to play alongThen you can start applying the same principle to positive mind states the ones that youre trying to developIf youre conscious of the part of the mind that doesnt want to stay with the breath try to find the part of the mind that does that really appreciates having a chance to settle down and let go of its burdensThe potential is there simply that its not emphasizedSo learn to give yourself pep talksPeople who get easily discouraged are the ones who havent learned that talentYou have to learn how to give yourself encouragement SeeYou did thatYou brought the mind backSee if you can do it again the next timeSee if you can do it faster Thats the kind of encouragement you need the kind that keeps you participating in getting states of concentration goingAfter all if the present isnt just a given why dont you learn how to shape a good presentEmphasize the positive things so they really do get strongerThat way you find that youre less and less a victim of eventsYou come to play a stronger more positive role in shaping your experience of the presentWe talk many times about how ultimately you want to discontinue that participation in the present so that you can open up to the DeathlessBut before you do that youve got to get skillful in how you participate in the present momentYou cant skip straight from unskillful participation to the ultimate skill of learning how to open up to the DeathlessYouve got to go through all of the stages of learning how to make the present a more positive experience  through the way you breathe the way you focus on the breath the way you deal with the various states positive or negative that come up in the mindYouve got to learn how to be a better manager of the present moment before you can develop the even more refined skills of learning how to take all of this participation apartSo when you sit down to meditate youve got to realize that not everything is a givenYoure participating right nowWhat kind of participation do you want to developWhat kind of participation do you want to discontinue to dropThese pains  the stones and thorns and all the other things that make it hard to settle down Theyre not just a givenYour element of participation helps create the stones helps sharpen the thornsIf you can catch yourself doing that and can unlearn the habit you find it a lot easier to settle down and stay settledYou can see more clearly whats going on and your skill in dealing with the present gets more and more refinedPsychologists have done studies of people whove mastered skills trying to figure out why some people are simply very good at a particular skill while other people really master itOne of their discoveries is that for people to really master a skill it has to capture their imaginationThey like to think about itThey like to try different ways of conceptualizing the skill approaching the skill applying the skill in unusual and unexpected waysAnd although we often dont think of imagination as being involved in meditation  in fact we think that meditation is antiimagination  actually thats not the caseTo master concentration it has to capture your imagination just as with any other skillWhen you practice concentration what are you doingYoure creating a state in the mindThat requires imaginationThe noble eightfold path as a whole is something fabricated something put togetherIt brings you into the present but when you get into the present you discover how much input your intentions have in each present momentThe practice of the path is designed to make you more and more sensitive to that fact to see how you put things together how you can put things together in a way that creates suffering or how you can get more skillful at putting things together in a way that creates less and less suffering until finally you reach a point where the whole thing gets taken apart and theres no suffering leftBut to get to that last point you have to understand what youre doingYou cant simply make up your mind that youre going to be totally uninvolved in the present moment and simply be an observer without participating because what happens is that your participation goes undergroundYou dont see it but its still thereSo instead you have to be very open about the fact that youre shaping the present moment simply by choosing what you focus onThats a decision right there The sensations you choose to focus on and the way you focus on them are going to shape your experience of the present momentYoure creating a state of becoming  the Pali word here is bhava  and although one of the things were trying to learn to overcome is the process of becoming we cant simply drop the processWe have to understand it before we can let it goWe have to understand it to the point of dispassion and then let goTo do that we have to keep creating more and more and more of these states but we have to create a type of state thats comfortable to stay with easy to analyze easy to take apart  which is why we practice concentrationA senior monk in Bangkok once asked Ajaan Lee When youre practicing concentration arent you creating states of becoming in the mind And Ajaan Lee responded Yes thats precisely what youre doing He went on to say that you cant take the process apart until you can do it really wellHe said Its like having a hen that lays eggsYou use some of the eggs to eat while the others you crack open and take apart In other words part of the role of concentration is to keep the mind nourished on the pathThe other part is to give you something to take apart while at the same time putting the mind in a position where it can take these present states apartSo when youre conscious of that fact look at the way you put the present moment togetherYou have choices you know different things you can focus on different ways you can focus on themIf you focus on the breath you discover that there are many different ways of conceiving and monitoring the breath your way of labeling the breath sensations the way you decide when an inbreath is long enough when its too long when its too shortA lot of these decisions get put on automatic pilot but as youre meditating you have a chance to examine themYou can look at them carefully and adjust them to see if there are more skillful ways of deciding how long a good long inbreath is what signs indicate that the breath is just long enoughThe same holds true with the outbreaths the depth the rhythm the texture of the breathTheres a lot to play with here and the word play is important because youve got to enjoy the processOtherwise theres no enthusiasm for the meditation you simply go through the motions because its time to meditateAnd when theres no enthusiasm no joy in the process you have a hard time sticking with itThe mind is going to lose interest get bored and try to find something else to think about something else to fill up the hourAnd what you end up doing is filling up the hour with filler  straw shredded paper and Styrofoam peanuts  things that are not nearly as helpful as learning about the breathThe reason were here is not just to put in timeWere here to see how the mind is creating unnecessary suffering for itself and to learn how to stop doing itOne helpful way of understanding the process is to look at the ways psychologists have analyzed imaginationTheyve discovered that it involves four skillsThe first is being able to generate an image in the mind  simply giving rise to an image of one kind or anotherThe second is to maintain the imageThe third is to inspect it look at its details explore some of its ramificationsAnd then the fourth ability is to alter the image making changes and then inspecting it again to see what happens as you alter itAnd although the psychologists who discovered these four skills were concerned primarily with mental pictures in the mind youll discover that any kind of creative work  writing creating a tune whatever  involves these same four stepsWhen you compare the four steps to concentration you find that they apply here as wellIn fact they correspond to the four bases of success desire persistence intentness and ingenuityIn terms of concentration the first step corresponds to giving rise to a nice pleasant state right here in the present momentCan you do thatIf you want to you canAs the Buddha said all phenomena are rooted in desireSo how are you going to use desire to give rise to that pleasant stateYou can adjust the breathYou can adjust your focusBreathe in such a way that gives rise to a pleasant feeling in at least one part of the bodyThen the next step once youve learned how to generate that state is to maintain it keep it goingAnd youll discover that you need mindfulness alertness steadiness to do thatSometimes you find its like surfing The wave changes beneath you but you learn to keep your balanceIn other words the needs of the body will change but you can keep that pleasant sensation going in spite of those changesWhen you first sit down the body may need a fairly heavy rate of breathing in order to feel comfortable but then as it feels more comfortable the bodys needs will changeAnd so you have to learn how to ride that change in the waveAdjust the rate of breathing so that its just right for the body right now right now right nowThis makes you more and more sensitive to the fact that the bodys needs change but you can learn how to maintain a particular balance as you get more and more sensitive in responding to those needs in giving the body the kind of breathing it wantsOf course the bodys not going to sit there saying I want thisI want that but you get more and more sensitive to the signs the sensations that tell you that certain parts of the body are starved of breath energy and you can consciously breathe into themThe third step is inspectionYou look at the state you have in the body Are there places where its still uncomfortable places where it still feels tense where it feels tightWell you can think of ways to change the breathThats the fourth stepThe third and fourth steps play off each other in this way Once you change things you inspect them again to see if the change has made any improvement or if its made things worseIf its made things worse you can try another changeKeep inspecting keep adjustingIn Pali this is called vicara or evaluationAnd as things get more and more comfortable you find that the range of comfort youve been able to create for yourself begins to expandYou can breathe in with a sense that the breath energy in the body is connected in all its partsYou breathe out and the energy feels connected your awareness keeps filling the body saturating the bodyAfter a while you get to a point where you really cant improve the breath any furtherIts just right as it isAs Ajaan Fuang once said its like pouring water into a water jarYou finally reach the point where youve filled the jar and no matter how much water you try to add after that you cant get it any fuller than thatSo you stop adding waterThe same with the breath When you reach the point of fullness you stop making so many adjustments so many changesYou can just be with the breathingFrom this point on its more a question of how the mind relates to the breath whether it feels that its separate from the breath and watching it or whether its more immersed in the breathingAs it gets more immersed the rate of breathing is going to change not so much because you made up your mind to change it but simply because youve changed your relationship to the breathAs you get more fully immersed in the body and breath you develop a sturdy feeling of unification and easeThe breathing will grow more subtle to the point where it finally stops not because youve forced it to stop but because the mind has slowed down enough to the point where it needs less and less and less oxygenThe oxygen exchange at the skin is enough to keep the body going so that it doesnt have to keep pumping in pumping outAjaan Lee compares this state to an ice cube with vapor coming off of it The body feels very still but around the edges theres a kind of effortless vapor that you feel with the inandout breathingThen after a while even that stops and everything is perfectly stillAll of this comes from creating that spot in the body where it feels good to stay focusedThen learning how to maintain itThen inspecting it to see where you can expand it where you can make it more stableAnd then adjusting it in various ways using your imagination to think at least of the possibility that the breath could be more comfortable the breath could saturate the bodyYou could think of all the cells of the body being bathed in the breath  whatever way you have of conceiving the breath that makes it more and more comfortable a better and better place to stayIn this way the four aspects of imagination apply to what youre doing right here even though youre not trying to create a mental pictureSometimes there will be mental pictures behind it but youre more concerned with the actual sensation of the breath as you feel it coming in as you feel it going out as you play with it as you create a sense of very intense wellbeing right hereEven though its something created something fabricated its a good thing to create a good thing to fabricateAs the Buddha said right concentration is the heart of the pathThe other factors are its requisitesAnd for discernment to do its work of insight in the present moment the heart of the path has to stay healthy and strongYou have to create and maintain a good solid basis through concentrationSo because its a created state you have to be creative about it imaginative about itAnd you find that the more your imagination opens up to the possibilities already present the more new possibilities your imagination opens upAs long as youre frank about the process that youre creating this state you dont have to worry about getting attached to it  even though you probably will get attached to it  because deep down inside you know its something youve created and eventually youll have to take it apartBut in the mean time learn how to do it wellThe more solid the concentration the more you want to stay hereThe more you stay here the more familiar you get with the territoryAnd its through that familiarity that the practice of concentration turns into the practice of insight the kind of insight that can liberate youWithout this stability and familiarity your insights are simply ideas youve heard from Dhamma talks read in books notions youve picked up from outsideThey dont seep deep into the mind because the mind hasnt softened up the territory here in the present momentOnly through the practice of concentration can the hardness in the present moment begin to soften up and give the insights a chance to seep deeper and deeperSo when you have this kind of understanding about what youre doing you find it a lot easier to go about itAnd you begin to realize its not a mechanical processIts a creative processThat way it can capture your imaginationWhen it captures your imagination you get more interested in what you can do with the breath not just when youre sitting here with your eyes closed but any time of the dayHow you deal with the breath how you get centered in the breath can help you deal with angerIt makes you more sensitive to what anger does to the body and you can breathe through the physical manifestations of the anger so that you dont feel like theyve taken overWhen theres fear you can try using the breath to deal with fearGet in touch with the physical side of the fear and breathe right through itNotice how the breath can help deal with boredom how it can help deal with illness how it can help deal with painTheres a lot to explore hereAnd as the possibilities of the breath capture your imagination you find that this skill is useful not only when youre trying to sit with your eyes closed but also wherever the present may be wherever you may be in the presentWhatever the context whatever the situation you find that the breath has something to offer  if you explore itAnd to explore it you have to get a sense that it can capture your imaginationIt gives you that kind of challenge along with the sense of reward that comes when youve explored something and discovered something new a valuable skillThis is how meditation can start permeating your whole lifeWhen it permeates your whole life when youre more and more familiar with it thats when the insights arise unexpected insights sometimes insights that you wont always find in the books but very personal very much relevant to how you relate to events in the body and mindAnd you realize that theyve come to you because youve opened up your imagination to whats possible with the raw materials of the presentAjaan Suwat often recommended putting yourself in a good mood each time before you meditateThis may sound a little backwards for many of us because we meditate in order to put ourselves in a good mood and yet he says to start out with a good moodBut when you stop to think about it theres really no way you can get good results out of the meditation unless the mind has at least some good qualities in it some cheerfulness some patience some wisdomThese are qualities that act as seeds that allow the meditation to developWere not totally emptyhanded when we come to the meditationWe do have good qualities in the mind and there are plenty of things we can think about to put the mind in a good moodThis is why we have the chant on goodwill to start out the meditation each and every timeGoodwill is a good thing to think aboutYou look at yourself spreading thoughts of goodwill and you feel good about yourselfYoure not totally selfish not totally angry vindictive whateverTheres at least some goodness inside youYou take that as your starting capitalAs with any investment you need to have something to begin withIf you dont have money at least youve got strength or youve got your intelligenceYou take whatever good things youve got and you invest themThats how they growSo when we sit here to meditate we do our best to make the mind patient to lift it above its ordinary cares and concerns of the day and then bring it to the meditation objectThat way you can relate to the breath or whatever your object in a friendly wayBeing in a good mood puts the breath in good shape as wellIf you feel frustrated about your breathing or frustrated about your meditation thats going to do funny things to your breath make it harder and harder to stay with the breathSo think in whatever way helps the mind get ready to meditate in the mood to meditateThis is part of the first basis of success chanda the desire to meditateYou want to meditateYou feel an inclination an attraction to the meditationIf you sit down and you feel yourself totally disinclined to meditate dont just force yourself to do itRemind yourself of the good reasons for why youre doing itThink of ways to make it interesting ways to make it entertainingYou can do all kinds of things with the breathLook at Ajaan Lees Dhamma talks When he defines the different levels of breathing in the body he hardly ever repeats himselfTheres always something new something different that hes found from his meditationWe dont have to memorize all his ways of analyzing the breathWe should give them a try of course but we should also look at our ways of analyzing the breath energy and see what works for usWhen you feel depressed what kind of breathing feels uplifting and energizingWhen you feel manic what kind of breathing feels groundingWhen you feel lazy what kind of breathing energizes youWhen you feel tense what kind of breathing relaxes youTheres a lot to explore and in the exploration you get absorbed in the breath without even thinking about forcing yourself or holding a whip over the mindThis way the mind can be on good terms with the breath the breath can be good and its easier and easier to settle downSo always take stock of your mind before you meditate to see what kind of shape its inDont let thoughts of frustration or discouragement take charge of the mindThe Dalai Lama once said the thing he found most surprising about Westerners was their selfhatredIn Tibet he said only the village idiots feel selfhatredOf course he said that smiling but its a pretty harsh judgmentAnd its also true I noticed in ThailandPerhaps not so much any more As modern culture moves in it really does teach people to hate themselves to feel bad about themselvesIt holds up all sorts of images of physical and financial perfection that nobody can live up toBut in traditional culture one of the basic skills of being a human being was essentially how to feel good about yourself how to love yourself how to wish yourself well and how to act intelligently on that wishOnly really stupid people would hate themselves and yet that kind of stupidity is rampant now in the modern worldBe careful not to pick it upThe mind has the potential for all kinds of moodsSometimes simply sitting and taking stock of things for a few minutes learning how to use our powers of thought  not to destroy ourselves as many of us do but as an assistance to the meditation  can make all the differenceWe often think that to meditate is to stop thinkingWell you have to learn how to think properly before your thoughts can stop in a skillful wayIf youre thinking in ways that are selfdestructive in ways that are really harmful to yourself and you simply stop its like running a truck into a wallYou can get thrown through the windshield or suffer whiplashBut if you learn how to think in ways that are for your own true benefit  like the things we chant about every evening which are always beneficial to think about  then when the time comes for the mind to settle down and think less and less and less and get more and more absorbed in the present moment its a lot easierTheres a natural decelerationSo the way you prepare yourself to meditate the attitudes you bring to the meditation are very importantThis doesnt mean that you should meditate only when youre in a good moodIf youre in a bad mood think in ways that will improve your mood that will improve your attitude toward the meditation your attitude toward the object that youre going to be focusing onRemind yourself that the breath is your friend and youre here to develop the friendship even furtherIn that way your thinking instead of being a distraction is actually a component part of the meditationIts an important step that cant be overlookedWeve all read how the practice of meditation can dismantle our sense of self as we take a good hard look at the things we identify as me or mineWhen you meditate youre supposed to come into the present moment and drop all reference to the future or the past and simply look at things as they ariseBut some futures and pasts are easier to drop than othersEven if you can drop them for the time youre in meditation youve got to come back and live with them when you come out of meditationThis whole issue of the narratives of our lives the stories we tell ourselves If we could just drop them and be done with them life would be awfully easyMeditation would be easyBut some narratives are stickier than othersWe know that the Buddhas teachings involve learning to drop a lot of things but in some cases before you can drop them you have to learn how to do them skillfullyThe stories you tell yourself about your life are among the things you have to learn how to do skillfullyOtherwise you can come out of a nice peaceful meditation and meet up with the same old rotten story all over againYoull find yourself relating to it and getting tied up in it again and again and againOr else you find that you cant even get into the meditation to begin with because no matter how hard you try to drop the story it stays stuck to your handSo a good part of the meditation is often not just being with the breath but  if you find youve got a story that keeps obsessing the mind stirring up greed anger delusion fear whatever  learning how to deal with that story learning how to tell yourself new storiesLearn a corrective to the old storiesOne of the basic ways of doing this is to reflect on the passage we chanted just now developing thoughts of goodwill compassion appreciation and equanimityTry to develop these attitudes with respect to those stories so that you can tell yourself new stories that are easier to let go of in a liberating wayIn other words you dont just push the stories awayYou weave a new story and then you get to the point in the story where its time to settle down and meditateThat way the story will leave you aloneWhen you come back out of meditation the story may still be there but its not the kind of story thats going to get you all worked upIts been refashionedLearn to get more and more skillful at the way you tell stories in the mind starting out with an attitude of goodwillFirst goodwill for yourselfYou realize that if you sit here telling yourself bad stories over and over again youre going to sufferDo you want to sufferWell noDo you want other people to sufferWell maybeYou may think about people whove wronged you and of how much youd like to see them get their just dessertsIn cases like this you have to ask yourself what youre going to gain from their sufferingYou dont benefit in any way from their sufferingThe fact that youre sitting there wishing suffering on them is harming you right now getting in the way of your meditationSo what you want is a story for yourself that ends up with your being happy and their being happyThats your wishThats the basic foundation for all the rest of the sublime attitudesNow in some cases you see where people are actually harming themselves harming you harming othersThats where you need compassionThink about itYou really wish they could stopAnd of course the same thing applies to youWhen youre harming yourself you wish you could stop causing that harmIt would be good for that harm not to happenIt would be good for those people not to suffer Remind yourself of that attitudeFor appreciation you remind yourself of your goodness of the goodness of other people the things youve done that make you deserve to be happy the things that other people have done that make them deserve to be happyYoure not jealous or resentful of their happiness and you dont downplay their good pointsFinally equanimity when you realize that some things are simply beyond your control No matter how much goodwill you feel for other people no matter how much appreciation and compassion you feel some things lie totally beyond what you can changeNumber one the past cannot be changedYou have to develop equanimity toward the pastLook at what the Buddha has you think about to develop equanimity the principle of kammaOld kamma is old kamma and cannot be undoneWhats important is your new kamma what youre doing right nowNow that can effect some things but there are other things beyond the power of new kamma largely through the continuance of old kammaYouve got to think about that and learn how to develop equanimity in cases where equanimity is appropriateThe Buddha isnt saying that equanimity is better than the other three attitudesYou just learn which situations require which attitude which situations require goodwill which require compassion which require appreciation which require equanimityIn this way equanimity is not simply passive acceptanceIts an ordering of your priorities telling you to stop wasting energy on things that cant be changed and to focus it instead on areas where good will compassion and appreciation can make a differenceSo you look at the stories youre telling yourself and try to inject them with these attitudes and especially the teaching on kammaTheres no wrong that goes unpunished no good that goes unrewardedThats simply the way kamma isTherefore we dont have to carry around ledger sheets  which person did this which person did that  with the fear that if the ledger sheet disappears then that persons not going to get the retribution he or she deservesThe principle of kamma takes care of thatBut remember that it also takes care of you as wellWhen you look at the satisfaction you get out of unskillful storytelling you realize that its pretty miserableIts nothing you really wantIts nothing that stands up to any real scrutinyWhen you see this you find it easier to let goYouve got these other attitudes that will bring you into the present moment in a way that allows you to feel good about yourselfYoure not allowing yourself to be victimizedAt the same time youre not wishing ill on anybodyYou do what can be done given the situationAnd when the time comes where the mind needs a rest the mind needs to settle down thats what should be done right nowThats the best thing you can do right nowAnd that way the narrative leads you into the present momentYou want to look at the attitudes youre fostering in your mind and make sure theyre skillful ones  because the whole issue of kamma boils down to this What you do right now is importantWhat was done in the past may have some influence on what you can do right now but what you do right now is whats really importantAnd the possibility of doing something skillful right now is always presentWhen bad things come you accept them as the results of past kamma but if you realize youre doing bad kamma in the present as well thats something you cant have equanimity forYouve got to change itYou can do your best in whatever the situation is confident that it will work out  that if you keep on doing and saying and thinking skillful things the results will have to be goodSo no matter how bad the situation your hope lies in what youre doing right nowAnd the more you think about this the more it brings the mind into the present momentThats when its ready to meditateIf you look in the texts where the Buddha talks about the past some of them go back many aeons many cycles of the universe describing how this happened how that happened where this came from where that came from long stories about past lives or cycles of livesBut these texts all end up by pointing to the basic principle that has shaped these things and is going to shape the future the principle of kammaAnd wheres kamma being madeRight here right nowSo focus right hereThe same with all the cosmologiesWhen the Buddha describes the levels of being the discussion comes down to where these levels of being come fromThey come from the mind from what the mind is doing in the presentRight here right nowWhatever the narratives are when you tell them skillfully they bring you back to the present momentSo learn how to be a good storyteller telling yourself the right stories stories that will bring you into the present with a sense of confidence in your own abilities with a sense of wellbeing a sense of the importance of stilling the mindNo matter what the stories are  no matter what other people have done no matter what youve done  theres a way of looking at them that can put the mind at restTo try to find that way This is what all the teachings on kamma all the teachings on the sublime attitudes are aboutYou weave new stories in the mind stories in which you have a change of heart new stories that come together right here enabling you to stay right here with a sense of wellbeing clarity concentration mindfulness and discernmentWithout anything tugging you back into the past pulling you into the future youre able to just be right here right now aware right here right now healing the mind right here right nowThats how you use the minds storytelling ability to bring it to a point where it can just stop telling stories and look at what youve gotLearn to be skillful with what youve got right here right nowThats what the Buddhas teachings all come down to this principle of skillfulnessHow skillfully can you relate to the different things going on in your mind for your own wellbeing for the wellbeing of others around youMeditation doesnt mean that youre cutting off any mental facultiesThe mind has to tell storiesEven arahants can tell stories can reflect on the past and plan for the futureTheyve simply learned to do it in a way that doesnt cause any sufferingAnd its not just from their bringing the mind into the present momentIt also comes from reflecting on things in a certain way using the Buddhas teachings as proper tools to weave skillful narrativesLet all the ways that the mind relates to itself in terms of past future narratives stories worldviews cosmologies  all your views  become skillfulLet them no longer be a cause for sufferingThink of the practice as an allaround way of training the mindYoure not here just to get very skillful at noting or at being with the breathYou want the mind to become very skillful in all its activitiesAjaan Fuang once said to me when I went back to reordain that being a meditator requires being skillful in everything not just sitting here with your eyes closedYou approach everything as an interesting challenge Whats the most skillful way of dealing with thisWhats the most skillful way of dealing with that When you have that attitude when youve developed it and trained it in your daily life then when you come to the meditation things go a lot easierA frequent question is How can you tell if youre making progress in your meditationAnd one of the answers is When the mind slips off its object you get faster and faster at bringing it backNotice the answer isnt The mind doesnt slip off at allIts Youre expected to slip off its a normal part of the practice a normal part of the trainingThe point lies in being more alert to whats going on and quicker to remedy the situation when youve slipped off the breathSo an important part of learning how to meditate is learning how to fallThey say that when you start learning Aikido the first thing they teach is how to fall without hurting yourselfThe purpose is that it makes you less and less afraid to fall less and less damaged of course by the fall and also less likely to fall more willing to take chancesSo the trick when you meditate is learning how to bring the mind back with a minimum amount of recrimination a minimum amount of selfcriticism with just the simple observation I havent come here to think about next weeks schedule or last nights fiascoes or whateverIm here to focus on the breath Simply leave those other things and come backLearn how to do it without tying your mind up in knotsIn our modern educational system were quickly channeled into the activities where we have a natural talentAs a result we dont learn how to become good at things that dont come easilySo when we make an effort at something that doesnt come naturally the easiest thing in the world seems to be to slip and fall and then just go with the fall and plop down fallenThats called not knowing how to fallThe trick when you fall is to notice that there is a certain amount of momentum but you dont have to give in to the momentumYou can notice this when youve made a vow to give up something for a particular period of timeLast summer it was popular here at the monastery to give up chocolate in the eveningBut then came the temptation Whats wrong with a little bit of chocolate Well theres nothing really wrong with chocolate per se so it was easy to rationalize and come to the decision to drop the vow to go for the chocolateThe problem of course is that the important part of the vow wasnt the chocolate it was the training in sticking to your vow no matter whatAll too often we assume that once that decision to drop a vow has been made it cant be unmade youre powerless and have to follow through with the momentumBut it is possible to unmake that decision  in the next moment or two moments later three moments laterThis is called learning how to fall properlyIn other words you dont give in to the momentum that leads you awayYou realize that youre always free to change your mind immediately and come backWhen you notice yourself slipping off the breath dont just give in to the momentum of having slippedCatch yourself I can just turn around and youll be amazed at how quickly you can turn aroundNow the mind may come up with other reasons Oh no you cant turn around now youve committed yourself Well thats interestingYouve suddenly committed yourself to the distraction  which isnt committed to you  and you dont feel youve committed yourself to your meditationThis is one of the many tricks the mind plays on itselfThe important point is learning how to see through those tricks not to believe them and to have a few tricks of you ownTheres a part of the mind that says its a lot more natural to take the easy way out but that begs the question of nature versus nurtureIf you go to a psychotherapist you learn very clearly how your particular habits got developed by a particular way your parents raised you or by particular experiences you had when you were a kidThat means those habits are not necessarily naturalThey were learnedTheyre there theyre ingrained but you can unlearn themYou can nurture the mind in the other direction which is what were doing as we train it in meditationWere reeducating the mindAnd not only are we teaching it how to stay on one topic as we stay with the breath but were also teaching it how to come back to the breath more quickly how to catch yourself as the mind begins to let go of the breath and latch on to something else and to just turn right around without any problem at all and latch back onto the breathThis way you learn to discipline yourself without the harshness that we usually associate with the word discipline Were learning a more matteroffact way of dealing with our own mindYou find that this cuts through a lot of the garbageAnd as a result there are fewer hooks for your defilements to hang on toInstead of dealing with abstractions such as my personality my character the way I am just keep focused on the present momentWhatever decision was made it was made in total freedom and if you see its a bad decision you have total freedom to make another decisionWhen you clear away your selfimage  which is another hiding ground for all kinds of defilements  the playing field is a lot clearer and there are a lot fewer places for the defilements to hideA woman I know in Laguna Beach once went to a meditation retreat where she was taught to bring meditation practice into daily life by viewing daily life as an interplay between the absolute and the relativeThose are pretty big abstractions about as big as you can getAnd after trying to think in these terms for a week she came to the Sunday sitting group with a very convoluted question about how to manage her life in those termsI must admit the question was so convoluted that I couldnt follow it but the problem was obvious The more abstract the abstraction the more difficult it is to see your way clearly in the path and the easier it is to get tied up in knotsWe tend to think of abstractions as being clean and neat and Mondrian but actually they leave room for lots of convolutionsThey place lots of veils over whats really happeningWhen you clear away the abstractions you have the mind right here with the breathIt can decide to stay with the breath or it can decide to move awayIts as simple as thatThe same principle applies throughout the practiceOnce youve made up your mind to stick with the precepts you keep deciding with every moment whether youre going to stick with that vowOnce youve made up your mind to stick with the breath you keep deciding with every moment whether youre going to stick with that intentionAnd the more you keep things on simple terms basic terms downtoearth nononsense straighttalking terms in the mind  without bringing in issues about your past without bringing in issues about your selfimage to complicate matters  you find its a lot easier to stay on the pathIts a lot easier to bring yourself back when you fall off because there are fewer convolutions in the terrain youre falling onSo not only when youre meditating but also when youre practicing every aspect of the path try to keep things as simple as possible as downtoearth momenttomoment as possibleWhen I was staying with Ajaan Fuang he would sometimes ask me to do things like Tonight sit up and meditate all night long Omigosh I responded the first time he said that I cant do that I didnt get enough sleep last night and had a long tiring day And so onAnd he said Is it going to kill you Well no Then you can do itAs simple as thatOf course it wasnt easy but it was simpleAnd when you keep things simple they eventually do become easierYou just stay with that momenttomoment decision not thinking about All night all night Ive got to keep this up all night You just think about This breath this breath this breath Find ways to keep yourself interested in each breath as it comes and youll make it to morningThats how you bring the meditation into daily life Keep things simple strip them downOnce things are stripped down in the mind the defilements dont have many places to hideAnd when you do fall you fall in a place thats easier to get up fromYou dont have to give in to the momentum of the fall or get stuck in a quagmireYou catch yourself and regain your balance right awayMy mother once said that the event that first attracted her to my father happened during a meal at her homeMy uncle her brother had invited my dad home from college for a visitThen one day during a meal my dad knocked a glass of milk off the table but he caught the glass before it hit the floorAnd thats why my mother married himI know it sounds kind of crazy  I owe my existence to my fathers quick reflexes  but it says something very interestingAnd its the kind of quality you want as a meditator If you knock yourself over well you can pick yourself right back upIf you can do it before you hit the floor so much the betterBut even when youre flat on the floor youre not a glassYou havent shatteredYou can still pick yourself upTry to keep it as simple as thatWhen I first went to stay with Ajaan Fuang one of the questions I asked him was What do you need to believe in order to meditate He answered that there was only one thing the principle of kammaNow when we hear the word kamma we usually think kammaandrebirth but he meant specifically the principle of action that what you do shapes your experienceIf youre convinced of this you can do the meditation because after all the meditation is a doingYoure not just sitting here biding your time waiting for the accident of Awakening to happenEven in very still states of meditation theres an activity going onEven the act of being the knowing is still a doingIts a fabrication a sankharaIn one of the suttas the Buddha says that all the different khandhas all the different aggregates that make up experience as a whole have to get shaped into aggregates by the process of fabricationIn other words theres a potential for a form a potential for a feeling potential for perception fabrication consciousness and the act of fabricating is what turns these potentials into actual aggregatesIt sounds abstract but its a very important lesson for the meditation even from the very beginningYou sit here in the body  and of course thats a fabrication right there the idea that youre sitting in the body  but given all the many different things you could focus on right now theres the possibility of choiceThis possibility of choice is where kamma comes inYou can choose any of the sensations that are coming into your awarenessIts as if there were a buzz in all the different parts of the bodyTheres a potential for pain here a potential for pleasure over thereAll these different sensations are presenting themselves to you for you to do something about them and you have the choice as to which ones youll noticeDoctors have done studies showing that pain isnt just a physical phenomenonIt isnt totally a givenThere are so many different messages coming into your brain right now that you cant possibly process them all so you choose to focus on just some of themAnd the mind has a tendency to focus on pain because its usually a warning signalBut we dont have to focus thereIn other words there can be a slight discomfort in a part of the body and you can focus on it and make it more and more intense more and more of an issueThats one thing you can do right now but  even if you may not realize it  you have the choice of whether or not to do thatYou can choose not to make it more intenseYou can choose even to ignore it entirelyMany times we have habitual ways of relating to sensations and theyre so habitual and so consistent that we think theres no choice at allThis is the way things have to be we think but they dontThats the other implication of the principle of kamma You can change your actionsIf some parts of experience are dependent on choice and fabrication you can choose to changeYou see this really clearly when you focus on the breathThe breath is always there in the body and if you look carefully youll discover that it has many levelsIts like looking up in the sky Sometimes you feel a breeze coming from the south but you look up in the sky and see a layer of clouds moving east and another higher layer of clouds moving westThere are lots of different layers of wind in the atmosphere and in the same way there are lots of different layers of breath in the bodyYou can choose which ones to focus onIts like having a radio receiver You can choose to tunein to different stationsThe radio waves from all the nearby radio stations all the different frequencies are all in the air around usThere are radio waves from Los Angeles radio waves from San Diego even short wave radio waves from whoknowswhere all over the placeTheyre going through this room right nowTheyre going through your body right nowAnd when you turn on the radio you choose which frequency you want to focus on which one you want to listen toThe same with the bodyYou sort out of all the possible sensations just one type of sensation to focus on the breathness of the breathWherever you feel the sensation of the inandout breath most clearly you focus right thereNow some of us have a radio we havent taken very good care of and as soon as we tune it in to one station it slips over to anotherSo youve got to keep tuning it back tuning it backBut the problem isnt just the tuningIts what you do with the sensation once youve tunedin to itAgain you can focus on the breath in a way that makes it painful or you can focus on it in a way that makes it comfortableYoure not faced just with the givenness of the breathWhat you do with it can make it more or less painful more or less comfortableTo continue the analogy its like having a volume control on the radio You can turn it way up loud so that it hurts your ears or you can turn it way down soft so that you can hardly hear it at allBut as you get more skillful with your volume control you get a sense of whats just right so that you can adjust the level and the pressure of your focus for maximum enjoymentAs you get tunedin more and more precisely you discover there are other subtleties as wellAgain like the radio when you really get tuned very precisely onto the frequency the static goes away and you can hear subtleties in the signal that you couldnt hear beforeYou can play with them turn up the treble turn up the base whatever you wantSo even though the radio signal is a given you can do a lot with itThats the element of kamma in your meditation right now Its what youre doing with the breathYou can learn how to be more skillful in how you relate to it so that you can sense not only the very obvious breath of the air coming in and out of the lungs but also the sensations that go through the whole body as you breathe in as you breathe out the patterns of movement in the body that actually bring the air into the lungs and let it go outTheres a wave going through the body each time you breatheAs you become sensitive to it you begin to sense where theres tension in the body and where theres not where the subtle breath flows properly and where it doesntAnd again its not just a givenYou can do things with that flowYou can improve the flowIf you notice tension in a certain part of the body you relax it and oftentimes doing this improves the breath flow not only at that one spot but also in other parts of the body as wellYou begin to have a sense of the body as a whole series of different interconnected energy patternsA tightening up here may lead to a tightening up over there and it all gets connected in a feeling of overall constriction of bands of tension squeezing the bodyOr you can loosen it upThats your choiceYou can relax this bit of tension here and find that it leads to an unraveling of tension over thereOr you might find that everything gets so loose that you drift offThis means that youve got to learn how to gain a sense of just right so that you can stay with the sensation keep your focus and even if the radio signal begins to drift a little bit you can follow it precisely and stay right with itAt this point you can let go of the sensation of the inandout breath  the coarse breath the obvious breath  and focus more on the subtle breath flow in the bodyAs you work through all the different parts of the body where it feels tense or blocked or sort of squeezed out you let the breath sensations fill all those little nooks and crannies and there comes a greater and greater sense of fullness refreshmentThats what piti meansIts the drinkingin of the good sensationWe normally translate piti as rapture but its also related to the word for drinking pivatiYou drinkin this nice sensationIt feels full it feels refreshing all the way through the body because youve opened up all the little cells in the body and allowed the breath to enterWhen you get that sense of fullness its easier to relaxThis may not be a pretty image but the mind at this point is like a mosquito when its finally hit a big vein in your bodyIt sticks its little proboscis in and just stays right there bathed in blissIts wings go weak its feet go weak and no matter how much you try to brush it away it just doesnt want to goIts just drinkingin what it wantsThe same with the mind As soon as that refreshing breath sensation begins to fill up in the body you let go of everything elseNo matter what other disturbances come youre not the least bit interested because youve got something really satisfyingYou could almost say that its a sensation to die forYou let down your guard let go of everything else because this sensation is so totally absorbingYouve opened up every part of the body every part of your awareness for this sensation to come inAs you stay there and the mind grows more and more still you become aware of a deeper sensation of absolute fullness with no sense of flowing back and forth  a real stillness in the bodyTheres a slight sense of air exchange on the very surface of the body the surface of your awareness but deep down inside theres a great stillnessTheres no longer the sense of drinkingin because youre absolutely fullAjaan Lee uses the image of an ice cube Theres a vapor coming off the cube  a very vaporous movement around the edge of your awareness  but everything else is solid and stillAnd then finally even that vapor stops and the solidity fills your whole awarenessIts accompanied by a sense of brightness even though you may not sense this brightness as a lightIts a peculiar quality a physical sensation a feeling tone of brightness clarity filling the whole body and youre just sitting there in the middle of itTheres no need to rush through these stages no need to go jumping through hoopsIn fact its best if you not try to rushJust find one sensation you can tunein toStay right there and it will develop on its own simply because of the consistency of your focusWhen you finally reach that sense of solid stillness and stay there you begin to realize that you can choose to give a shape to it or notYou can focus on the sensations that give you a sense of the shape of the body or you can choose to ignore themThis is where you really see the principle of kamma coming into play in the meditationIts almost as if the various sensations of the body have turned into a mistThere are these little breath droplets just shimmering there and you sense the space in between themThe whole body is filled with this space which also extends outside the body in every directionInstead of focusing on the little droplets you can focus on the spaceThis gives you a really clear lesson in how much choice you have in how you experience the present momentJust the simple sensation of having a body here comes from subconscious shapegiving choices youve madeYou realize there are lots of different sensations you can focus on and theres a skill in how you choose your sensations in how you magnify the ones you want and how you just put aside the ones you dontSo even though this is just training in concentration theres also a lot of discernment involvedAs the Buddha once said both tranquillity and insight are required for getting good strong states of absorptionAnd he never talked about insight without framing it in terms of kamma in terms of the skillfulness of what youre doingSo this practice is what lays the groundwork so that  when the time comes to consider issues of inconstancy stress and notself  youve got the proper contextYouve created a good space inside a good space in the present moment so that theres no hungry sense of having to grasp after this or grasp after thatWhen youve drunk your fill of the fullness and stillness youre in a much better mood to consider things for what they actually are  so that when insight comes its not destabilizingWithout this solid foundation thinking about inconstancy stress or notself can get really disorientingBut when you start thinking about these issues in the context of what youre doing in the meditation they make it even more stabilizingThis is where concentration tranquillity insight and discernment all come together in a healthy and balanced wayWhen theres a Dhamma talk you dont have to listenThe important thing is to stay with your breathWhen the breath comes in you know its coming in when it goes out you know its going outTry to make that experience of the breath fill your awareness as much as possibleThe Dhamma talk here is a fence to keep you corralled with the breathWhen the mind wanders off heres the sound of the Dhamma to remind you to go back to the breath but when youre with the breath you dont need remindingYou do your own remindingThats what the mindfulness does in the meditationEach time you breathe in each time you breathe out remind yourself to stay with the breathMake just a little mental note This is where you want to stay this is where you want to stayAnd try not to think of yourself as inhabiting one part of the body watching the breath in another part of the bodyThink of the breath as all around youIts coming in and out the front coming in and out the back down from the top all the way out to your fingers all the way out to your toesTheres a subtle breath energy coming in and out of the body all the timeIf youre in one part of the body watching the breath in the other part youre probably blocking the breath energy to make space for that sense of you in the part of the body thats watchingSo think of yourself as totally surrounded by the breath bathed in the breath and then survey the whole body to see where there are still sections of the body that are tense or tight that are preventing the breath from coming in and going outAllow them to loosen upThis way you allow for the fullness of the breath to come in go out each time theres an inbreath each time theres an outbreathActually the fullness doesnt go in and outTheres just a quality of fullness thats bathed by the breath coming in bathed by the breath going outIts not squeezed out by the breathIts not forced out by the breathEach nerve in the body is allowed to relax and have a sense of fullness right here right nowSimply try to maintain that sense of fullness by the way you breatheYour focus is on the breath but you cant help but notice the fullnessIf you cant get that sense of fullness going throughout the whole body find at least some part of the body that doesnt feel squeezed out that feels open and expansive and then see if you can copy that same feeling tone in other parts of the bodyNotice the other different parts of the body where it feels open like that and allow them to connectAt first nothing much will happen from that sense of connection but allow it to stay open stay openEach time you breathe in each time you breathe out maintain that sense of openness openness and the sense of connection will get strongerThis is why the ability to stay with these sensations is so important for your staying with them is what allows them to growIf you move off to someplace else if youre thinking of something else there will have to be a tensingup in the body to allow that thought to happenWhatever sense of fullness might have developed  say in your arms or your legs in different parts of the body down your back  doesnt have a chance to developIt gets squeezed off because youre not paying attention to it any moreThis is why the Buddha talks about concentration as mahaggatam cittam an enlarged awarenessIf your awareness is limited just to one little spot everything else gets squeezed out everything else gets blotted out  and what is that if not ignoranceYoure trying to make your awareness degrees all around in all directions because the habit of the mind is to focus its awareness in one spot here then one spot there moving around but theres always the one spot one spot one spotIt opens up a little bit and then squeezes off again opens up a little bit squeezes off again and nothing has a chance to growBut if you allow things to open up throughout the whole body you realize that if you think about anything at all you destroy that opennessSo youve got to be very very careful very very still to allow this open fullness to developSo these qualities of consistency care and heedfulness are important in allowing this state of concentration to developWithout them nothing much seems to happenYou have a little bit of concentration then you step on it a little bit of concentration then you squeeze it off as you go looking at something else thinking about something elseAnd so whatever little bits and pieces of concentration you do have dont seem very remarkableThey dont get a chance to be remarkableConcentration takes time  and our societys pretty extraordinary in fostering the expectation that things should happen quicklyIf anythings going to be good it has to happen quickly it has to be instantAnd so by and large weve lost the ability to stay with things as they develop slowlyWeve lost the ability to keep chipping away chipping away chipping away at a large task thats going to take time and cant be speeded upWhen the Buddha gives images for practicing concentration he often relates them to skillsSkills take time and he was teaching people who had taken the time to master many useful skillsIn Thailand they still sharpen knives against stones and its a skill you have to learn how not to ruin the knife as youre sharpening itIf you get impatient and try to speed things up youll ruin the sharpness the straightness of the bladeSo you have to be very stillThe mind has to be still and you have to maintain just the right amount of pressure constantly as you sharpen the bladeAt first it may seem like nothing is happening but over time the blade does get sharper and sharperThe consistency of your pressure is what guarantees that the blade wont get worn in one particular spot  too sharp in one spot and not sharp enough in another too sharp in the sense that the blade is no longer straightYouve worn it down too much in one spotThere are a lot of things you have to watch out for simply in the act of sharpening a bladeBut if you have that skill in your repertoire then when the time comes to meditate its easier to relate to what youre doing that same kind of consistency that same evenness of pressure the continual mindfulness and alertness that are needed to maintain the proper pressureAnother skill sometimes used as an analogy is that of a hunterA hunter has to be very quiet so as not to scare the animals off and at the same time very alert so as not to miss when a particular animal comes byIn the same way we as meditators have to be careful not to slip off in either direction into too much stillness or too much mental activityYou have to find the proper balanceI was once talking to an anthropologist who said that of all the skills in primitive societies that anthropologists try to learn the hardest is huntingIt requires the strongest concentration the most sensitivitySo here were not hunting animals but were hunting concentration which is even more subtle and requires even more stillness and alertnessSometimes we in the West think that we come to the Dhamma with an advantage Weve got so much education were so wellreadBut we have a major disadvantage in that we lack the patience and consistency that come with mastering a skillSo keep that in mind as youre meditating when you find yourself getting impatient for resultsYou have to be watchful and consistentYou need that sense of being bathed by the breath being open to the breathing sensations in all parts of the body down to every little pore of your skinThen you learn the sensitivity thats required the consistency thats required to maintain thatThat way the sense of fullness can grow and grow and grow until it becomes really gratifying really satisfying to give your concentration the kind of strength the sense of refreshment the sense of nourishment it needs in order to keep goingAjaan Fuang once said that without this sense of fullness refreshment or rapture your meditation gets dryYou need this lubricant to keep things smooth and running the sense of wellbeing and refreshment the immediate visceral pleasure of being in a concentrated stateAt the same time it heals all our mental wounds any sense of tiredness of being stressedout mistreated abusedIts like medicine for these mental woundsNow medicine often takes time to work especially soothing and reconstituting medicineThink of the creams you put on chapped skinThe skin isnt immediately cured when you first rub on the creamIt takes timeThe skin has to be exposed to the cream for long periods of time to allow the cream to do its workThe same with concentrationIts a treatment that takes timeYour nervous system needs to be exposed to the sense of fullness for a long period of time giving it a chance to breathe in breath out all around so that the mindfulness and the breath together can do their healing workSo dont get impatientDont feel that nothing is happeningA lot of things that are very important require time and they do their work subtlyIf you give them the time they need you find that youre more than repaidAfter all you could be sitting for the whole hour planning next week planning next month planning next yearWhat will you have at the end of the hourA lot of plansAnd part of you may feel satisfied that youve provided for the future but when you reflect on how many of your past plans have actually borne results youll realize the odds against your new plans ever amounting to muchWhat would you have to show for your hour thenNothing very certainMaybe nothing but mousedroppings and strawBut if you give the breath an hour to do its healing work totally opening up the body to allow the breath to bathe every nerve out to every pore you know that youll come out at the end of the hour with a body and mind in much better shapeThe body will be soothed the mind bright and alertAnd you dont need to stop being bathed in the breath when the hour is upYou can keep it going in all your activitiesThat way even though you may not be armed with a whole set of plans for facing the future at least youre in a position where you dont need that kind of armorYouve got the armor of a healthy body and mindYouve got an invisible armor the forcefield of this allencompassing breath continually streaming out from your center to every pore protecting you on all sidesThats something you feel in every cell of your body something you know for sure for you can sense it all around you right here right nowAnd you know that whatever the future brings youre preparedYou can handle itThis sense of fullness brightness alertness Thats all youll need to keep the mind capable healthy and strongWhen the Buddha teaches breath meditation he teaches sixteen steps in allTheyre the most detailed meditation instructions in the CanonAnd the breath is the topic he recommends most highly most frequently  because the breath is not only a place where the mind can settle down and gain concentration but its also something the mind can analyzeIts where all the insights needed for Awakening can arise  while the mind is being mindful of the breath alert to the breath and also conscious of how it relates to the breathIn the later stages of breath meditation the emphasis is focused less on the breath than on the mind as it relates to the breathIn the beginning stages though the emphasis is on the breath itself on using the breath to snare the mind and bring it into the present momentIn the first two steps youre simply with long breathing and short breathing sensitizing yourself to what long and short breathing feel likeBeginning with the third step though theres an element of volitionYou train yourself and the first thing you train yourself to do is to be aware of the whole body as you breathe in aware of the whole body as you breathe outWhen the Buddha describes concentration states he doesnt use images of singlepointednessHe uses images of wholebody awarenessWhen a sense of rapture and pleasure comes from the breath he tells you to knead that sense of rapture and pleasure through the whole body the way you would knead water into flour to make doughAnother image is of the rapture welling up from within the body and filling the body just like a spring of cool water coming up from within a lake filling the entire lake with its coolnessAnother image is of lotuses standing in a lake Some of the lotuses dont go above the water but stay totally immersed in the water saturated from their roots to their tips with the stillness and coolness of the water in the lakeStill another image is of a person wrapped in white cloth totally surrounded by the white cloth from head to foot so that all of his body is covered by the white clothThese are all images of wholebody awareness of a sense of rapture pleasure or bright awareness filling the entire bodyThats what you want to work on when you get to know the breath because the type of awareness that allows insight to arise is not restricted to one pointWhen youre focused on one point and blot out everything else that leaves a lot of blind spots in the mindBut when you try to get a more allaround awareness it helps eliminate the blind spotsIn other words you want to be immersed in the breath aware of the breath all around youOne of the phrases they use for this  kayagatasati  is mindfulness immersed in the bodyThe body is saturated with awareness and the awareness itself gets immersed in the body is surrounded by the bodySo its not that youre up in one spot  say in the back of the head  looking at the rest of the body from that one spot or trying to block awareness of the rest of the body from that one spot of awarenessYouve got to have a wholebody awareness allaround degrees so as to eliminate the blind spots in the mindOnce you have this type of awareness you work at maintaining it  although the work here is not like other workYou work at not moving your attention at not letting it shrinkYou work at not taking on other responsibilitiesWith time though the work becomes more natural more secondnatureYou feel more and more settled and at homeAs the mind settles in its usual nervous energy begins to dissolveThe body actually needs less and less oxygen because the level of your brain activity begins to grow calm and so the breath gets more and more refinedIt can even grow perfectly still for all the oxygen you need is coming in through the pores of your skinAt this point the breath and your awareness seem to have melted into each otherIts hard to draw a line between the two and for the time being you dont tryAllow the awareness and the breath to interpenetrate to become oneYou have to allow this awareness this sense of oneness to get really solidOtherwise its easily destroyed because the tendency of the mind is to shrink upAs soon as we think we shrink up the energy field in certain parts of the body to block them out of our awareness which is why theres tension in the body every time a thought occursThis part of the body gets tense so you can think that thought that part of the body gets tense so you can think this one back and forth this wayIts no wonder that the simple process of thinking takes a lot out of the bodyAccording to some Chinese medical treatises a person whose work is mental tends to use up energy at three times the rate of a person whose work is totally physicalThis is because thinking involves tension in the bodyAnd in particular thoughts that go off into the past or into the future have to create whole worlds for themselves to inhabitWhen were getting the mind concentrated were thinking in a different wayIn the beginning stages were still thinking but were thinking solely about the present moment observing solely the present moment being alert and mindful to whats going on here so we dont have to create worlds of past and futureThis imposes less stress on the bodyIn order to maintain that present focus and not go slipping off to your old habits youve got to keep your awareness as broad as possibleThats what keeps you rooted in the present moment all the way down to your fingers and toesWhen your awareness stays broad it prevents the kind of shrinking up that allows the mind to slip out after thoughts of past and futureYou stay fully inhabiting the presentThe need to think gets more and more attenuatedWhen fewer and fewer thoughts interfere with the flow of the breath energy a sense of fullness develops throughout the bodyThe texts refer to this fullness as rapture and the sense of ease accompanying it as pleasureYou let this sense of easy fullness suffuse the body but you still maintain your focus on the breath energy even if its totally stillEventually  and you dont have to rush this  the point will come when the body and mind have had enough of the rapture and ease and you can allow them to subsideOr there may be times when the rapture gets too overpowering in which case you try to refine your awareness of the breath so that it can come in under the radar of the rapture and you move to a level of total easeThen even the ease  the sense of imbibing the pleasure  subsides leaving you with total stillnessAfter youve become settled in the stillness you can start looking for the dividing line between awareness and the breathUp to this point youve been manipulating the breath trying to get more and more sensitive to what feels comfortable in the breathing and what doesnt so that your manipulation gets more and more subtle to the point where you can drop the manipulation and just be with the breathThis allows the breath to grow more and more refined until its absolutely stillWhen things are really solid really still your awareness and the object of your awareness naturally separate out like chemicals in a suspension thats allowed to stay stillOnce the awareness separates out you can begin directly manipulating the factors of the mind the feelings and perceptions that shape your awarenessYou can watch them as they do this for now the breath is out of the wayIts like tuningin to a radio station As long as theres static as long as you arent precisely tunedin to the stations frequency you cant hear the subtleties of the signalBut once youre right at the frequency the static goes away and all the subtleties become clearWhen youre tunedin to the mind you can see the subtleties of feeling and perception as they moveYou can see the results they give the impact they have on your awareness and after a while you get the sense that the more refined that impact the betterSo you allow them to calm downWhen theyre calmed down youre left with awareness itselfBut even this awareness has its ups and downs and to get you past them the Buddha has you manipulate them just as you manipulated the breath and the mental factors of feeling and perceptionThe text talks about gladdening the mind steadying the mind and releasing the mindIn other words as you get more and more used to the stages of concentration you begin to gain a sense of which kind of concentration your awareness needs right nowIf it seems unstable what can you do to steady itHow do you change your perception of the breath or adjust your focus to make the mind more solidWhen the meditation starts getting dry what can you do to gladden the mindAnd as youre moving from one stage of concentration to the next exactly what do you let go that releases the mind from the weaker stage of concentration and allows it to settle in a stronger oneWhen the Buddha talks about releasing the mind at this point in the practice hes not talking about ultimate releaseHes talking about the kind of release that occurs as you let go say of the directed thought and evaluation of the first jhana releasing yourself from the burden of those factors as you move into the second jhana and so on through the different levels of concentrationAs you do this you begin to see how much those levels of concentration are willedThis is importantInsight can come while youre in concentration as you move from one stage to the next as you notice out of the corner of your minds eye what you do to move from one way of experiencing the breath to the next one level of solidity to the nextAnd you see how much this is a produced phenomenonThis finally leads to the stages of breath meditation associated with insightFirst theres insight into inconstancy both in the breath but more importantly in the mind as you see that even these stable very refreshing levels of concentration are willedUnderlying all the refreshment all the stability is a repeated willing willing willing to keep the state of concentration goingTheres an element of burdensomeness thereInsight into inconstancy or impermanence has less to do with how you consume experiences than it does with how you produce themYou see all the effort that goes into producing a particular type of experience and the question becomes Is it worth itIsnt this burdensome having to keep making making making these experiences all the timeThen the problem becomes What are you going to do to let go of this burden If you dont fabricate these states of concentration is your only choice to go back to fabricating other kinds of experiencesOr is it possible not to fabricate any experience at allAll of our normal experiences from moment to moment to moment whether in concentration or out have an element of intention an element of willAnd now youve come to the point where that element of will that element of intention begins to stand out as an obvious burdenParticularly when you look around to ask Who am I producing this forExactly who is consuming this You come to see that your sense of who you are who this consumer is is difficult to pin down because its all made out of the aggregates and the aggregates themselves are inconstant stressful and notselfThis consumer is something produced as wellThis gives rise to a quality the texts call nibbida which can be translated as disenchantment or disillusionmentSometimes the translation gets stronger revulsionIn all cases its a sense that youve had enough of thisYou feel trapped by this processYou no longer find any satisfaction hereYou want to find a way outSo you focus on letting goAccording to the texts first theres a focus on dispassion then a focus on cessation then finally a focus on total relinquishmentIn other words in the final stage you let go of every kind of doing every kind of volition of the producer of the consumer of the observer even of the perceptions and the thoughtfabrications that make up the pathWhen the pathfactors have done their job you can let them go as wellAll of this takes place right at the breath at the point where the mind and the body meet at the breathThis is why the Buddha never has you totally drop the breath as your theme of meditationProgress along the path comes simply from staying right here and growing more and more aware of whats going on all around right hereYou develop a more allaround awareness not only allaround in the body but also allaround in the mindYou see through the blind spots that allowed you to consume experiences obliviously forgetting the fact that you had to produce themIts like watching a movie  two hours of lights flashing up on a screen  and then later seeing a documentary about how they made the movieYou realize that months sometimes years of labor went into it and the question becomes Was it worth it A few brief hours of empty enjoyment and then you forget about it  despite all the work all the suffering that went into making itSo when you look at all your experiences in the same way seeing all the effort that goes into their production and asking if its worth it Thats when you really get disillusioned disenchanted when you can really let goYou let go not only of perceptions or feelings as they come and go but also of the act of creating these thingsYou see that this act of creating is allpervasive covers all your experiencesYoure always creating either skillfully or unskillfullyThere is constant production every time theres an intention every time theres a choice in the mindThis is what begins to seem oppressive this is what finally impels you to let goYou let go of the producing you let go of the creation and the lettinggo really opens things upThe mind opens to another dimension entirely one thats not made up thats not created where theres no arising or passing awayAnd that too is touched right here although at that moment theres no sense of breath no sense of the body no sense of the mind as a functioning creating consumer or producerWhen the Buddha talks about it all his words are analogies and all the analogies are of freedomThats about all that can be said when you try to describe it but theres a lot that can be said about how to get thereThats why the Buddhas teachings are so extensiveHe goes into a lot of detail on how to get there outlining all of the stepsBut if you want to know what the goal is like dont go looking for extensive descriptionsJust follow the steps and youll know for yourself right hereSometimes meditation is easy sometimes its hardBut whether its easy or hard we have to keep our minds on an even keelWhen it gets easy dont get complacentIf you get complacent things start loosening up like screws loosening up in your carAfter a while things begin to rattle and then they fall offAt the same time when things dont go well dont get upsetRule number one in either case is to keep the mind on an even keelHave a strong sense of the observer the part of the mind thats simply watching whats going on and identify as much as you can with thatAjaan Suwat once mentioned that when he first went to stay with Ajaan Mun his mind seemed to be all over the placeHed sit and meditate and be thinking about this thinking about that and he was afraid to tell Ajaan Mun for fear of what Ajaan Mun might sayBut then he realized Im here to learn So he went to see Ajaan Mun to see what kind of advice he would giveAnd Ajaan Muns response was this Well at least youre aware of whats happeningThats better than not being aware of your distractions at all Then he quoted the Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness Being aware of a scattered mind when its scattered counts as one of the foundations of mindfulnessAjaan Suwat handled that lesson really wellHe realized that Ajaan Mun was not praising him but simply giving him some comfort giving him some encouragementHe wasnt saying that where he was was just fine but he was reminding him that it wasnt a total disaster that the fact that he was meditating was better than not meditating at allThis often happens with people Things dont go well in their meditation and they say Well tonights just not my night to meditateId do better to stop Not meditating is not the answerEven though it may not be pleasant sitting through a bad meditation is better than not meditatingThere may be some point in the course of the meditation when you finally come to your senses when you see something in there that you didnt see beforeThis is why that sense of the observer is so importantIn the Canon they talk about the person whos got his or her theme of meditation well in hand and the image they use is of a person sitting whos watching someone lying down or of a person standing whos watching someone sittingIn other words you place yourself a little bit above whats going on and you watch itYou step back to see whats happening from a better perspective to get a sense of where the imbalance is in your mind to watch what youre doing and to think about what you might do differentlyExactly why is the meditation going poorlyWhats lackingAjaan Fuang once advised making a mental note of the seven factors that Ajaan Lee sets out in his Method  and then comparing your meditation with them to see whats lackingIf youve got all seven component factors then the mind is going to settle down for sure mindful solid and stillSo check to see whats lackingAre you not clear about the lengths of the breathsAre you not clear about whether the breath is comfortableAre you not spreading the comfortable breath sensationsDo you not have a resting place for the mind for the breath in the bodyJust go down the list and if you find that any of the component factors are missing try to make up for the lackBut again to do this you need that sense of the observer the person whos watching and doesnt get upset by whats happening doesnt get carried away but just watches in total neutralityWhen you can watch in this way then even a bad meditation isnt a total disasterYou take it as a challengeTonights meditation may be a little bit different from last nightsLast nights went well but you start out tonight and things dont seem to be going so wellInstead of getting flustered just ask Is it a question of the bodyIs something wrong with the breathIs something wrong with your energy levelAre you too manicToo depressed Lots of different factors can be playing a role here either factors in the mind or factors in the bodyIf your energy level is too low you can change the way you breathe to energize yourselfIf your energy is too frenetic you can breathe in a way that calms you downTry to be as precisely observant as possibleMany times what makes a difference in the meditation is the details the little things and if youre not paying careful attention simply going through the motions you miss a lotYou may be missing something important even though it seems minorTry to go through every aspect very meticulously try to be very observant be close in your powers of observationTheres a word in Thai thii thats used to describe the closeness say of the teeth in your comb or the pickets in a fence  any series of thingsIts also used to describe the frequency of a radio signalThe higher the frequency the closer the frequencySo you want your acts of mindfulness your acts of alertness to be very close right next to each other with no gapsOtherwise if you leave a lot of gaps theres plenty of time for the curtains to come down in the mindThe backstage crew can change the scenery and when the curtain comes up again youre off someplace elseBut if your mindfulness is close like this then they have no time to bring down the curtainIf they change the scenery you see it happening and that destroys the illusion that otherwise would carry you awaySo whatever happens in the meditation always stop and take stock of Wheres the observer right now  in other words the part of the mind that can simply watch and not be moved by events at allWere so used to living in the part of the mind thats constantly pushed around by events that it almost seems traitorous to step back and be in the part thats not moved by anything at all not touched by anything at all that just watches seeing whats going onTheres always that corner in the mindSo try to locate it get familiar with itLearn how to make that the basis of your stance so that no matter what happens you see the events clearly for what they areYou clearly see the connection between cause and effectThat puts you in a position where you can use your ingenuity to make changes adjust things here adjust things there try this try thatEven if what you try doesnt work out youve learned somethingYouve learned that that particular tactic doesnt work here which is something worth knowingIf you take this attitude then no matter how well the meditation goes no matter how poorly it goes its always an opportunity to learnOne of the most difficult but necessary skills we need to develop as meditators is learning how to be judicious without being judgmentalAnd as a preliminary step to developing that skill its good to reflect on the difference between the twoBeing judgmental is basically an effort to get rid of something we dont understand and probably dont want to understandWe see something we dont like and we try to dismiss it to stamp it out without taking the time to understand itWere impatientWhatever were being judgmental about we just want to get rid of it quicklyBeing judicious however requires patience together with understandingA judicious choice is one youve made after understanding all the options all the sides of a questionThat way your choice is based on knowledge not on greed aversion or delusionThis is why the Buddha in his analysis of the four truths said that our task with the regard to the first truth  the truth of suffering or stress  is to comprehend itAll too often we treat pain in the same way we treat anything we dont like We want to get rid of it as fast as possible without taking the time to understand itSo what were learning as we practice is how not to be judgmental about the things we dont like inside ourselvesWe develop the patience and the skill we need in order to stop and take a good long look at these things so that we can deal with them judiciously so we can deal with them through understandingWe give them space so that we can watch them can understand them so that when we finally decide that they really are unskillful that we really dont want to have them going on in our mind we can get rid of them neatly effectivelyThe problem with being judgmental is that its not effectiveWe try to stamp out things here and they go springing up someplace else as in the old movie The ThingThe Thing would go underground and suddenly spring up someplace elseIf you cut off one head here one identity here its underground roots and tentacles would spring up with a new even more horrific identity someplace elseThe same thing happens when we try to get rid of anything in the mind when we dont understand its roots dont understand where its coming fromBeing judicious though is more effectiveIts more preciseWe see whats really skillful whats really unskillful in the mind and we learn how to disentangle the twoOften our skillful and unskillful habits get entangledThe things we dont like within ourselves actually do have some good in them but we dont notice itWe focus instead on what we dont like or what were afraid of and we end up trying to stamp it all out the good along with the badSo this is why we meditate to step back a bit to watch things patiently so that we can see them for what they are and deal with them effectivelyOur concentration practice gives us a comfortable center in our awareness where we can rest where we feel less threatened by thingsWhen we feel less threatened and less oppressed we have the resilience to be more patient to look into whats going on in the mind and to develop the proper attitudes toward what is skillful and what isntThis is where the four sublime attitudes come inBack in the s I read a book about Buddhism whose author tried to organize everything around the four noble truths but couldnt figure how the four sublime attitudes fit into the framework of the four truthsThey just didnt seem to connect anyplace at all so the author ended up treating them as an entirely separate topicBut actually the four sublime attitudes underlie the whole practiceTheyre the reason the Buddha focused his teaching on the four noble truthsYou need a sense of goodwill to be even interested in the question of trying to understand suffering because you want to find an effective way of dealing with itYou want to be rid of suffering to experience wellbeing precisely because you have goodwill for yourself and for othersSo as meditators we try to use that attitude that desire as a way of developing the center we need in order to work toward that wellbeing from a position of strengthIf you dont have that basic sense of goodwill youll have a hard time trying to stir up the energy needed to master the concentration to keep with the breath to keep coming back to the breath no matter how many times you wander offNow you may want to be at a more advanced stage than trying to rein in the mindYou want to sit down and Bung there it is the first jhanaBut when it doesnt happen quickly you get frustratedSo put that frustration asidePut away all the pride and the shadow side of pride which is the shameJust put those things aside and remind yourself that this is the way things are this is where you are and be willing just to keep coming back coming back to stick with those simple tasksThe people who master any kind of skill are the ones who are willing to step back and master the simple steps to practice them over and over again because its in doing the simple steps and being observant that you learn many of your most important lessonsThese steps are not just a mechanical process that you have to bulldoze your way through as quickly as possibleYou have to pay attention to what youre doing even when things are not going wellPay attention to how the mind slips off pay attention to how you bring it back and youll learn an awful lot right thereUnderlying all this has to be an attitude of goodnatured goodwillIf theres a sense of frustration remember that youre here because of goodwill not for the sake of frustration not for the sake of finding some new thing to beat yourself over the head about or to be judgmental aboutYoure here for the sake of goodwill for the sake of giving the mind a place where it can settle in and be at easeDevelop compassion for yourselfThink of all the suffering you could be causing yourself if you werent meditatingThink of all the suffering you might be causing others if you werent meditatingThis helps to remind you that when things arent going all that well in the meditation its still a lot better than most of the things that people do in their livesIts a good beneficial use of your timeThen develop an attitude of sympathetic joy appreciating the happiness you can develop through the practice appreciating the happiness of othersOf all the four sublime attitudes sympathetic joy gets the least pressIts often the hardest to developThere seem to be voices in our heads that resent happiness  either the happiness of other people or if other people have resented our happiness weve picked up their voices someplace and can even be distrustful of our own happinessSo we have to counter those voices by realizing that there is nothing wrong with happinessIt comes through our actionsIf the happiness that someone is experiencing right now doesnt seem to be deserved in terms of his or her present actions there must be something in the past to account for itAt the same time remind yourself that an attitude of resentment doesnt help you or anyone else at allSometimes it seems unfair that some people are happy and others are notBut for the time being just put the question of fairness or unfairness asideWherever theres a sense of wellbeing in the mind learn how to appreciate that sense of wellbeingIt has its usesMost people when they experience happiness get complacent which is one of the reasons why the quest for happiness is often branded as selfishPeople enjoying power or beauty or wealth tend to get complacent and as a result of their complacency start doing very unskillful thingsBut if you approach happiness from the attitude of someone whos practicing as the Buddha taught there is a use for happinessIts a quality in the mind that if properly used can bring about peace of mindAfter all the concentration were looking for in our practice has to have some basis in wellbeingOtherwise the mind wouldnt be able to stay hereSo if you learn how to use that sense of wellbeing properly without complacency it has no drawbacksThe Buddha when he was practicing austerities all those years and years in the wilderness prior to his Awakening had a very unhealthy attitude toward happinessHe was afraid of itHe was afraid of pleasure afraid that it would lead to all kinds of detrimental things in the mindOnly by reflecting carefully on the sense of pleasure in jhana and realizing that there was nothing to fear that there were no drawbacks in that type of pleasure was he able to give himself wholeheartedly to the practice of jhanaIts good to remember that whatever issues we have in the practice the Buddha went through them allIts not that theres something especially wrong with usThese are natural human tendenciesThe Buddha was a human being and had to overcome natural human tendencies tooSo were in good companyWeve got his example to show that they can be overcome and his assurance that we as human beings have what it takes to do itFinally theres the attitude of equanimity which is useful in many waysWhen were working here in the meditation and the results arent coming as fast as wed like equanimity teaches patienceIt reminds us that the principle of action often requires that things take timeIf youre working on something that takes time try to develop equanimityThat makes it easier to be patientRealize that things dont necessarily have to go the way you want them to right awayWhen youre willing to admit what the situation actually is then you can actually act more effectively with itAgain this is a matter of being patient taking the time to understand whats going onSo when we work at these sublime attitudes and bring them to the meditation we find that they create a sense of patience a sense of wellbeing an ability to work at a task that takes timeSometimes the practice seems to require that we do mindless things over and over again Just bring the mind back to the breath bring the mind back to the breathWhyDont ask questions right now just bring the mind back to the breathBut be observant while you do it because as you catch the mind going off you can learn some very interesting thingsYou come to a point where you can see the mind beginning to move and you have the choice to go with it or notOnce you catch yourself at that point then its a lot easier to stay with the breathYouve learned an important lesson about how to read the movements of your mindThe same principle applies to how you bring the mind back when you realize its wandered offDo you bring it back in a judgmental way or in a more judicious wayIf you find that your attitude is judgmental can you find other ways of simply bringing it back without all the extra baggageJust very matteroffactly bring it back and leave it at thatJust this simple process in and of itself teaches you a lot of lessons about the difference between being judgmental and being judiciousIn other words you try to understand you try to look for patterns so that the way you order the mind around or try to create some sense of control in here is actually effectiveThe reason control freaks have a bad reputation is because theyre ineffectiveTheyre judgmental theyre not judicious in how they control thingsActually control isnt a bad thingBut  as with being judicious  it has to be done skillfullyAnd that takes time requires powers of observationWatch what youre doing watch the resultsIf things dont work admit the fact and try something elseWhen you do this you find it easier and easier to tell the difference being judgmental and being judiciousAt the same time you start getting better results from your meditation because youve taken the time to watch to observe to understand whats going onOne of the main problems in modern life is that people have so little timeWhen they meditate they want to cram as much of their meditation as possible into their little bits and pieces of spare timeOf course that aggravates the whole problem of being judgmentalSo keep reminding yourself that meditation is a longterm projectWhen you have a sense of that long arc of time its a lot easier to sit back and work very carefully at the basic stepsIts like learning any skillIf in one afternoon you want to gain all the skills youre going to need to play tennis you end up doing them all very sloppily and wont get the results you wantBut if you realize that this may take time you can work on one skill at a time How do you keep your eye on the ballHow long is your backswingTake the skill apart step by step by step and be willing to work on small things like this bit by bit by bit so that you really understand them deep down in your bonesThat way when the time comes to make choices theyll be judicious choices not judgmental choices and youll get the results you wantTheres a character in Through the Looking Glass who says that he likes to think about two or three impossible things every morning before breakfastIt helps air out his mindThats a good strategy for us as meditators  think about a couple of impossible things every day that youre going to master the concentration youre going to taste the DeathlessOf course these things strictly speaking are not impossible but a lot of voices in our minds seem to insist that they areSo its good to think about impossibilities every now and again to change the tone of the conversationRemind yourself that your life isnt already written in stone that youre not a slave to fate or a little nameless cog in the big machineYoure actually a doer a mover a shaperYou can shape your life in the direction you want it to goThe Buddha said that there are four types of action in the world things we like to do that give good results things we dont like to do that give bad results things we like to do that give bad results and things we dont like to do that give good resultsThe first two are nobrainersWithout even thinking you do the things that you like to do and give good resultsTheres no conflict in the mindThe same holds true for things you dont like to do that give bad resultsYou dont want to do themTheres no discussionThe committee is unanimousThe difficult actions are the ones you like to do but give bad results and the ones you dont like to do but give good resultsThe Buddha had an interesting comment on these twoHe said theyre a measure of a persons wisdom and discernmentHe didnt say theyre a measure of your willpowerYou need to use discernment to do the things you dont like to do but give good results and to not do the things you like to do but give bad resultsThe discernment lies not only in seeing the connection between cause and effect in each case but also in outmaneuvering the committee members who just want to do what they want to do regardlessIt learns to see through the blockades that the mind puts up for itself the difficulties it creates for itself and figures out how to get past themOne of the biggest difficulties we create for ourselves is our selfimageWe notice that its difficult to do things that are good for us and easy to do things that are not good for us and we come to think that our nature is to be lazy or that the lazy side of the mind is our true self because the other side obviously takes effortThe lazy side of the mind is the one that just goes with the flow so that must be who we truly areThats what we think but that kind of thinking is really selfdestructiveWe may remember the times when weve done the right thing  when weve meditated followed the precepts lived in line with the Dhamma  but all we can think about is how much effort it tookSo we say That must not truly be meThat must be somebody elseI must be the person who does things that are easy I must be lazy I must have very poor willpower That kind of attitude is a huge misunderstandingThe things that are difficult are hard for everybodyRather than creating a selfimage about it though wise people just think How can I maneuver around this lazinessHow can I maneuver around this negative attitude They experiment and try different approaches until they find what worksThis is what you have to try to do in your meditationIf you find yourself up against that kind of obstacle learn to take your selfimage apartRealize that your self is not a given the image itself is not a givenIts a pattern its a habit this kind of selfimaging you haveIf it gets in the way of what you really want then no matter how much it screams that this is your true self you have to question itYou have to take it apartDont believe itNo matter how much the mind may say it doesnt want to struggle thats just one part of the mindTheres another part that does want to attempt the struggle does want to have the strength does want to see things throughThe lazy side has sabotaged that by saying Thats not really me Well who is this lazy sideWhy would you want to identify with itYou have the choiceTry to find the holes in its arguments learn how to take things apartYou have to learn to deconstruct the negative habits in the mindThe first step is to question their truth their validityAfter all the Buddha said that the mind can be trained and that happiness comes from the trainingIf people couldnt change thered be no point in teaching the DhammaThered be no point in trying to practiceThe truth of the matter though is that we all have the potential for changeEach moment is a new moment a moment with an element of freedomThen theres the part of the mind that says Okay you can choose to do the right thing right now but its not going to last very long You have to question that tooThe best way to question it is to choose to do the right thing for at least the next moment and the next moment and the next moment and then say SeeI can do it The negative side will come up with all kinds of other arguments but you have to be determined not to listen to them not to believe themTry to figure out ways to undercut the part of the mind that does believe themIts kind of like internal politicsThere are certain voices that come screaming at you all the time and youve learned to give in to them sometimes simply because of their forceIf you stop and really look at them though you see that theres not much there that youd really like to give in toSo you have to create other voices in the mindThe path is something you create after allIts something you put togetherIn technical terms its sankhata dhamma something you put togetherThe question is not whether you naturally like it or notThats one of the main common misunderstandings in American Buddhism right now this sense that you can choose whichever path you like and it wont matter because all the paths come out the same in the endWell there are paths that work and there are paths that dontA path you happen to like isnt necessarily going to take you where you really want to goSo there has to be an element of struggleThere has to be an element of putting something new together of not falling back into old waysWhen you stop to think of it when you fall into old ways theres an element of construction youre creating that old sense of self over and over every time you give in to itIs that the kind of self you want to createYou have the option to create something elseFor many of us we dont like the responsibility because if were responsible that means were going to be responsible for our mistakesSo you have to ask Well so what Everybody makes mistakesEven the Buddha made mistakes before he became the BuddhaThis is where were all coming fromThis is why sanghanussati recollection of the Sangha is such a useful contemplationSometimes its hard to compare yourself to the Buddha but you can compare yourself to members of the noble SanghaPeople who followed the Buddhas teachings were of all kindsThere were lepers poor people rich people all kinds of peopleOne famous pair was Mahapandaka and CulapandakaThey were brothersMahapandaka was the older brother Culapandaka the younger brotherMahapandaka was very smart Culapandaka was very dumb yet both of them became arahantsThere are all kinds of people in the noble SanghaEveryone in the noble Sangha has been where you are now in terms of the strengths and weaknesses of their mindsWhat made the difference is that they finally decided that they were going to use those strengths to overcome those weaknessesAnd the first step was simply thinking that it could be doneIf they could do it so can youIt may seem impossible but you can get used to thinking impossible thingsAfter all the Buddha was told that it was impossible the idea that there could be a Deathless that there could be something better than what he already hadThere he was wealthy educated good looking powerfulHe had all the sensual objects and pleasures that anyone could imagine and he still wasnt satisfiedHis family and friends said Dont kid yourselfThe Deathless isnt possibleThis is as good as it getsHe said Well if this is as good as it gets then life is pretty miserable because its all going to fall apart someday So he set out to find the impossible  and he found itWe may not feel up to comparing ourselves to the Buddha but there are lots of noble disciples who must have felt at some point that true happiness must be an impossibility that for them to change must be an impossible thingBut then one day they decided to do the impossibleThats how they ended up being members of the noble SanghaThe point being of course that what we think is impossible is not necessarily impossibleWeve just allowed ourselves to be limitedWhen I first ordained I found that the scariest part of being ordained was that so much more was demanded of meWhen you live in normal society peoples expectations peoples standards are not all that highIts not all that difficult to live up to themBut suddenly when theres the possibility of working for the Deathless it seems overwhelmingTheres part of the mind that wants to run back to the shelter of what seems easier to handleBut of course whats easier to handle also brings on more sufferingAs the Buddha said Lay life is hardLife as a renunciate is hard But at least life as a renunciate takes you someplace really worth going toWhen you finally make up your mind that youre really going to train yourself it makes that goal less of an impossibilitySo try to overcome that barrier in your mind that deep down someplace says I cant do this Question itWhy would you want to believe thatWho in your mind is saying thatIts the part of the mind that doesnt want to make an effortDo you want to identify with that part of the mindYou can if you want to but you dont have toYou have the opportunity of identifying with better voices in the mindIts your choiceNo matter how impossible it may seem it is your choiceEvery time you sit down to work with the breath remember the story of the foolish inexperienced cowThe cow is in a nice meadow on the hillside has plenty of green grass and water but sees another meadow over on another hillside and starts wondering Whats the grass like over thereWhats the water like over there And so because shes a foolish inexperienced cow she sets outShe doesnt know how to go down the hillside cross over the ravine and go up the other hillside so she gets lost in betweenShe doesnt get to the other hillside and cant get back to where she originally wasThis stands for the mind that once it gets into a state of concentration wonders where to go next to get something betterThe trick is to learn how to stay in your meadow so the grass has a chance to grow so you have a chance to enjoy the water right where you already areAnd the place where you are will develop into deeper and deeper states of concentrationThis is why its so important that before you start working with the breath here or there adjusting it here or there you find at least some spot where its comfortable and focus on thatTo make another comparison its like starting a fire on a windy dayYou have your tiny little flame so you cup it in your hands and make sure that it doesnt get blown outAt the same time you dont cut off the oxygenYou cup it in your hands just right keeping that one little flame going and after a while it will catchThen it will spread throughout all the timber youve piled upBut its important that you get that first little flame goingThe same with the breath Find at least one little spot and stay right there for a whileIt doesnt have to be a big spot just a small spotAnd content yourself with that small spot for the time beingAllow it to be comfortableAfter a while it will catchThen you can start spreading that sense of comfort throughout the body because youre working from a position of strengthYoure working from a position of comfort not a position of desperation or anxiety or restlessness thinking that this has to be like that or that has to be like thisJust content yourself with what youve got and allow it to growContent yourself at first with the small things and ultimately with practice theyll grow into a greater and greater sense of wellbeingRemember that the word jhana comes from the verb jhayati or burningThis verb isnt used to describe just any kind of burning its used to describe the burning of an oil lampWhen an oil lamp burns the flame is steadyIt may not be a big flame but its steadiness is what helps it illuminate the roomYou can read by itIf it were a flickering flame you couldnt read by it no matter how bright it was for the shadows would be jumping all over the placeBut the steadiness of the oillamp flame is what enables you to read even in an otherwise dark roomIts the same with the state of your concentrationYou stay steadily with one spotThe steadiness the consistency of your gaze is what allows this one spot to become really comfortableIn the beginning it may not be all that comfortable just an okay spot someplace in the bodyThe breath feels okay coming in feels okay coming outNo big deal nothing specialBut you find if you allow yourself to settle into it that it solves a basic problem in the mind the underlying tension where its ready to jump at a moments notice like a cat settled in one spot but coiled up ready to springIf you could take a picture of the mind thats what it would look like a cat coiled ready to springWhen it lands on an object part of it is ready to spring away from that object as soon as it doesnt like the object as soon as the object turns into something unpleasant because thats the way its been dealing with objects all alongBut here you allow it to settle into one little spot and let that sense of tension in the mind melt awayYou melt into the object of your concentration and then let that melting sensation spread into the body all the way down to your fingers and toesThis way the meditation goes a lot better than if youre constantly fighting and figuring things out too muchYouve got to learn how to apply just the right amount of pressure just the right amount of pushing not too much not too littleThe more sensitive you are in your meditation the better it goesSo youve got a meadow someplace in your bodyIt may not be a big one but its thereYou dont sit around worrying about where the next meadows going to be or what other meadows you have around youJust stay right where you are and the grass will growThe water will flowAnd you find that the place where you are starts to developThats the kind of concentration you can really live withIn other words its the kind of concentration you can pick up and take with you wherever you go not where you prefashion things too much and preconceive things too much and have to do this and have to do that and adjust this and adjust that and it all becomes very theoreticalJust an inner sense of allowing it to feel just right right here to feel good right here and wherever you go youre still with right here You can identify where that good feeling is and carry it with you wherever you goThats the kind of concentration that growsIts the kind of concentration that seeps into your life and begins to make a difference in how you think how you act and how you speak because its there all the timeIt doesnt require too much fashioningIt may require a little bit of looking after but not based on what youve read in booksIts just a sense of wellbeing right hereYouve got your little spot and you take it with youAjaan Fuang once said that mindfulness and concentration are little tiny things but youve got to keep at them all the timeThe statement sounded better in Thai because it was a punTheres the word nit which means little but theres also the word nit  spelled differently but pronounced the same way  which means constantlySo concentration is a little tiny thing that you do constantlyWhen it comes from this beginning sense of wellbeing its a lot more stableYou can maintain it a lot longerThe sense of wellbeing begins to glow throughout the body and the mind when you allow it to happen when you allow the grass to grow and the water to flowOr in terms of the image of the flame when you give it enough space and protection to allow it to catch holdIn one of Ajaan Lees talks he says that big things have to start from little thingsSometimes you have to content yourself with just a little bit of concentration a little comfortable spot but you stick with it constantlyYou plant one banana tree and after a while it will grow and provide you with the seeds to plant more banana treesSo you take the seeds out of the banana  in Thailand they have bananas with seeds  you plant them and after a while youve got a whole banana orchardOr even better mangoes Youve got one tree that you take really good care ofYou dont yet worry about planting the rest of your landYouve got your one tree and after a while it gives mangoes and bit by bit you can plant a whole orchard with the seeds you got from the fruit of the one treeAt the same time you get to eat the flesh of the mangoesYou can enjoy yourselfAfter all this is a part of the path the part where the Buddha explicitly mentions rapture pleasure and ease as factors of the pathIf you dont have that sense of wellbeing the practice gets very dryAs youre planting the mangoes and eating their flesh you find that the path becomes a really nice place to be a good path to follow  not only because you know its going to take you to a good place but also because its a good path to be on while youre thereYoure not going through the desertYoure going through orchards and lush countrysideIf you learn to recognize which plants are food and which ones are medicine for which disease theres plenty to keep you healthy and energized all along the wayWere an impatient societyEverything has to be done fast the results have to come fast or else we lose interest quicklyIts because were so impatient that we dont understand what patience is all aboutWhen were told to be patient many times we think its a sign that we shouldnt care about the results that we dont have to be so committed to the practice that we can let things take their course whenever they want toWe think that patience means a lack of resolution a lack of dedication that youre a carefree and indifferent about when things are going to come together when the results are going to showThats not what patience meansPatience means sticking with the causes of your practice no matter how long it takes to get the resultsIn other words youre resolute in doing the practice you stick with it you stay with it slow and steadyKhanti the Pali word we often translate as patience also means enduranceIt means that you stick with things even when they take a long time to show resultsYou dont get frustratedYou remind yourself This a path that takes timeAfter all were unlearning a lot of habits that weve been indulging for who knows how longSo it only stands to reason that its going to take time to unlearn those habitsThe only way to unlearn them is to actually stick with the practice to be resolute in what youre doingThis firm resolution is whats going to make the differenceAjaan Thate talks about being patient like farmersThose of you whove never lived on a farm even you know that farmers dont have an easy lifeThey work hard especially in Thailand where they dont have a lot of laborsaving devicesWhen the time comes to do what needs to be done they have to do it quicklyIn other words when the rice grains are ready you have to harvest them quickly before the mice get to themYou have to take care of them quickly winnow the rice quickly before any late season rain comes to spoil itSo its not a matter of being slow or casual this patience of a farmerThe patience of a farmer is the sort that knows you cant plant the rice today and expect to have the grains ripened tomorrowIts going to take time and during that time its going to require workFortunately for farmers they have experienceThey know from previous years how long it takesWe however dont have that kind of experienceWere working on something new developing new habits in the mindSometimes we read the passages in the Satipatthana Sutta about how you can gain Awakening in seven days if youre really dedicated and we come away with unrealistic ideas about how quickly we should see results in order to deem our practice successfulThis is not to say that its not possible but just that most of the people who could get results in seven days have already gotten results and gone to nibbanaThat leaves the rest of us here muddling along  which doesnt mean we should be any less dedicated in our practiceWe should just realize that its going to take timeGood things always take timeThe trees with the most solid heartwood are the ones that take the longest to growSo we do the practice focusing on what were doing rather than getting into an internal dialogue about when the results are going to come what theyre going to be like and how we can speed up the practiceMany times our efforts to speed things up actually get in the wayOur practice is pretty simpleStay with the breath allow the mind to settle in with the breath be friends with the breathAllow the breath to open up and get more and more gentle more and more porous so your awareness can seep into the breathThats all you have to doOf course we want to add things on top of that to make the results come faster but the things we add on top get in the waySo try to keep things simpleJust stay with the breathIf the mind is going to get into any dialogue engage in a dialogue about how the breath feels right now reminding yourself to stay with breath catching the mind when its going to slip offTheres a lot of work to do even when you try to keep it simple just keeping the mind with the breathAs for whether the results are coming as quickly as youd like or when they come whether theyre going to stay as long as youd like Thats going to depend on what youre doing right here with the breathOur desire to have the results come our desire to have them stay is not going to keep them hereThe actual doing of the practice is what will make the differenceTheres a passage in the texts where the Buddha talks about a hen incubating her eggsWhether or not the hen has a desire for the eggs to hatch theyre going to developWhether or not she has a little dialogue about how quickly she wants them to come and why arent they coming any faster than this all those little questions that she probably doesnt have the brain to ask Our problem is that we do have brains that ask those questions and they get in the wayIf youre going to ask questions ask questions about what youre doing right nowIs that you wandering offWhere are you goingAre you looking for troubleOr are you staying right here Thats all you have to askJust be really consistent and resolute in sticking with what you know you have to doIf you find yourself flagging learn how to give yourself pep talks encouraging yourself along the wayDo what you can to keep the mind right here as consistently and steadily as possibleConsistency is what builds up momentumAlthough wed like momentum to build up fast sometimes our minds are pretty massive and the massive minds are the ones that take time to accelerateSo try to streamline things as much as you canStay focusedStay resolute in what youre doingAs for the results thats what youre patient aboutDont allow yourself to be patient or tolerant about vagrant thoughts that will pull you away from the breathPatience relates to the process of causality in the sense that you cant push the results to appear unless the causes are rightSometimes the causes take a while to come togetherBut you can rest assured that when they do theyll bring the results without your having to concoct a lot of preconceived notions about themWhen they do come dont abandon the causesWhen the mind finally does get a sense that its settling in feeling comfortable dont leave the breath to focus on the comfortThe comforts there you can think of it spreading through the body but spread it through the body by means of the breathIf you abandon the breath its like letting the foundation of a house rot awayYou like the house its a comfortable place but if you dont look after the foundation youll soon have no place to staySo the focus should always be on the causes and you should apply yourself to the causes with as much commitment and resolution as you can musterLet go of your thoughts about how long youve been practicing what the results used to be in the pastFocus on what youre doing totally on what youre doing right nowWhen we train the mind its not just a question of using a meditation technique to bludgeon the mind into the present momentIf thats our approach the mind is going to start rebelling finding ways of slipping around our defenses because there are times when the meditation technique is right for the situation and times when it isntThe times when it isnt Thats when the mind is going to rebel if you singlemindedly use just that one technique and dont have other techniques or approaches up your sleeve as wellMeditation is not just a question of techniqueIn training the mind you have to remember theres a whole committee in thereIn the past the committee has had its balance of power its likes and dislikes and the politics among the various voices in your mindEach of them has different tricks for pushing its agenda on the restSo just as these defilements have lots of tricks up their sleeves you as a meditator need to have lots of tricks up your sleeve tooOne really basic trick is for when the mind says Ive got to do thisI want to do thatI dont want to meditate Youve got to ask Well why And play kind of dumb so that the mind really has to explain itselfIts like lesson number one in any journalism class If you really want to get a good interview out of people you have to play dumb ask stupid questions so that they think they have to explain things to you very carefullyAnd oftentimes they reveal all kinds of things they wouldnt have otherwiseIts the same with your own mindWhen greed anger and delusion come into the mind they usually barge in with a lot of force and expect to push you right overSo one thing you have to do is to ask Well whyWhy should we follow thatWhy should we want instant gratification And there will be an of courseness to their answer the first time aroundOf course you want it this wayOf course you want it that way Well why If youre persistent in being blockheaded like this all the defilements will start revealing themselvesYoull see how shabby they areYoull be able to get around them more easilyIts like training a little childSometimes you have to be strict with the child other times you have to offer rewards patiently explain thingsOther times you have to make up little gamesIn other words you have to use your full psychology with the mindBut this time around youre not using it for the purpose of deception which is what the mind ordinarily does with itselfYoure using it for the purpose of truth and honesty for whats really in your own best interestWhat does the wandering mind do for youIt gives a little bit of instant gratification and then that gratification goes with nothing left to show for itselfIf you keep allowing this to happen where are you going to pick up the skills youll really need when aging illness and death hit with full forceThis is why the Buddha stressed the principle of heedfulness all the timeWe cant just spend our time sniffing the flowers and looking at the skyTheres work to be doneWhen the mind is untrained it causes us a lot of unhappinessIf the mind is well trained if its more tractable it can bring a lot of happiness our wayIn order for that to happen you have to learn how to psyche yourself into the mood to meditateOnce it starts meditating and begins to see the results it gets more willing and tractable  most of the timeThen there are times it starts rebelling all over again totally irrationallySo youve got to sit down with it again work things through with it again to see exactly what issue got covered up the last time around and is only now getting exposedThis is one of the ways in which you learn a lot about your defilementsIts not that you have to wait for a totally solid concentration before you can see the defilements clearlyA lot of learning about the defilements lies in learning how to struggle with them as you bring the mind to stillnessYou begin to see Oh this is how greed works this is how aversion works this is how Ive fallen for this stuff before in the pastWell this time around Im not going to fallSometimes its like a battleOther times its more a question of learning how to work together in a way thats for your own best interests how to be a mediator a negotiator or a patient teacherYouve got to have lots of ways of relating to the different elements in your mindThe times when you can win the defilements over to your side Thats when its bestYour desire turns into a desire to practiceYour hatred turns into a hatred of the defilementsYou learn how to use the energy of these things for your own true benefitThats when you can be said to be a discerning meditatorYou cant gain insight simply by following the rulesSomebody says For insight you need to do one two three four five six and sevenSo you do one two three four five six seven without any thinking without any reflection on what youre doing and yet that doesnt give you any true insightsIt gives you preprogrammed insights sometimes but the actual startling new understandings that can come through the meditation dont happen because youre too busy following the directionsThe directions are there for you to apply to the mind and then to observe to look at what happens to reflect on what happens to make adjustmentsMake the meditation your own and not just somebody elses bulldozer running through your headAfter all the big issue is how you relate to yourself how you relate to the body how you relate to feelings perceptions thoughtfabrications and consciousnessThats the area where youre causing yourself suffering so thats the area where youve got to gain sensitivity and insightNobody else can get into your head and straighten these things out for youYou use the techniques of meditation to see what they reveal about the mindThen you build on those lessons so that the meditation becomes your ownIn Thai they have a word for practice  patibat  which also means looking after someone to attend to someones needsIn the practice of the Dhamma youre looking after your own mind attending to your own minds needsIts not so much that youre learning about BuddhismYoure learning about your own mind looking after your own mindThats when the meditation really starts showing its valueIt rearranges all the power balances in the mind so that truth begins to take over wisdom begins to take over discernment begins to take chargeThese become the big powers in your mind the ones in charge of any discussionWhen thats the kind of mind you have its a really good mind to live inWe live in physical places only for a certain amount of time but in our own minds all the timeTry to make the mind a good place to live so that no matter what else happens outside at least the mind is on proper terms with itself not fighting itself not doing stupid things that arent in its own best interestGet so that it really does know how to deal with the aggregates as they arise how to deal with pain so it doesnt turn it into suffering how to deal with pleasure so it doesnt turn it into sufferingGet so that the mind develops a basic intelligence in sorting itself out managing itself so that all your mental powers suddenly become powers you can truly put to good useAs we were saying today there are times when for your own good you dont want to be focused on the breathThere are things you have to think about things youve got to plan for things you have to ponder where you take all the powers of the mind youve trained in concentration and put them to other usesThat way the benefits of the concentration permeate your whole life everything you doSo its an allaround training not just learning to relate to the breath but learning how to relate to everything else going on in the mind as well so that skillful thoughts take over and unskillful thoughts get left behindThats when you can say that the meditation is a wholemind processThats when it gives results penetrating throughout your whole lifeThe committee members learn how to live togetherThe unskillful ones get outvotedThe ones who should be in charge the skillful qualities take over and run the show in such a way that nobody suffersThe Buddha teaches that there are two sides to the path of practice the side of developing and the side of letting goAnd its important that you see the practice in both perspectives that your practice contains both sidesIf you practice just letting go youll throw away the baby with the bath waterEverything good will get thrown out because you let go of everything and leave nothing leftOn the other hand if yours is just a practice of developing and working and doing you miss the things that happen on their own that happen when you do let goSo an important part of the practice is realizing which is whichThis is what discernment is all about realizing which qualities in the mind are skillful the ones that are your friends and which qualities are unskillful the ones that are your enemiesThe ones that are your friends are those that help make your knowledge clearer make you see things more clearly  things like mindfulness concentration and discernment together with the qualities they depend on virtue morality persistenceThese are the good guys in the mindThese are the ones you have to nurture the ones you have to work atIf you dont work at them they wont come on their ownSome people think that practice is simply a matter of letting the mind go with its own flow but the flow of the mind tends to flow down just as water flows downhill which is why the mind needs to be trainedIn training the mind were not creating the unconditioned or unfabricated in the mindIts more like polishing woodThe grain is already there in the wood but unless you polish it it doesnt shimmer it doesnt shineIf you want to see the beauty of the grain you have to polish it to work at itYou dont create the grain but the polishing is what brings out the grain already thereIf you dont polish it it doesnt have the same shimmer it doesnt have the same beauty as it does when its polishedSo practicing the Buddhas path is like polishing away at the mind to see whats of real value there within the mindThats what the mindfulness the persistence the ardency and all the other terms the Buddha uses that suggest effort and exertion Thats what theyre forThis is why we have rules in the practice rules in terms of the precepts rules for the monks to followThey provide work for the mind and its good workTheyre not just makework rulesWhen you hold by the rules when you hold by the precepts the result is that you learn an awful lot about the mind at the same time youre making life a lot easier for yourself and the people around youIn the beginning it may seem harder to have the rules to follow but once you start living by them they open up all kinds of possibilities that werent there before when everything was confined by the riverbanks of your old habits going along with the flowThis is why there has to be effortThis is why there has to be work in the practiceAs the Buddha said right effort has four sidesAbandoning is only one of the fourTheres also preventing  preventing unskillful things from arisingWhen unskillful things have arisen those are the things you abandonThen theres the effort to give rise to skillful qualities and the effort to maintain them once they are thereYou develop these skillful qualities and then you keep them going so that they develop to higher and higher levelsSo sometimes when youre reflecting on your practice its useful to focus on exactly what youre developing here  the good qualities like mindfulness and alertnessAt other times its helpful to focus on the things you have to let go of the things you have to work at preventingYou see right effort very easily when doing concentration practice because you have to focus on where you want the mind to be to be aware of where you dont want it to be and also to be ready to fight off anything thats going to come in to disturb your stillness of mindWhen youre focusing on your meditation topic you pick it up and say that this is what youre going to focus on for the next hourBy doing this youre giving rise to skillful qualitiesAnd then you try to keep your focus thereYouve got to keep reminding yourself that this is what youre doing hereYoure not just sitting youre sitting here to develop the mindSo you keep your mind on the topic youve chosen like the breath and then you work at bringing the mind back whenever it slips off bringing it here keeping it here at the same time being aware that any moment it can slip off againThis second level of awareness is what keeps you from drifting off obliviously and then coming back to the surface five minutes later suddenly realizing that you were off whoknowswhere in the mean timeIf youre prepared for the fact that the mind can leave at any point then you can watch for itIn other words youre watching both the breath and the mind looking for the first sign that its going to leap off onto something elseThis is a heightened level of awareness that allows you to see the subtle stirrings in the mindThe mind is often like an inchworm standing at the edge of a leafEven though the inchworms back feet may still be on this leaf its front feet are up in the air swaying around searching around for another leaf to land onAs soon as that other leaf comes boomph its offAnd so it is with the mindIf youre not aware of the fact that its getting ready to leave the breath it comes as a real surprise when you realize that youve slipped off someplace elseBut when you have a sense of when the mind is beginning to get a little bit antsy and ready to move you can do something about itIn other words you cant be complacent in the practiceEven if the mind seems to be staying with the breath sometimes its ready to move on and youve got to have that second level of awareness going as well so that you can be aware both of the breath and of the mind together  so that you have a sense of when the mind is snug with its object and when its beginning to get a little bit looseIf you see it loosening its grip do what you can to make it more snugIs the breath uncomfortableCould it be more comfortableCould it be finerCould it be longer shorter whateverExplore itThe mind is telling you on its own that it isnt happy there anymoreIt wants to moveSo look at the quality of the breath and then turn around and look at the quality of the mind  this sense of boredom this wanting to moveWhats actually causing itSometimes it comes from the breath and sometimes its just a trait that arises in the mind a trait that stirs up troubleTry to be sensitive to whats going on to see whether the problem is coming from the mind or the object the mind is focused onIf its coming from a simple sense of boredom thats moved in let the boredom move onYou dont have to latch onto itYou dont have to identify with it saying that its your boredomAs soon as you identify with the boredom the mind has left the breath and is on the boredomEven though the breath may be there in the background the boredom has come into the forefrontYour inchworm has moved off to the other leafSo if the mind is getting antsy and saying Well moveFind something new refuse for a while and see what happensWhat is the strength lying behind that need to moveWhats giving it powerSometimes youll find that its actually a physical sensation someplace in the body that youve overlooked so work on thatOther times its more an attitude the attitude that you picked up someplace that said Just sitting here not thinking about anything is the most stupid thing you can doYou arent learning anything you arent picking up anything newYour mind isnt being exercised Ask yourself Where is that voice coming from Its coming from somebody who never meditated who didnt understand all the good things that come from being still in the present momentOnly when the mind is really still right here can it begin to resonate with the bodyWhen theres a resonance between the breath and the mind it gives rise to a much greater sense of wholeness and onenessThis is the positive aspect of the practice that you want to focus on because if the mind is one place and the body someplace else theres no resonanceIts as if they were singing two completely different tunesBut if you get them together its like having one chord with lots of overtonesAnd then you come to appreciate how when theres this sense of resonance between the body and mind you begin to open upYou begin to see things in the mind and in the body that you didnt see beforeIts healing for both the body and the mindIts also eyeopening in the sense that the more subtle things that were there suddenly appearYou gain a sense of appreciation for this that this is a very important thing to do with the mindThe mind needs this for its own sanity for its own healthSo when the mind starts getting antsy and wants to move around and think about things and analyze things and it starts telling you that youre stupid to sit here and not think remind it that not everything has to be thought through not everything has to be analyzedSome things have to be experienced directlyWhen you analyze things where does the analysis come fromIt comes mostly from your old ignorant ways of thinkingAnd what were doing as we get the mind to settle down is to put those ways of thinking and those ways of dividing up reality asideFor a state of concentration you want to get the mind together with the body and to foster a sense of oneness a sense of resonance between the twoOnce theyve had chance to be together then you can begin to see how things begin to separate out on their ownAnd this is a totally different way of separatingIts not the kind of separating that comes from ordinary thinkingIts actually seeing that even though the body and mind are resonating they are two separate things like two tuning forksYou strike one tuning fork and put another one next to itThe second tuning fork picks up the resonance from the first one but theyre two separate forksOnce the body and mind have had a chance to resonate for a while you begin to see that they are two separate thingsKnowing is different from the object of knowingThe body is the object the mind is the knowingAnd this way when they separate out they dont separate out because you have some preconceived notion of how they should beYou watch it actually happeningIts a natural occurrenceIts like the grain of the wood When you polish it the grain appears but not because you designed the grainIts been there in the wood all alongThe same with your meditation Youre simply giving yourself a chance really to see your experience of body and mind for what it is instead of coming in with preconceived notions about how things should get divided up how things should be analyzedTheres a natural separation line between name and form body and mindThey come together but theyre separate thingsWhen you learn how to allow them to separate out thats when real discernment comes inThis is why the discernment that comes with concentration is a special kind of discernmentIts not your ordinary mode of thinkingIt comes from giving things a chance to settle downLike a chemical mixture If everything gets jostled around the two chemicals are always mixed together and you cant tell that there are two in thereThere seems to be just the one mixtureBut if you let the mixture sit for a while the chemicals will separateThe lighter one will rise to the top the heavier one will settle to the bottomYoull see at a glance that there actually are two separate chemicals thereThey separate themselves out on their own because youve created the conditions that allow them to act on their ownThe same with the mind A lot of things begin to separate out on their own if you simply give the mind a chance to be still enough and youre watchful enoughIf youre not watchful the stillness drifts off into drowsinessSo you need the mindfulness together with the stillness for this to happen properlyWith the stillness youre letting go of a lot of nervous activity youre letting go of a lot of unskillful things in the mindWith the mindfulness youre developing the skillful qualities you need to see clearlyThis is how the lettinggo and the knowing come togetherWhen the Buddha discusses the four noble truths he talks about the duty appropriate to eachYour duty with regard to craving the second noble truth is to let it goThen theres a third noble truth which is the cessation of sufferingAnd what is thatIts the lettinggo of the craving at the same time youre aware of whats happeningSo the task appropriate to the cessation of suffering is a double process knowing together with the lettinggo and this makes all the difference in the worldMost of the time when we let go of craving were not aware of whats happening so its nothing specialIts just the ordinary way of life as we move from one craving to anotherBut when the mind has been still enough and the mindfulness welldeveloped enough then when the craving gets abandoned youre aware of it as well and this opens up something new in the mindThis is why the factors of the noble eightfold path fall into two types the ones that develop and the ones that let goThe ones that let go abandon all the minds unskillful activities that obscure knowledgeThe developing ones are the ones that enable you to see clearly right view right mindfulness right concentrationThey all work at awareness so that you can know clearly whats actually happening in the present momentSo there are these two sides to the practice and you want to make sure that youre engaged in both sides for your practice to be completeIts not just a practice of relaxing and letting go and its not just a practice of staying up all night and meditating ten hours at a stretch really pushing pushing pushing yourselfYou have to find a balance between clear knowing and effort a balance between developing and letting go knowing which is which and how to get that balance just rightThats the skill of the practiceAnd when you have both sides of the practice perfectly balanced they come together and are no longer separateYouve got the mind in a perfectly clear state where the knowing and the lettinggo become almost the same thingBut the balance doesnt occur without practiceYou may ask Why do we keep practicingWhen do we get to perform Well were practicing for the time when ultimately we can master these thingsWhen the practice gets balanced the path performs and thats when things really open up in the mindThe Buddha often compared himself to a doctor healing the diseases of the hearts and minds of his listenersNow we normally think about heart disease as meaning hardening of the arteries and mental disease as insanity but he said the real diseases of the heart the real diseases of the mind are three passion aversion and delusionThey burn like a fever in the heart a fever in the bodyAnd the reason he taught about these diseases is because there is a way to gain release from themIf they were impossible to cure he wouldnt have bothered to teachSo we have to learn to take his teaching as treatment for our own hearts our own mindsThats when were using them properlyTreating these kinds of diseases is in some way similar to treating ordinary mental diseases ordinary bodily diseasesAnd in some ways its differentWith ordinary diseases the doctor can give you medicine you take the medicine and thats itWith the Buddhas treatment though you are the one who administers the cureYou simply learn about the cure from the BuddhaAs he says he simply points out the way but youre the one who actually has to carry through and administer the treatment to yourselfSo youre both the doctor and the patient  youre a student doctorYoure learning the treatmentSometimes the symptoms of the disease dont quite match whats printed in the texts dont quite sound like the things youve heard people say Thats why you need an experienced doctor to help you alongBut also you need your own ingenuity because there are times as in a hospital when the experienced doctor isnt on callSometimes a really drastic case comes in and theres nobody but interns aroundThe interns have to figure out what to do on their ownSo its not simply a matter of following whats in the booksYou also have to learn how to apply the teachings to all kinds of unexpected situations to learn which teachings are the basic principles and which are secondary detailsThe similarity between the two types of diseases  outer diseases and inner diseases  is that in both cases there are two kinds of sources for the disease inner and outerSome bodily diseases you can blame on germsThey come in from the outside and they wreak a lot of havoc in the bodyBut on a more basic level the question is Why do the germs take over  because sometimes you have enough resistance to fight them off and sometimes you dontIn this sense the basic cause comes from inside from your inner lack of resistanceThe same holds true with the mindMany times we blame problems within the mind on things from outside  what other people do what other people say the general atmosphere around us the values we grew up with the things we learned as childrenAnd these do play a role but the most important problem is what comes from the mindWhy is it susceptible to those influencesAfter all you find some people staying in a certain environment and theyre perfectly okay they pick up no negative influences while other people get into the same environment and come out all warpedTwo kids growing up in the same family hear the same lessons from their parents but take away totally different messagesThis is because of what you bring to life when you come what weak points and what strong points are already there in the mindSo you have to focus in on the mind as the main problemYou cant go blaming things outsideIf the mind had really good powers of resistance a really good immune system nothing could stir it to passion nothing could stir it to anger nothing could stir it to delusionFortunately you can train the mind develop that immunityThats the kind of mind you want to developThats the mind that the Buddha defines as healthThis is why the training focuses inside looking at your own mind and seeing where things set it offWhen germs come into the mind where is your resistance strong and where is it weakWhat is your line of resistanceThis is what were developing in the meditation lines of resistanceConcentration virtue generosity these are all our first lines of resistance against the invading germsSitting here with our eyes closed instead of trying to change things outside we change things insideSome people think that the practice is simply a matter of learning how to accept everything just as it isWell some things you do accept and some you dontYou learn to accept the fact that the outside world is going to be the way it isThere are always going to be external problemsAnd the phrase outside world here doesnt refer just to other peopleYour own body is part of the outside world from the point of view of the DhammaAnd the body contains aging illness and deathThats the nature of the bodyYou cant change that but what you can change is the mindThis is where you cant just sit around and be equanimous accepting the mind as it isYouve got to accept that the mind has the potential to changeSo youve really got to stir yourself to look into the mind to see which potentials need to be weakened and which ones need to be enhancedThis is where right effort comes in  when you learn how to distinguish skillful and unskillful states in the mindThe skillful ones are the ones that can keep up your resistance against greed anger and delusionThe unskillful ones are the ones that give in the ones that are susceptible to infectionAnd because delusion is part of the problem the first thing you need to learn how to do is to distinguish which states are skillful and which ones arentThis is why you need instructionsThis is why you need a technique in your meditation  youve got a focal point the breath as a measuring stick for the movements of the mindYou watch the breath as its coming in and going out and you notice when you get pulled away from it Thats a good measure of when the mind is being influenced by somethingIf you dont have this kind of focus its hard to tell when anger comes and when it goesTheres nothing to measure it againstLike the clouds in the sky You cant tell how fast theyre moving unless youve got something still and solid on the ground to use as your reference point  a tree a telephone poleIf you focus on that one point then you can see whether the clouds are moving north or south and how fast theyre going in relation to that pointIts the same with the mind once it has a focal point like the breath As soon as your attention gets pulled away from the breath you know something has happenedThen you check to see what it isIn the beginning you simply notice what it is and  realizing that if you follow that youre drifting away from where you want to be  you bring the mind backThis is on the basic level of just getting the mind to learn how to be still for a while how to stick with your original intention to stay centered and how to settle downBut as your powers of concentration your powers of mindfulness get stronger and stronger you find you can actually investigate whats pulling you away  or what would have pulled you away if you hadnt caught yourself in timeThis is when your powers of resistance are getting stronger when you begin to see exactly how you get hooked to that pullIts as if your mind is covered with Velcro hooks and you investigate to see what comes along and ends up stuck in themActually those little Velcro hooks are choicesTheyre not necessaryYou dont have to get stuck on thingsThere is actually a place in the mind where youre making a choice to latch onOnly when things get really still in the mind and your awareness is really clear can you see that choice as an act  that you made the choice to lower your resistance and latch onto the germs when you didnt have toThats where you can let goOne you see the drawbacks of the diseases caused by the germs and two you realize that you dont really have to come down with those diseasesTheyre not really necessaryWhen you can identify the particular disease patterns they will never be necessaryThey seem necessary only when you cant conceive of anything elseThings have to be that way or so the mind tells itselfIf the mind had to be that way there would be no purpose in meditating there would be no purpose in the Buddhas teachingHe could have sat around under the Bodhi tree for the rest of his life and just enjoyed the bliss of AwakeningHe realized though that teaching would serve a purposeSo thats what were doing  were carrying out that purpose putting his teachings into practice so we can gain the results that he wanted to see from the effort he put into his teachingAll this comes under right effort realizing when you have skillful states realizing when you have unskillful states and being determined that once an unskillful state has arisen youre not going to feed it youre not going to follow along with itSome people have problems with this especially with the issue of struggling or effort or having a goalThe problem though doesnt lie with effort or goals in and of themselvesIt lies with your attitude toward themYou need to have a healthy attitude toward this struggleYou need to have a healthy attitude toward the effort toward the goal because the goal is what gives you a direction in lifeWithout goals life would just be floundering around like fish flopping around in a puddleSo you need to have a directionYou realize that maybe this is a bigger task than other tasks you have taken on so you dont berate yourself for not getting to the goal immediately or not catching on right awayYou learn through experience what your pace is and you stick to itSometimes you push yourself a little too hard in order to know what it means to push yourself too hard and then you let offAnd you find that you tend to vacillate back and forth between pushing too hard and not pushing enough but as long as youre sensitive to this fact you begin to get a better and better sense of what just right isWhen the Buddha talks about the Middle Way its not necessarily what our preconceived notions of the Middle Way areYou have to test themAnd the effort required is not blind effortRight effort involves using your eyes knowing whats skillful in the mind whats unskillful being determined to let go of anything unskillful that arises in the mind and trying to prevent more unskillful things from arising in the mindAt the same time you try to realize when skillful qualities have appearedYou try to maintain them develop them make them strongSo theres both the lettinggo and the developing and the function of discernment is to tell when which is appropriateYou have to listen very carefully to whats happening in the mind watch things in the mind be observantThis is why a lot of the meditation instructions throw things back on you on your own powers of observation because only by developing those powers can you develop the discernment youre going to needSometimes in the Buddhas teachings its almost as if he purposely leaves a few blanks doesnt explain everything leaves things for you to figure out on your own because if everything were handed to you on a platter where would your discernment get engagedHow would it developYoud be a restaurant critic picky and choosy about whats served to you but totally ignorant about how to fix the food yourselfSo sometimes the Buddha gives the teachings as riddles and your willingness to try to figure them out make mistakes come back and try again is what will make you growThis is the healthy attitude toward right effort realizing that sometimes its going to take a lot of persistence a lot of endurance a lot of tenacityBut not alwaysThere are times when it gets very easy and enjoyable and everything seems to flowSo you learn to adjust your effort so that its just right for whatever the situationThats when right effort is really right when you start getting your own sense of how things vary and how things need to be adjustedThats when the practice becomes more and more your own practice the practice youve made your own not just something that somebody outside is telling you to doAnd this is where you turn from a student doctor into an experienced doctorLuckily with the diseases of the mind its not the case that your patients are all going to dieThis particular patient the mind keeps coming backSo theres room for mistakes  but you cant be too complacentAfter all youre the patientYoure the one who suffers from the mistakesSome of those mistakes can lead you down a path that ends up far away and itll be a long time before you find your way backSo again you need an attitude of balance You dont berate yourself for not attaining the goal but at the same time you dont get complacentMuch of the practice is this one issue figuring out where that balance isOther people can help give you pointers but you yourself really have to listen to your own practice look carefully at the results as they come  because this ability to see cause and effect in the mind is what lies at the essence of discernment and discernment is what makes all the differenceIts the ultimate medicine in the Buddhas medicine box  and yet he cant just hand it to youIts like an herbal medicine that you have to grow yourselfHe describes it and tells you how to find it how to grow it and then how to take itSo get used to this image that youre both the doctor and the patient and learn to have a very strong sense of the doctor looking after the patientDont identify totally with the patient because if you do its hard to see a cure hard to see even the possibility of a cureBut if you have the attitude of the doctor there has to be a notion of what health is and how to recognize illness whenever it shows its faceAt the same time you have to develop the ability to step back and look at the whole situation to figure out the cureHeres another image Ann LandersPeople who write letters to Ann Landers are so thoroughly immersed in their problems that they cant step backThey have trouble even formulating a letterBut all Ann Landers has to do is read the letter once its formulated and usually she can give an answer right off the bat because shes not immersed in the situationFrom her perspective the issue is already formulatedHer job is not all that hardYoull find your own practice gets a lot easier too when you can step back to recognize the problem and articulate it to yourselfOnce the problem is clearly delineated youve got your answerAs in the case of the doctor the real difficulty lies in learning to diagnose the illnessOnce youve got the diagnosis right the choice of medicine is easySo the first step is learning how to be the doctorIdentify at least part of your mind as the doctorThis is the part you want to trainAnd the funny thing is that in training the doctor the patient gets curedThe Dhamma is like medicineYou can see this from the way the Buddha teachesHe starts off with the four noble truths which are very much like an analysis of how to care for a diseaseIn his case hes offering a cure for the basic disease of the mind the suffering that comes from craving and ignoranceThats what weve got to cureSo he analyzes the symptoms of the disease diagnoses it explains its causation discusses what its like to be free of the disease and then shows a path of treatment that leads to the end of the disease to a state of healthIts important that we keep this in mind as we practice here together Were working on the diseases of our own mindsEach of us has illnessesAnd although the basic causes of illness are the same  craving ignorance  our cravings are differentOur particular brands of ignorance are different as wellThis is why we have to make allowances for each other because different people have to undergo different courses of treatmentIts like going into a hospitalIts not the case that everyone in the hospital has the same diseasesSome people have cancer some have heart diseases some have liver diseasesSome people have diseases from eating too much some from eating too littleThere are all kinds of different diseases in the hospitalAnd its the same way here in the monasteryWe each have our own particular diseasesAnd our duty here is to take care of our own diseases without picking up diseases from other people  and at the same time not getting upset that somebody else is taking a different kind of medicine than you areEach of us has his or her own diseases requiring specific kinds of medicineSome medicines are bitter and unpleasant to take other medicines are a lot easier to swallowSo each of us has his or her own course of treatmentIts important that we pay attention to our own course of treatment and not worry about the treatments of othersIf some people dont seem to be recovering from their diseases as fast as you would like them to well again its their diseaseTry to keep this is mindRemember what Ajaan Lee says When you look inside its DhammaWhen you look outside its the world And its not just that youre a detached observer looking at the worldYour whole mind becomes the world as well when you start focusing outsideThis person does that this person does this Thats the world even if you use the categories of the Dhamma to judge the personYouve taken the Dhamma and youve turned it into the worldSo youve got to keep your gaze focused insideIn other words when you get upset at someone else what is this quality of being upsetFocus on thatThe events in the mind are the important issuesThose are the things causing your own illnessDo you want to cure your own illness or to aggravate itKeep this question in mind as you practiceAs we live together and practice together we see each other a lot but try to make that fact have the least possible impact on the mindTry to turn your gaze insideEven when youre looking outside you want your focus to be inside How is your mind reacting to thisHow is your mind reacting to that This is part of restraint of the sensesSeveral years back we had an elderly visitor from Thailand who was very serious about practicing restraint of the sensesShe kept her eyes down and hardly talked to anyoneAnd then she overheard other people talking about how stuck up and unfriendly she was because she was trying to be so quiet and unresponsiveSo she came to me to complain about how other people were not respecting her restraint of the sensesOf course what kind of restraint is that getting upset over what other people are saying about youRestraint is purely an internal matterAs you go through life you have to hear things see things taste things touch things think about thingsThe point of restraint is that you dont make those things the main focusThe process of how the mind reacts to the seeing how it directs the seeing and so on with the other senses that should be your focusIf issues come up and aggravate the illness in the mind how are you going to deal with itThe Buddha laid out a lot of medicines for us to chooseThe chant on the parts of the body Thats basically a reminder of his medicines for dealing with attachment to your own body and lust for the bodies of othersThe chant on the four sublime attitudes Thats for dealing with not only anger but also with resentment jealousy any cruel intentions in your mindMany times you can get worked up about things totally beyond your control Thats when you should reflect on the principle of kamma to develop equanimityThere are antidotes for all these diseases and our duty here is to use themBecause after all whos suffering because of our diseasesOther people may be suffering to some extent but were really sufferingWe suffer very little from what other people do and a great deal from the lack of skill in our own mindsIn the Canon the Buddha talks about how people should not give in to craving and conceit and when we look at other people its obvious that hes rightTheir craving and conceit are obviously causing troubleThe trick though lies in seeing our own craving our own conceitIf you find yourself using these teachings to judge other people stop and ask yourself Well wait a secondAm I the National Bureau of StandardsThen turn around and look at yourselfWhat about your own cravingYou want things to be a certain way and then they arent the way you want them to beThis is a very important lesson I learned with Ajaan FuangHe always seemed to fall sick at times that were extremely inconvenient for meId have some project going on around the monastery and it always seemed that just when I was really getting into the project he got sick and I had to drop everything to look after himI began to notice the sense of frustration growing within me and I finally realized Hey wait a minuteIf I let go of the desire to finish that project things go a lot more easily At the same time if I let go of my desire for him to care for his illness in the way I thought best it made things a lot easier around the monasteryEspecially for me and  probably in no small measure  for him as wellWhen you start running into that reality realize Your cravings are the things that are making you suffer so those are the things you have to let go ofWhen you let go you find you can live with all kinds of situationsNot that you become lazy or apathetic just letting things be whatever way they want to beYou become selective Where can you make a differenceWhere can you not make a differenceWhere is your craving helping you in the pathWhere is it getting in the wayYou have to learn how to be selective how to be skillful in where you direct your wants where you direct your aspirationsAgain the problem is not outsideThe problem is insideWe do suffer to some extent from things outside but the reason we suffer is because things inside are unskillfulThats what we have to work onOnce the inside problem is dealt with the outside problems dont touch us at allConceit is another troublemakerConceit is not just puffing yourself up and thinking youre better than other peopleAccording to the Buddha its the tendency of the mind to compare itself with othersEven if you say Im worse than that other person or Im equal to that other person thats conceitTheres an I there the Imaking minemaking and tendency to conceit Thats a lot of the problem right there a major cause of diseaseThe Buddha describes the sense of I am as the underlying cause for the minds tendency to proliferate ideas its tendency to make differentiations to complicate things and all the categories and conflicts that come from those complications These all start with the I am The basic verbalization of craving also starts with I am It then goes on to I was I will be or Am IAm I not and all the other questions that come up from putting the I and the am together and then identifying with themYou start comparing this I am to other peoples to your sense of what they areSo either youre better than they are or youre equal or youre worseWhichever side you come down on though its just a big troublemaker all aroundJust keep remembering Other peoples diseases are their diseasesTheyve got to cure themTheyve got to take their medicineYour diseases are yours  your prime responsibilityAnd if the person next to you in the hospital room is not taking his medicine properly thats his problemYou can be helpful and encourage him but there comes a time when you have to say Okay thats his issueIve got my own disease to take care of This way its a lot easier for all of usWhen these attachments cravings and conceits dont get in the way then any place you practice becomes an ideal place to practicePeople often ask Where is the best place to practice And the answer is Right here in the hereandnow Its actually the only place you can practiceBut you can do things to make the hereandnow a better place to practice wherever you are both for yourself and for the people around youIts dependent not so much on changing things outside as it is on changing your inner attitudesThat way the place where were practicing becomes a good place to practice for us allWhen you read Ajaan Lees autobiography you notice the number of times he made vows vowing to sit all night vowing to meditate so many hours vowing to do this vowing to do without thatThe word for vow in Thai is adhithaan which is also translated as determinationYou make up your mind youre determined to do somethingMaking determinations like this gives strength to your practiceOtherwise you just sit and meditate for a while and when the going gets tough  Well thats enough for today You dont push your limitsAs a result you dont get a taste of what lies outside the limits of your expectationsAs the Buddha said the purpose of the practice is to see what youve never seen before realize what youve never realized before and many of these things youve never seen or realized lie outside the limits of your imaginationIn order to see them you have to learn how to push yourself more than you might imagineBut this has to be done with skillThats why the Buddha said that a good determination involves four qualities discernment truth relinquishment and peaceDiscernment here means two thingsTo begin with it means setting wise goals learning how to recognize a useful vow one that aims at something really worthwhile one in which youre pushing yourself not too little not too much  something thats outside your ordinary expectations but not so far that you come crashing downSecond it means clearly understanding what you have to do to achieve your goals  what causes will lead to the results you wantIts important to have specific goals in your practice Thats something many people missThey think that having a goal means youre constantly depressed about not reaching your goalWell thats not how to relate to goals in a skillful wayYou set a goal thats realistic but challenging you figure out what causes what actions will get you there and then you focus on those actionsYou cant practice without a goal for otherwise everything would fall apart and you yourself would start wondering why youre here why youre meditating and why you arent out sitting on the beachThe trick lies in learning how to relate to your goal in an intelligent wayThats part of the discernment that forms this factor in determinationSometimes were taught not to have goals in the meditationUsually thats on meditation retreatsYoure in a highpressure environment you have a limited amount of time and so you push push pushWithout any discernment you can do yourself harmSo in a shortterm setting like that its wise not to focus on any particular results you want to brag about after the retreat I spent two weeks at that monastery or one week at that meditation center and I came back with the first jhana Like a trophyYou usually end up  if you get something that you can call jhana when you go home  with an unripe mangoYouve got a green mango on your tree and someone comes along and says A ripe mango is yellow and its soft So you squeeze your mango to make it soft and paint it yellow to make it look ripe but its not a ripe mangoIts a ruined mangoA lot of readymix jhana is just like thatYou read that its supposed to be like this composed of this factor and that and so you add a little of this and a pinch of that and presto there you are jhanaWhen you set time limits like that for yourself you end up with whoknowswhatNow when youre not on a retreat when youre looking at meditation as a daily part of your life you need to have overall longrange goalsOtherwise your practice loses focus and the practice of daily life becomes a fancy word for plain old daily lifeYou need to keep reminding yourself about why youre meditating about what the meditation really means in the longterm arc of your futureYou want true happiness dependable happiness the sort of happiness that will stay with you through thick and thinThen once youre clear about your goal you have to use discernment both to figure out how to get there and to psyche yourself up for staying on the path youve pickedWhat this often means is turning your attention from the goal and focusing it on the steps that will take you thereYou focus more on what you do than on the results you hope to get from what you doFor example you cant sit here and say Im going to get the first jhana or the second jhana or whatever but you can say Im going to stay here and be mindful of every breath for the next whole hourEach and every one Thats focusing on the causesWhether or not you reach a particular level of jhana lies in the area of resultsWithout the causes the results wont come so discernment focuses on the causes and lets the causes take care of the resultsThe next element  once youve decided on your goal and how youre going to approach it  is to stay true to that determinationIn other words you really stick to your vow and dont suddenly change your mind in midcourseThe only good reason for changing your mind would be if you find that youre doing serious damage to yourselfThen you might want to reconsider the situationOtherwise if its just an inconvenience or a hardship you stick with your determination no matter whatThis is your way of learning how to trust yourselfTruthfulness sacca is not simply a matter of speaking the truthIt also means sticking truly to what youve made up your mind to doIf you dont stick truly to that youve become a traitor to yourselfAnd when you cant rely on yourself who will you rely onYou go hoping for someone else to rely on but they cant do the work you have to doSo you learn to be true to your determinationThe third element in a good determination is relinquishmentIn other words while youre being true to your determination there are things youre going to have to give upTheres a verse in the Dhammapada If you see a greater happiness that comes from forsaking a lesser happiness be willing to forsake the lesser happiness for the sake of the greater oneA famous Pali scholar once insisted that that couldnt possibly be the meaning of the verse because it was so obviousBut if you look at peoples lives its not obvious at allMany times they give up longterm happiness for a quick fixIf you take the easy way out for a day then you take the easy way out for the next day and the next and your longterm goal just never materializesThe momentum never builds upThe things that really pull you off the path are those that look good and promise a quicker gratificationBut once youve got the results of the quick fix many times you dont get any gratification at all  it was all an illusionOr you get a little bit but it wasnt worth itThats one of the reasons why the Buddha presents those strong images for the drawbacks of sensual pleasureA drop of honey on a knife bladeA burning torch youre holding in front of you upwind as youre runningA little piece of flesh that a small bird has in its claws while other bigger birds are coming to steal it and theyre willing to kill the smaller bird if they dont get itThese are pretty harsh images but theyre harsh on purpose for when the mind gets fixated on a sensual pleasure it doesnt want to listen to anybodyIts not going to be swayed by soft gentle imagesYou have to keep reminding yourself in strong terms that if you really look at sensual pleasures theres nothing much no true gratification and a lot of true dangerI once had a dream that depicted the sensual realm as nothing more than two types of people dreamers and criminalsSome people sit around dreaming about what theyd like while others decide that they wont take no for an answer theyre going to get what they want even if they have to get violentIts a very unpleasant world to be inThats the way the sensual realm really is but we tend to forget because were so wrapped up in our dreams wrapped up in our desires that we dont look at the reality of what we do in the process of our dreaming what we do in the process of trying to get what we wantSo learn to reflect often on these thingsThis is one of the reasons why your determination should start out with discernmentYou have to use discernment all the way along the path to remind yourself that the lesser pleasures really are lesserTheyre not worth the effort and especially not worth what youre giving up in terms of a larger pleasure a larger happiness a larger wellbeingThe fourth and final element in a proper determination is peaceYou try to keep the mind calm in the course of working toward your goalDont get worked up over the difficulties dont get worked up over the things youre having to give up dont get worked up about how much time youve already spent on the path and how much remains to be coveredFocus calmly on the step right ahead of you and try to keep an even temper throughoutThe second meaning of peace here is that once youve reached the goal there should be a steady element of calmIf youve reached the goal and the mind is still all stirred up its a sign that you chose the wrong goalThere should be a deeper pacification a deeper calmness that sets in once youve attained the goalAs the Buddha said its normal that while youre working toward a goal theres going to be certain amount of dissatisfactionYou want something but youre not there yetSome people advise that in order to get rid of that dissatisfaction you should just lower your standardsDont have goalsBut thats really selling yourself short and its a very unskillful way of getting rid of that sense of dissatisfactionThe skillful way is to do what has to be done step by step to arrive at the goal to get what you wantThen the dissatisfaction is replaced if its a proper goal by peaceSo as you look at the goals in your meditation in your life try to keep these four qualities in mind discernment truthfulness relinquishment and peaceBe discerning in your choice of a goal and the path that youre going to follow to get thereOnce youve made up your mind that its a wise goal be true to your determination dont be a traitor to itBe willing to give up the lesser pleasures that get in the way and try to keep your mind on an even keel as you work toward your goalThat way you find that you stretch yourself  not to the point of breaking but in ways that allow you to growAs you learn to push yourself a little bit more a little bit more a little bit more than you thought possible you find that each little bit becomes quite a lotIt all adds up and you find that the practice can take you to places that you otherwise wouldnt have imaginedIts always interesting to notice which words disappear from common usageWe have them in our passive vocabulary we know their meaning but they tend to disappear from daytoday conversation  which usually means that theyve disappeared from the way we shape our livesSeveral years back I gave a Dhamma talk in which I happened to mention the word dignity After the talk a woman in the audience who had emigrated from Russia came to me and said that she had never heard Americans use the word dignity beforeShe had learned it when she studied English over in Russia but she never heard people use it hereAnd its good to think about whyWhere and why did it disappearI think the reason is related to another word that tends to disappear from common usage and thats restraint foregoing certain pleasures not because we have to but because they go against our principlesThe opportunity to indulge in those pleasures may be there but we learn how to say NoThis of course is related to another word we tend not to use and thats temptation Even though we dont have to believe that theres someone out there actively tempting us there are things all around us that do that tempt us to give in to our desiresAnd an important part of our practice is that we exercise restraintAs the Buddha says restraint over the eyes ears nose tongue and body is good as is restraint in terms of our actions our speech and our thoughtsWhats good about itWell for one thing if we dont have any restraint we dont have any control over where our lives are goingAnything that comes across our way immediately pulls us in its wakeWe dont have any strong sense of priorities of whats really worthwhile of whats not worthwhile of the pleasures wed gain by saying No to other pleasuresHow do we rank the pleasures in our lives the happiness the sense of wellbeing that we get in various waysActually theres a sense of wellbeing that comes from being totally independent from not needing other thingsIf that state of wellbeing doesnt have a chance to develop if were constantly giving in to our impulse to do this or take that well never know what that wellbeing isAt the same time well never know our impulsesWhen you simply ride with your impulses you dont understand their forceTheyre like the currents below the surface of a river Only if you try to build a dam across the river will you detect those currents and appreciate how strong they areSo we have to look at whats important in life develop a strong sense of priorities and be willing to say No to the currents that would lead to less worthwhile pleasuresAs the Buddha said if you see a greater pleasure that comes from forsaking a lesser pleasure well be willing to forsake that lesser pleasure for the sake of the greater oneSounds like a nobrainer but if you look at the way most people live they dont think in those termsThey want everything that comes their wayThey want to have their cake and enlightenment too to win at chess without sacrificing a single pawnEven when they meditate their purpose in developing mindfulness is for the sake of an even more intense appreciation of the experience of every moment in lifeThats something you never see in the Buddhas teachings thoughHis theme is always that you have to let go of this in order to gain that give this up in order to arrive at thatTheres always a tradeoffSo were not practicing for a more intense appreciation of sights scents sounds tastes smells tactile sensationsWere practicing to realize that the mind doesnt need to depend on those things and that its healthier without that dependencyEven though the body requires a modicum of the requisites of food clothing shelter and medicine theres an awful lot that it doesnt needAnd because our use of the requisites involves suffering both for ourselves and for everyone else involved in their production we owe it to ourselves and to others to keep pushing the envelope in the direction of restraint to give up the things we dont need so as to be as unburdensome as possibleThis is why so much of the training lies in learning to put this aside put that aside give this up give that upDeveloping this habit on the external level makes us reflect on the internal level What attachments in the mind would be good to give upCould our mind survive perfectly well without the things we tend to craveThe Buddhas answer is YesIn fact its better off that wayStill a very strong part of our mind resists that teachingWe may give up things for a certain while but our attitude is often I gave up this for a certain while I gave up that for so long now I can get back to it Thats a typical patternLike with the Rains retreat thats winding down right now People tend to make a lot of vows  Well Ill give up cigarettes for the Rains Ill give up newspapers for the Rains  but as soon as the Rains is over they go back to their old waysTheyve missed the whole point which is that if you can survive for three months without those things you can probably survive for the rest of the year without them as wellHopefully during those three months youve seen the advantages of giving them upSo you can decide Okay Im going to continue giving them up Even though you may have the opportunity to say Yes to your desires you remind yourself to say NoThis principle of restraint of giving things up applies to every step of the pathWhen youre practicing generosity you have to give up things that you might enjoyYou realize the benefits that come from saying No to your greed and allowing other people to enjoy what youre giving awayFor example when youre living in a group theres food to be shared by allIf you give up some of your share so others can enjoy a bigger share youre creating a better atmosphere in the groupSo you have to ask yourself Is the gratification I get from taking this thing worth the trade And you begin to see the advantages of giving up on this levelThis is where dignity begins to come back into our lives Were not just digestive tractsWere not slaves to our desiresWere their mastersThe same with the precepts There may be things that youd like to do or say but you dont do them you dont say them because theyre dishonest or hurtfulEven if you feel that you might get ahead or gain some advantage by saying them you dont say them because they go against your principlesYou find that you dont stoop to the activities that you used to and theres a sense of honor a sense of dignity that comes with that that you cant be bought off with those particular pleasures with the temptation to take the easy way outAt the same time youre showing respect for the dignity the worth of those around youAnd again this gives dignity to our livesWhen youre meditating the same process holdsPeople sometimes wonder why they cant get their minds to concentrateIts because theyre not willing to give up other interests even for the time beingA thought comes and you just go right after it without checking to see where its goingThis idea comes that sounds interesting that looks intriguing youve got a whole hour to think about whatever you wantIf thats your attitude toward the meditation time nothings going to get accomplishedYou have to realize that this is your opportunity to get the mind stable and stillIn order to do that you have to give up all kinds of other thoughtsThoughts about the past thoughts about the future figuring this out planning for that whatever You have to put them all asideNo matter how wonderful or sophisticated those thoughts are you just say No to themNow if youve been practicing generosity and have really been serious about practicing the precepts youve developed the ability to say No skillfully which is why generosity and the precepts are not optional parts of the practiceTheyre your foundation for the meditationWhen youve made a practice of generosity and virtue the minds ability to say No to its impulses has been strengthened and given finesseYouve seen the good results that come from being able to restrain yourself in terms of your words and deedsYouve seen that restraint means the opposite of deprivationNow as you meditate youve got the opportunity to restrain your thoughts and see what good comes from thatIf you really are able to say No to your vagrant ideas you find that the mind can settle down with a much greater sense of satisfaction in its state of concentration than could possibly come with those ideas no matter how fantastic they areYou find that the satisfaction of giving in to those distractions just slips through your fingers as if it were never thereIts like trying to grab a handful of water or a fistful of airBut the sense of wellbeing that comes with being able to repeatedly bring your mind to a state of stillness even if you havent gone all the way begins to permeate everything else in your lifeYou find that the mind really is a more independent thing than you imagined it could beIt doesnt need to give in to those impulsesIt can say No to itselfEven more so when you develop the discernment thats able to dig out the source of those impulses to see where they come from to the point where the whole issue of temptation is no longer an issue because theres nothing temptingYou look at the things that would pull the mind out of its stillness out of its independence and you realize theyre just not worth itIn the past you were training the mind in a sense of hunger  thats what we do when we keep giving in to impulses Were training ourselves in hungerBut now you train the mind in the direction of having enough of being free and you realize that the sense of hunger that you used to cultivate is really a major source of sufferingYoure much better off without itIts important that we realize the role that restraint plays in overcoming the problem of suffering and finding true wellbeing for ourselvesYou realize that youre not giving up anything you really needYoure a lot better without itTheres a part of the mind that resists this truth and our culture hasnt been very helpful at all because it encourages that resistance Give in to this impulse give in to that impulse obey your thirstIts good for the economy its good for you spirituallyWatch out if you repress your desires youre going to get tied up in psychological knots The lessons our culture teaches us  to go out and buy buy buy be greedy be greedy give in give in  are all over the placeAnd what kind of dignity comes from following those messagesThe dignity of fish gobbling down baitWeve got to unlearn those habits unlearn those messages if we want to revive words like dignity and restraint and to reap the rewards that the realities of dignity and restraint have to offer our mindsWere afraid of so many thingsTheres so much fear in our livesAnd yet the texts dont treat fear all that much largely because there are many different kinds of fear  fear associated with greed fear associated with anger fear associated with delusion  and the texts focus more on the emotions behind the fears than on the fears themselvesThe implication here is that if you want to understand your fears you have to understand the emotions behind themYou have to analyze fear not as a single solid thing but as a compound of many different factors to see which part of the fear is dependent on the greed or passion which part is dependent on the aversion and which part is dependent on the delusionThen when youve taken care of the underlying emotions youve taken care of the fearIf theres greed for something or passion for something theres the fear that youre not going to get it or the fear that once you have got it youre going to be deprived of itThen theres fear based on angerYou know that if a certain thing happens its going to hurt youre going to sufferYoure averse to it so youre afraid of itAnd then theres the whole area of delusion of what you dont know of the great unknown out thereFear based on delusion can range anywhere from fear of a ghost in the next room or a strange person in this room to general existential angst a sense that something is required of you and you dont know what it isHuman experience seems like such a huge void something very alienTheres the big sense of fear that there may not be any meaning or purpose to life that its just pointless sufferingSo you have to divide out the different kinds of fear because you need to work not so much on the fear as on its rootUnless you dig down to the different factors you wont know what kind of fear it isYou wont be able to get to its root causesNow fear is complicated by the fact that its such a physical emotionWhen fear arises there are all kinds of reactions in the bodyThe heartbeat speeds up the stomach juices get churning and we often confuse the physical reactions for the mental stateIn other words a single flash of fear floods the mind and then recedes but it sets into motion a huge series of physical reactions that sometimes will take a long time to settle downAnd because they dont settle down right away theres a sense that I must still be afraid because here are all the physical symptoms of fear So the first thing in dealing with fear especially strong fear like this is to separate the mental state from the physical stateSome people say they have no trouble reasoning themselves out of the fear but find that theyre still afraidThat may be based on a misunderstanding on mistaking the physical symptoms of fear for the actual mental stateWe have to separate the physical side of the fear from the mental state because if youre reasoning through the issue the actual fear itself may be at bayWhat seems to live on or seems to be unwilling to go away is the physical side and of course it takes a while to go away because of the hormones churned up in your blood streamIts going to take a while for them to wash outSo your first line of defense is to learn to know when there actually is fear in the mind and when theres no fear in the mind even though there may be the signs of fear in the bodyWhen you can make this distinction you dont feel so overwhelmed by the emotionYou breathe as best you can through the physical manifestations of fear the tension the feelings that come with that shortened breath or the constricted breath that result from the fearThen consciously expand that sensation of physical relief and open it up to counteract the fears physical symptomsAt the same time ask yourself Exactly what is this fear Whats being threatened Where do you feel weak What is the danger Learn to take the reasons for the fear apart because a lot of the fear lies in the confusionYou dont know exactly what youre afraid of or you dont know exactly what to doAll the avenues seem closed and you cant analyze whats going onAnd that multiplies the fearSo you have to sit down if you have the chance to sit down or at least mentally make a note What is this fearExactly what sparked it Learn to look at the fear not as something that youre feeling but something thats simply thereAnd try to look at why it keeps shouting at you over and over and over in the brainSome fears are neuroticTheyre based on gross delusion and theyre relatively easy to deal withThose are the ones that psychotherapists can handleYou had a really bad experience as a child and youve instinctively been avoiding that particular issue that particular feeling ever since but its gotten to the point where its totally unrealisticAnd because the fear is unrealistic the treatment is to simply look at the situation for what it really isYou confront it you try not to avoid it but actually put yourself into circumstances that will bring up that fear again and watch the disjunction between the fear and the realityYou learn that the reality was not as bad as you thought it would beAs this disjunction grows clearer the fear gets calmer weaker more and more manageableThats how you handle neurotic fearRealistic fears require deeper practiceOne of the members of our community lost her mother in a war came to the States and became a psychotherapistAs part of her training she had to undergo psychotherapyAfter a couple of years of psychotherapy the therapist said It looks like your fears are very realisticTheres nothing I can do for you This is where Dhamma practice comes in facing our realistic fears our fears of aging illness separation and deathThese things are real and they do cause suffering  if you dont work your way down into exactly where your attachments areThis is precisely the Buddhist take on fear It comes from clinging and attachmentAnd the clinging is threatened by impermanence by stress and suffering by the fact that these things are beyond your controlThe purpose of our training here is to learn how not to let our happiness be based on things beyond our control because as long as we entrust our happiness to them were setting ourselves up for suffering setting ourselves up for fearThis is how the meditation in and of itself is a way of dealing with the fears  the deeper fears the realistic fearsAsk yourself What exactly does my happiness depend on Normally people will allow their happiness to depend on a whole lot of conditionsAnd the more you think about those conditions the more you realize that theyre totally beyond your control the economy the climate the political situation the continued beating of certain hearts the stability of the ground beneath your feet all of which are very uncertainSo what do you doYou learn to look insideTry to create a sense of wellbeing that can come simply with being with the breathEven though this isnt the total cure its the path toward the cureYou learn to develop a happiness less and less dependent on things outside and more and more inward something more under your control something you can manage betterAnd as you work on this happiness you find that its not a second bestIt actually is better than the kind of happiness that was dependent on things outsideIts much more gratifying more stableIt permeates much more deeply into the mindIn fact it allows the mind to open up because for most of us the mind jumps around like a catWherever it lands its always going to stay tense for it knows it has to be ready to jump again at any momentBut when you find something you can stay with for long periods of time the mind can allow itself to relaxWhen it knows that it wont have to jump anytime soon it can soften up a bitWhen it softens up you find it easier to know the mind in and of itself what its like where its attachments are where its still clingingThat allows you to go deeper stillAnd we find that our ultimate fear is fear of death which is an extremely realistic fearIts going to happen for sure and for most of us its a huge mysteryThis is where the solution has to lie in the meditation for only meditation can take you to something beyond death beyond space and timeDeath is something that happens within space and time but there is something that can be experienced outside of those dimensionsThats what were looking forAs the texts say there are four reasons why people fear deathOne theyre attached to their bodies  they know theyre going to lose their bodies at deathTwo theyre attached to sensory pleasures  they know theyre going to lose them at deathThese two types of fear are based on passion passion for the body passion for our sensual appetitesThe third type of fear is based on aversion when people know that they have done cruel things in the past and that they may have to face punishment for those cruel things after deathThe fourth type of fear is based on delusion when people are uncertain about the true Dhamma Was the Buddha rightIs there really a Deathless As long as you dont know these things directly for yourself theres always going to be an uncertainty a large amount of ignorance and delusion surrounding death creating fearThe whole purpose of the practice is to counteract these causes for fear so that you arent dependent on the body you dont have to cling to the body for your happiness you dont have to cling to sensory pleasures for your happiness you train yourself to do good things and you reach the point where you taste the Deathless and know for sure that youre on the right path to the right goalTo do this you have to take apart the basic building blocks of experience as you encounter them in concentration form feeling perceptions thoughtfabrications and consciousnessYou look to see where these things are inconstantWhere theyre inconstant you realize theyre stressfulTheres stress right there in the inconstancyThen when you look at stress look at suffering  although at this level its more stress than suffering  you ask yourself What am I doing to cause that stress to aggravate that stressWhat activities are accompanying the stress You look for the cause and its right there in your intentional actionsWhen you can take those intentions apart things open upOnce they open up you realize that youve come to something totally different a totally different dimension outside of space and timeAnd you realize that death cant touch thatOnly with that direct experience can you say that youve overcome your fear of deathThe only fear youre left with is the fear you might have lapses of mindfulness where you might do something unskillfulSo there is still work to be doneAt the very least though in the gross sense of the five precepts you wouldnt intentionally do anything unskillfulSo this is how the meditation deals with fearIt breaks the fear down into other emotions looking for the underlying causes in terms of the greed passion anger and delusion that give rise to the fear and keep it goingAt the same time the meditation points directly at the way we pin our hopes for happiness on undependable things and opens the way for us to pin our hopes not on something changeable or out of our control but on a dimension beyond the reach of things that could harm itSo the cure for fear is not just a matter of talking yourself out of it but of putting yourself in a position of strength where there really is no danger nothing to fearSo these are a few thoughts on dealing with the emotion of fear as it comes Learn to separate the physical from the mental side so you dont misunderstand whats happening in the body so it doesnt stir up more confusion in the mind Learn how to focus directly on the mind to see exactly what the problem is where the sense of weakness is where the clinging is because wherever theres clinging theres weaknessAnd thats what constitutes fear Then look to see if that danger is realisticIf its not theres one way of dealing with it if its realistic theres another deeper way of dealing with itThis way you find you can not only get a handle on your fear or learn to cope with fear but ultimately put yourself in a position where there truly is nothing to fearAnd thats what makes this practice so specialFreud once said that the purpose of psychotherapy is to take people out of their neurotic suffering and leave them with the ordinary miseries of daily lifeThe Dhamma however takes you from the ordinary miseries of human life and leads you beyond to a dimension where there is no misery no suffering at allIt deals not only with unrealistic fears or fears that are way out of proportion but also with the fears that are genuinely realistic and well foundedIt can take you beyond even those to a point where in all reality there is nothing to fearWhen we come out to the monastery like this we come to a place cut off from human society  not totally cut off because there are other human beings here but its a different kind of society a society where the bottom line is the practice the growth of the mind the growth of the heart the development of mindfulness concentration and discernmentThats not the bottom line in the world at large but it is the bottom line here because the mind needs this kind of environment to develop its best qualitiesWhen we live in the world we tend to pick up the values of the world  and what do those values sayThey say it doesnt matter what you do as long as you succeed as long as you get ahead as long as you get moneyThats the important thingPeople try to dress these values up to sound a little better than that but thats basically what they come down toAnd when you live with people who hold to these values and you dont have a good solid basis within yourself to withstand that kind of thinking youve got to give inYou tend to follow along with them whether you like it or notBut the Buddha teaches us that true happiness isnt found that wayHe says that true happiness comes from developing good qualities in the mindIt has nothing to do with money nothing to do with status nothing to do with the opinions of other peopleIts something totally inner and it has to come from inner goodnessThis is revolutionary because the world tells you if you want to get ahead you have to develop all sorts of qualities you cant really be proud of the qualities you need to stab people in the back make a quick buck take advantage of other peoples weaknessesBut the Buddha says that true happiness requires you to develop things like persistence perseverance endurance integrity mindfulness kindness reliabilityThese are things you can be proud to developTheres a dignity to the practice that you dont find in the world outsideBut if youre living in a worldly environment what the Buddha says sounds like a dream lots of nice ideas but not all that realisticThats why you need places like this where the values that the Buddha teaches are realisticIts what life here at the monastery is all aboutSo being here gives the mind a chance to develop these qualities and to see that they really do lead to happinessThey really are important much more so than the things the world holds to be importantThis is why physical seclusion is so essentialYou get in touch with yourself out hereYou get in touch with whats really important in your lifeThe issues of birth aging illness and death become very large out hereIn the world  the ordinary world  these issues get shunted asidePeople dont have time for them and so when aging illness and death do hit its like a big surpriseThe mind isnt preparedPeople get blown away even though everyone knows deep down inside that these things have to happenYet when you live in a society that doesnt give you time to look at these things to reflect on them and to prepare for them you really get knocked to pieces when they comeSo you need a chance to get out and look at whats really important in your life and how youre going to prepare for these thingsThats what the meditation is all about  developing a good solid basis in the mind that can withstand these things when they comeThe image the Buddha gives for this basis is of a stone column eight cubits longFour cubits are buried down in the ground in a good solid mountainFour cubits are above groundWhen the wind comes the column doesnt shake at allIt doesnt even shiverNo matter how strong the wind no matter which direction its coming from the stone column stays putThats the kind of mental state you need in order to withstand these things  and thats what you develop in the course of the meditationThen as we all know its important that you dont cultivate this skill only while youre here this place of physical solitude but that you also take this skill back with youMany times people come to the monastery and say that its such a relief for the mind to be out here and theyd like to take that state of mind with them when they go backWell you cant take a state of mind like that with youIts a resultWhat you can take back is the skill the cause of that state of mindIts not just the environment that allows it to developPeople can come out here and still have their minds a total messWhat makes the difference is that you learn how to make use of the environment to develop the skills you need to straighten out things insideThe skills are the things you can take back with you when you go home  the skillful attitudes the skillful approaches to bringing the mind under control giving it a sense of stability insideThese are the important parts of the practice that train the mind to stand on its own two feetWhen you ask yourself Where is the best place to meditate your answer should be Right here wherever you areThats the best place Thats the idealBut as youre getting started youre like a child learning to ride a bicycle  you need training wheels you need helpYou cant just jump on the bicycle and ride off with a perfect sense of balanceYou use the training wheels you use the community you use the peaceful environment to help get the mind in the proper attitudeThen you try to develop your own skills so that when the training wheels are taken away you can ride with ease and wont fall overWhat are some of these skillsThe most basic one is just learning to focus the mind on one thing and to withstand any temptation to let it goThis is an important skill you need whatever your work isIf you can concentrate on your work and dont let the distractions get in your way work gets done and it gets done properlyIts a solid piece of work and not just little bits and pieces that happen to be thrown together because theres a continuityAnd when you learn how to focus on one thing like this when you focus in on the breath it changes your attitude toward the other thoughts that come into the mindIf the mind doesnt have a particular focus it can wander around from thought to thought not really noticing what its doing and not having a sense of directionIt gets lost going in the wrong direction because every direction is just the direction where its flowingBut when you give it something to hold onto you have a sense of directionThen you can see how some things pull you away and some things pull you backIts like the difference of being on the earth and being out in outer spaceWhen youre on the earth theres a definite sense of orientation  theres north south east and westYouve got the earth as your reference pointBut if youre out in outer space you dont know which way is up which way is down north south east west  they have no meaning out thereAnd the mind is just adrift in the stellar currentsBut when youre on the earth when youve got a good basis then you have a sense that This way is north this way is south You have a sense of the direction you want to go and you know when youre heading in that direction and when youre notThats why its crucial to have a center for the mindBut to maintain that center you have to enjoy itIf you dont it simply becomes one more burden to carry in addition to your other burdens and the mind will keep dropping it when your other burdens get heavyThis is why we spend so much time working on the skill of playing with the breath making it comfortable making it gratifying making it fill your body with a sense of easeWhen you have that kind of inner nourishment to feed on youre less hungry for things outsideYou dont need to feed on the words and actions of other peopleYou dont have to look for your happiness thereWhen you can develop a sense of inner fullness simply by the way you breathe the mind can stay nourished no matter what the situationYou can sit in a boring meeting and yet be blissing out  and nobody else has to knowYou can watch all the good and bad events around you with a sense of detachment because you have no need to feed on themIts not that youre indifferent or apathetic simply that your happiness doesnt have to go up and down with the ups and downs of your lifeYoure not in a position where people can manipulate you for youre not trying to feed on what they have to offer youYouve got your own source of food insideAt the same time when you have an inner center like this to hold onto you develop a sense of dissociation from the thoughts that arise within the mindYou realize  when youre focused on the breath and a thought comes into the mind  its not necessarily you thinking or your thought and youre not necessarily responsible for itYou dont have to follow it and check it out or straighten it outIf it comes in halfformed just let it go away halfformedYou dont have to be responsible for itThis is another important skill because if you can learn to step back from the thoughts and emotions that come into the mind and not say that this is my thought or this is my emotion then you can really choose which ones are worth holding onto which ones should be explored and which ones should be let go that you dont have to deal with at allSome people may say that thats irresponsible that youve got to check everything outWell thats just what they sayWhat do they know Thats the kind of attitude you have to developAs the Buddha said his own practice really got started in the right direction when he divided his thoughts into two types skillful and unskillfulWhat this means is having the ability to step back from your thoughts and look at them not in terms of their content but in terms of where they take youIf you have thoughts motivated by greed anger delusion passion aversion confusion boredom  where do they take youWell they dont take you to nibbana thats for sureThey dont take you where you want to go so you decide to dissociate from themYou dont deny that they exist for that would just drive them undergroundYou admit their existence but you realize that you dont have to follow themYou can let them go and they pass away from the mindMeanwhile you latch onto more skillful thinking  either that or you learn how to let go of thoughts and just keep the mind still where it doesnt have to thinkThis is where you gain a sense that youre more in control of your mind that youre not subject to everything that comes passing throughMost peoples minds are like bus stationsEveryone who wants to go through the bus station has the right to do soAnd they can do all kinds of weird things while theyre there in the bus station mugging people having sex in the restroom stalls shooting up heroin back in the dark cornersThats what most peoples minds are likeYouve got to make up your mind to turn your mind into a home a place where you have the right to let thoughts in or not let them in as you like  or let them just go passing onYou can close the windows and doors and let in only your friendsYoure more in controlAnd when you have a home like that you can settle down and be at ease and at peace at home at ease and at peace with your own mindSo this is an important skill to take with you wherever you goIts not a skill that you use only while youre sitting here with your eyes closedOne of the essential techniques you need in this skill is the ability to breathe through your thoughts because when thoughts come heavy  when they come really strong  they dont just affect the mindThey affect the body as wellThats why when anger comes you have a strong sense that you have to get it out of your system because its gotten into the body into the way you breathe into the patterns of tension in the bodyIt builds up and gets hard to bear so you feel youve got to get it outMost people think that the way to get it out is to say something or do something under the power of the anger but that doesnt solve anything at allWhen were with our breathing practice we learn how breathe through that pattern of tension in the chest or the belly and let it disperse throughout the bodyOnce its dispersed it loses its powerYou feel less oppressed by itThen you can look at the situation from a calm vantage point and decide what should be doneDo you have to say somethingIs this the best time to say it or is it best left unsaidHow will people react if you talk nowShould you wait till a later timeYou can gauge these things clearly which you cant do when youve got a sense of weightiness or oppression from the anger inside the bodySo you breathe through the patterns of tension in the bodyIts an important skill you use not only while youre here but also while youre out working while youre dealing with your family whatever youre doing in the world at largeIts important to realize that the skills of meditation are for use not only while youre on the cushion or sitting with your legs crossed and your eyes closedTheyre basic skills for governing your own mind looking after your own mind administering the ways your mind works whether youre sitting with your eyes closed or open whether youre alone or dealing with people because its the same mindThe defilements that arise in the course of your practice and the defilements that arise in the course of daily life are basically the same defilementsSometimes in society the defilements appear more unexpectedly with more force and a greater sense of urgency but they come down to the same thing  if an unskillful state arises in the mind and you treat it unskillfully then you just go wherever it leads youBut if you learn how to deal skillfully even with the unskillful things that come  to deal skillfully with feelings of passion feelings of anger your own misunderstandings  you can take the raw material of life and turn it into something fineAs Ajaan Lee once said A person with intelligence takes whatever gets sent his or her way and makes something good out of it This is the attitude youve got to adopt because we live a life full of the power of kamma  old kamma and newYou cant do anything about old kammaYou have to accept it like a good sportThats why you practice equanimityBut as for the new kamma youre creating right now you cant practice equanimity with thatYou have to be very concerned about what youre putting into the system because you realize that this is the only chance you get to make the choiceOnce the choice is made and it gets put into the system then whatever the energy  positive or negative  thats the sort of energy youre going to have to experienceSo pay attention What are you putting into the system right nowThis is the important thing to focus onWhatever other people do to you whatever arises in your body in terms of pains illnesses aging death or whatever Thats old kamma that you simply have to learn to take with good humor with a sense of equanimityAs for what youre putting into the system right now thats serious businessThats where your attention and efforts should be focusedSo the skills you pick up from the Buddhas teachings are not just techniques for silent meditationTheyre skillful attitudes skillful approaches you develop to whats important in lifeYou want to approach life as a skill to realize that there is always the possibility of doing things skillfullyYou may not have perfected it but you dont beat yourself for not having the perfect response to every situationYou realize that theres always the opportunity to learnYou make mistakes you learn from themThis is a normal part of life and a wise way of living is to learn from your mistakes and resolve not to repeat themLearn from what youve doneNotice when you do things correctly notice when you make mistakes and take that information to adjust your patterns of behaviorSome people come to the practice and say Well this is the kind of person I amIve just got to be this way That attitude closes the door on the practice entirelyYou start from where you are but you have to be willing to changeIf people couldnt change if they had to stay the way they are the Buddhas teaching would be in vainThere would be no reason to have the teachings because theyre all about transformationTheyre all about learning developing changing the way you approach lifeFrom the Buddhist point of view accepting yourself means not only admitting where you are but also accepting that you have the potential to changeAs your approach becomes more and more skillful youre doing less and less harm to yourself less harm to others less harm to bothYou find that you live in a way that brings more benefits for yourself more benefits for others more benefits for bothIt may take more energy more attention but its a much more worthwhile way of livingIts like being an expert carpenterYouve got various ways of approaching the problems that arise in the mindYou realize that there are all kinds of problems and there are many ways of dealing with themIf you try just one approach its like having a tool box full of nothing but sawsYou cant build anything with thatYou cant be called a decent carpenter at allBut when you realize that there are ways of dealing with different situations that arise and through your own powers of observation you discover which ways work for you which ways get the right results for you Thats called having a full tool box with a wide range of toolsAnd when you have those tools at hand you can stay anywhereYou can stay in a monastery you can stay in a hospital you can stay at work at home in this country in another country this world the next world this life the nextThe tools stay with you once youve developed themSo focus on the practice as a way of collecting tools developing skills both in terms of techniques in the meditation and whole attitudes toward your lifeThats the most worthwhile use of your timeThose are the best things to take with you when you goGet your body into positionSit straight hands on your lapClose your eyesGet your mind in positionThink about the breath and be aware of the sensation of the breathingSeeIts not all that hardJust doing it is not the hard partThe hard part is the maintaining keeping it thereThats because the mind isnt used to staying in position just as the body isnt used to staying in positionBut the mind tends to move a lot faster and to be a lot more fickle than the body which is why we have to work extra hard at that really hard aspect of the training keeping the mind in one place maintaining it in concentrationAjaan Lee once said there are three steps in concentration practice doing maintaining and then using the concentrationThe using is funOnce the mind has settled down you can use it as a basis for understanding thingsYou suddenly see the motions of the mind as it creates thoughts and its a fascinating process to watch to take apartThe maintaining though isnt all that fascinatingYou learn a lot of good lessons about the mind in the course of maintaining and without those lessons you couldnt do the more refined work of gaining insightBut still its the most difficult part of the practiceAjaan Lee once compared it to putting a bridge across a riverThe pilings on this bank and that bank arent hard to place but the pilings in the middle are really hardYouve got to withstand the current of the riverYou dig down and put a few stones on the bottom of the river and you come back with your next load of stones only to discover that the first load of stones has washed awayThis is why you need techniques for getting that middle set of pilings to stay in place for otherwise the bridge will never get across the river at allSo this is what we work atIn the beginning the work is simply a question of noticing when the mind has slipped off and bringing it backWhen its slipped off again you bring it back againAnd againAnd againBut if youre observant you become sensitive to the signs that tell you when the mind is about to slip offIt hasnt gone yet but its getting ready to goIts tensed up and ready to jumpWhen you can sense that tension you simply relax itMeticulouslyAnd that way you can keep the mind more and more consistently with the breathBe especially careful not to ask where the mind was going to jumpYou cant give into that temptationSometimes the mind is getting ready to jump off to something and you wonder Where is it goingAnyplace interesting Or when a thought begins to form Its just a vague inchoate sense of a thought and the mind puts a label on itThen you want to see Does this label really fit And that means youre fully entangledIf you look more carefully at the process of whats happening you begin to realize that whether the label fits or not the mind has a tendency to make it fitSo its not a question of whether its a true label or not but whether you want to follow through with that process of making it fitAnd you dont have toYou notice a little stirring in the mind and you dont have to label itOr if youve labeled it you dont have to ask whether the label is true or notJust let it goThat way the stirring can disbandNow when the mind finally does settle down in the beginning there can be a sense of rapture a sense of accomplishment that youve finally gotten the mind to stay with the breath for long periods of time for longer and longer periods of timeIt feels really refreshing to be thereThen you make it a game seeing how quickly you can get there how often you can get there what other activities you can be doing at the same timeHowever  and I dont want to spoil it for you  there comes a time when this gets boring tooIts boring though only because you lose perspectiveEverything seems so calm everything seems so settled and theres a part of the mind that gets boredOftentimes thats your first object lesson in insight Look into the boredomWhy is the mind bored with a state of calm and easeAfter all the mind is in its most secure place its most comfortable placeWhy would part of you want to go looking for trouble to stir things upLook into thatTheres a chance for insight right thereOr you start telling yourself This is really stupid just sitting here still still calm calmThis isnt intelligent at all Thats when you have to remind yourself that youre working on a foundationThe stronger the foundation then when the time comes to build a building the taller it can go the more stable it will beWhen insights come you want them to be solid insightsYou dont want them to knock you askewHow can insights knock you askewYou gain an insight and get so excited about it that you lose perspective forget to take it and look on the other sideWhen an insight comes Ajaan Lee always recommends turning it inside outThe insight says This must be this Well he says try thinking about what if it were not thisWhat if it were the oppositeWould there be a lesson there as wellIn other words just as youre not supposed to fall for the content of your thoughts youre not supposed to fall for the contents of your insights eitherThat requires really stable concentration because many times when the insights come theyre very striking very interestingA strong sense of accomplishment comes with themTo keep yourself from getting carried away by that sense of accomplishment you want to have your concentration really solid so that its not impressedIts not bowled overIts ready to look at the other side of the insightThis is one reason why you need solid concentration to work at the steady steady job of just coming back staying staying keeping it still keeping it stillThen that old question of perception begins coming up againThe whole perception of your state of mind starts getting questionableFile that one away for future referenceAs the Buddha said all the states of concentration all the states of jhana up through the state of nothingness are perceptionattainmentsThe perception you apply to them is what keeps them goingAnd as you stay with a particular level there starts to be a slight sense of the artificiality of the corresponding perceptionBut wait until the concentration is really solid before you start questioning it for the perception is what keeps the state of concentration going  and it is an artificial state that youre creating in the mindWhen the time comes for insight one of the topics that youll want to focus on is the artificiality of that concept the artificiality of the perception that creates the state of concentration youve been living withFor the time being though just file it away for future referenceIf you question things too early everything gets shortcircuited and youre back to where you startedSo even though the work of maintaining concentration may seem like drudgery work  just coming back coming back coming back  everything depends on this quality of consistency of maintenanceGet really good at it really familiar with itThe more familiar you are with it the more easily you can use it as the basis for insight when the time comesTheres a passage where the Buddha talks about a meditator whose mind has attained a really solid stage of equanimityWhen youre solid in your equanimity you realize that you can apply it to different thingsYou can apply it to the sense of infinite spaceYou can apply it to the sense of infinite consciousness or nothingnessOnce you recognize precisely where those perceptions are precisely how you can focus on them and stay there for long long times youll suddenly gain insight into how constructed they areIn the beginning its very obvious how constructed they are because youre working so hard to put them togetherBut as you get more and more familiar with them theres a greater sense that youre simply tuningin to something already thereYoure more impressed by the alreadythereness of the stateYou begin to overlook the act of tuningin because it gets easier and easier more and more natural  but its still there the element of construction the element of fabrication that keeps you thereWhen the concentration gets really solid so that you can look into it even in its most refined state thats when the insight really hits you how constructed this is how artificial the whole thing is  this state youve learned to depend onAnd only then is the insight meaningfulIf you start analyzing states of concentration in terms of the three characteristics before youve really depended on those states before youve really gotten familiar with them it shortcircuits the whole processOh yes concentration is unstable Well anyone can sit and meditate for two minutes and learn that and it doesnt mean very muchBut if you develop the skill so that youre really solidly with it you test that principle of inconstancyHow constant can you make this state of the mindUltimately you get to the point where you realize that youve made it as constant as you could ever make it as reliable as you could ever make it and yet it still falls under the three characteristicsIts still constructedThats when the mind starts tending toward the unconstructed the unfabricatedIf youve brought the mind to still enough a state of equilibrium you can stop fabricating and things open upIts not just an intention of saying Well Im going to put a stop to this Its a matter of learning how equilibrium happens without any new intention taking its placeThats where the real skill liesThats why we spend so much time getting the mind into balance balance balance for only in a real state of balance like that can you totally let goSome people have the conception that meditation is about getting the mind into a really extreme state where things break through Bring it to the total edge of instability and then suddenly you break through to something deeperThats what they sayBut Ive yet to find the Buddha describe it that wayFor him its more a question of bringing the mind to a state of balance so that when the time comes to stop fabricating the mind doesnt tip over in any direction at allIts right thereSo these qualities of consistency persistence sticktoitivedness training the mind so it can really trust itself depend on itself rely on itself in the midst of all the inconstancy in the world These are the qualities that make all the difference in the meditationTry to be present throughout the whole breath each breath all the way in all the way outWe like to think that if we had it all figured out we wouldnt have to pay so much attention  that if there were some formula we could memorize that in itself would take care of things so we wouldnt have to put so much effort into the meditation put so much effort into being presentWed like just to plug into the formula and let things go on automatic pilot  but thats missing the pointThe point is being attentive paying careful attention being sensitive all the timeThis is a quality the Buddha calls citta intentness attentiveness really giving yourself fully to what youre doing right nowWhen youre intent insight comes not as a formula that allows you to be inattentive but as a sensitivity to whats going on right now so you can read whats happening continuallyIn other words youre trying to strengthen this quality of being attentive this quality of being present because when youre really present you dont need all the other formulasYou recognize the signs of whats going on when the breath is too long when the breath is too short when the breath energy in the body is too sluggish when its too activeBeing attentive is what enables you to notice these things to be sensitive to them to read what theyre telling youSo the insights you gain are not necessarily wise sayings that you can write down in little books of wisdomInsight is a greater and greater sensitivity to whats going onDont think that youd like to have things explained beforehand or to sit here trying to come up with little rules or memory aids Well when this happens you should do this and then when that happens you should do that Youre trying to develop the quality of being able to listen able to read whats happening in the present moment all the time so that you wont need those memory aidsIf youre looking for the little formulas or the little nuggets of wisdom that you can wrap up and take home in hopes that theyll allow you to drop the effort that goes into being so attentive its like the old story of the goose laying the golden eggYou get a golden egg and then you kill the gooseThats the end of the eggsThe goose here is the ability to stay attentive to be present to be fully engaged in whats happening with the breathThe insights will come on their own  you keep producing producing producing the insights  not for the sake of taking home with you but for the sake of using them right here right nowYou dont have to be afraid that youre not going to remember them for the next timeIf youre really attentive your sensitivity will produce the fresh insights you need next timeIt will keep developing becoming an ability to read things more and more carefully more and more precisely so that you wont have to memorize insights from the pastIt will keep serving them up hot and freshLike sailing a boat When you first get out in the boat and they give you the rudder it doesnt take long before you flip the boat over because you steer too hard to the right steer too hard to the leftYou dont have a sense of whats just rightBut if you pay attention to what youre doing after a while that sense of just right developsAnd the next time you get into the boat its not that you have to remember any verbal lessons you learned from the last timeThe sensitivity is there in you the ability to read how much pressure you should put on the rudder at this point when this happens when that happensTheres a greater and greater familiarity that comes from being fully attentiveThe same principle applies hereIts not the case that youre going to be fully attentive for five minutes and learn whatever lessons youre going to need for the hour and then just zone out or go on automatic pilotYou have to be as attentive to the first breath as you are to the last breath as attentive to the last breath as you are to the first and all the breaths in betweenAs this quality of attentiveness grows stronger your sensitivity grows strongerTheres less and less of a conscious effort but it doesnt mean that youre less presentIts just that youre more skilled at being present more skilled at being sensitive ready to learn whatever lessons there are to learnMichaelangelo at the age of reportedly said that he was still learning how to sculptWell that should be your attitude as you meditateThere are always things to learnEven arahants have things to learnTheyve learned enough already to overcome their defilements but theyre still learning other things because theyre attentive all the timeTheyre watching whats going onTheir sensitivity has been heightenedWhen people talk about the path being identical with the goal there is an element of truth there in the sense that when you reach the goal you dont throw away all the things you did when you were on the pathThe texts say that even arahants practice the four foundations of mindfulness not because they have anything more to do in terms of uprooting their defilements but because the practice of mindfulness provides a pleasant abiding in the here and nowIts a good place to beAt the same time if they have to teach other people they use the sensitivities theyve developed in their meditation and apply them to the process of teachingSo dont sit here saying Well Ill just stay with the breath until I get the results I want and then I can stop this effort Youre working with the qualities that are going to take you there and that are going to stay with you once you arrive the qualities of mindfulness alertness discernment  all the good qualities were working on hereYou want to bring them more and more to bear on what youre doing in every situationThey get stronger and stronger and they give you the sensitivity you need to cut through any defilements you encounterThey give you the sensitivity you need to find more stable states of concentration to figure out the techniques you need in order to get the mind to settle down when its obstreperousBut again once youve learned those lessons its not the case that you can turn off the effort to be sensitive the effort to be fully engagedIts just that you learn how to be more and more comfortable being engaged so that whatever lessons come up whatever things you have to read within yourself whatever things you have to listen to within yourself youre ready to listenYoure alert to the signs that you have to decipher when you readSo do what you can to keep this goose alive and well so it can keep laying the golden eggs you needYou crack open the golden egg and theres a lesson for you to use right there right thenYou dont have to worry about making a stockpile of golden eggs because its a funny kind of gold like the gold in a fairy taleYou turn around and a few minutes later its turned into feathers or strawBut if youre really attentive the goose is ready to lay another golden eggSo keep nourishing it tending to it so that it can keep producingUse the eggs for their intended purpose and then just let them goDo your best to keep this mindstate going so that its ready to lay another egg to give you more gold all the timeLet the mind settle down comfortably on the breathDont push it too hard and dont let it float awayTry to find just the right amount of pressure for staying with the breathLet there be just that one question in the mind right now how heavily to focus on the breathOther questions you can put aside because most of the other questions you would be focusing on now would simply foster doubtThe questions dealing with the mind and the breath in the present moment Those are the ones that are relevant because you can answer them by looking right here right nowThe point of our practice is to gain discernment that leads to liberation that leads to releaseBut before we get to that level of discernment we have to train the discernment we have in every level of the practiceThis morning we read a passage by Ajaan Lee in which he talks about how generosity virtue and meditation both depend upon discernment and give rise to discernmentIn other words you have to use your discernment in each of these levels of the practiceIts not that you have to wait until the very end for discernment to land on youYou take the discernment you have you exercise it it gets strongerIts just like exercising your bodyIf you want a strong body what do you doYou take the weak body youve got exercise it and it turns into a stronger body step by step by step because youre using itBut that also means learning how to exercise it properlyYou dont exercise it too heavily to the point where you pull a tendon or tear a muscleSo at each level of the practice there are questions you want to ask to foster discernment appropriate to that level of the practiceWhen youre practicing generosity you have to ask What right now is just rightHow much can I affordHow much is giving too muchIn what way is my gift going to be most beneficial most effectiveIf I dont have much to give in terms of material things what else can I give The gift of your time and energy the gift of forgiveness can sometimes be many times more useful than the gift of material thingsThats the development of skill insight and discernment on the level of generosityThen on the level of the precepts you work up to a higher levelHow am I going to maintain my precepts in difficult situations Say when people ask questions that you know are going to be harmful if you answer them how are you going to avoid the answer so that you dont lieOr how are you going to live in your house so that you dont have to kill pestsOnce youve laid down the law for yourself  Okay these are the principles Im going to hold to  you suddenly find yourself with a whole new set of questionsYoull need ingenuity and discernment to answer themAnd as you come up with answers using whatever ingenuity you have you find that your ingenuity and discernment get strongerThe same principle holds with meditationEach step in your meditation requires certain questionsYou take the questions bit by bit by bit step by step and you find that the meditation both requires discernment and strengthens discernment as you use itFor instance when youre focusing on the breath you ask a simple question What kind of breathing feels good right now And then you exploreYoure free to experiment with the breath to find out if long breathing feels good if short breathing feels good deep breathing shallowTheres an element of investigation already even in the simple practice of concentrationIts not that you make the mind really really still and then all of a sudden discernments going to go off like a flash bulbThere has to be some discernment involved in the process of getting the mind to settle downAs the Buddha said theres no jhana without discernment no discernment without jhanaThe two have to go together to help each other alongDiscernment here is learning which things to develop and which to let goYou start out with really simple thingsYou have to focus on what the breathing is like what kind of breathing the body needs right nowIf your energy level feels low what kind of breathing will raise the energy levelIf you feel too frenetic what kind of breathing can calm you downIf there are pains in different parts of the body are you breathing in a way thats actually augmenting or causing those painsThese are things you can exploreWhat youre doing is taking your thinking process the questioning process of the mind and learning how to use it skillfullyMeditation is not a matter of stopping your thought processes right awayEventually there does come a point where thinking gets more and more attenuated until you can hardly call it thinking at allBut in the mean time before you can get there you have to learn how to use your thinking skillfully so you apply it to the issue of concentration apply it to the issue of settling the mind downThis is a basic principle in a lot of the Buddhas teachingsIn order to learn how to let go of something youve got to learn how to do it skillfullyThis principle doesnt apply to sex but it does apply to a lot of other thingsFor instance some texts talk about going beyond precepts and practices in the practice but before you can go beyond them you have to learn how to maintain your precepts with skillSome Zen texts talk about letting go of the discriminating mind but before you let go of the discriminating mind you have to learn how to use it properlyBefore learning how to let go of desire you have to learn how to use your desire properlyFocus it on the causes that will get you where you want to goThe unskillful use of desire means focusing so much on the results you want that you ignore the causesYou want to skip over themThat kind of desire is unskillfulYoure not going to get beyond desire by just dropping unskillful desiresYou have to learn how to replace unskillful desires with skillful ones focused on the causes that will take you where you want to goThen when youve arrived the issue of desire falls awaySo right now focus your desire on what will take you to concentrationThis means being mindful to keep the breath in mind and being alert watching the breathA good way to do that is to ask yourself questions about the breath and how you can relate to it here in the present momentIf you were to make the next breath a little bit longer what would happenTry it and find outHow about a little bit shorter deeper stronger more refinedJust ask those questions of the mindDont put a lot of physical pressure on the breathJust ask the question and youll find that simply asking the question opens up the possibilityThis is called appropriate attention  yoniso manasikara learning how to ask skillful questions  and its essential to the whole practiceIn fact the first question youre supposed to ask when you go to meet a new teacher is What is skillfulWhat is not skillfulWhat if I do it will be for my longterm happinessWhat if I do it will be for my longterm sufferingYou take those questions usually starting on the level of the precepts or generosity and work down deeper and deeper into the mindThats how the deeper levels of concentration are attainedThe discernment that gives rise to liberation comes in as well by learning how to ask the question Whats the skillful thing to do nowNow in order to ask those questions from the very refined levels of the mind you have to start by asking them from more blatant levels in your daily lifeThis is why the Buddhas teaching is not about how soon we can get the experience of Awakening how soon we can get the feeling of oneness so we can go on with the rest of our lifeThats not it at allYou have to train your whole approach to lifeWhats the most skillful thing to do right nowWhats the most skillful thing to sayWhats the most skillful thing to think Learn how to keep asking these questions looking for the answers learning from your mistakes time and again so that you gradually do become more skillful on the outer levelsYou find that that habit begins to take root in your mindThen as youre sitting here meditating it becomes an automatic question Whats the most skillful way to relate to the breathWhats the most skillful way to relate to the present moment You experimentYou testYou come up with answersAnd then you test the answersSo its a basic process that starts from the outside and works inUltimately it leads to the discernment that liberates the mind totally from sufferingThats the point we all want to get toBut its not a matter of simply sitting here and waiting until it comesLiberating discernment comes from the process of questioning and probing and looking and getting the mind to settle down and be really still and asking Why is there still a disturbance in thereWhat acts of mind what decisions are creating that disturbance Sometimes the disturbance is on a very subtle levelWhat decisions are still getting in the way You look and you watch and you have to be very patientAjaan Khamdee one of the forest ajaans once made a comparisonHe said that meditating is like being a hunterThe hunter goes out in the forest and on the one hand has to be very still so he doesnt scare off the rabbits and other animals but at the same time he has to be very alertHis ears and eyes have to be very sharpAnd the hunter cant say Well okay Im just going to sit here for half an hour and Ill bag my rabbit He has no idea how long its going to take but he maintains that attitude of quiet alertnessThe same in your meditation The concentration is what keeps you quiet that little question is what keeps you alertAnd the combination of the two when you get them just right That will lead to AwakeningPracticing the Dhamma is primarily an issue of looking at yourself looking at your own thoughts your own words your own deeds seeing whats skillful seeing whats notIts not so much an issue of selfimprovement as one of actionimprovement wordimprovement and thoughtimprovementThis is an important distinction because people in the modern world  especially in the modern world  seem to be obsessed with selfimageWeve spent our lives bombarded with images and you cant help but compare your image of yourself to the images of people you see outside youAnd for the most part theres no comparison Youre not as strong as beautiful as wealthy as stylish and so forthI noticed in Thailand that as soon as television became rampant teenagers became very sullenI think its largely this issue of peoples looking at themselves in comparison to the images broadcast at themAnd the whole question of selfimage becomes very sensitive very painfulSo when we say that youre looking at yourself remember youre not looking at your self Youre looking at your thoughts words and deedsTry to look at them as objectively as possible get the whole issue of self out of the way and then it becomes a lot easier to make improvementsThe same applies to your dealings with other peopleThe Buddha said there are two factors that help most in the arising of discernment that help you most along the pathThe foremost internal factor is appropriate attentionThe foremost external factor is admirable friendshipAnd its important that you reflect on what admirable friendship means because even though youre supposed to be looking at your own thoughts words and deeds youre also looking at the thoughts words and deeds of the people around youAfter all your eyes are fixed in your body so that they point outsideYou cant help but see what other people are doingSo the question is how you can make this knowledge most useful to yourself as you practiceAnd this is where the principle of admirable friendship comes inTo begin with it means associating with admirable people people who have admirable habits people who have qualities that are worthy of admirationOne list puts these qualities at four Admirable people have conviction in the principle of kamma theyre virtuous theyre generous and theyre discerningTheres a wellknown line from Dogen where he says When you walk through the mist your robe gets wet without your even thinking about it Thats his description of living with a teacherYou pick up the teachers habits without thinking about it but that can be a doubleedged sword because your teacher can have both good and bad habits and you need to be careful about which ones you pick upSo in addition to associating with admirable people the Buddha says there are two further factors in admirable friendshipOne is that you ask these people about issues of conviction virtue generosity discernmentAnd this doesnt necessarily mean just asking the teacherYou can ask other people in the community who have admirable qualities as wellSee what special insights they have on how to develop those qualitiesAfter all theyve obviously got experience and youd be wise to pick their brainsThe second factor is that if you see anything in other people worth emulating you emulate it you follow it you bring that quality into your own behaviorSo this makes you responsible for your end of admirable friendship tooYou cant sit around simply hoping to soak up the mist waiting for it to blow your wayYou have to be activeRemember that passage in the Dhammapada about the spoon not knowing the taste of the soup while the tongue does know the tasteBut again when looking at people around you its important that you get away from your sense of competitiveness of this person versus that personYou look not at them but at their activitiesOtherwise you start comparing yourself to the other person This persons better than I amThat persons worse than I am And that brings in questions of conceit resentment and competition which are not really helpful because were not here to compete with each otherWere here to work on ourselvesSo again look at other people simply in terms of their thoughts their words their actionsAnd see whats an admirable action what are admirable words what are admirable ideas ones you can emulate ones you can pick upIn this way the fact that were living together becomes a help to the practice rather than a hindranceThe same is true when you notice people around you doing things that are not so admirableInstead of judging the other person simply judge the actions by their results that that particular action that particular way of thinking or speaking is not very skillful for it obviously leads to this or that undesirable resultAnd then turn around and look at yourself at the things you do and say Are those unskillful words and actions to be found in youLook at the behavior of other people as a mirror for your own behaviorWhen you do this even the difficulties of living in a community become an aid to the practiceThe Buddha designed the monkhood so that monks would have time alone but also have time togetherIf you spent all of your time alone youd probably go crazyIf you spent all of your time together life would start getting more and more like dorm life all the timeSo you have to learn how to balance the twoLearn how to develop your own good qualities on your own and at the same time use the actions and words of other people as mirrors for yourself to check yourself to see what out there is worth emulating to see what out there is clearly unskillfulAnd then reflect on yourself Do I have those admirable qualitiesDo I have those unskillful qualities in my thoughts words and deeds If youve got those unskillful qualities youve got work to doIf you dont have the admirable ones youve got work to do there as wellWhats interesting is that in both of these internal and external factors  both in appropriate attention and in admirable friendship  one of the crucial factors is questioningIn other words in appropriate attention you learn how to ask yourself questions about your own actionsIn admirable friendship you ask the other people you admire about the qualities they embodyIf you find someone whose conviction is admirable you ask that person about convictionIf you find someone whose effort and persistence are admirable you ask him about persistenceIn other words you take an interest in these thingsThe things that we ask questions about those are the things were interested in those are the things that direct our practiceAnd its the combination of the two the internal questioning and the external questioning that gets us pointed in the right directionSo this is something to think about as you go through the day and you see someone else doing something that gets you upset or something that offends youDont focus on the other person focus on the action in and of itself as part of a causal process and then turn around and look at yourselfIf in your mind you create other people out there you create a lot of problemsBut if you simply see life in the community as an opportunity to watch the principle of cause and effect as it plays itself out the problems vanishThe same with admirable people You dont get jealous of their good qualities you dont get depressed about the fact that you dont have their good qualitiesWhere do good qualities come fromThey come from persistence from effort from training which is something we can all doSo again if you see something admirable in other people ask them about it and then try to apply those lessons in your own lifeIf we go through life without asking questions we learn nothingIf we ask the wrong questions we go off the pathIf with practice we learn how to ask the right questions thats the factor that helps us get our practice right on targetI once read a mans reminiscences about his childhood in which he said that every day when hed come home from school his mothers first question would be What questions did you ask in school today She didnt ask What did you learnWhat did the teacher teach She asked What questions did you ask She was teaching him to thinkSo at the end of the day when you stop to reflect on the days activities thats a good question to ask yourself What questions did I ask todayWhat answers did I get That way you get to see which direction your practice is goingThe Buddha concluded one of his most important talks with the phrase adhicitte ca ayogo commitment to the heightened mindWhat this means is that we lift the mind above its ordinary concerns as when we come here to practice meditationOur normal cares of the day  looking after our own bodies feeding them looking after other people being concerned with what other people think about us how we interact with them all the concerns of the day  we put those down lift our mind above them and bring it to the meditation objectWhen you look at the affairs of the world you see that they spin around just as the world doesTheres a classic list of eight gain and loss status and loss of status praise and censure pleasure and painThese things keep trading placesYou cant have the good ones without the bad onesYou cant have the bad ones without the goodThey keep changing places like this around and around and if we allow our minds to get caught up in them its like getting our clothes caught up in the gears of a machineThey keep pulling us in pulling us inIf we dont know how to disentangle ourselves they keep pulling us in until they mangle our arms mangle our legs crush us to bitsIn other words if we allow these preoccupations to consume the mind the mind gets mangled and doesnt have a chance to be its own selfWe dont even know what the mind is like on its own because all we know is the mind as a slave to these things running around wherever they force itSo when we come to meditate we have to learn to lift our mind above these thingsAll thoughts of past and future we put asideWe just bring the mind to the breath so the mind doesnt have to spin around anymoreIt simply stays with the breath coming in going out and gains at least some measure of freedomFrom this heightened perspective we can look at our normal involvement with the world and begin to realize that for the most part it doesnt go anywhereIt just keeps spinning around coming back to the same old places over and over and over againAll that gets accomplished is that the mind gets more and more worn outIf we allow the mind to rise above these things so that it doesnt feed on them doesnt run after them well begin to get some sense of the minds worth in and of itselfAs the mind gets still things begin to settle outLike sediment in a glass of water If you allow the water to stay still for a time whatever sediment is in there finally settles out and the water becomes clearThis is what happens when you let the mind separate from its ordinary concerns and simply stay with its meditationEven when you go back into your normal activities youll have a sense of the mind your awareness as something separateThis sense of separate is a very important part of the practiceIts part of the daytoday work of practicing the DhammaWe all come to the practice hoping that some day some really great experiences are going to hit us while were meditatingWell theyre not going to hit unless you do the daytoday practiceThis is why the Buddha insisted that there are four noble truths not just the truth of the cessation of suffering but also the tasks of understanding suffering abandoning its cause and developing the pathThese are all very important parts of the teachingTheyre all noble truthsThe development of the path is largely two thingsOne developing qualities that enhance the minds ability to know to be awareAnd then two learning how to let go of things that are burdensome to the mindThis is what it means to heighten the mindOnce you let go of the burdens the mind gets lighter and begins to rise above thingsLearning how to do this in all activities is very important because when the really Technicolor experiences hit in the meditation if you cant rise above them youre just going to fall for them tooAnd they eventually lead you back into the world againYour attachments lead you backSo a large part of the practice is learning how to lift your mind stage by stageYou lift it above your ordinary everyday activities and you get into a good state of concentrationIn the beginning the mind and the object seem to become one when youre really absorbedBut as you allow the mind to stay in that state for a while it begins to separate out as wellYou begin to see the object as one thing your awareness as something else and although theyre right next to each other they are separate thingsThis is what enables the mind to gain insight both into the workings of the mind and into the workings of its objectsIt also develops the habit of learning how to let go stage by stageYou rise from one level of concentration to the next to the nextYou pull backThe image in the texts is of a person sitting up looking at a person lying down or a person standing looking at a person sittingYou pull back bit by bit by bit stage by stageNo matter how good the stage you begin to realize youve got to lift above itThis is especially important when really strong experiences come in the meditationYou dont jump to any conclusionsAgain you lift the mind above them and watchHopefully by that time the habit has become builtin enough so that you realize you cant allow yourself to get attached to anything even the really amazing experiencesLift yourself up rung by rung by rung along the ladderYou go from one attachment to a higher one to a higher oneFinally though there comes a point where you have to let go and just watch what happensOnly when youve developed this habit of lifting the mind up can you get through some of these experiences that waylay everyone else along the meditation pathWere not just here for the experiencesWere learning the basic skills we need so that no matter what experience comes to the mind we dont fall for itWe dont latch onto it so that we dont become a slave to it  for the whole purpose of the practice is freedom and yet the habits of the mind tend toward selfenslavementEven when great feelings of oneness or unity or unlimitedness come into the mind you find on a very subtle level that the mind can become enslaved to them as wellAnd the question is how instead of becoming enslaved or enthralled you can learn even from that kind of experienceUltimately the mind has to become totally free even from the state of oneness even from the state of unlimitedness because a lot of those experiences are just states of concentrationTheres still a subtle level of attachment and conditioning going onBut if you develop the habit of learning how to let go and rise above things even while you live in the midst of them then youve developed the proper habits the skills you need that are going to protect you in all circumstancesTheres a fine passage in one of Ajaan Maha Boowas talks where at the time of Ajaan Muns death he sits and reflectsAt first he feels lostHere is the teacher he was able to depend on for so long and now that teacher is goneWhat is he going to doAfter a while he begins to realize Well what were the things he taught when he was aliveTake those as your teachers And one constant theme was Whatever arises in the mind if you dont get caught up with it but just stay with that sense of knowing with the knowing as separate from the event in the mind then no matter what that experience will pose no dangers for youThis skill of learning how to step back step back raise the mind above its experiences This is whats truly distinctive about the Buddhas teachingsThis is whats distinctive about his approach to the really spectacular nondual experiences in the mindIf you havent learned how to develop that approach to ordinary experiences in the mind  looking for the use of the experiences rather than trying to feed on them  then the spectacular ones are going to eat you up wholeThis is why the habits developed along the path are so importantThis is why the path is one of the four noble truths on a par with the othersSo keep this teaching in mind this issue of the heightened mindWatch out for when you allow the mind to lie beneath its objects under the power of its objects and when youre able to lift it up above them so that even though you live with them you have a sense of rising above them of being able to use them of not being caught up in themThats the skill were working onWe just chanted about having respect for concentrationThis is an important principle to keep in mind because all too often the stillness of our minds is something we step onAn idea pops into our heads and we go running after itWe leave our home base very quickly and then find it hard to get backWeve got to learn how to make concentration our normal state of mind centered present alert to the body alert to things going onIts not that you dont sense other things when youre concentrated or that you dont register them with your senses at allSimply that the mind doesnt move out after themThe mind stays firmly based in the breath its home base and from there it protects that sense of being centered looks after it maintains itThis is the only way that concentration can grow can develop the real stability we need to withstand whatever comes upToo many times Ive heard people say Now that my mind is calm what do I do next Theyre in a great hurry to jump to the next step to run off into insightBut before the mind can gain any liberating insight it has to overcome its impatience to moveYou need to get it very solid very secure because when you start working on the issues of insight  trying to understand why greed anger and delusion take over the mind  youre going to find yourself running up against all kinds of stormsIf your concentration isnt really solid and settled youll just get blown awaySo you have to respect this part of the pathAfter all its the heart of the pathThe Buddha once said that right concentration forms the heart of the noble eightfold path while all the other factors of the path are simply requisites supports for the right concentration to keep it right to keep it on trackSo have some respect for this quality of mindLook after itSometimes it seems like were going against the Buddhas teachings on inconstancy stress and not self when we focus on putting the mind in a state thats constant easeful and oursWe get really absorbed in this sense of oneness and we come to identify with it both with the stillness and with the object of the stillness as wellIt all becomes oneSo it seems like were running counter to what insight is supposed to tell usBut what were actually doing is testing the limits of human effortWere taking the khandhas  these aggregates of body feeling perception thoughtfabrications and consciousness  and instead of identifying with them we use them as toolsAnd as part of the process of mastering them as tools there will have to be a sense of identificationYou identify with the state of concentration whatever sense of the body is present in the concentration whatever feelings perceptions thoughtfabrications and consciousness are thereThats why you become so devoted to themThey all turn into a onenessBut instead of simply identifying with them youre also treating them as the pathThat makes all the differenceYou bring things together and once theyre brought together you can sort them out for what they areIf everything is scattered all over the place its hard to see how things interact its hard to see where the connections are and where the lines are drawn between themBut when you get them all right here gathered into one then once theyve been staying together for long while they begin to separate outAjaan Lee has a nice image of taking a rock and putting it in a fireWhen the various elements in the rock reach their melting point they melt out of the rock one at a timeThats how they separateThe same holds true with all the things youre going to try to understand and gain insight intoOnce theyve been together a long period of time gathered here in a sense of oneness they begin to separate outAnd all you have to do is ask the question Whats thisIs this the same as that And then you just watchYou begin to see that theres a natural dividing line between these thingsBut until youve brought the mind to oneness in concentration you cant really see thatAll the dividing lines you see are the ones imposed by words and ideas by preconceived notionsPut those preconceived notions aside and just focus on getting the mind centeredYoure sitting here in concentration trying to get the concentration as refined and as solid as possibleWhen you get up to leave dont drop itTry to maintain itAn image they use in the Canon is of a person carrying a bowl on his head filled to the brim with oilTry to develop that same sense of balance care and mindfulnessAs you get up from concentration and go to wherever youre spending the night try to maintain that sense of being centered and poisedDont let it spillThis is one aspect of having respect for concentration trying to maintain it throughout the course of the day not letting yourself get distracted outsideAgain youll be aware of outside things people to talk to work to be done the sounds of the birds the wind in the treesThese things will all be present to your awareness but you wont send your attention out after themTry to keep your center here insideAs you develop this continuity it becomes your habitual center of awareness your habitual point of referenceThe movement of other things in relation to that center becomes very clearIn other words the impulse to go out and see something Youll see it exactly as that  a current or a physical sensation in certain parts of the body that runs or flows out after thingsIf you can catch sight of it youll see Oh thats what happens when the mind focuses its attention outside Theres both a mental and a physical side to that change of referenceWhen your sense of clear awareness is still enough you can see these things as they moveThe more still your frame of reference the more refined the movements you can notice in the mindSo this element of stillness is very importantWithout it insight is just words ideas things you picked up from booksBut with it insight is seeing things as they actually happen as they actually moveSo this is the basis from which insight comes the insight that leads to releaseYou begin to observe the movements you used to ride on because now youre not riding on them any moreYou see these movements of the mind as they flash out but you dont go flashing with themThats what makes all the differenceIf you ride out with them thats just the way of the normal mindBut if theres a sense of being centered inside you can see the movements of the mind as they go out as thoughts go out as perceptions go out latching onto thingsYou see them as they actually happenYou begin to wonder Why would I ever want to identify with thatThats when the possibility of release comesBut this can happen only when youre really really stillAnd to be still youll need a sense of wellbeing here in the present momentOtherwise the mind wont stayFor the concentration to stay solid and unforced you want to feel good being right hereYou work with the breath in whatever way will help you to settle down to stay clear and centeredAs you use the breath to work through pain in the body youll find that some pains you can deal with and some pains you cant but the only way youll know is by experimentingIf there are pains you cant disperse by adjusting the breath you learn to live with themYou learn not to identify with themYoure aware of them but theres a sense of separation between the sense of awareness and the painThat makes it bearableIf youre going to identify with certain parts of the body identify with the good onesFind the parts of the body where you can maintain a sense of wellbeing through the breathingFocus on thoseThose become your center your point of reference in the midst of this moving worldAllow your awareness to settle in on the breath and get aligned with the bodyIt takes a little experimenting to find exactly what amount of pressure is needed what amount of force is needed to stay with the breath and the body in a way thats just rightIf the pressure is too light the mind goes drifting offIf its too heavy the body starts feeling constricted the mind starts feeling constricted and its going to look for a way to get outSo try to see precisely what amount of mindfulness and alertness is needed just to keep the body and mind together right at the breathThe breath will be a good barometer to let you know when the pressure is too much when its too little  but youve got to know how to read the barometerThis is why we practice meditation day after day after day to get more familiar with our barometerTo begin with you can focus your awareness at any one spot in the body where the sensation of breathing is very clearIt might be the tip of the nose the throat the middle of the chest the abdomen any spot where you know clearly Now the breath is coming in now the breath is going out Theres a sense of rightness about the spot its an easy spot to maintain your focusThis may seem strange this emphasis on ease and comfort in the meditation after everything weve heard about the Buddhas teachings on pain stress and sufferingBut you have to look carefully at what he says about pain stress and suffering and also what he has to say about pleasureLook at the four noble truthsTruth number one of course is stress and sufferingBut buried down in number four the path you find the most important factor of the path right concentration which involves getting the mind focused on the breath with a sense of ease and raptureThis rapture comes from seclusion seclusion here meaning that youre not thinking about past not thinking about the future youre right here with the present momentThings are settling in and theres a snugness to how things feelIt feels good it feels secure being right hereLook at what the Buddha has to say about the tasks with regard to each of the noble truthsThe task with regard to stress and suffering is to comprehend itThe task with regard to the path is to develop it which means you want to develop that sense of ease the sense of rapture that comes as the mind begins to settle down in concentrationWhat youre doing is taking one of the aggregates  the aggregate of feeling  and instead of latching onto it or pushing it away you learn how to use it as a toolWhen pain and stress and suffering come you want to comprehend themComprehending pain and stress teaches you a lot about the mindThe Buddha never said that life is sufferingHe just said theres suffering in life which is a very different teachingAs long as theres going to be pain as long as theres going to be suffering get the most use out of themYou find as you focus on pain  as you get to know it get to comprehend it  that you learn all kinds of things about how the mind is workingIn particular you learn to see what its doing to take a physical pain and turn it into mental pain  or if youre starting with mental pain to make it worseBut to watch that feeling of pain long enough and consistently enough so that you can comprehend it the mind needs strength it needs nourishmentOtherwise it gets drainedThats where the pleasure in the path comes inThats your nourishmentTry to create a sense of wellbeing in the mind as its focused in the present moment so that it doesnt feel threatened by the pain doesnt feel drained by the pain so that you always have a place to go when you need that strengthWhat were doing is taking one of the aggregates that we usually cling to Clinging here doesnt mean just holding onIt also means trying to push away and pushing away is like pushing away a glob of tarThe more you push it away the more you get stuckSo instead of clinging or pushing away we try to learn how to use these aggregates as tools in the same way youd use tar to make asphalt for paving a roadThis is a common theme running throughout the Buddhas teachings Before you can let go of anything you have to learn how to master itOtherwise youre just holding on pushing away holding on pushing awayAnd nothing comes from that except more stress more suffering more painThis harms not only you but also the people around youIf youre constantly feeling worn down by the pains and the inconveniences of life youll find it hard to be kind to other peopleIn fact most of the evil things people do in their lives come from their sense of being totally overwhelmed feeling weak and trapped and then lashing outBut if you give the mind the sense of strength and security that comes with knowing it has a center it can return to and gain nourishment from its a gift not only to yourself but also to the people around youIts not a selfish practiceLearn how not to hold onto feelings grabbing hold of the pleasant ones pushing the painful ones awayInstead learn how to use them as toolsWhen theyre used as tools they open things up in the mindYou understand where the mind is unskillful in how it manages its thinking and you realize that you dont have to be unskillfulThere are better ways to think better ways to manage the thought processes in the mindAnd a funny thing happensAs you master these processes they bring you to a point where everything reaches equilibriumThats where you can really let goYou can even let go of your tools at that point because theyve taken you where you want to goFrom that point on everything opens up to the DeathlessBut you cant get there by pushing and pulling your way aroundIf the Deathless were something you could force your way into everybody would have gone to nibbana a long time agoIt requires a lot of finesse a lot of skill in how you deal with the mind learning to recognize the time for analyzing issues of stress and suffering and the time for letting the mind rest so it that it can gain strength and then go back to workThe ultimate skill is learning how to put those two things togetherIn other words you develop states of concentration to give the mind a really solid center and from that center you can begin to let go of things that are obviously unskillful things you obviously dont want to hang on toThen when youve let go of everything else you turn on that pleasant center youve been developing and take it apartBut all too often weve read the books that tell us what comes next in the practice and we want to get on to insight as fast as possibleIn doing so we tend to destroy the very quality thats going to help us this ability to get the mind aligned with the body in a way that feels just right and then to use the strength use the nourishment the comes from that the stillness and ease the steadiness that comes from thatOnly then can you really gain insightIn other words you just cant jump over concentration or go rushing through the various levelsIts something you want to settle down into so that you can stay still calm for long periods of timeAnd when you can stay that way during your formal sitting you take it out and try to maintain that same calm center no matter where you go no matter what happensThats when you really gain interesting insights into the mind seeing how it goes flowing out after things rushing to grab hold of this rushing to push that awayThe Buddha talks about effluents in the mind things flowing out of the mind and when you can maintain your center you actually get a physical sense of the energy flowing out as the mind loses its alignment with the body and goes out after its objectsThe trick is learning how to maintain that still steady observer so that you can see the movement and realize you dont have to go along with itThe movement is something separateThe knower is something separateAnd the movement dies awayWhen you have that separation clearly delineated you can see even more clearly which of the minds actions are skillful and which are notYou begin to see cause and effect in a way that really opens things up in the mindSo we carry these five khandhas these aggregates around with us and the wisdom of the Buddha is in taking these aggregates that tend to weigh us down like big lumps of metal in a suitcase and opening up the suitcase to look insideThats when you begin to see that theyre not just lumps of metalTheyre tools tools that you can apply to dismantling your attachments so you dont have to lug things around any moreUse them to cut away your obvious attachments and then finally when everything else is taken care of you can let go of your attachments to the tools themselvesBut until that point you want to take good care of them  not to the point of worshipping them but careful enough that they stay in good shape so you can actually use themThis is why the Buddha didnt teach selftorment but he didnt teach selfindulgence eitherThe middle path between the two is not half indulgence and half tormentIts learning how to regard these aggregates as toolsYouve got aggregates of form feeling perception thoughtfabrications and consciousnessLearn how to treat them as tools showing them the proper care and attention that tools need but also realizing that theyre not the beall and endall of lifeTheyre processes not thingsTheyve got their uses but theyre not ends in and of themselvesOnce youve got that point clear the path opens upSo many people accuse the Buddha of being pessimistic He starts his teachings with painAnd yet when you first sit and meditate what do you find after the first five or ten minutesPainYou cant avoid itOr when people just cant sit by themselves cant spend a whole day by themselves without busying themselves with this that or the other thing whats the problemIts mental pain mental discomfortThese are things we live with all the time and yet we think somehow that if people point them out theyre being pessimisticOf course the Buddhas purpose in pointing out pain and suffering wasnt just to stop right there pointing them out and saying Isnt that horrible He says LookTheres a solution In fact his approach to pain is extremely optimistic Human beings can put an end to suffering in this lifetime through their own effortsSo when we sit here we have to anticipate that there will be pain in sitting stillThe reason we normally move around is because we encounter pain in a particular posture so we change a little bit to get away from itThe Buddhas approach isnt to try to run away from it that wayHe says Look into itAs Ajaan Suwat used to say We normally take our cravings as our friends and our pains as our enemiesWe should switch that aroundLearn to look at pain as your friend and craving as your enemy The craving is whats really causing all the problemsThe pain is just there to teach you somethingOf course its a difficult friendSome people are easy to be friends with you can get along with them with no problem at allOthers are difficultPain is definitely a difficult friend but one worth cultivatingStill because its difficult you have to go about it the right wayThis is why when we start meditating the Buddha doesnt have us focus immediately on the painHe says to focus on the breath instead because whatever pain is associated with the breath  and it tends to be subtle but it is there  is something you can manage something you can deal withHe gives you the breath as your tool for dealing with the painSo when youre aware of pain dont yet let your primary focus be on the painKeep your focus on the breathIn other words get used to being acquainted with the breath first because thats the person wholl introduce you to pain properlyIts like meeting any important person You first have to get to know certain wellconnected friends who can introduce you to that personAnd thats the way it is with pain You have to know the breath first for its your wellconnected friendSo get in touch with the breathFind a place in the body thats relatively at ease relatively comfortable and focus there first get to know that spot first be very sensitive to the breathing at that spotWhen you breathe in there how does it feelWhen you breathe out there how does it feelIs there even the slightest discomfortCan you make it feel betterCan you experiment with different ways of breathing different ways of conceiving the breath energy in your bodyWhen you find something that feels really good the whole tone of your body will feel really goodInstead of sitting here tensely trying to breathe in one spot think of the whole body relaxing into the breathThe more relaxed you are about the practice the longer youll be able to stay with itSo think of yourself as just relaxing into the body relaxing into the breathFind a way of breathing that feels really good  all the way from the beginning to the end as it goes in and all the way from the beginning to the end as it goes outMake that your foundationOnce that feels good think of spreading that good breath energy to the other parts of the bodyThink of it as going right through the painMany times a lot of the discomfort we feel around pain comes from tensing up around it and the tensing up just makes things worseSo try to breathe through any tension you feelBreathe right through the pain all the way on outSuppose theres a pain in your hip or in your knee Think of the breath going through the hip through the knee all the way out through the toes as you breathe in and out into the air as you breathe outAs you approach the pain try to maintain the same mental tone and feeling tone you had when focusing on the comfortable breathYour primary frame of reference here should still be the breathTheres no way youre not going to notice the pain but ask yourself How does the breath affect the painHow does the pain affect the breath Always keep the breath in mind as your frame of referenceThat gives you a handle on the painOtherwise if you jump right into the pain you find yourself picking up the energy from the pain that puts you on edgeThe first thing youll think will be Make the pain go away And then theres even more impatience as you get involved in the past and the future of the painBut when you stay with the breath you want to be as much with the present as possibleDont think about how long the pain has been there or how long its going to stayJust Whats there right now That takes one huge burden off the mind right thereSo as you go through the pain make the thread of your awareness stay with the breathThats what you want to keep track of thats what you want to hold ontoLearn to relate to the pain through the breath rather than just butting up against the pain headonNow if you find that the pain just gets worse and worse and worse to the point where you cant stand it sit with it another five minutes and then change your positionIn other words push your limits a bit at a time and youll find that you get better and better at staying with the pain more skillful in maintaining your frame of reference with the breathAs long as you really stay with the breath youll be okaySlipping away from the breath is what creates the problems because the mind then immediately creates stories about the pain creates issues around the pain Why is this pain happening to me Or if its a physical pain that you know you caused Why did I do that All these questions  How much longer is it going to lastAm I going to have this pain the rest of my life  just drop them right nowStay with the breathDeal immediately in the present because the past and the future are not actually thereThey are things the mind creates and once theyre created they turn around and bite the mindSo try to stay with that thread of the breath as it goes through the painThen youll begin to see why the Buddha focused on pain as the primary spiritual issue in our practice for it teaches you so much about the mindIts like filming a documentary on the animals in the desert If you go out and spend the day wandering around the desert youll probably miss most of the animalsBut if you set up your camera at a safe place near the water hole hours a day all of the animals in the area are going to have to come thereThats where you get to film them allIts the same with the painIf you focus steadily on the pain youll see all the minds reactions around the painAll its issues will come to the surface and congregate thereAt the same time if you use the breath as your tool for dealing with the pain those issues wont totally overwhelm youIts like having a safe shelter to run to if the lions object to being filmedYouve got a safe place in the breathYoure not totally at the mercy of the painYou can pull out any time you want and youve got a handle to deal with itYouve established a feeling tone around the whole body that holds the pain not grasping onto it but surrounding it with an energy surrounding it with a space where youre not threatened by itThen you can deal with itWhen youre not threatened you can really get into the present momentIf you find that you cant yet handle it youve got the breath to go back toBut when things get stable enough in the mind clear enough in the mind so that you can handle it then you really can start looking at the pain as your friendYou can get familiar enough with it so that ultimately you can understand it for what it truly is so that ultimately its no longer a problemUntil that point its always going to be a difficult friend but if you start off on the right foot using the breath as the basis of your friendship youll find that youre in a good position to make the friendship workOur basic problem in life is that the most important thing in our lives is the thing we know the least about our own mindsAs the Buddha said all things come out of the mind  all our experiences all the happiness and all the pain we experience come from the mindAll things have the mind as their forerunnerThings are made of the mind determined by the mind  and yet we dont know our minds so our lives are out of controlWe dont understand where things come from or how things happen in our livesThats why we have to meditate  to get to know our own mindsThe difficulty in meditation is that you cant focus directly on the mindIts like focusing on the wind up in a sky with no clouds  you have no way of knowing which direction its going because theres nothing against which its going to make contactThats why you need a meditation object like the breath or buddho or parts of the bodyWhichever object you find easy to settle down with thats the one you takeHaving an object gives the mind something to bounce off of  because when you decide youre going to stay with something you begin to see how erratic the mind isIt keeps jumping aroundIt goes here a little while then it goes there for a little while and then over thereYou begin to realize how this most important element in life  the mind  is so totally out of control totally undependableThats why the mind needs trainingWe need to strap it down to one object and make it stay there so that we can really get to know it and train it until we sense that we can depend on itWe talk about taking refuge in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha but they can be our refuge only when we bring them into the mindAnd the mind can be dependable only when weve got the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha in there qualities like mindfulness concentration persistence and dependabilitySo if you want to depend on the mind make it something you can depend onThe Buddhas good news is that its possible to do thisAt the time the Buddha was teaching there were other teachers who said that there is nothing that you can do about the way life is its all written in the starsOthers said that no matter what we do any action leads to more suffering so the only way to stop suffering is to stop actingAnd still others said that life is totally chaotic theres no way you can make any sense out of it at all so dont tryJust try to have as much fun as you can while you can because everything falls apart at deathSo there were all kinds of teachings but they were all teachings lacking in hopeThe Buddhas teaching was the only one that offered any hopeHe said yes there is a skill that you can develop in training the mind and yes it does lead to true happinessSo just as with developing any skill you have to be observant stick with it be sensitive to what youre doing be sensitive to the results make necessary changes or adjustments and as a result you keep getting better and better and better at itSometimes the improvement is hard to see because its so incrementalIt takes such tiny tiny steps but you can rest assured that whatever positive energy you put into the practice is going to produce positive resultsThats also part of the good news of the Buddhas teachingsNothing good you do is wastedNo effort that you put into Right Effort is wastedSo we have conviction in the Buddhas teaching because he teaches us to have conviction in ourselves  that the practice is something we can doWe dont have to depend on anything from the outside at allYour own power your own potential Thats whats going to get you where you want to goIf you have to depend on others you dont really know if you can depend on them or notWill they be there when you need themThey might change their mindsAfter all you have no control over things outside of youEven though you currently may not have much control over the mind you can still work at it and develop more and more control over timeTell the mind to sit down and stay in one place often enough and eventually it will stayIts going to rebel for a while but if you use your ingenuity in teaching it  showing it that in being obedient this way it wont always have to be struggling or suffering  its going to find that it actually likes settling downAnd then you can hardly keep it from settling down  it wants to keep coming back coming back coming back to the state of stillness feeling at home in the present momentThis is why we adjust the breath in the practice to help the mind settle down easilyAnd we work to get to know the breathWhat are the different ways it has of coming inWhat are the different ways it has of going outHow does it affect the rest of the bodyWhen the breath comes in and out its not just the air coming in and out of the lungsIts the energy that courses through the whole body throughout every nerveThink about the whole nervous system going down from the brain down the backbone out the arms out the legs encompassing all the parts of the bodyThen allow yourself to think that the entire system can be affected by the breath if you let it happenLet the whole body relax and get into the breathingLet your mind get into the breathingDont think of yourself as being outside someplace looking at the breathBe immersed in the process of breathingThe whole body breathes inThe whole body breathes outAnd youre right in there with itAfter you work at this for a while you begin to find that the work pays offIt really feels good feels gratifying just to sit here breathingThe mind has a sense of being at homeIf the mind were to go out to think of other things youd be sending it out into a territory it totally has to create for itselfBut you dont have to create much right here in the present momentWhen youre really with the breath youre putting much less of a strain on the mindAnd when the mind gets used to this it decides that it really likes itUntil it decides that it likes it you have to use both the carrot and the stickThe carrot is the comfortable sensation of breathing the stick is the constant reminder of whats going to happen if the mind doesnt come under control if it isnt willing to settle down  all the suffering and pain that youll have to endureThe Buddha said that when people suffer when theres pain in life they have two kinds of reactionsOne is bewilderment because they dont know where the pain comes from or why its happeningThe second reaction is the desire to get free of the pain one way or anotherAnd these two reactions go hand in handYoure bewildered at the same time that youre trying to get free and so you tend to do all kinds of unskillful things to get away from the pain things that arent helpful at allBut through practice you come to realize that the pain in the body isnt the culpritThe pain in the mind  the mental anguish the mental distress Thats the real problemWhen you really get to know the mind you see that the pain in the body isnt such a big deal at allIt becomes a problem only when the mind takes it on and converts it into mental pain but to understand mental pain you have to work with physical painSo after the mind has settled down focus it on the pain pain in the legs pain in the back whateverJust get to know it as its actually presentWhat is this painIs it what you think it isTry to see the pain on its own  simply as a sensation and not as a pain  without all the presuppositions you may have about it that its placed right here that it has this shape that its taken over the body or whatever crazy notion the mind has about the painWhen you think about it most of the notions youve developed about pain were developed when you were really small because thats when you first met up with painThe first thing they do when youre born is to spank you so you can breatheAnd even before they spank you going through the process of birth is enough to make you pass outSo weve been dealing with pain ever since we were small and for most of us the strategies weve been using are those we picked up when we were so small that we didnt know what was going onA lot of those strategies are still there in your mindSo just sit down and get to know the painSimply regarding the pain as something you want to know changes a lot of your subconscious attitudes toward it right thereYour usual attitude is that once theres pain you want to get rid of it to get away from itOf course if you keep running away from it youre never going to get to know it youll never get to understand it and this means that youll end up dealing with pain more and more out of bewildermentSo once the mind has settled down in the sense of wellbeing fostered by the breath tell yourself that its time to get to know the pain make friends with the pain  not so you can live with pain forever but so you can really understand how far the pain goes and how far the mind goes and where the two are actually separateBe sure that your purpose is to get to know the pain not so much to make it go away but to thoroughly understand itThe understanding is what will enable you to get beyond it in ways you didnt expect The mind can be with the pain and yet not be pained by itThis is an important skill to develop because as long as theres a body theres going to be painThe question is not how to run away from it but how to live with it so as not to be pained by itRealize that the pain is simply happening not necessarily happening to youIts just happeningIts an eventIt has no intention to harm you at allYou feel pained by it because you put yourself in the way by laying claim to the part of the body where the pain seems to beIts like getting into the line of fire Youre bound to get shotSo dont get into the line of fireDont lay any claim to itSee that the pain is just something thats there and that its going to come and its going to go in line with its own causes and effectsYour only duty is to watch it to see what its really like for there to be painSimply be there with the pure sensation in the momentHow does it move aroundHow does it changeExactly what about it is painfulWhats the mind doing to the pain when the mind labels itWhat effect does that haveIf you can catch that event in the mind  the mind saying This is this and that is that this is the pain and its doing this and all of the other running commentary that the mind makes on the present moment  then you begin to realize this in itself is a lot of the problem right thereThe fear that the pain is going to stay the anticipation that its going to stay all these thoughts Just let them drop awaySee what happensWhere does the pain go when they drop awayBy watching this your whole attitude toward the pain changes because you come to see that it isnt at all what you thought it wasAnd at the same time you learn an awful lot about your mind  all the things that the mind comes in and says about the painIts as if you have a whole committee offering their suggestions and opinionsSo this is a very good way of getting to know the mind because a lot of things buried in the mind will tend to surface and focus on whats happening when theres painInstead of trying to run away from the pain you just sit with it and see what kind of reaction comes up in the mindAgain dont identify with the reactionsThe reactions will say Stop stop stop Or theyll say This is this and thats that and you should do this and you should do that Just respond No Im just going to be hereIm just going to watch And watch both the pain and the minds reactions to the painThis is how you really get to know the mind while training it to become more and more dependableIf the mind isnt shaken by pain theres very little thats going to shake itIf it doesnt fear pain theres very little for it to fearAnd when its not afraid in the face of pain it becomes a mind you can depend onWhen you want it to work it will work for youWhen you want it to rest it will restWhen you want it to think it can think  and it will think clearlyWhen the time comes for it to stop thinking it will stopWeve spent so much of our lives developing fear of pain fear of sufferingIf you can get past that fear get past the minds tendency to be pushed around by these things youve got a mind you can rely onAs when they train soldiers They have to put the soldiers through all kinds of hell in order to know which ones they can depend on and which ones they cantThe ones who come through it okay Those are the ones you know you can depend onIts the same with the mindIf youre afraid to face up to pain the mind will never have any control over itself at allIt will never become something you really can depend onIt will always flinch under the pain unwilling to do this unwilling to do that because its afraidAnd when thats what your mind is like where are you going to find anything to depend onWhere are your true friends at that pointEven your own mind isnt a friendSo when the mind has settled down and really feels at home in the present moment working with pain is an excellent way of training itThrough this you can come to see that the mind will obey you not only when you make it comfortable but also when you test it when you give it work to doThats when you have a mind you can really take as your refugeLet your mind settle inStay with the breathTheres nowhere else you have to go nothing else you have to do right nowJust be with your breathingWhen the breath comes in you know its coming inWhen the breath goes out you know its going outAllow it to come in and go out in a way that feels good and refreshingIf youre feeling tired you may want to breathe in a way thats energizingIf youre feeling frenetic breathe in a way thats more calmingGain a sense of what the breath can do for the body and the mind here in the present momentDo what you can to put the mind in a good moodIn other words if you approach the process of meditation with a lot of anxiety with a lot of frustration that anxiety and frustration will show up in the breath and simply make things worseSo remind yourself Not too much is demanded of you right now just being with the breathIf you notice youve wandered off just bring the mind right backIf it wanders off again bring it back again and try to make the breath even more comfortableAs you keep at this you find that the mind develops a stronger and stronger foundation a place where it can stay a place where it really feels safe where it feels at home where it can look at the larger issues in life and not mess them upThe Buddha talks about suffering as his number one truth and when we hear about that many of us want to run awayWe feel that we have enough suffering in life we dont want to hear about it anymoreBut the Buddhas whole reason for teaching about suffering is because he has a cureTo work that cure though you first have to get the mind in good shape because most of us when we deal with suffering simply make the issue worseWe feel threatened by it we feel surrounded by it we start getting desperate and in our desperation we do all kinds of things that are harmful both to ourselves and to people around usSo first get the mind in a good moodAll you need is the breath coming in and out with a sense of wellbeingIf youre really observant and become familiar with the breath over time you find that that sense of wellbeing starts permeating throughout other parts of your life as wellAnd when youve got a sense of wellbeing you can depend on then you can turn to the issue of suffering to see exactly what suffering is looking at it not so much out of desperation as out of curiosityAs the Buddha said the best way to deal with suffering is to comprehend it as in the passage we chanted just nowHe said most people dont discern sufferingWe suffer we feel it but we dont discern it we dont understand itThe Buddha said that if you understand it you can manage it you can put an end to itIf you dont understand it you just keep on suffering and never put an end to it at allIn his first sermon he describes suffering the suffering of birth the suffering of aging the suffering of illness the suffering of death of being separated from what you love of being conjoined with things you dont like of not getting what you wantThat seems to be a pretty good summation but then he boils it down to even more basic termsThis is where the discussion gets technicalHe analyses suffering down to five heaps five clingingaggregates form imbued with clinging feeling imbued with clinging perceptions thoughtfabrications and consciousness all imbued with clingingThe clinging is the important elementIts what turns ordinary form feeling and so forth into sufferingWere often told that these aggregates are the Buddhas description of what we are but that wasnt his purpose in formulating this teachingHis purpose was to give us tools for breaking suffering down into manageable piecesFor most of us suffering is an enormous issue much larger and more pressing than the abstract question of who or what we areWhen suffering comes it overwhelms usWe cant stand up under its weightIn fact thats one of the traditional definitions of suffering that which is hard to bearAnd its hard to bear because we feel overwhelmedWhen it hits hard it seems like an enormous mountain filling our awarenessWe cant get a handle on itThe purpose of dividing it into these five heaps is to break the mountain down into gravel and the gravel down into dustThis helps us realize that no matter what the type of suffering  whether its the suffering of aging illness death the suffering of separation the suffering of not getting what we want  it can all be analyzed into just five sorts of thingsThats all it isAnd furthermore we can look at these five sorts of things and see that theres nothing there worth suffering overWe build enormous narratives around our pains but what are those narrativesTheyre just perceptions combined with the thoughtfabrications built out of themIf we cling to those narratives theyre going to make us sufferBut if we take them apart we see that theres nothing much thereSo the Buddha has us focus not so much on the story line but on the building blocks we use to put the story line togetherIf you get down to the building blocks you begin to see how artificial this whole process is  because these aggregates are not thingsTheyre actually activities things we doWe suffer because we cling to certain activities certain movements of the mindSo to cut through this clinging you have to keep breaking your suffering down and analyzing it Whats going on hereSuppose theres a pain in your leg and youre suffering from itWhats going on thereTheres the form of the body and then there are the actual feelings of painAnd then there are the perceptions the labels you put on the feeling the thoughtfabrications the stories you build around the feeling and then the consciousness the repeated acts of being conscious of all these thingsSo instead of building up the stories around the feeling  getting angry about the feeling getting upset about it worrying about it  if the mind is calm enough you can start taking the suffering surrounding the feeling apartWhats going onWhats actually thereTheres the form of the body which is actually separate from the feeling although we often glom the two togetherIf theres a pain in our knee it feels like our whole knee is nothing but painBut if you look at it carefully theres the form of your body and then there are the feelings flickering around the formTheyre not a single solid thingMany times we perceive the feeling to be a solid thing but now were taking that perception apartActually theres not just one perceptionThere are many repeated perceptions just as there are many moments of feelingThis is why these things are called khandhas or heapsLike heaps of gravel or heaps of sand theyre made out of small individual events small individual motions either physical motions or mental motionsSo you break them down break them downAnd once theyre broken down theyre not too big to handleYou can change themFor example those perceptions you applied to the feelings What happens if you change them from perceptions of pain to simply perceptions of sensationOr you can try to analyze the sensation into its physical aspects the sensation of warmth or heat or maybe a sense of blockage that feels solidIf you actually take those solid feelings apart though you begin to see theyre not so solid after allThen there are the stories you build up around the sensations the fears of what will happen if you dont do something about the painIf you sit here for the next hour is your leg going to fall offWill you harm the tissues of the body by cutting off the bloodThe mind can build up all sorts of stories about the sensations but instead of looking at the stories and getting caught up in the story line just look at them as words coming through the mind without your having to believe themSimply watch the stories as individual wordsThen you begin to see that if you cling to the story line you make the pain worseSo why cling to itYou dont have to follow the story lineIts not a movie youve paid to seeYoure not missing anything important if you dont follow it through to the endSo what you want to do is take the suffering apart into its component parts and locate the clinging that turns those component parts into the sufferingIf you take each component part on its own its not all that badThe aggregate itself is not sufferingThere can be a pain in the leg but we suffer simply because we identify with it we lay claim to it as oursThats why we sufferWithout the act of identification without the clinging there would be no sufferingThe mental label that says mine or my pain my leg or whatever What happens if you drop itYou dont have to think itTheres nobody forcing you to think itTheres simply the force of habitAnd habits can be changedAs you take the suffering apart into little bits and pieces like this its a lot more manageableMany times the pain may still be there but theres no sufferingOr sometimes when youre not worked up about it the pain actually goes awaySome physical pains are physical in their causes others are more mental in theirsEven physical pain has its mental component as the mind chooses which sensations to focus on and which ones to ignore which ones to downplay and which ones to magnify with its stories and running commentaryYou can see this mental component clearly when you stop the commentary or when you just step back and watch the commentary as you would something curious and say Well why would I believe that and suddenly the suffering goes awayWhether or not the pain is still there the suffering is goneThats when you see that the issue was not the pain but the unnecessary suffering you created by clinging to these feelings and perceptionsWhen you see clearly the things youve been clinging to and that theyre not really worth clinging to the suffering breaks downThe mountain is leveled and pulverized into dustWhen youve mastered this skill thats the end of sufferingWe meditate developing mindfulness developing concentration and after a while we begin to wonder When is the discernment going to comeWhen are the insights going to come So its instructive to look at the Buddhas analysis of what gives rise to discernmentMindfulness and concentration are prerequisites but theres moreAnd in searching for that more its especially instructive to look at two sets of qualities that the Buddha said lead to Awakening  the five strengths and the seven factors for Awakening  to learn their lessons on what gives rise to discernment whats needed for insights to ariseOtherwise you can meditate for twenty thirty forty years  as Ajaan Lee says you could die and your body could dry out on the spot  and still not gain any discernment because youre lacking some of the proper qualitiesThe five strengths  a set of factors that culminate in discernment  are interesting because they start out not with ideas that youve heard from someone else in terms of what Buddhist discernment is aboutThey start with the quality of convictionConviction in whatConviction in the principle of kammaThats what it comes down to  conviction in the principle that our actions do matterSome people have problems with the teaching on kamma but what exactly is the Buddha asking you to believe in when he asks you to have conviction in kammaFirst action really is happening  its not an illusionSecond you really are responsible for your actionsTheres no outside force like the stars or some good or evil being acting through youWhen youre conscious youre the one who decides what to doThird your actions have results  youre not just writing on the water  and those results can be good or bad depending on the quality of the intention behind the actSo the teaching on kamma puts you in charge of shaping your lifeIts a good teaching to believe inAnd how does this relate to discernmentIt provides the basis for the questions youre going to ask to give rise to discernmentAnd because the principle of kamma places a lot of emphasis on the need to act on skillful intentions to get the good results you want the basic question becomes How can you tell whether an intention is skillful or unskillfulTogether with conviction you need the quality of heedfulness the realization that if youre not careful about your actions you can create a lot of suffering for yourself and for those around youHeedfulness is said to underlie the development of the five strengths leading up to discernmentIts the quality that makes sure youre going to pay close attention to what youre doing close attention to your intentions close attention to the results of your actions  as in the passage where the Buddhas instructing Rahula his sonBefore you do something he tells Rahula ask yourself Whats the intention hereWhy am I doing thisIs it going to lead to suffering or not Only if the intention looks good should you act on itThen while youre acting you check the results of your actionAfter the action is done you check again because while some results are immediate others are long termSo conviction in kamma focuses your attention at the right spot and gets you asking the right questionsHeedfulness gives urgency to your investigationAnd the two of them together lead to discernmentThe teachings on the seven factors for Awakening are similarYou start out with mindfulnessThe Buddha teaches you to be mindful of the body in and of itself feelings in and of themselves mind states mental qualities in and of themselvesWhySo that you can be really clear on what your actions are and what the results areIf youre concerned with other issues  as the Buddha says things in the world things that other people are doing  you miss what youre doingSo you focus right here get yourself in the present moment not simply because the present moment is a good moment in and of itself but because its the only place where youre going to see your intentions in actionIn this way mindfulness puts you in a position to develop the second factor for Awakening the discernment factor called analysis of qualities The qualities here are qualities in the mind mental states in the presentThe food for this factor is appropriate attention to the skillful and unskillful states arising in the mindYou pay attention to the intentions you act on trying to see whats skillful and whats notAnd again the test for judging whether your actions are skillful is by their results How much harm do they causeHow much happinessDiscernment focuses on actions in terms of cause and effect and works at developing greater and greater skill in acting greater and greater sensitivity in evaluating and learning from the results of your actions to the point where your actions are so skillful that they lead to the DeathlessThis may sound unusual for were often taught that Buddhist discernment focuses on seeing things in terms of the three characteristics inconstancy stress and notselfWere taught to look for the inconstancy the impermanence of things and then to see that if theyre inconstant they must be stressful if theyre stressful they must be notselfWell those teachings have to be placed in context and that context is the act of judging the results of our actionsThe three characteristics are designed so that we dont content ourselves with only a middling level of skillfulnessIn other words you might be skillful enough to have a good job a nice place to live a good family life  in other words ordinary mundane wellbeing  and a lot of people get satisfied right thereOr you might get satisfied with a nice state of concentrationYou might be able to get the mind centered pretty much at will things dont disturb you too muchA lot of people stop right there  its good enough for themThis is where the teachings on the three characteristics kick in in judging the results of your actions Are they really satisfactoryDo they give permanent constantly dependable results Well noIf they dont then youre setting yourself up for stress suffering disappointmentYoure setting yourself to latch onto things that arent totally under your controlIn other words theyre not yoursYou cant say Okay body dont get oldGo back and get younger the way you were say five or ten years ago You cant tell your painful feelings to turn into pleasureYou cant arrange for only good and useful thoughts to come into your mindThe purpose of the three characteristics is to keep you from getting complacentThey help foster heedfulness so that your standards for judging your actions stay highIn judging the results of your actions youre not going to settle for anything that falls under the three characteristicsYoull keeping trying to become more skillful in your actions until you gain results that arent inconstant or stressful results where self and notself dont applyIn modern culture its considered psychologically unhealthy to set very high standards for yourselfWhat does that doIt creates a society of very middling people mediocre people people who experience a mediocre level of happinessThe Buddha though was very demanding first with himself and then with his followersHe said Dont satisfy yourself with just ordinary everyday wellbeing because its not well all the timeWhen set your sights set them on something of more permanent value what he called the noble search the search for what doesnt age doesnt grow ill doesnt die for a happiness that doesnt changeSo the three characteristics in and of themselves are not the totality of Buddhist wisdom Buddhist discernmentThey have to be placed in context the context of the question of skillfulness What are you doingWhat are your intentionsWhat are the results of your actions based on those intentionsAre you content with them or do you want better The three characteristics spur you on to be more demanding of yourself saying I want better than thisIve got this human life what can I do to get the most out of it And the answer should be Im going to do the best I can to find true happiness something dependable something to show for all the suffering Ive been through as I take birth age grow ill and dieSo we should think about these issues as we meditateWere not getting into the present moment just to stop thereThat would be like someone who after wading through a dense jungle finally gets to a road  and then lies down on the road forgetting that the road is there to be followed to see where it leads youWhen you get into the present moment thats not enoughYou have to learn how to ask yourself the right questions about the present moment in particular What are your intentions right now and what results do they haveWhere are they going to take youIntentions just dont float in and out of the mind without leaving a traceThey leave their markThey do have resultsAre you satisfied with the resultsIf not what can you do to get better resultsLearning how to ask these questions the Buddha said is what gives rise to discernment so that your actions go beyond just the ordinary mundane levelAs he pointed out there are four kinds of action actions that are skillful on a mundane level actions that are not skillful on the mundane level actions that are mixed and then actions that take you beyond the mundane level that open you up to the Deathless and bring you to the end of actionThat fourth kind of action is what he says is really worthwhileThats whats special about his teachingThats whats distinctive about his teachingHe discovered that the principles of causality work in such a way that you can bring yourself to the Uncaused by being as skillful as possible in what you doAnd the discernment that shows you how to act in those ways that detects what in your intentions is skillful and whats unskillful what in the results of your actions are satisfactory or not Thats what guides you in the right directionYou take your desire for happiness and you take it seriouslyIts not that the Buddha condemns all cravingTheres a passage where he says There is a kind of craving that has good results  the craving that leads you away from repeatedly wandering on the desire to get out of this wandering to discontinue this wandering So you take that desire  which is what the expression of metta is all about the desire for happiness both for yourself and other people  and you add to it the conviction that you can do things that lead to happinessYou take that desire you take that conviction you put them together with a good dash of heedfulness and then you try to watch as skillfully as you can to see what youre doingMonitor the results of your practice and adjust them as necessaryThese factors all taken together are the recipe for the discernment that leads to releaseTheres no one technique that can guarantee that youll gain discernment just as theres no one technique that has a monopoly on giving rise to discernmentThe techniques are things that you use in your quest for discernment but your quest has to be informed by more than techniquesIt has to be informed by the right questions by the right qualities of mind by the rigor you bring to your attention to what youre doing by your willingness to set the highest possible standards for yourself your unwillingness to settle for a happiness that falls under the three characteristicsThats how liberating discernment comes aboutA friend of mine once wrote a novel about a storytelling contest between the gods of the Taoist heavenIn the course of the novel you read about the gods conducting their story contest  its the male gods lined up against the female gods but there are traitors on both sides  and you also read the story they invent alternating from one side to the nextThe storys full of all kinds of suffering A young woman gets sold as a slave to get her parents out of debt her new master is a good person but he dies off pretty quickly hes got an evil brother and all kinds of horrible things happen there are floods fires suicides lots of injustice  what makes for a great story but a miserable lifeAnd then at the very end of the novel Kuan Yin appears and tells the Taoist gods Well now that youve told this story youre going to have to go down there and live it The last image in the novel is of the Taoist gods all tumbling out of heaven down to the earth theyve despised so much belowOf course Kuan Yin here represents what Buddhism did to China It brought in the teaching on kammaWere creating our livesAnd even when the mind seems to be simply spinning its wheels its not just idly spinning its wheelsIts creating new states of being new possibilities  some of which are good some of which are not so goodYou have to keep that principle always in mind as youre meditatingYoure not simply here innocently watching whats going on without any responsibility for what youre experiencingYoure responsible for your experiences  through your actions in the past and in the present momentOn the one hand this sounds a little onerous because nobody likes to take responsibilityOn the other hand though its empoweringIf you dont like the present moment you can create a new present moment because the opportunities to do so are endlessWere not just consumers of experiencesWere also producersWe have to keep this principle in mind as we go through the practiceOur training in the precepts reminds us that we shape our life by the choices we make in what we say and doOur training in concentration teaches us that how we approach the present moment is going to make a big difference in how the moment is experiencedYou can develop skill in the way you focus on the breath the way you adjust the breath the way you develop sensitivity to whats going on in the bodyThese are all things you do as a producer of experiences and you can learn to do them more and more skillfully to create a sense of wellbeing in the present momentEven when theres pain in the body even when there are other difficult issues in life you can create a still center for yourselfYou dont have to be a victim of what comes in from outsideYou dont have to be a victim of whatever comes welling up from within the mindYou have a role right here right now in shaping things and  as you develop more mindfulness develop more alertness as your powers of concentration get more and more solid  you have the tools you need to make that present experience a lot more livableThe same principle holds true as we try to develop discernmentWere often told that discernment consists of seeing things as inconstant and because theyre inconstant theyre stressful and because theyre stressful theyre notselfNow most of us in the West are used to consuming our experiencesWe dont buy a Ford ExplorerWe buy the Ford Explorer experienceWe go to Yosemite for the Yosemite experienceIf we take the Buddhas teachings on discernment out of context and put them in our normal consuming mode what do they seem to sayThey seem to say Life is shortExperiences are fleetingGrab as much pleasure as you can And since you cant hold onto things for too long before they change you have to try to embrace them appreciate them squeeze as much as you can out of your experiences and then be quick to let go before they start falling apartBut thats okay because other experiences will come along so that you never run out of things to embraceIn other words the teaching seems to be telling us how to be expert connoisseurs in consuming our experiencesTaking the teachings out of context leads to other misunderstandings as wellYou begin to think If everythings impermanent why spend all this time trying to develop concentrationIts all going to end someday anyhowWhy try to develop good qualities in the mindTheyll all come to nothing eventuallyWhy dont we just accept what weve got and learn to enjoy that But thats taking the teachings out of contextWhen the Buddha taught the teachings of discernment he started with questions of Whats skillfulWhats unskillfulWhat can I do that will lead to longterm happiness This is the first set of questions youre supposed to ask to develop discernmentIf you look at your normal patterns of consumption you begin to realize that a lot of them are very unskillful They lead to only shortterm types of happinessAnd you realize its not just the consumption but its also what you do to produce these experiences thats unskillfulYou find yourself acting on greed anger passion fear just to get the experiences you wantSo to get out of that pattern you want to develop the skills that will make your happiness more solid longer lasting less likely to turn on you and eat you upThis is the type of discernment that underlies development in terms of virtue and concentrationYou refrain from the activities that would lead to instant gratification but longterm regret longterm remorseYou develop qualities of mind that create a sense of greater wellbeing that doesnt have to depend on outside stimuli that can stand up against any kind of outside situationOnce youve developed these qualities you take the process of discernment a little bit deeperUse that principle of inconstancy to ask Is there anything thats not inconstantDo I have to keep on producing producing producing for the rest of eternityIsnt there a type of happiness that doesnt require that So you turn and look more carefully at the type of happiness youre creatingThen you run into the question of Whos consuming thisWhat is this consumerWhat is this producer You begin to see that the consumer is also made up of khandhas youve producedAnd this insight makes the whole process seem even more futileWhy would you want to get involved in this process  creating experiences for experiences to enjoyFrom this point of view even longterm happiness isnt good enoughYour powers of sensitivity have been sharpenedYour insight into the process of production and consumption has gotten sharper as wellAnd when you finally reach the point where you see that its not necessary you let goIf you were only a consumer itd be easy enough to continue enjoying things that are inconstant as long as youve learned to mind your manners in how you embrace things  hugging without grabbing  but as a producer there comes a point when you get tired of producingYouve had enoughYou see that all the effort going into producing is simply not worth itThats the insight that allows you to drop things that allows you to let goAnd its in that context that the teachings on the three characteristics have their true meaning play their true roleLike the storytellers in the novel we have to be careful about what were creating because were going to have to live in what we createKeep asking yourself Is this good enoughAm I satisfied with what Im creating  because its not an easy task to stop creatingIf it were easy we wouldnt have to sit here and meditate so hardIts difficult and whether we like what were creating or not we keep on creatingThats the problemSo as long as youre going to create try to create as good a world for yourself as you can as good a world for the people around you as you can until youve developed the qualities where you can look into this worldproduction activity in your mind this factory that keeps churning things out momentbymomentbymoment to see if you can take it apartIt sounds a little scary but then the Buddha promises that once you take these things apart there comes a happiness that nothing that youve created can ever compare toThis promise together with the reality of that uncreated unfabricated level of happiness thats what makes all this work were doing here more than worthwhileThey tell us that the heart of the Buddhas Awakening was discovering the principle of causality how cause and effect work to shape your experienceIt sounds pretty abstract but its actually directly related to what youre experiencing right nowIn other words theres the result of past kamma theres your present kamma and theres the result of present kammaThose are the three things youre experiencing at any given momentOf course when we start out it all tends to be mixed togetherIts just experienceWe dont see these patterns we dont see the component factors as separate and distinct so things seem pretty randomBut if you learn how to look at what youre doing right now you come to see that youre not totally passiveThe things youre experiencing are not just coming in at youTheres an active side to the mind that goes out and shapes them adds a little here takes away a little bit thereYoure getting sensitive to that aspect of the mind to what youre doing right nowThats a large part of the insight you need to gain in the meditationMost of us are like a man who goes storming into a room acting in an offensive way and then later complains The people in the room seemed awfully defensive awfully unfriendly  as if he didnt have any impact on the atmosphere of the room through his actions through the way he entered the roomSo how are you storming into the present momentOne way to find out is by checking on the breathExactly what are you doing with the breath right nowIs the breathing a totally passive automatic process or are you doing something to the breathIs there some level of the mind thats making decisionsOne way to find out is to make conscious decisions about the breath nudging it a little bit here a little bit thereWere not talking about making huge differences in the breath just making gradual changes in whichever direction seems most comfortableAs you do this you begin to realize that your present experience of pleasure or pain depends on decisions youre making right nowYou begin to get more sensitive to what the mind is doing particularly in terms of its perceptions and thoughtfabrications and how these relate to your feelingsPerceptions are the labels you put on thingsFor example you may experience the body as something solid breathing in and breathing outWell you can change that perceptionSee everything you sense in the body right now as an aspect of the breath propertyLook at it that way every sensation as a type of breath sensationSee what that does to your sensation of the body the way you relate to it the way you evaluate it the way you breatheAnd then your thoughtfabrications Use them to ask questionsHow about breathing this wayHow about breathing that wayAnd so you give it a tryAs you do this you get a greater and greater sense of how much you really are shaping your present experienceThen you can take this insight and apply it to issues of pain both physical pain and mental painMost of us tend to think of ourselves as passive recipients victims of a particular pain attacking usThere doesnt seem much we can do about itThats because we have a habitual way of reacting to painUnless we can change that habit were not going to see much improvement in the issue of why were suffering of how we sufferBut if you really look at a physical pain you realize that while part of it comes from something wrong with the body another part comes from what the mind is doing to manage the experience of pain the way it paints a mental picture of the pain the way it latches onto that mental picture what its doing to maintain the pain in a particular way or to move it in a particular directionThats going on all the time yet were not really aware of how much were contributing to our own painThats the big issueThats the first noble truth the pain were creating through our clinging craving and ignoranceTo see these things you have to be very very sensitive to the present moment and very sensitive to what your input isThis is why concentration is so important getting the mind really still so that it can see these things very preciselyFor instance when pain arises we tend to miss the fact that the mind is constantly labeling it Pain pain pain pain pain And in addition to the label of pain we sometimes paint a picture of it to ourselvesThat act of labeling if theres clinging along with it contributes to the painAnd when you get really sensitive to the movements of the mind  and this requires getting the breath really still so that its not interfering with what youre seeing  you see that theres a constant repetition going on in the mindSometimes the labeling the clinging and the repetition are so insistent that the physical cause of the pain has long since goneThe act of clinging is the actual pain youre experiencing nowSo when you learn how to see Oh theres that mental label going again there it goes again there it goes again Can you stop itSee what happens when you stop it when you just drop itYoull find that your experience of the pain changesThats when you gain insight into the issue of what youre doing in the present moment how you contribute to the shape of your experienceThats a lot of the meditation right there  just sensitizing the mind to what its doingMost often thats our big blind spot what were doing right nowWere so conscious of what other people are doing  They did this to me they did that to me  but were not looking at what were doing which is why what theyre doing causes us painMany times you cant avoid whats coming at you from the outside  its past kamma  but you can avoid the unskillful ways youre reacting to itSometimes you find that the way youre reacting to the situation feeds back into the situation influencing what those other people are doing and making the situation worseBut even when thats not the case you find that your suffering really comes from the way you relate to the outside situationThats what the first noble truth is all about clinging to the five aggregates clinging to the form of the body clinging to your feelings perceptions thoughtfabrications or consciousnessWhen you stop clinging to these aggregates then even though theyre still impermanent and there still may be some stress in them it doesnt weigh on the mindThe bridge has been cut so that it doesnt connectYou stop lifting things up as in Ajaan Suwats image The mountain may be heavy in and of itself but if youre not trying to lift it up then its not heavy for youSo youve got to see where youre doing your heavy lifting and then try to understand whyOnly when you understand why youre doing things can you really stopSometimes in the course of a meditation you can force yourself to stop but if theres no real understanding then as soon as the mind gets back to its old ways it goes lifting things picking them up carrying them around againBut if you look into why youre lifting these things what misunderstandings lie behind what youre doing why you feel that you have to carry these things around Thats a lot of the insight right thereIts an old habit the way the mind contributes to things in the present moment particularly the ways it causes itself unnecessary sufferingWe think that an undercurrent of suffering is a necessary part of experience but its notWhen you see it as stress when you see it as a burden and you realize that its not necessary thats when you really let goSo check on exactly where your clinging is right now where youre contributing to unnecessary sufferingTry to make the mind as still as possible and then stay there to observe Is there still some stress hereIs there still a sense of burdensomeness hereWhat else is going along with thatCan you see any activity any intention thats going along with that stress And if you catch sight of that activity that intention you drop itIts almost invariably something you didnt realize you were doing something you were holding onto in the sense of repeating it mindlesslySometimes youre aware that youre holding onto the act of intention but you think youve got to hold on This is the core of my being this is who I am this is the way my mind has to work Well it doesnt have to work that wayLearn how to question those assumptionsLearn how to let go a little bitThis loosens things up in the mindThe things you never saw before now you suddenly seeThis burden you create for yourself is totally unnecessaryWhat you thought was necessary the way things had to be They dont have to be that way at allThats the whole message of the Buddhas Awakening the principle of causality weve been talking aboutHe applied it to see how the suffering the mind experiences in the present moment is not necessaryThats why the principle of causality was so importantHe realized the input he was putting into the present moment that was creating the suffering and he learned to stopAnd what happened when there was no input in the present momentAs we meditate we find that our input gets more and more and more subtleOftentimes were not even aware of any inputWe tell ourselves that were sitting here perfectly peaceful perfectly calm nothings going on but actually theres a lot going on in the mind that were missingIts in a blind spotWhen you begin to see that blind spot begin to let go of whats in there thats when things open up thats when the meditation can really start making a radical change in the mindA lot of the relationships in your mind  where you thought This is that way and thats this way  you begin to realize are not necessarily soAnd the realization that theyre not necessary Thats where the liberation liesSo a continuity runs throughout the whole process of meditation from the very beginningIf while youre sitting here the mind slips off just bring it right backIf it slips off again just bring it right back againEven this much can make you more conscious of what youre doing in the present momentYou get more conscious of how the mind has its blind spots and you learn to make them more and more and more subtle less dominant in the mindIn other words you try to cut through them as much as you canWhat happens of course is that they find more subtle ways to hide but at least you gain a measure of control over the mind and a greater sense of what youre doing in the present momentThats crucial to the meditationYou keep applying that principle to more subtle levels for the same principle holds all the way throughIts just that as you keep working on it it requires more precisionBut thats something you can developAfter all this is a skillThats another one of the Buddhas great discoveriesThe ability to learn the path to liberation is a skill you can master in the same way that you master other skills looking at the results of your actions reflecting back on what you did and trying to adjust things so that they keep getting more and more precise more and more subtle less burdensome to the mindAwakening isnt something that just drops on people without their being aware of what theyre doingIts not an accident or something that comes from outsideIt requires that you get really sensitive to this teaching on kamma I am the owner of my actions Youre acting right now so be very careful about what you do in the same way that youd be very careful about building a fire careful about sharpening a knife careful about all the other skills you need in lifeIts just that in dealing with the mind you need to be even more careful even more preciseIt requires more subtletyBut this simple process of just getting more skillful in how you relate to the present moment That can take you all the way to AwakeningAnd that right there is revolutionaryIn English we have a very limited vocabulary for describing how the body feels from the insideWe feel tingly or we feel heavy We have ants crawling on our skin or butterflies in our stomachsThere are not that many words and nothing really systematicThis is where the Buddhas teaching on the properties is helpfulIt provides a systematic way of categorizing the feelings you have in the body  how the body feels from the inside  along with a sense of what you can do with those feelingsThis teaching also gives you a very clear sense of how much your present input shapes the way you experience the body and an immediate very visceral way of using that present input to balance things out to make the body an easier place in which to settle downThe texts list the properties as six earth water wind fire space and consciousnessIt sounds like medieval chemistryWed do better though to look at these properties as ways of categorizing the sensations that make up the way the body feels from the insideThe earth sensations are feelings of heaviness or solidity water would be cool sensations fire is of course warm wind is the motion back and forth space is the feelings of emptiness and consciousness is the property thats aware of all these thingsThe theory behind these properties is that they get provokedIn other words as they get emphasized as some incident strengthens them or kicks them into action they get strongerOn the external level natural events occur when the external properties get provokedFloods come from the provocation of the water property huge fires or intense heat from the provocation of the fire property huge winds from the provocation of the wind propertyInterestingly the texts also attribute earthquakes to the wind propertyThis means that wind refers not only to the wind in the air but also to the motion down in the earthApparently earth was the only property that wasnt provokable on the external level at least but it would move when the wind property got into the actWhatever we may think of these concepts as ways of describing external events theyre a very useful way of looking at internal events at the experience of the body as sensed from withinClassically the internal properties are used to explain diseaseGiddiness or lightheadedness is a sign of too much wind property a sign that the wind property has been provokedWith fever of course the fire property has been provokedA feeling of lethargy or heaviness in your limbs is a sign of too much earth propertyThese are things you can play with in your meditationThats where the teaching really becomes useful because it allows you to see how the way you focus on the body has an impact on how you perceive the body how you actually sense the bodyWe think of sensations as being primary the raw material the basic building blocks of experience but there are conscious decisions being made that precede the sensationsLook at the teaching on dependent originationSankhara or fabrication is way down there prior to the sensations you feel in terms of form feeling and so forthSo how are you going to fabricate the bodyIf there are feelings of tension in the body sometimes thats a sign of too much earth property so you can think of the breathThis is one of the reasons we start with the breathIts the property thats most easily manipulated  classically its called the kayasankhara the factor that fashions the bodyIts also the property that most directly works through tensionWherever theres a sense of tension focus on it and see if you can get a sense of gentle healing motion going through itThe potential for motion is there simply that the perception contributing to the tension has blocked itSo you can consciously decide that youre going to perceive motion thereGive it a chance to happen and the potential for motion the potential for movement through that part of the nervous system will get strengthened will get aroused  which may be a better way of translating the word that I just translated as provoked The breathpotential gets arousedWhen your awareness of the breath is aroused or heightened it can move through that sense of blockageWhen youre feeling giddy or manic you can think of the earth property to settle things downIf theres just too much frenetic energy in the body you can think of your bones being made of iron of your hands and feet weighing a tonWherever you have a sense of solidity in the body focus on that and try to magnify itYou find that your choice of the image youre using your purpose in choosing it will really affect the way you start sensing that part of the bodyThen you can take that sensation and spread it out connecting it with other sensations of solidity in the bodyThe potential for solidity is always thereWhen youre feeling depressed and weighed down think of lighter sensations of the breath giving a lift to the different parts of the bodyWhen youre hot think of the water propertyFocus on whatever sensations in the body are cooler than the othersReally keep your focus right there and think water water or cool cool Youll find that other cool sensations in the body will appear to your awarenessThe potential for them was waiting simply that they needed the element of present intention to highlight themWhen youre feeling cold focus in on warmthThere will be some part of the body thats warmer than the others so focus in on itThink of the warmth staying there and spreading to other parts of the body where other warm sensations will get arousedYou can do this at any stage in the concentration although its most effective when the breath is stillAt that point the body feels like a cloud of mist little points of sensation and each little sensation has the potential to be any one of these four propertiesWhen your sense of the body is reduced to what the French would call pointillism its a lot easier simply with a thought to emphasize either the heaviness or the lightness the movement the warmth or the coolness of those sensations the sensationpotentials youve got thereThis way you accomplish two things at onceOn the one hand you balance out the bodyWhenever one type of sensation feels too oppressive you can think of the opposing sensation to balance it outOn the other you start seeing the role of present intention in your awareness in your experience of the present moment in a very visceral wayWhen things grow very still and balanced in terms of these four properties with this mist of potential sensations that can go in any direction you can also focus on the space between the pointsRealize that the space is boundlessIt goes through the body and out in all directionsJust think that infinite space Stay with the sensation of infinite space that comes along with the perceptionThe potential for it is always there its simply that the perception arouses itIts a very pleasant state to get inThings seem a lot less solid a lot less oppressiveYou dont feel so trapped in the bodyAjaan Fuang once had a student an old woman who started practicing meditation with him when he was getting ready to leave Wat AsokaramAfter he left she had to practice on her own for quite a whileOne evening when she was sitting in meditation with the group in the meditation hall a voice came to her and said Youre going to die tonight She was a little taken aback but then she reminded herself Well if Im going to die the best way is to die meditating So she just sat there and watched to see what would happen as the body dies to see what it would be likeThere was an actual sensation of the body beginning to fall apartAll of the various properties were going their separate ways she said like a house on fireThere was no place in the body where you could focus your awareness and have any sense of comfort at all So for a moment she felt lost but then she remembered Well theres the space property So she focused in on the space property and all that sense of the house on fire suddenly disappearedThere was a very strong sense of infinite spaceThere was always the potential to go back to the bodyWhen she came out of meditation of course she hadnt diedShe was still aliveBut she had learned an important lesson that when things get really bad in the body you can always go to spaceEven though its not Awakening and its not the unconditioned still its a lot better than being immersed in turmoil along with the properties in the bodySo the properties provide a useful way of looking at the potentials in the present momentThey also make it easier to get to that sense of awareness itself that you read about so much in the writings of the Thai AjaansOnce youre with infinite space drop the perception of space and see whats leftThere will just be a perception of knowing knowing knowing which takes its placeYou dont have to ask Knowing what Theres just awareness awareness or knowing knowingOnce youve got everything divided up into properties like this youve got the raw materials for gaining insightThe terms of analysis may initially seem strange but once you get a visceral sense of what theyre referring to youll find them extremely usefulThey not only give the mind a good place to settle down in the stillness of concentration but they also help you gain insight into the way perception shapes your experience of the body shapes your perception of whats going on here in the present moment seeing how fabricated it all isYouve got potentials coming in from past kamma but youve also got the element of present choice which becomes extremely clear when you analyze things in this wayWhen I first went to stay with Ajaan Fuang he had me memorize Ajaan Lees Divine Mantra six passages dealing with the different propertiesFor a long time it seemed very foreign to me until one night I was chanting the passage on the property of consciousness and I realized that it was referring to the awareness thats right hereThis awarenessRight hereWhen this realization hit it was as if a huge iceberg in my heart suddenly meltedI wasnt dealing with some outside foreign frame of thinking instead it was something extremely direct immediate right here and nowThat was when I began to get a sense of why Ajaan Fuang had asked me to memorize the chant why he wanted all of his students to think about their present experience in terms of the propertiesSo keep this mode of analysis in mindTry to get some sense of it as you put it to use and youll find that its extremely useful in the practiceAs with all of the Buddhas teachings the importance of the teaching is what you do with it and what it does for you in helping to gain insight into how stress and suffering are created in the present moment  and how you dont have to create them if you pay attention if you work at these skillsThe mind has a basic habit which is to create thingsIn fact when the Buddha describes causality how experiences come about he says that the power of creation or sankhara  the mental tendency to put things together  actually comes prior to our sensory experienceIts because the mind is active actively putting things together that it knows thingsThe problem is that most of its actions most of its creations come out of ignorance so the kind of knowledge that comes from those creations can be misleadingFor this reason what you want to do in the process of meditation is to back up to get down as close to this process of creation as you can to see if theres a way to do it skillfully that leads to knowledge that leads you to a point that breaks through ignoranceAnd that means instead of building up a lot of things you let things fall apart so you can get down to exactly where these basic forces in the mind are putting things togetherNow it so happens that when we bring the mind to the breath we have all these basic forces right here in their most elemental formsThe breath is the factor that fashions the bodyIts what they call kayasankhara or the physical puttingtogether The breath is what puts life together in the bodyIf it werent for the breath here things would start falling apart really fastThen theres verbal fabrication vacisankhara the act of putting things in wordsThe two basic verbal sankharas are directed thought and evaluationAnd youve got those right here tooYou direct your thoughts to the breath and then evaluate the breath How does the breath feelDoes it feel goodIf it does stay with itIf it doesnt feel good you can change itThis is about the most basic level of conversation you can have with yourselfDoes this feel good or notComfortable or notYesNoAnd then you work with thatWhat are you working withYoure working with mental fabrication cittasankhara which covers feeling and perception feelings of pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor painAnd then perceptions are the labels the mind gives to things This is pleasantThis is painfulThis is this and that is thatWhen youve got the mind with the breath youve got all of these things brought together the feelings that come with the breath the perceptions that label the breath Now the breath is coming inNow the breath is going outNow the mind is like thisNow its like that The directed thought and the evaluation are there as well keeping you focused on the breath and on evaluating the breathSo these things are all togetherIf you stray away from here youre usually straying away into distraction into the realm of further elaboration in which you lose this basic frame of reference and create a whole other oneIts what they call becoming in the texts when you create other worlds in the mindOnce you get into those other worlds you lose touch with the process of creationYou lose touch with how becoming is brought togetherSo youve got to learn how to take those worlds of distraction  and the processes that form them  apartThe Buddha talks about various ways of dealing with distractionOnce youve realized youve left your original frame of reference you bring yourself backIn other words you remind yourselfIn some cases the simple act of reminding is enough to disperse that other little world youve created for yourself and come back to this oneOther times you have to reflect actively on the drawbacks of that other world of the thinking that creates it especially if its thinking imbued with lust aversion delusion or harmfulnessYouve got to remind yourself What would happen if I thought about this for a while Well youd create certain habits in the mind and once those habits are imbedded in the mind they lead to actions that can create all kinds of problemsWhen you see the drawbacks of that kind of thinking you say I dont need thatIve had enough of that in my life You drop it and come back to the breathOther times you can consciously ignore the distractionA little world appears in your mind and you say I dont want to enter into that but for some reason it just doesnt go awayYou realize the reason its not going away is because youre paying attention to itEven if you dont like it paying attention to it is enough to keep it going  like a tar trapYou touch the tar with your hand and you get stuckYou try to pull yourself loose from the tar with the other hand and you get both hands stuckPull yourself off with your foot your foot gets stuckBite the tar your mouth gets stuckSo the only way to deal with it is to not touch itIn other words dont pay attention to itYou know its there but you just dont give it any mindAfter a while from lack of attention itll die awayA fourth way of pulling yourself back is to notice that when theres this process of creation when there are these little worlds you create in your mind an element of tension goes with themThings would be a lot easier if you didnt create these worlds if youd just relax whatever physical and mental tension supports these thingsSo look for the tensionOnce you can locate it just relax itWhen you relax the tension the thought goes awayA fifth way when none of these other methods work is to tell yourself Okay Im going to clench my teeth press my tongue against the palate and I will not think about that other thing In other words just through the force of your will you force it out of your mindThis is the method of last resort the one thats the least precise and works only as long as your will power lastsBut sometimes its the only thing that will clear the airIf we were to compare these various methods to tools this would be the sledgehammerIt may be crude but you need one in your arsenal for cases when scalpels and Exacto knives cant handle the jobSo when one of these other little worlds gets created in your mind you use whichever of these methods work to let go of it and bring yourself back to the most basic levels of the process of creation the breath directed thought evaluation feelings perceptionsStay right on this levelWhat do you do with them on this levelWell you can create levels of concentration in the mindConcentration is a kind of creation but its a creation that instead of obscuring the process of whats going on in the mind actually makes it clearerYou create but without leaving these basic levels of your frame of referenceIn other words you put them to use in a new wayYou put feelings to use in a new wayYou learn how to create a feeling of pleasure from the breath so that the pleasure gets more and more intense more and more solidJust the act of sitting here breathing gets really refreshingAnd if you stay with the feeling as a feeling in and of itself it doesnt pull you off into other mental worldsYou stay right hereIt feels good right hereSo instead of feeding on the pleasure in an aimless way you do it in a systematic wayThat way you can keep the mind with a sense of pleasure a sense of rapture and it doesnt wander offThats what the concentration is all aboutAs it strengthens the mind it gives direction to the mindIt takes the desire for pleasure and puts it to good useOnce the mind feels comfortable in the present moment its not going to wander off anyplace elseIt feels good right hereA lot more satisfaction comes from the sense of ease right here than from the little bits and pieces of satisfaction coming from the other worlds you can create with your mindAgain this is a process of creation but its a lot more skillful than normalIt keeps things on a basic level where youre in touch with the processYou dont lose sight of itIts like the difference between sitting out in an audience watching a play and being behind the stageBehind the stage you see the actual play but you also see what goes on behind itIn that way youre a lot less likely to get carried away by the illusion of the playNow of course pain is going to come into your meditation as wellSometimes its outandout painOther times its more subtleAnd again as with the pleasure instead of thinking that youre on the receiving end of the pain a victim of the pain you start putting it to useThe pain is there for you to comprehendThats what the Buddha said in his teachings on the four noble truths The task with regard to pain is to comprehend itOnce the mind is solid enough and stable enough so as not to feel threatened by the pain it can analyze the pain on whatever level it may be searing pain or more subtle stressAs you comprehend the pain you start finding that you understand the mind a lot better tooAll the little animals in the mind that tend to gather around pain You begin to notice who they are what they are and you realize Thats not meIts just these thoughts that tend to cluster around pain If you want to identify with them you can but theyre going to turn your mind into a menagerieTheyre going to create a lot of turmoilAnd so you learn how to let them goEven when youre focused on the pleasant levels of concentration youll find that as you get more and more sensitive toward these various levels a subtle element of stress accompanies each one of themOnce you identify where that stress is you let it goThat takes you to a more subtle level of concentrationYou stay there for a whileIn the beginning you dont notice the stress in the new levelIts like going into a bright room where your eyes havent yet adjusted to the lightAt first you see nothing but the dazzleBut if you stay there for long enough your eyes begin to adjust and you begin to notice Oh there are shapes there are forms there are things in this room that you can seeIts the same as you go from one level of concentration to the nextTake the stress of directed thought and evaluation for instanceOnce the breath really feels full really feels satisfying you dont need to keep evaluating itYou dont have to keep reminding yourself to stay with itYoure just there there there there there with a basic perceptionYou let go of the directed thought and evaluation and Bong  you come down to a much deeper levelYou go through this step by stepYou realize what an important role perceptions play in this the labels you put on thingsYoure constantly labeling the breathWhen the breath is still so that you can drop that label you begin to label the sense of space thats left then the sense of knowing thats left as you drop the label for space then all the way up to the sphere of nothingnessThats still called a perception attainmentIts based on the label that the mind puts on the experience that keeps you thereSo again youre with these very basic basic levels of creation in the mindWhen you start taking them apart thats when things really get interestingInstead of building building building up youre letting go letting go letting go bit by bit by bitAnd then of course youre getting attached to the new level you reach but its a good attachmentOtherwise youd go floating off to other worldsThis attachment here at least keeps you in the present moment where things can begin to open upAnd instead of elaborating on it you keep applying the teachings of the four noble truths and keep the questions basic Where is the stress hereThis is especially important when you get to the level of infinitude of consciousness or the infinitude of spaceOn those levels its easy to develop a sense that youve reached the ground of being from which all things come and to which all things returnIf youre not careful you can really start philosophizing on this theme elaborating on it getting into all kinds of abstractions about the relationship between the absolute and the relative emanation  all sorts of big buzzword issuesBut theyre totally irrelevant to the real problem in the mind  that theres still stress hereIf youre still stuck here you havent gone beyond you havent reached the DeathlessYouve got to keep asking that same old basic question Where is there stress here Look for itSee what youre doing that keeps the stress going see that its unnecessary and then let goUltimately you open up to something totally unfabricatedSo instead of building things up that pull you away from the present you start by building up states of concentration in the mindThese are types of fabrication of course but theyre the type of fabrication that keeps you within this frame of reference the very absolute presentThey dont distract you into other levels where you lose touch with the basic building blocks in the process of fabricationThis is a basic pattern throughout the Buddhas teachings Before you let go of things you first have to learn to do them skillfully mindfully with awarenessThe doing the mastering of the skill is what enables you to know themThis brings us back to that basic principle we talked about earlier We wouldnt know anything there would be no awareness at all if there werent any doing in the mindYou have to learn how to do things more and more skillfully until finally you can get to a level where the mind becomes too sensitive to do anythingAnd at that point it opens up to a totally different kind of awarenessSo you make use of what youve gotThe Buddha noticed that all things fabricated have an element of stressBut what are you going to doHow are you going to get to the unfabricatedYou cant use the unfabricated as a tool because that would be fabricating it and thats not its natureYou learn how to use the process of fabrication in a more skillful wayYou divide things up into the four noble truthsTheres stress the origination of stress the cessation of stress and the pathThe path is a process of taking things that are stressful  these perceptions these feelings these processes of creation  and using them in a skillful waySo you use fabrication to undo fabrication and then finally reach a point where everything opens up to the unfabricatedIts an extremely skillful path a skillful approachIt takes the raw materials that weve got around us all the time  the activities that we ordinarily use to create experience  and teaches us how to use them in a more skillful wayGetting down to basicsKeeping away from abstractionsOnce theres an abstraction in the mind theres a new level of being in there a new frame of reference it pulls you away from the presentA lot of selfdelusion comes through abstractionA lot of opportunity for lying to yourself comes through abstractionSo we keep things basicWe keep our nose to the groundJust look at the basic things we have physical verbal and mental fabricationLearn how to put them to the proper useUse them more and more skillfullyGet more and more in touch with the actual process of fabrication right here in the present momentThats where things open upOur practice requires a lot of letting goWe prefer to think that it involves letting go of things that we dont like while allowing us to hold onto the things we do like but actually it requires a lot more lettinggo than thatSeveral years back I was leading a daylong discussion on the four noble truthsWhen we got to the third noble truth the cessation of suffering the passages we were discussing contained descriptions of nibbana and the general consensus in the group was that they didnt like the sound of itIt seemed too alien too foreign to be really appealingThen we got to the fourth noble truth and we started talking about right concentrationThat sounded very appealing rapture and pleasure permeating the entire bodyThose were things you really could get your mind aroundThey sounded compellingAnd thats the way it is with the practice You have to develop the fourth noble truth the path of practice before you can appreciate the thirdYou have to hold onto right concentration before you can let go into the DeathlessThe Buddhas strategy in teaching us to let go is to give us better and better things to hold ontoFor example he gets you to hold onto states of good concentrationThen when you turn around and look at things that would normally incite your lust your anger your desire or passion you realize that theyre not worth itYoud much rather hold onto the stillness the state of satisfaction the state of wellbeing that comes with your concentrationSo you burn your bridges behind you and hold onto concentration as your only true happiness in lifeOnly then when the Buddha has you cornered like that does he have you think of the drawbacks not only of the things youve already left behind but also of the concentration youre holding toOnly when you see the drawbacks of concentration can you realize that the only alternative is the DeathlessThe only thing that would really appeal to you at that point is the DeathlessThats when the door opensAs the texts say the first stage in insight is to focus on the drawbacks of anything thats fabricatedThe next stage is for the mind to incline to the DeathlessNormally the mind will not incline to the Deathless unless it feels that thats the only way outOtherwise its always going to find some other place to go some other corner to hide inSo you need to remember that the teachings on say the three characteristics  inconstancy stress and notself  are part of a course of training and that the different teachings make sense only in particular stages of the trainingOnly when youre in the right stage for a particular teaching will it do its intended workOrdinarily wed like to leapfrog over the concentration to get to the discernment because were very busy people after allWeve got a lot to do in our lives so we want to get to the main point of this Buddhism thing and then go on to something elseBut thats not how the practice worksYou have to put your mind in particular states you have to get attached to particular states before the teachings can function in the way theyre supposed toIf you think about the inconstancy stress and notselfness of things youre not attached to it doesnt really make an impactOr if you tell yourself that everything is inconstant stressful and notself before the mind has a safe place to settle down those thoughts can be really unsettling and disorientingOnly when youre in a relatively stable place mentally and ready to look for a way out from even the subtle instability there will those thoughts provide the way outYears back I was flying on an airplane where they showed the movie Close Encounters of the Third KindI didnt have the soundtrack to go by but even without paying much attention I found the story pretty easy to figure outThe hero had a miserable family life and so when the opportunity came to step onto that humongous flying saucer and go off whoknowswhere he was willing to goNow if he had had a happy family life a satisfactory family life he wouldnt have goneHe would have been happy to stay home and the prospect of going off with these weird creatures from outer space would have been too dauntingBut the fact that his life was so miserable made him willing to take the leapIn that case the leap was pretty strangeAnd fortunately the Buddha doesnt ask us to be miserable before we leap to nibbana but he does recommend that we develop a sense of disenchantment  nibbida  and that we do it skillfullyHe teaches us to get attached to more and more refined states of wellbeing in the mind and to become disenchanted with everything elseIts like climbing a ladderTo climb up the rungs of the ladder you already have to be holding onto a higher rung before you can let go of a lower oneFinally when you get to the top of the ladder when theres nothing higher to hold onto nowhere else to go Thats when you get off onto the roof or wherever youre headedThats when you can totally let goIn the meantime youve got to hold onThe same principle holds true in the practice You let go of lower attachments only when youve got something higher to hold ontoSo when youre practicing concentration dont be afraid of being attached to itIn fact you should get attached hereThats part of the whole dynamic of the practiceAllow yourself to be attached to the breath get to play with the breath make the breath a really comfortable good place to stayAs the breath gets more refined you find that the mind goes through more refined stagesThe two help each other alongThe greater the refinement of the mind the more refined the breath and vice versa back and forthAnd you find that your concentration does go through clearly discernable levelsBut again dont be afraid of getting attached to themThe whole point is to want to be there to want to develop the mastery that allows you to bring the mind to those levels whenever you need them and to stay centered in them as long as you likeThis is why the Buddha  unlike a lot of modern teachers  never warned his students against getting attached to jhanaIn fact his instructions when he sent them off to meditate were always very clear Go do jhana And he wanted them to master itAjaan Fuang once said you have to be crazy about the meditation in order to be really good at itIn the course of the day whatever spare minute you can find to keep your mind on the breath you want your mind to head there again and againIts almost as if you were addicted to itThey say that when alcoholics go into a house one of the first things they pick up on is where the alcohol is keptTheyre very conscious of thatTheir minds incline in that direction so that without even thinking they can detect the signsWell you want to be a breathaholicWherever theres breath you want your mind to head thereOf course you find that its everywhere if youre really interested if you really want to pursue itAgain it doesnt matter that youre attached to itThere are ways of ultimately prying you loose from that attachmentIn the meantime its a good place to be attached states of concentration states of wellbeing in the mind that dont have to depend on circumstances outsideThats a lot better than being attached to the sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas were normally attached toSo allow yourself to cling hereIts like the cages where they put birdsIf you happen to open the door while the bird is clinging to the door the bird can get outThats what these states of concentration are Theyre doors to the DeathlessWhen we say that the Buddha has you cornered hes got you cornered right here at the doorIf you hang on here youll eventually be able to open the latch and youll be freeBut if youre not here if youre over hanging on the walls then its very easy for the person opening the cage to keep you inClinging to the walls doesnt get you freeIn other words you might think that youd like to put an end to all your suffering but if youre not really in the right place its not a doorYou keep banging your head against the walls of the cageBut if you learn to hold onto these states of concentration the time will come when they turn into doorsYoull develop a sense of dispassion not only for ordinary pleasures but also for the peace you gain from states of concentrationYoull begin to see that no matter how good you are at the concentration there will always be change inconstancy in that concentrationAnd the time will come when the mind is simply fed up with thatIts had enoughThats nibbida disenchantmentYoure no longer enchanted with the concentrationYou use it but it doesnt have the same pull it had beforeYou want something betterThats when the mind can really incline to the DeathlessAs I told the people in that discussion group the third noble truth may not sound attractive now but as you get into the fourth noble truth and develop these states of concentration you realize that the third noble truth really is betterIt may not sound better in words but when youre disenchanted with the fourth noble truth you see that the third truth is the only direction where true happiness liesUltimately the mind will lean there will incline itself there because its in a position to appreciate it for what it isSo if you want to know what the Buddha was talking about and see if it really is something better than what were experiencing now this is what you work at these stages of concentrationDirect the mind to the breath evaluating the breath really coming to appreciate what it is to be settled down really coming to appreciate the state of stillness and not chasing after things that keep running away from you through your sensesCome to appreciate the sense of stillness you can gain with the breathWhen you appreciate this youll be in a position to appreciate things that are even better  so that when you incline to something better you find that youre actually right at the door of the cageYou can flyThe daily schedule at Metta Forest Monastery includes a group interview in the late afternoon and a chanting session followed by a group meditation period later in the eveningThe Dhamma talks included in this volume were given during the evening meditation sessions and in many cases covered issues raised at the interviews  either in the questions asked or lurking behind the questionsOften these issues touched on a variety of topics on a variety of different levels in the practiceThis explains the range of topics covered in individual talksI have edited the talks with an eye to making them readable while at the same time trying to preserve some of the flavor of the spoken wordIn a few instances I have added passages or rearranged the talks to make the treatment of specific topics more coherent and complete but for the most part I have kept the editing to a minimumDont expect polished essaysThe people listening to these talks were familiar with the meditation instructions included in Method  in Keeping the Breath in Mind by Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo and my own essay A Guided Meditation If you are not familiar with these instructions you might want to read through them before reading the talks in this bookAlso further Dhamma talks are available at dhammatalksorgAs with the previous volumes in this series I would like to thank Bok Lim Kim for making the recording of these talks possibleShe more than anyone else is responsible for overcoming my initial reluctance to have the talks recordedI would also like to thank the following people for transcribing the talks andor helping to edit the transcriptions John Bullitt Richard Heiman Walter Schwidetzky Craig Swogger Jane Yudelman Balaggo Bhikkhu Gunaddho Bhikkhu Khematto Bhikkhu and Susuddho BhikkhuMay they all be happyIf our education system were really designed for people the core curriculum would teach how to live how to die  how to deal with the big issues in life pain aging illness death separation  because those are the things that plague peopleThe skills for dealing with them are the most important skills people can develop in lifeBut one of the problems with our society is that everything is geared toward the economyLaws are struck down because theyre not good for the economy  at least for this quarters profit marginEducational systems are designed to fit us each into our slot in the economyThe skills we learn center on how to function economicallyThen when we get too old to function they put us out to pasture and were pretty much left to our own devicesAnd many of the skills we learned in order to be good members of the economy  good producers good consumers  are actually bad for us as we get olderThis producing and consuming self we have is an especially big problemSo as we come here to meditate  which is practice in learning how to live and how to die  this producing and consuming self is one of the big issues we have to face downWhat does it consumeFeelings of pleasure and feelings of painIt tries to produce more and more pleasure but often ends up producing more and more painWhen you look at your sense of who you are it comes down to these two things the producer and the consumerThese are the habits you have to observeWhen you meditate the first thing you learn is how to produce pleasure in the present moment  not for the sake of the pleasure in and of itself but to use it as a strategyOften we regard pleasure as an end in and of itself but the Buddha says NoYou use pleasure and pain  both of them  as means to a higher endHow do you use pleasureFocus on the breath right now and see how it feelsThen experiment with the breath to see how the way you breathe can produce either pleasure or painIt may be subtle  the difference between the two  but its thereWeve learned to desensitize ourselves to this aspect of our awareness so its going to take a while to resensitize ourselves to begin seeing the patternsThis is why we practiceKeep coming back to the breath coming back to the breathTry to get more sensitive to this area of your awareness more skilled at learning how to maximize the potential for pleasure right here and now simply by the way you breathe  not only producing pleasure but also maintaining itAfter all feelings of pleasure and rapture are part of the pathTheyre tucked in the noble eightfold path under Right ConcentrationAnd as part of the path they have to be developed and maintainedAs the Buddha said this pleasure is blamelessIts also useful because you can use it to examine any pain that may be in other parts of the bodyWhen you sit here its sometimes difficult to get the whole body saturated in pleasureThere may be parts that you cant make pleasurable so as Ajaan Lee says dont lie down thereIts like knowing that there are rotten floorboards in your houseIf you try to lie down on the rotten part of the floor youre going to fall through to the basementSo lie down where the boards are soundAs the pleasure youre relying on gets more and more solid youve got a good vantage point for looking at painAnd hopefully by now the meditation has taught you to be inquisitive Youve been learning about the breath about the parts of the body that you can adjust to your liking so how about these other parts that you cant adjust as you likeWhats going on thereIs the problem related to the breath energyThats one way you can deal with itThink of breathing through the painSee what that doesOr you can notice how you label the painThere may be a mental image to go along with itTry dropping the image or changing the image and see whats leftIn other words develop an inquisitive attitude toward painPut yourself in a position where you dont feel threatened by pain so that you can probe the pain and ask questions watch and observe and learn about itGet so that pain holds no mysteries for you holds no fear because you understand not only the sensation of pain but also how the mind can latch onto it and create problems around itThen you learn to abstain from those ways of latching onIts like knowing that when you stick your finger into a flame its going to burn so you stop sticking your fingers into flamesAs you learn to abstain from unskillful ways of thinking about pain you learn more and more about the mind more and more about ways of not getting yourself involved in sufferingYou start out with little tiny pains little tiny disturbances but once youve figured them out you get more interested How about the bigger onesThis is one of the most important parts of the practice this willingness to rise to a challenge this courage thats not overwhelmed by thingsYouve seen people who suffer in their lives and all they can think about is This isnt going right that isnt going right people dont sympathize with me They do nothing but pile more suffering onto the original sufferingWhen they see a difficult challenge they just faintThey whine and complainBut thats not the Buddhas wayHis way is to give you the skills the tools you need and then to encourage you to fire your imagination to rise to these challengesYour tools are the meditation instructionsYour encouragement comes from the examples set by the Buddhas life the stories of the noble disciplesThey show how when you find yourself in a difficult situation you can rise above it using your wits your grit the resources youve gotSo here we are with our breathSometimes weve also got pain and at other times distractions  sometimes both together  and we tend to regard them as mosquitoes swarming around as we meditateWed like to swat them and get rid of them so we can actually get down to the real business of meditatingBut dealing with the distractions dealing with the pain That is the real business of the meditationWhen you die the big problems are going to be distraction and painEven before you dieYouve probably noticed this with old people They cant look ahead into the future because all they see in the future is deathSo they start looking only to the pastThey cut off large swaths of their awarenessTheir minds cant accept whats actually happening  and if they havent been trained then the pain and depression of having to face death overwhelm themWhen the actual pain of illness and death comes theyre even more overwhelmed because they have no toolsThey dont have the right attitude for dealing with these thingsBut if youre practicing meditation youre dealing precisely with the big issues that are going to cause suffering as you dieThe more skilled you get at the meditation the more youll be ready for whatever comes and the more youll have the right attitude toward itYou see it as just one more challenge and youre up for itYouve got your toolsWhen illness comes you can deal with it lucidlyWhen death comes you can deal with it lucidly with a sense of confidenceYouve dealt with pain and distraction in the past so the basic principles are the sameFor this reason when things like pain and distraction come up in the meditation dont get discouragedThese are the riddles of the meditation these are the things you want to figure out  how to spar and parry how to sidestep when necessary how to take them straight on when you have toDont get discouraged by how big the task isJust keep chipping away chipping awayThis is another thing we dont learn from our education system how to deal with something were not good at from the very beginningOften they channel you into areas where you show a talent and neglect to teach you how to gain skill in areas that dont come to you easilyAs a result when you come to meditation you need to develop the basic skills needed to deal with a longterm project Keep chipping away chipping away step by stepLearn to look for the least little signs of progress so you can give yourself encouragementAnd take things as they comeThe world doesnt always throw things at you step by stepSometimes big pains come and then little pains and then big pains againBut you do what you canAnd dont forget that every step you take in the right direction big or small is an important stepIts not wastedSo dont go for the easy way out saying Im just here to hang out in the present moment and enjoy the present moment and who cares about striving for something large Many modern meditation teachers claim that the secret to good meditation is to stop trying to stop striving  that by striving you only pile more suffering on yourself and place obstacles in your way so the best thing is just to let go and appreciate the way things arePeople who denigrate striving saying that it did nothing for them forget to think that maybe they were striving in the wrong wayAs in the sutta where the Buddha compares the right path and the wrong path If you practice with Wrong View Wrong Resolve and Wrong Effort he says its like trying to squeeze gravel to get sesame oilMany meditators are squeezing gravel to get sesame oilThen they realize that this doesnt work and so they stop squeezing the gravel  and thats where they stopThey celebrate how great it is to stop squeezing gravel thinking that thats the secret to good practiceWell its an important step but the path actually consists of finding sesame seeds and squeezing themIt may take some effort but at least it produces real resultsSo if you find yourself pushing pushing pushing and nothings coming from it ask yourself Am I squeezing gravel to get sesame oil In which case youd better back up a little bit take stock of your practice and do what you can to get back on the right pathDont think that just giving up on the effort is going to be a solutionThe solution lies in learning how to apply the effort skillfully and learning how to read the results of your actions until you get what youre looking forThis requires not only seeing the connection between your actions and their results but also having the imagination to realize that to stop squeezing gravel is not the only alternativeThere is the alternative of finding sesame seeds and squeezing sesame seedsThat way you get the oilAnd the oil is really pricelessAfter all its the DeathlessOnce you touch that in your meditation you have your safe place you have your secure placeIt doesnt have to be fabricatedIt doesnt have to be protectedIts there and it will always be there for you to tap into when you really need itSo finding that oil is the most important skill you can developThis gives the most satisfying narrative to your lifeThe narrative of most peoples lives is  whatThey were born they struggled they went through all sorts of difficulties and then got sick and diedIf they were lucky maybe they got to do some good things for their fellow human beings but then they still just grew sick and diedBut if you touch the Deathless thats a very different narrative the narrative of a life that genuinely accomplished something a life well livedIf you dont touch the Deathless the question at the end of your life is What was that all aboutWhat was accomplished by all that producing and consuming all that struggle Whatever you do in time and space is going to get changed someday like a picture you draw with a stick in flowing waterBut if you touch something outside of time and space then life hasnt been wastedThe narrative arc is really satisfying  because once youve found the Deathless its always there to depend onYou always have something to show for your effortsAnd thats the most important thing youll ever need to knowAjaan Fuang once said that a lot of the practice is found in the grass at the gate to the cattle pen  the image being that when you open the gate to the cattle pen the cattle go rushing out looking for grass someplace elseUsually theres a little bit of grass right next to the posts of the gate but most of the cattle miss itIts the same with usWhen we look for happiness we tend to look far awayEven when were meditating we tend to look far away from where things actually areEverything we need to know the Buddha says lies in this fathomlong body with awarenessWe sometimes think that Buddhism has a negative take on the body especially early Buddhism but it has more of what youd call a balanced takeLike the chant just now It isnt lying when it says that the body is filled with all sorts of unclean things  your liver kidneys spleen your intestines the contents of your intestinesIf you took them out and put them on the floor wed have to clean up the mess right awayIf you put them in nice platters on the table people would run away in disgustThe only reason we dont go running away from these things is because theyre tucked inside right now so they seem presentableThe purpose of the chant is to give you a sense of detachment from your desire from your lust from your attachment to the body as something that constantly has to be pandered toOnce you have that element of detachment then you can look at the body and see What does it have of a positive nature Buddhism talks about that tooTheres a potential for rapture right here a potential for ease  all associated with the breathMany times when we read the descriptions of Right Concentration it seems far away but everything we need is right hereWhen Ajaan Lee talks about comfortable breath sensations and uncomfortable ones we already have comfortable breath sensations in at least some parts of the bodyTheres already the potential for a sense of fullness a sense of ease in different parts of the bodyIts simply a matter of applying our directed thought and evaluationWhat that means is that we locate these potentials and then work with them for a whileThe working here many times is simply a matter of protecting themThe word Ajaan Fuang used is prakhawng which means you hover around something to make sure that its okay that nothing happens to itIts like trying to start a fire on a windy dayYou have to cup your hands around the little tiny flame you begin with to make sure that the wind doesnt blow it out until finally it catches and starts to spread and finally reaches a point when its strong enough that you dont have to cup it any moreSo you might want to try a little exercise in how to locate that sense of ease in the body and let it developPay attention to your feet and your handsWhere are they right nowHow do they feelTenseIf they feel tense relax themGo through them finger by finger toe by toe through the palms of the hands the backs of the hands the soles of the feet the tops of the feet relaxing all the little spots of tension you findYou might begin to notice that sometimes as you breathe in theres a slight tensing  either in your hands or in your feet maybe the back of your hands or in your fingersSee if you can breathe in and out without the tensingJust keep both hands both feet as relaxed as possible  all the way through the inbreath all the way through the outNotice where in the breath cycle theres a little bit of tensingAllow it to relaxGet so that you can maintain that sense of relaxation all the way through the inbreath through the space between the inbreath and the outbreath all the way through the outbreath and then through the space between the outbreath and the next inbreathKeep that sense of relaxation as constant as you canNo matter how the breath is cycling through the rest of the body keep the sense of relaxation in your feet and your hands as steady as possibleIt doesnt have to be an enormous relaxation just enough for you to know that its more relaxed than beforeOne way of checking it is to compare one hand to the other one foot to the otherSee which one is more tense and then allow it to relax as much as the other oneSometimes you find that as you relax the feet and the hands you set off patterns of relaxation through the rest of the body too  up the arms to the neck up the legs to the small of the backAllow that to happen but dont lose your focus on the feet and the handsJust let that sense of relaxation spread and keep watch over its sourceThe focusing on the sensation here is directed thoughtWatching over it protecting it is evaluationStaying consistently with the relaxed sensation is singleness of preoccupationAnd in that relaxed sensation theres the potential both for ease and for rapture to developSo youve got the potential for all five factors of the first jhanaThey tend to grow stronger if theyre allowed to be continuousTheres a cumulative effectAnd thats all you have to doIts right thereIts very simple but we tend to make things too difficult for ourselvesWe complicate things when we dont really have toSo keep your directed thought and evaluation uncomplicatedJust work on being steadily vigilant right hereAnd thats it the grass at the gate to the cattle penMeditation is like running a series of experiments in the mind trying to see what happens when you focus it on one thing for long periods of time trying to see what happens when you really take seriously the idea that the way you use your mind may be causing unnecessary sufferingSo you want to see clearly what youre doing where the suffering is and what you can changeThis is why its important that you get accurate results from the experimentAnd as with any experiment one of the most basic things  in fact its so basic that we hardly even think about it  is that you dont want the scientists to be starvingIf theyre starving theyll eat up the endowment before it even gets to the experimentOr theyll fudge the findings to get quick results so that they can print them and make a name for themselvesOr if theyre really starving  say the experiment involves feeding bananas to apes  the scientists will eat up the bananas firstTheyll never get to the apesWhat this means is that as a meditator you have to come to the meditation with a sense of wellbeingThis is why the path doesnt begin with meditationIt begins with generosity and virtue because generosity and virtue help you gain a sense of self esteemWhen youre generous you see the good that comes from being able to give things awayThat in and of itself gives the mind a sense of wealthGenerosity is one of the forms of noble wealthIt gives the mind a sense of contentmentYoure not constantly gobbling up your profitsYou take part of the profits and share the restThat provides a different kind of wealth insideThe same with virtue You see the things you could do that might give you an immediate advantage over somebody else but you realize that youd rather not do them because theyre harmful  not only to the other person but also to yourselfAs you learn to say No to yourself more and more consistently in situations like that you can begin to trust yourselfAs your precepts get tested in more and more difficult situations you gain a greater and greater sense of their worthIf someone were to offer you a thousand dollars to lie you realize you have a precept thats worth more than a thousand dollarsIf they offer a million dollars you still can say NoYouve got a precept worth more than a millionAnd you learn a lot of other skills as well in the course of practicing generosity and virtueFor one thing you learn deferred gratification realizing that there are solid pleasures to be gained from putting aside or forgoing quick and easy pleasures that end quickly and easily as wellAs you find yourself able to forgo the easy pleasures you gain a sense of responsibility a sense of selfworth a sense that you can trust yourselfThis translates into a sense of inner wealth inner wellbeingThis is what you want to bring to the meditation so that you can watch whats happening in the mind with a sense of dispassionBad things come up in the meditation and you dont get worked up over them good things come up and you dont grab at themYou can watch them instead of saying Wow this must be something really great and trying to grab them only to find that theyre already goneIts like a woman I once knew in ThailandShe lived down the road from the monastery but was new to meditationId gotten to know her over time and had noticed that she was pretty mercenaryAnd sure enough one day as she was sitting and meditating she reached out in front of her grabbed the air and fell overLater she admitted very sheepishly that she had seen a vision of a golden tray floating right in front of her and she wanted itThis is what happens when you meditate with a sense of hungerYou grab at everything that comes by and it just slips through your fingersYou destroy whatever it wasSoTry to come with a sense of wealth that youre not hungry for things so that when something good comes up you can just watch it for a while and say What is thisIs this really good or not If you can develop the patience to watch things then you begin to get a better sense of whats worthwhileWhen something really good does come along you can just watch it for a while and not try to gobble it up right awayEven when you can maintain a particular state of ease or rapture you dont want to start jumping to conclusions about itThats like the scientists who get a few results from their experiments and then are in a great hurry to publish them so that they can make a name for themselvesIf youre wise when something comes up in the meditation youre not too quick to interpret itYou just watch it for a while to see what happens to see what it doesWhat good does it do for the mindThis is what makes all the good things in the meditation good They do good things for youWere not here to hoard up the jhanas the way youd hoard up houses on Baltic or VentnorWhen something comes just watch it for a while see what it doesHow is it useful in the practiceAjaan Fuang once pointed out that even states of Wrong Concentration can be useful if you know how to use themFor instance you can get yourself in states of concentration where you totally lose any sense of the body  and here I mean strong states of concentration not that kind of floating deluded concentration where you just lose your bearingsIm talking about the state of nonperception where you really focus on a very minute spot and refuse to deal with anything that comes in through any of the sensesAs a result you can totally blank yourself outYou lose the sense of the body you cant even hear anything and you can stay there for long periods of timeIf you make up your mind beforehand that youre going to stay for two hours youll stay for two hours and then come out right on targetTwo hours will seem like two minutesIts Wrong Concentration because theres no way youre going to be able to develop any insight while youre in that stateBut it has its usesAs Ajaan Fuang told me he once had to go into surgeryThey were going to remove a kidney but he didnt trust the anesthesiologist so he put himself in this state so that no matter what happened he wouldnt have to suffer painSo even Wrong Concentration can have its usesAll the more so with Right ConcentrationBut even Right Concentration as I said is not an end in and of itselfIts part of the pathAnd the path is worthwhile because it takes you to where you want to goSo whatever comes up in the mind just put a postit note on it saying This seems to be x Then watch it for a while to see what x doesMaybe after a while as you get more and more familiar with the territory of the mind you have to shift the postit notes aroundBut you havent lost anything because youve learned what these states are useful forThis is why you want to come to the meditation with a sense of wellbeingTry to keep the mind on an even keel so that no matter what happens good or bad the mind doesnt have to zoom up with the good things or crash down with the badYou simply watchIf the mind is centered you can ask yourself This seems goodWhere did it come fromWhere is it going to go If the mind is scattered ask yourself Where did this come from Try to trace it outTry to understand whats happening in terms of cause and effectThis requires that the mood not take total possession of your mindTry to maintain a sense of the observer thats just watching the mood come and goOf course that observer itself will have its own mood which is a mood of patience a mood of wellbeing but also a sense of urgency This is important work that were doing here  we dont want to sufferSo its important that you strike the right balanceYou want accurate resultsSometimes that takes time so youre willing to take time  the idea being that when you finally publish your results they really are worthwhile they really are dependable rather than being just a flash in the panThis requires that you bring a sense of contentment a sense of wellbeing to the meditationDevelop attitudes of generosity virtue and selfrestraintPractice them in your daily lifeAnd try to get a keen sense for the rewards that come the sense of wellbeing and inner wealth that comes when you know that you can give things away that you can abstain from what you know to be harmful actionsNo matter how much youd like to do something harmful you just dont do it and in that way you build up a sense of inner worth and inner wealthThis puts you in a position where as you watch your mind in the course of the meditation youre really going to see whats happeningYoure not going to eat up the endowment youre not going to eat up the bananas before they can get to the apesYoure going to wait until your results are solid and sure before you try to publish anythingThats when the experiment really will be a gift of knowledge both to yourself and to everybody elseI dont know how many times Ive started a Dhamma talk by saying Dont listen to the Dhamma talkFocus your attention on the breathThe talk is here to be a fence to direct you back to the present moment direct you back to the breath in case you wander off The reason I say that is because thats how the Dhamma functions as a wholeIts meant to point you back to your mind in the present moment to what youre doing in the present moment where you can relate things to the present moment  thats when youre using the Dhamma the correct wayWhen you find that the talk carries you off into speculation youre using it in the wrong wayThe Dhamma is meant to function as a set of tools to apply to the present momentYoure not here simply to be hereYou want to understand why youre here what youre doing here whats the best thing to be doing hereWhen the Dhamma talks about the past or the future its meant to catch you if youve wandered off into the past or the future and to bring you back  not only to bring you back to the present but also to give you a perspective on what youre doing hereFor instance the teachings on karma Every time the Buddha talked about cycles of past lives or the general direction of the universe in the future he ended up by saying that it all comes down to what people do that karma is what has fashioned the past will fashion the futureAnd where is karma being madeRight here right nowWhat is karmaIntentionThats the action being performed in the present momentSo you want to look at your intentionsThe best way to do that is to meditateAs for the future were shaping think about the past youve shaped with all your past actionsWhat are the things youve regretted mostSometimes you might think that you regret something that somebody else did but the things that really burn inside are the harmful things you didAnd they burn especially when you did them even though you knew theyd be harmfulWhy did you do themBecause you werent very alert werent very mindfulYou let defilement take over the mindHow are you going to prevent yourself from doing that in the futureBy developing mindfulness developing alertnessWhere do you do thatRight here right nowSo if youre concerned about the future remember that if you take care of the powers of the mind here in the present moment those powers will enable you to handle the future well when it comesSo the teachings related to past and future  particularly the teachings on karma  are designed to bring you back into the present moment and to give you an understanding of why youre hereYoure not just hanging out in the present moment because its a wonderful place to stayYoure not here passively youre actually doing something here all the timeAnd what youre doing is importantSo you want to do something skillfulThe Buddha talks about Right Effort the things you should abandon the things you should prevent the things you should give rise to the things you should maintain and developHe also talks about the four noble truths and each of them has a dutyWith stress and suffering your duty is to comprehend itIf you happen to run into some suffering here in the present moment try to comprehend itIf you run into any craving recognize that thats the cause for sufferingDo what you can to abandon it to undercut the ignorance that makes it unskillfulAs for the factors of the path  concentration mindfulness alertness  develop thoseIf you see any moments where craving disbands try to be very clear about how that happens  whether its simply one craving taking over another one or if theres actually a moment when craving stops and nothing takes its placeLook into thatMake it clearAs for the right efforts or the right exertions I mentioned just now their purpose is to give rise to skillful qualities  like the qualities of the path  and then to maintain themThe preventing and the abandoning apply to the cause of sufferingSo the Buddhas instructions are very clearThey tell you what to doBut they dont simply say Do this and dont think about why They give you the reasons so that you understand why youre here in the present moment why youre doing what youre doingWhen you understand that much you understand the purpose of the DhammaWhen you use the Dhamma for that purpose youre using it properly to come into the present moment and to sort out whats going on right here and particularly to understand what your intentions are doingSo dont be worried if you dont know a lot about the Dhamma or dont understand it allUnderstand enough to bring the mind to stillnessUnderstand enough to bring the mind to the present moment to watch what its doing to do it skillfully to be mindful alert right hereIf you find yourself wandering off try to keep it as short a wander as possibleIf the mind is persistent and constantly going back to the past or worrying about the future keep reminding yourself of the lessons that the Dhamma has to teach about how to relate to the past and the futureThe only really beneficial use for the past is to remember your mistakes and to resolve not to repeat them to remember what you did well and see if it applies right nowAs for the future its main use is to remind yourself that you dont know how much future time you have left in this particular lifetimeNotice how the Buddha teaches recollection of death Its not just keeping Death death death death death in mindThe proper reflection is If I had just one more breath I could make good use of it So where does that reflection focus youOn the present momentYou do have this one more breath so make good use of itHave a sense of the value of each breath as it comes in each breath as it goes outHave a sense of the importance of the present momentThe opportunities are here in the present moment for performing the duties appropriate to the four noble truths for mastering Right Exertion or mastering Right EffortThats all you really need to knowIf you want your understanding of those teachings to get more refined the present moment is the place to look more carefullyThink about the Buddha on the night of his AwakeningHis first knowledge was recollection of past lives but that wasnt AwakeningStill it did inspire the question Did this pattern apply just to him or to everybodyAnd whats the factor that determines whether a life is going to be happy or sad comfortable or notIn the second knowledge he applied his powers of concentration to that question and discovered that the principle of rebirth applies to everybodyHe also found that actions performed with Right View  skillful intentions influenced by Right View the view that your actions are important  are the things that led to happy lifetimesUnskillful intentions performed from Wrong Views lead to sufferingBut then the Buddha did something very unusualHe applied that insight to the present moment What do all these lessons have to do with the present momentThats where the third knowledge came inHe focused on the immediate present on the questions of stress and suffering right here and now the causes for those things as they appear right here and nowIn other words he focused on his actions his intentions in the present moment along with the stress and suffering occurring right there in the present momentAnd the mental activities that led him beyond the suffering to transcend suffering Those were all right there in that moment tooIt was because he looked at the present moment in that way that he was able to break through to something else something that can be touched right here in your awareness of the present but lies beyond itSo learn to use the Dhamma in a way that keeps bringing you back bringing you back to what youre doing right here right now with the determination to do it skillfully with alertness with mindfulnessIf you have any doubts about why youre here reflect on what the Dhamma teaches that what youre doing right here is usefulVery useful both for you and for the people around youA lot of people accuse meditators of simply running away from things but were not running awayWere running to the source of all things right hereWere accused of doing something totally useless to other peopleWell no its not Were getting rid of greed anger and delusion right hereThis benefits not only ourselves but also everyone around usThats our purpose for being hereAnd its an important purposeIts the most important thing we can do with our lives the sort of thing that if it demands great sacrifices we should be willing to make themAs the Buddha once said even if your practice of the holy life brings tears bathing your cheeks in sorrow frustration and despair you should stick with itThats much better than giving upThis is the best use of your lifeThe Dhamma is there to remind you of thatSo were not just hanging out here in the present moment grooving on or blissing out in the present moment  although there may be blissThats not all that were here forWere here for something more important than thatThe teachings on the past or the future  all the teachings of the Dhamma  are here to remind us of that to give us the incentive to stick with the present moment to watch the present moment to work with the present moment to parse it out and see which part of our experience is the result of past karma which is the actual karma were doing right now which is the result of the karma were doing right nowAnd our experimental laboratory is the breath right hereSo here you are right at the breathYoure where you should beYoure at the best place you can be right now the most useful place you can be right nowSo make the most of this opportunityWhen you come to practice meditation tell yourself that youve left all your baggage at the doorYou dont have to carry it in hereAll of your thoughts about what youve done today what youre going to do tomorrow anything past or future Tell yourself that those things arent relevant right nowWhats relevant is what youre immediately sensing right nowAnd what is thereTheres the sensation of the body and the sensation of the breath coming in and going outAs for the other sense doors you can close them downYour eyes are closed you can even close your earsYou dont have to listen to the Dhamma talkAs Ive said many times before the Dhamma talk is here as a fenceIf you leave the breath you run into the fenceGo back to the breathDont let the talk interfere with your breathingAllow the body to relaxAjaan Suwat once noted that theres a paradox in what were trying to develop as we get the mind to settle downOn the one hand the texts talk about making the mind soft and malleableOn the other hand they talk about making it strong  strong in the sense that youre not going to get waylaid by other thoughtsYoure going to stay focused right here on the breath focused right here on the immediate sensation of the body no matter what else happensTry to elaborate that as little as possibleStay just with the direct sensation the breath coming in the breath going outYou feel it right here and you feel the different sensations in the body that let you know where your legs are where your arms are where your head isDont try to fill in anything more than what you actually senseThats a good exercise in selfhonesty right thereOrdinarily we bring a lot of ideas into the present moment perceptions about the shape of the body about how we should breathe about where we should be feeling the sensation of the breathingIf you really look though you see how fabricated those ideas areIf you let them go what have you got leftExploreWhen you do you find things softening up a bitA lot of the tension with which you hold the body to make it fit in with your preconceived notions of what you should be feeling right now gets put asideAs you allow yourself to become more and more sensitive to what youre feeling the tension in the body can begin to relaxYoure not here trying to prove anything or to force anythingYoure here to explore What have you got right here right nowIf theres a sensation of tension or tightness in any part of the body allow it to disperseYou can think of the breath as a means of clearing out that tensionIn other words you breathe through it as you breathe in and you allow it to go out with the breath or simply to dissolve as you breathe outAs you let go of the tension in the body your sense of the body here in the present moment your sense of awareness here in the present moment begins to open upThats the softness the malleability that were aiming for in the state of concentrationAs for the strength that lies in not allowing yourself to get waylaidOther thoughts are going to come inThats something you can expect to happen so dont get worked up about itThe trick lies in letting them go right through youThink of your awareness of the body as a big window screen with lots of little holesTheyre porousWhen a sound comes in when a thought comes in whatever comes in just let it go right throughYou dont have to catch it just as a screen doesnt catch the windThis way you can combine that sense of being tender softened up more malleable with the strengthThe strength lies in the wires in the screen in that they dont get blown away by whats coming throughThe softness lies in the holes in the porous nature of your awareness that allows things throughWhen the breath comes in and goes out it can come in and go out anywhere in the body at allSo experiment and explore to see how that feelsWhat breathing feels best right nowLook into itTheres long breathing slow breathing fast breathing short breathing hot cool and warm breathing  like the porridge in the story of GoldilocksYou have all kinds of choices but what you want is the one thats just rightYoure not trying to program yourself or force yourself into a particular moldThe recommendations of the technique are there to give you guidance in your exploration to give you a sense of direction in what youre doingBut the things youre going to see depend on your own powers of observation as you adjust the breath as you adjust your focusThat act of adjusting is the beginning of discernmentYou begin to see connections cause and effectWhen you choose to breathe in a certain way certain sensations are going to result either pleasurable or painfulThats the law of karma right there seeing how things arise and pass away seeing the connections between what you do and the feelings that arise and pass away as a resultWhen the texts describe the insight that leads to the first stage of Awakening they express it as seeing this All thats subject to origination is subject to cessationThats an insight both into change and into causal connections underlying changeThe Pali word for origination samudaya refers to the way things arise together with their causesAs you go deeper into the meditation this insight grows deeper and becomes more allencompassing but it starts with precisely this act of adjusting changing your perceptions and intentions a little bit here a little bit there seeing what feelings result and trying to be as observant as possible as sensitive as possible to whats really happening to whats connected with whatThis is why youre told not to force the breath but to allow it to come in and go out comfortably and then to monitor it to see what feels bestLearn to listen to things as they come into beingThis was characteristic of the Buddha as he sought Awakening to see things as they come into beingHe didnt try blindly to force things in line with a lot of preconceived notionsHe was more of an explorer trying different approaches and seeing what results came aboutUltimately he found what worked best in the sense of putting an end to all suffering and then recommended that method for us to followHe set out all the basic principles but left the details for us to observe for ourselves in our laboratory right here the body sitting here breathing in and outIn other words were sitting here trying to follow his method not just trying to clone the resultsWe follow the method he proposed for learning the truths that lie within usBut to get the best results requires developing your own sensitivity your own awareness and seeing what precisely really is thereRecently Ive been looking through a field guide on nature observationThe author when he was a child was trained by an old Native AmericanOne day the child asked the old man Why is it that youre not afraid of heat and coldThe old man looked at him for a while and finally said Because theyre realAnd this is our job as meditators to try to learn not to be afraid of things that are realUltimately we discover that things that are real pose no danger to the mindThe real dangers in the mind are our delusions the things we make up the things we use to cover up reality the stories the preconceived notions we impose on thingsWhen were trying to live in those stories and notions reality is threateningIts always exposing the cracks in our ideas the cracks in our ignorance the cracks in our desiresAs long as we identify with those makebelieve desires we find that threateningBut if we learn to become real people ourselves then reality poses no dangersThis is what the meditation is for teaching yourself how to be real to get in touch with whats really going on to look at your sense of who you are and take it apart in terms of what it really is to look at the things that you find threatening in your life and see what they really areWhen you really look you see the truthIf youre true in your looking the truth appearsThis is an important principle in the practiceThis is why the Dhamma is so preciousOnly people who are true can see the truthTruth is a quality of the mind that doesnt depend on figuring things out or being cleverIt depends on having integrity in your actions and in your powers of observation accepting the truth as it isIt means accepting the fact that you play a role in shaping that truth so you have to be responsibleYou have to be sensitive both to what youre doing and to the results you get so that you can learn to be more and more skillfulMany people think that selfacceptance means celebrating whats there already that youre good enough that you dont have to make any changesThats not the case at allAcceptance means accepting the fact that youre responsible for a lot of your experience right nowYou cant blame anybody elseAnd ultimately thats a good thingIf other people were ultimately responsible for shaping your experience what could you doYoud have to go around pleasing them all the timeBut the key fact is that youre shaping your pleasures and pains here in the present momentSome of your experience comes from past actions but a lot comes from the way you shape things with each present intentionSo learn to be open and honest about the role youre playing in this momentThat way the meditation leads to greater and greater sensitivity into precisely this  what youre doing right now  and into the fact that if you were really observant youd be a lot more sensitive in shaping your experienceThered be a lot less sufferingIn fact you could ultimately get to the point where you put no suffering into your experience at allThats how far the skill can goIt requires that you be true in your observation both admitting what youre doing to yourself and admitting the results that come at the same time using your ingenuity to figure out how to do things betterSo this is where those qualities of sensitivity or tenderness on the one hand and strength on the other hand come togetherThe sensitivity lies in allowing yourself to see really refined things the strength in admitting the truth for what it isIts in this area that the ignorance leading to suffering lies in our inability to be true to ourselvesBut as the old mans statement implied if youre true the truth isnt threateningIf you learn to be a real person then reality doesnt hold any dangers doesnt hold any fearsIf youre still living in worlds that are false and made up though then reality poses a threatOnly when you strip away all the unreality in your mind will you find in whats left that theres nothing to fearThere are no dangersTheres just reality meeting with reality truth meeting with truthSo the clearer and more honest you are about what youre doing right here right now the closer you get to that position where theres nothing to threaten you where there are no dangers in life no sufferingThats where this simple exercise of watching your breath adjusting your breath and watching it again can take you if you really follow it all the way throughIt can be very chastening to see how changeable your mind isYou make up your mind to do something and then find yourself just a few minutes later heading off in another directionSometimes its because you saw that your original intention was not as wise as you thought it was but often it has nothing to do with that at allThe original intention was perfectly fine but youre off headed at right angles to that intentionAnd you wonder whyOne of the purposes of meditation is to see exactly whats happening why you can suddenly veer off at right angles exactly what the mind does to itself in order to drop a perfectly good intention and go someplace totally differentIn this way the meditation is like an experimentYou set up some conditions and then watch how they play outIn other words you start by focusing on something you know is good the breathAfter all the breath is the force of life and its very immediateIts not far off or dubiousIts right here right nowYou can see that sticking with the breath and allowing it to be comfortable is bound to have a good effect on the body and the mindSo theres no doubt thereAfter setting up the breath as the object of your intention the next step is to be aware of any other vagrant intentions that will pull you off in other directionsFor the time being the rule in your mind is If a thought doesnt have anything to do with the breath you dont want to get involvedSo as soon as you find yourself veering off you dont have to ask a lot of questionsIf youre getting pulled away from the breath just drop that thoughtformation and come back to the breath no matter how interesting intriguing or important that thought may beJust let it goLeave it in midsentenceYou dont have to tie up any loose endsYou dont have to make a little note to come back there and check it out laterJust totally drop it and come backNow the afterecho of that thoughtformation may continue for a whileThats okay you dont have to listen to itYour job right now is to train the mind to be more and more consistent in sticking with an intentionAnd  sure enough  a second thought will come up or a third or a fourth a tenth or a hundredth but no matter how many youre not going to follow themThats the promise you make yourself when you sit downAnd the important thing is not to get discouraged when you find yourself breaking that promiseJust pick yourself up dust yourself off and get back to the breathRemember This is a deeply ingrained habit were fighting here so its going to take effort and timeIf you think training a dog is difficult the human mind is even more devious even more resistant to new tricksIts difficult to train the human mind in this way but it can be doneAnd the time spent in training yourself in new habits like this is time well spentAfter all the force of intention is what shapes your lifeWe dont often think of the teachings on karma as having much relevance to the meditationSometimes were even taught that karma was one of those weird pieces of cultural baggage that somehow got smuggled into Buddhism from its cultural backgroundBut thats not the case at allThe Buddha had some very specific teachings on karma that had nothing to do with what anybody else was teaching at the time and theyre immediately relevant to why and how were meditatingThe why has to do with the point I just raisedGiven that karma is intention and intention is the huge shaping force in your life you want some control over itIf you make up your mind to do something that you know is good you want to be able to stick with that intentionAnd where does intention happenRight in the present momentWhere does it get changedIn the present momentThis is why we focus on the present moment so that we can see the process of intention in action as it happens and can have a say in where that intention is going to goThe more solidly you can stay in the present moment  the more steadily you can maintain your balance here  the more youll be able to see and the more conscious say youll have in the direction those intentions are going to take youThats the whyAs for the how youll notice as things come up in the meditation that the vagrant intentions have very little to do with anything you were consciously thinking about as you sat down to meditate when you made your intention to stay with the breathAnd yet suddenly they appearThis relates to the Buddhas teachings on how your present experience is made up of three things the results of past intentions the actual process of intention in the present moment and immediate results of that present intentionCertain thoughts are going to come up as a result of past intentions and they dont necessarily have much meaningThey just happen to pop up and they can be pretty randomSometimes we look for inspiration or signs of some special knowledge as we meditateThat can happen but its also mixed up with a lot of really random stuffIts like looking for meaning in your dreams Some dreams are portentous some are pretentious and most are totally randomYou cant take them as a dependable guideIn the same way you cant necessarily take what pops into your mind in the present moment as a guide either no matter how still or luminous your mind may be for a lot of what pops up is simply the result of random past intentionsBut what you can do  by staying solidly in the present moment and solidly with your intention to stay with the breath  is over time to put yourself in a better position to evaluate what comes into the mindIf a thought of greed anger or delusion comes in youll be able to sense it and to see what it does because youre more sensitive to whats going on hereInsights may come up but you dont have to memorize themAjaan Fuang once said that if an insight is really valuable you dont have to take note of it for future referenceInstead see if you can apply it to whats actually happening to your mind in the present momentIf it gives good results stick with itIf it doesnt drop itIf its a really valuable insight itll stay with you because you got good results from itYou wont have to tag it put it on a leash and lead it back home with youThe insights are not nearly as important as the ability to put the mind in a position where it can produce insights and evaluate them in terms of what they do in the presentThats why were trying to get the mind in concentrationTry to be very very alert to cause and effect here in the present momentWhen you can see the connection between cause and effect thats when youre in a position to evaluate your thoughts because the worth of a thought lies in its effectIts like having a goose that lays golden eggs You focus on taking good care of the goose rather than the eggs because these golden eggs are like the gold in fairy talesIf you dont use them or give them away right away they turn into feathers they turn into charcoalRemember fairy talesThe more you try to hold onto things the more they turn into strawIf you get something good you put it to useYou give it awayThats when you gain something more valuable in returnIts the same with insightsIf the insight is appropriate for the time and place fine use itIf not just put it asideIt probably wasnt an insight anyhow because as I said all kinds of things from your past karma can come popping up into a still mindBut the value of a still mind doesnt lie so much in what pops up as in your ability to evaluate what pops upYou can see cause and effect in actionWhen the mind is really still and very refined it can sense the presence of greed anger and delusion even in minute quantitiesIt can sense what they doYour powers of sensitivity are raised your ability to see cause and effect is sharpenedYou can tell genuine gold from fools gold a lot better when the mind is stillSo you dont have to trust whatever comes up in the still mindIn fact youre not supposed to trust anythingYoure supposed to put everything to the testThe value of a still mind is not that it sees things but that it sees things in actionYou can gauge your intentions a lot better when the basic underlying intention in the mind is reliable solid and sureHere the basic underlying intention is this Always to do whats most skillfulAlways choose whats going to be the least harmful the most beneficial course of actionAnd one of the most beneficial things you can do for yourself is to learn how to stick with a very simple good intention like this like staying with the breathAs you get more and more reliable in staying here you provide the foundation for all the other insights and all the other good things that come from training the mindSo make sure the foundation is strong make sure the foundation is solid and the good things you develop to build on top of that are less likely to topple overThis practice were doing here is called the karma that puts an end to karmaAnd because karma is intention this means that the practice is the intention to put an end to intentionThats why its trickyIf you intend to put a stop to intention thats an intention right there but that doesnt mean its impossibleIt simply means there are going to be some unexpected twists and turns along the pathAs the Buddha said the central part of his path is Right ConcentrationConcentration basically means a firm intention sticking with one objectYou focus your intention on staying with the breath staying with goodwill whatever the object of your meditation and then you try to maintain that intentionThen you see what you can learn about intention in the course of trying to maintain it what other things you can learn about the mind as you try to maintain that intentionThe usual culprits to begin with are distractions either internal or externalThe internal ones are other thoughts other intentionsAt first you hardly realize that theyre intentionsYoure focusing on the breath everything seems fine and then suddenly youre someplace else half a world awayIts as if someone snuck up behind you threw a sack over your head dragged you off and then dumped you on another continentYou dont know what happened in the meantimeYou dont catch sight of the fact that an intention triggered the slipping awayThere was one brief moment when you decided Im out of here Something else popped up in the mind and you went for itThere was a choiceThis is why meditation requires so much mindfulness and alertnessAs we practice mindfulness means the ability to keep your original intention in mindAlertness means the ability to keep watch over things around that intentionOn the one hand you focus on whats going on with the object of your concentrationOn the other you keep track of how the mind is relating to itLearn how to catch any warning signals that the mind is about to goIt may take a while for you to catch them because theyre subtle and quickThe only way to see them is to stick with your original intention and keep yourself warned Okay the mind is going to leave so keep watch for how it does itAt the same time work on ways to make the original intention a good one to stay withOtherwise the mind is going to resistStaying with the breath if its not comfortable is going to be like trying to keep a balloon under waterItll stay there only as long as your grip is really secureAs soon as theres the slightest slip there it goes popping up out of the waterThis is where you have to get your defilements on your sideThey want comfort so give them comfortTry to make the breath as comfortable as possibleThe breath here is not just the air coming in and out of the lungs its your whole sense of energy flow in the bodyAs the image for the first jhana says its like working moisture through a ball of bath powderOr you can think of making breadYou put water in with the flour and then knead it through the flour until every part of that ball of flour is moistenedYou take whatever ease and sense of refreshment that comes from the breath and try to knead it through the body all the way out to the tips of the toes all the way out to the tips of the fingers all over the front and back of the bodyThat makes the body a good place to stayOr you can think of systematically going through the bodyRelax the fingers relax the palms of your hands the backs of your hands your wrists your arms anywhere you can detect tension that pulls you out of a nice comfortable straightupanddown postureStart with the tips of your fingers and go up your palms the backs of your hands up your arms to the shouldersThen start with your toes go up your feet your legs pelvis up the back to the neck and then all the muscles around the headThen try to develop an allaround awareness that can keep the whole body relaxed all the timeThis makes the body a much nicer place to stayAs you work on this it engages several parts of the mind such as the desire for pleasure and the desire to explore as you begin to see connections throughout the bodyThis means youve got allies insideAs Ajaan Lee said its like taking Mara and putting him on your sideSo thats one strategy for staying with your original intentionAnother strategy is to learn to be very quick in dealing with your distractionsIts so easy to get entangled in the story line wherever your thoughts lead youIf the distractions come from within a little thought bubble comes up in the mind and says Lets explore this and see where it goes And you end up finding yourself in the Andromeda galaxyIn other words these things can take you far far away into whole other worlds whole other storiesSometimes its hard to pull yourself out of those stories because you want to see how they endIts almost as if youre committed to itThis happens all the timeYou walk past a TV and suddenly find yourself in some stupid storyYou know the stories on TV are stupid but you still get sucked inThats because youre already a sucker for getting sucked in to these stupid stories in your mindSo you have to learn to develop a certain amount of skepticism for these storiesDo you really need to know the endLearn how to cut things off in the middle of a storyThe characters wont mindIn other cases the story lines dont start out with internal distractionsThey start out with external irritants that pull you awayOther people say or do things that irritate you and all of a sudden youre focused on how much you dont like what they said or didThen you get upset because theyve destroyed your concentrationYou can build up huge narratives about how they shouldnt have done that shouldnt have destroyed your concentrationActually they werent the ones who destroyed your concentrationYou dropped it ran after them and then found some satisfaction in blaming themAgain youve got to learn how to pull yourself out of that mindset as wellNo matter what anybody else says or does the breath is still thereYou made the choice to leaveThats what youve got to watch out forSo the whole purpose of concentration practice is to get to know the process of intentionThe best way of doing that is to stick with this one intention as much as you can because it gives you something to measure your other intentions against so you can notice how they moveThen after the distractions get less and less compelling you can begin to look into this intention youre trying to maintainWhat is it made out ofMostly verbal fabrication and mental fabricationThe verbal fabrication is directed thought and evaluation two of the factors of jhanaDirected thought is when you focus your intention on an object evaluation is when you examine the object seeing whether you like it dont like it what comments you have to make on itThese two processes lie at the basis of every sentence in the mind every sentence you speakThats why theyre called verbal fabricationThen theres mental fabrication feeling and perceptionThese things have their intentional element tooEven when you drop directed thought and evaluation to go from the first jhana to the second theres still feeling and perceptionIn fact the perception  the perception of breath  is what keeps you there all the way up through the fourth jhanaTry to hold onto that perception until the breath energy in the body grows stillThen you stay with still breath as your perceptionAfter a while the border between your body and whats outside your body begins to dissolveYou begin to realize that the border was a perception reinforced by the movement of the breathWhen the breath gets still theres nothing to reinforce itSo you can adjust your perception to space or consciousness and theres no border to these thingsIn other words after dealing with distractions youre able to focus on the one intention that forms your concentration and you begin to understand itWhats the process of fabrication going on in hereIf it werent consistent enough you wouldnt understand it for youd get nothing but fleeting glimpsesA lot of your insights are just that  little fleeting glimpses  and then you try to connect themIts like playing connectthedotsAnd the problem with connectthedots is that the dots can be anything like the constellations in the skyWe look up at Orion in the winter and we see his belt and his knife hanging from his beltPeople in Thailand though look up at the same stars and see a plowThe belt is the actual plow and the knife is the part that pulls the ploughAnd whos to say that were right and theyre wrongThe same holds true for our connectthedot insightsIf awareness isnt continuous enough all we see are the lines weve drawnWe dont see the actual dotsBut when you can stick consistently with your original intention you begin to see the actual dots and the actual lines what actually connects to what what causes what and what actually makes up this intention weve been working so hard to maintainThe other insight that comes is that as youre maintaining an intention its like maintaining a yoga postureJust as you relax into the yoga posture over time in the same way youre relaxing into the concentrationYou begin to realize that certain activities in your original intention are not necessary to keep it goingAfter the mind begins to settle down you have less and less need for directed thought and evaluationThe breath gets more comfortable you get more settled in and there comes a point where you can drop the directed thought and evaluationYou can just be one with the breath  in the same way that when youre in a yoga posture you begin to realize that youve been tensing certain muscles that you dont have to tenseIn fact youd be more comfortable in the posture if you relaxed those musclesBut those insights into which parts are going to have to be relaxed  you cant will those beforehand but you can pose the question in your mind What would be more comfortable hereThats how you can develop insightWhen the Buddha talks about developing insight he focuses on posing certain questions in your mind How should fabrications be regardedHow should they be investigated You cant put the mind through a vipassana mill and guarantee that it is going to come out with insightBut if you learn to pose the right questions  and these are basically questions that come from the four noble truths  Where is the stressWhat are you doing thats causing the stress Insight starts with simple things like thisWhats tense in the breathWhats tense in the bodyWhere is there any blockage in the body thats really unnecessaryWhen you see you learn to relax itThen you focus on the mental factors maintaining your state of concentration Which ones are an unnecessary burden that makes it hard to maintain the concentrationOnce youve settled in you learn how to relax those mental activitiesThats the pattern for insight and you follow that pattern all the way through as it takes you from one level of concentration to anotherIt takes concentration as far as it can goTry to maintain your concentration as much as you can because the more consistently you can maintain it the more youre likely to catch sight of those unnecessary actionsTheyre activities theyre inconstantIf they were totally constant youd never catch sight of their existenceIts because they come and go that you realize Now its here now its notTheres something going on hereThe stress comes the stress goesThe cause comes the cause goesAnd insight is a matter of learning how to catch sight of these things as they happenYou pare down the intention to stay still until theres nothing left to pare down without totally dropping intentionAgain thats something unexpectedYou cant intend to see it at a particular moment but you can pose the questionThe posing of the question is whats called appropriate attentionThats what opens things up makes it possible to see things that you didnt intend to see or to see them where you didnt intend to see themThis is how things finally open to the DeathlessThe Deathless is unintendedIts something that when you hit it you realize was always there and that nothing you can do will change itThe reason you didnt notice it before was because you were entangled in your intentions and the results of your intentionsBut you cant get there simply by saying Okay Im not going to intend anything anymore That doesnt do itYou have to intend Right Concentration Thats the doingThat allows you to understand what it means to do well enough so that you can actually stop doingThats the karma that puts an end to karma the intention that allows you to understand intention until you finally get to the point where you can stop intendingAnd it really is a stopping of intentionIts not a hall of mirrors where you say Okay Im going to stop intending to stop intending tending tending which is an intention to stop the intention which is an intention and just goes on and on and on like thatYou cant reason yourself into this but its something that can be inducedYou can bring yourself to the brink where it can happenSo work at this intention the intention to stay focused on one preoccupationGet to know itGet to be on good terms with itGet as much of the mind on your side as you can through making the breath comfortable through making the process interestingAnd then learn to be resolute at cutting away things that arent really helpful things that pull you off in other directionsThis is going to require all your ingenuity all your attention but its one of the few skills in life thats really worth all the effort it requires that more than repays all the effort put into itItll see you all the way through every possible type of suffering because its rewards are more than you can intendYou can think about the goal you can have a picture of what its like but the picture in your preconceived notion has an intentional elementIts part of the path because it helps you along gives you encouragement but the actual rewards when they come are much greaterSo keep reminding yourself of the Buddhas instructions on tranquility and insightFor the tranquility its a question of how to settle in how to really steady the mind in its intention how to indulge in it which means to learn how to enjoy itThe insight then comes in learning how to question the intention  not in the sense of doubting it but in the sense of learning how to investigate whats going on hereWhen you learn how to bring the activities for tranquility and insight together in the right balance then you really come to know what the Buddha was talking aboutWhen the Buddha teaches mindfulness immersed in the body the first thing he discusses is being mindful of the breathIts good to stop and think for a few moments about why he starts thereOne of the reasons is that the breath is your most immediate experience of the bodyWe have a tendency to identify ourselves with the solid parts of the body and think of the breath as something secondary something that comes in and out of the part we inhabitBut actually you wouldnt know about the solid parts of the body the solid sensations in the body if it werent for the breathFor one thing youd be deadAnd even if there were some way of being alive and not having the breath the only way youd know that theres something solid is because something is moving against it moving over itSo think about this as youre focusing on the breathOne way of approaching the body is thinking of it as primarily breath sensationsAjaan Lee lists a whole series of them the breath that moves up the body the breath that moves down the body the breath that goes out through all the blood vessels tensing and relaxing the muscles in the blood vessels the breath that goes out the nerves the breath sensations that spin around in place the breath energy constantly radiating from the diaphragm the breath constantly coming up the spineThere are all kinds of breath sensations in the bodyOne way of making the body more comfortable is to think of it as all breathEvery sensation has a breath aspect to it so focus on that breath aspectIf anything seems tight or tense dont write it simply off as being a solid part of the bodyThink of it as a breath sensation that somehow got tightenedLoosen it upApproach it as you would a breath that should be moving through the bodySee how that changes the way you relate to itThis is one way of making the body interestingAn important principle in concentration practice is that if you try to rely solely on willpower to stay with an object you wont have much staying powerBut if you find the object absorbing its a lot easier to staySo look at the body in a new light from a new perspective and see if it becomes more interesting to be sitting right here not doing much of anything else just staying with the body exploring how it feels to be right here and not traveling around outsideIf you try to lock the mind into the body its like locking a child into his room Hes going to try to figure out some way to get out the window or start doing something in the room he knows his parents dont like just to spite themThe mind is like that If you lock it in with an object itll start doing things to spite youSo the trick is to leave the windows and doors open but give the mind lots of things to play with to get absorbed insideThat way the child will stay in its room without your having to force it without your having to lock it inThe breezes come in the window and they wont blow you away because youve got something interesting right here in the present momentWhen the breath energy flows more smoothly through the body aches and pains will calm downYoull be healthier in generalAs you really get to know the breath you find that it can induce a sense of refreshment which as you allow it to stay gets more intense and shades into rapture  all simply from being with the breathSo if you find that the breath is boring its because one youre not paying attention and two youre not asking the right questionsYoure assuming lots of things you dont really know about the body in the present momentLearn how to question those assumptionsIs the body as solid as it seemsCertain sensations of tension or tightness Do they have to be thereMaybe the way youre breathing is whats maintaining themAs you allow yourself to get absorbed in the breath exploring these things you require less and less willpower to stay hereThis is the kind of concentration that has discernment as one of its integral factorsIn terms of the bases of success its the fourth one concentration based on the powers of analysisSo give it a tryExplore whats actually happening as you just sit hereThe breath comes in the breath goes out the breath spins around in place gets blocked here flows there dissipates here gets strong and constant thereExplore these thingsIts part of learning how to take care of the bodyAnd you find that in taking care of the body this way youre taking care of the mind as wellSome people think that when the Buddha describes the five aggregates hes describing what we are but thats precisely what hes not sayingHes saying that were not thatBut the mind does identify with these things  sometimes with the body sometimes with feelings perceptions thoughtformations sometimes with sensory consciousness sometimes different combinations sometimes all of the aboveIf you could take a movie of the minds sense of itself it would be erratic and mercurial like a reflection on water  slithering here and there identifying with this identifying with that shapeshifting all the timeIn changing position all the time like this the mind expends a lot of energyOne of the things that we want to try to do as we meditate is to get it to stay in one place to save some energyAs long as youre going to have a sense of self keep it solid  rock solid  immersed in the bodyBreath meditation is one way of staying immersed in the bodyThe term in Pali is kayagatasati mindfulness immersed in the bodyAnd the quality of immersion is importantYou want to fill the whole body occupy the body inhabit the whole body as much as you canWhere is your observer right nowFor many of us its like a weird bird perched on our shoulders and peering through our eyesIt watches the body as if the body were something separateBut as we meditate were trying to get away from identifying with that particular observer we want to be an observer filling the whole bodyYour feet fill your feet your hands fill your handsYour entire sense of who you are fills the entire bodyThis puts you in a position of strength because if youre leaving big gaps of unoccupied territory in your body other things will occupy it  different thoughts different defilementsBut if your awareness occupies your whole body other things cant get in so easilyThe image in the Canon is of a solid wooden door a ball of string thrown at the door wont leave a dent at allEven if things do come in and make a dent on the mind youre going to know it youre going to see it because youre right thereYoure not off in some other corner of the body looking at something elseSo as you focus on the breath try to get past the idea that youre in one part of the head watching the breath in other parts of the bodyYou want to occupy the whole body bathed in the whole breathThe breath and the body should be surrounding your sense of where you areAnd then you want to maintain that sense of being centered in the body like this filling the whole body with your awareness as you breathe in as you breathe outWhyFor one thing this sense of filling the body helps you stay in the present momentWhen the mind goes off thinking thoughts about past and future it has to shrink its sense of awareness shrink its sense of itself down to a small enough dot so that it can slip into the past or slip into the futureIn other words you latch onto the part of the body that you use as a basis for thinking about the past or the future while other parts of the body get blotted outBut if youre filling the body with your awareness and can maintain that full awareness you cant slip off into the past and future unless you want toSo this is one way of nailing yourself down to the present momentYour inner hands are nailed to your physical hands your feet to your feetYou cant moveThink of the breath coming into the whole bodyEvery cell of the body is participating in the breathing process and youre sitting here in the midst of itThis gives your sense of observing self a greater solidity so that when thoughts come into the mind youre not knocked off balance by themYouve got a solid foundationThe word they use for the object of meditation in Pali arammana literally means support the idea being that your mind is standing firm on somethingYoure standing here in the bodyThis is your locationThis is where you take your stanceAnd when your stance is solid nobody can kick you over or knock you downIts like riding on the subway in New York CityThe subway sways back and forth and up and down and all aroundIf your stance is planted just right  so that you dont get knocked over either by the acceleration or deceleration of the train or the swaying to the left or the right  you can maintain your balance no matter whatBut life is a lot more erratic even than a subway trainThe things that happen around you  sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations things that people do things that people say They can hit the mind with a lot more violence with a lot more force than the wobbling or sudden braking of a subway trainSo the mind needs a really solid stanceThis is why we work on providing this support for the mind not only while were sitting here meditating but also throughout the daySome people complain that its asking too much of them to pay attention to the events of the day and to the breath at the same timeWell if youre sitting in the back of your head watching the breath in the body and watching things outside it does add an extra burden Youve got two things to watch at any one time instead of just oneBut if you think of yourself as immersed in your body inhabiting your whole body this puts you in a different positionYoure standing in the breath in a position of solidity a position of strengthFrom that position you watch things outside so that instead of having extra things to do youve simply got a better place to maintain your stanceIf your sense of self is inhabiting one little part of the body and things come in from the outside with great force  somebody does something or says something that hits you the wrong way  you can get knocked off kilter really easily because your stance isnt solidThe mind is so used to flitting around from one position to another that its very easily knocked off balanceBut if youre standing filling your whole body with your awareness  this is your stance this is your support  then no matter what comes you can keep your balanceSo try to maintain this sense of inhabiting your body being bathed in the breath being surrounded by the breath on all sides not only while youre sitting here but also as you go through the dayTry to maintain this quality of being fully immersed in the body fully aware fully mindful fully alertOnce you can maintain this stance in different situations then you can start observing the sense of self youve created hereIf your sense of self is flitting all around  first with a feeling then with a perception then back to a feeling again then to perception and feeling like those weird amoebalike shapes that flit across the surface of water  its hard to observe to get a sense of What is this selfWhy does the mind need a sense of self But as you maintain this one sense of self inhabiting the body immersed in the body surrounded on all sides by the breath its there long enough for you to observe it Whats it made ofWhats the form hereWheres the feelingWheres the perceptionWhere are the thoughtformationsWheres the consciousnessIts all right here relatively still enough that you can really observe itThere are lots of advantages to having a sense of mindfulness immersed in the body your sense of self immersed in the bodyEventually you take that sense of self apart but in the meantime you learn how to use it so that you dont get knocked over by all the winds and currents of the worldYou dont get knocked over by all the currents flowing out of the mind eitherWhen they talk about taking the body inandofitself as your island as your refuge this is what they mean The current of the river flows past but the island stays solid because its deeply rootedIts made of rock like Manhattan its not a sandbarYouve got your awareness deeply rooted in your hands in your feet in the different parts of your body not just in your head not flitting around from here to thereYouve got a large sense of awareness filling the presentThis puts you in a position of strength which you want to maintain for as long as you canIt helps ward off the currents that come flowing from outside or inside and it also allows you to see your sense of self a lot more clearly to understand what it is  where theres still suffering even in this position of strength where theres still stress and uncertainty and inconstancyBut first you do your best to make it constantHow are you going to believe the Buddhas teachings on inconstancy until youve found some constancy in your awarenessYou push the limitsIts only when you really push the limits that you can gain a true sense of where things start pushing backWhen the Buddha gave his teachings he didnt simply ask for people to believe what he saidHe said to push back inside yourself to test themSoInconstancy stress notself How do you test thoseBy creating a constant sense of ease in the body because this awareness has to be relaxed in order to lastAnd you can identify with it inhabit it fullyIts only in this way that you can push against the limits and see where the principles of inconstancy stress and notself will push back even in this state of mindBut work on it firstRemember this is a skill taking this stance maintaining this stance being concentrated in the body but concentrated with an expansive sense of ease so that it doesnt become oppressiveWork at filling the body with your awareness so that if they were going to take a picture of your sense of self of the minds sense of self it would be like the image in the Canon a person totally surrounded by a white cloth from head to toeOr like Ajaan Lees image of the mantle of a Coleman lantern  all its threads bathed in a bright white unmoving flameTry to saturate your body with this sense of relaxed but steady awareness and see what happens as a resultMeditation has to engage not only the thinking part of your mind but also the emotional partOtherwise it gets dry and doesnt totally train youSo its good to think about the emotions that need to be involved in meditation for the training to be more completeThe first emotion youre supposed to bring to the training is samvegaThats the emotion Prince Siddhartha felt on seeing the old person the sick person and the dead personSamvega is a word that doesnt quite have an equivalent in EnglishIt means a sense of shock dismay or urgency and its related to the adjective samvigga or terrifiedIts a chastened realization of what life is like that the pleasures youve been pursuing are fleeting and never really provide satisfactionLook at you yourself Youre fleeting as wellAnd the amount of suffering in life Not only is life fleeting but theres a lot of suffering before you fleet totally awayTheres that famous passage where the Buddha says that the waters of the ocean are less than the tears youve shed in all your many lifetimesYouve drunk more milk from your mothers breast whether your mother was human or a dog or whatever than there is water in the oceanAs the Buddha concludes just thinking about these things should be enough to give you a sense of terror dismay and dispassion enough to make you want to gain releaseTaken on its own samvega can be a very depressing realization which is why it has to be paired with pasada or confidence confidence that there is a way outIn the famous story about young Prince Siddhartha seeing the old person the sick person and the dead person he also saw a forest mendicantThat was his fourth visionHis realization after seeing the forest mendicant was This must be the way outIf theres any way out this is it And so he pursued that conviction with a strong sense of clarity and confidenceAjaan Suwat when he led the meditation here at Metta would often say Start with a sense of pasada that this is your way outStick with the practice with that sense of conviction confidence desireIf you approach the meditation in a desultory way youre going to get desultory resultsYou really have to be devoted to what youre doing here Or as Ajaan Fuang would say You have to be crazy about the meditation if you want to meditate well You have to get fully into the meditation so that it really engages your imaginationWhat can be done with the mind as you focus it on the breathWhat can be done with the breathHow can you learn to relate to the breath in a way that allows you to settle down and see whats going on in the mindBe curiousFind outWhen you meet up with obstacles you need the sort of inquisitive mind that doesnt give up that tries to find a way around the obstacles with the conviction that there is a way aroundThats what the confidence is forIf youre lost in the woods convinced that theres no way out theres going to be no way outIf you think theres a way out at least you have a chance of finding itSo when you come up against issues in the meditation be confident in using your ingenuity as much as you canIf you find yourself controlling the breath its natural that youre going to be controlling the breathIn fact its important to realize that thats happeningMany times they say Let the breath come in and out on its ownDont control it What happens then though is that you dont notice how youre controlling itThe controlling all goes undergroundWhat were doing here is bringing the issue of control out into the openAs long as youre controlling the breath anyway try to do it consciously skillfullyAnd what is it that controls the breathTheres an intention and theres a perceptionCan you be clear about your intentions and perceptionsCan you change your intention to be more sensitive to what the breath really needsCan you change your perception of the breath so that the way you control it actually causes less stress does less harmWhat ways of thinking of the breath coming in and out of the body help to overcome the unhealthy or unskillful ways that you control the breathWhat different kinds of breathing energy are there in the bodyLook into that as wellYoull find that different kinds of breath energy are helpful at different timesWhen youve got lower back problems its good to think of the breath energy coming up continually from the soles of your feet giving more strength to the back as it goes up and then out the top of the headIf theres a tightness in the chest think of the tightness dissipating out through the shoulders the arms and the fingersIn other words use your ingenuity so that you become more and more interested in staying in the present momentAll too often we approach concentration practice as an exercise in forcing the mind to stay still not to think not to move not to do anythingAnd of course as soon as you tell it not to move its going to start fidgeting around like a little kid told to sit still in a chairBut if you give the kid something to play with something to explore he can get still and very enthralledHe can sit in the chair for hours without complainingSo try to engage your ingenuity as you practiceAnd always have the confident conviction that no matter what the problem in your meditation theres a way around itThat confidence is going to help see you throughOf course simply the confidence is not going to be enoughYou have to use your ingenuity until you start seeing results as wellAnd when you start seeing results there will be a sense of ease and finally a sense of rapture  a sense of fullness or refreshmentWhen youve finally figured out how to be with the breath consciously and intentionally and yet can allow the breath energy to feel full in every little cell in the body rapture arisesYou can maintain that rapture by learning how to maintain the right amount of pressure so that youre not squeezing the breath pushing it or pulling it  and some people experience this as a sensation of drowningTheyre so used to breathing in a particular way or having the minds cartoon idea of what the breathing has to do as it comes in and out the body that when they finally give up on that cartoon idea theres a sense of drowningSome people find this really scary but its nothing to be scared of at allSimply sit with itIf the breath is going to come in its going to come inIf its not going to come in dont worry about itYoure not going to dieThe breath will have to come in at some point if it really has toAnd maybe it wont have toMaybe youre getting enough oxygen through your poresSo allow the breath not to disturb anything that feels stillIf you dont disturb the stillness it grows a sense of fullness and with it a sense of easeYou become a connoisseur of your breathingYou learn to really enjoy itThis amount of enjoyment is a necessary part of the path as wellIts the food of your meditationAs you learn to feed off that you start looking at the other things the mind has been feeding on and realize that theyre pretty miserable foodThis is where the sense of nibbida comes inIts sometimes translated as disenchantment sometimes even as disgust or revulsionWhat it means is a sense of having had enough of something and no longer being attracted to it because youve got better food to feed onOnce youre used to good wholesome food you feel repelled by junk foodYou dont crave it any moreA lot of the preliminary work in discernment consists of learning how to maintain a sense of stillness of being centered with a sense of fullness and learning to adjust it as you need it learning to gladden the mind when it needs to be gladdened to release the mind when it needs to be released to steady it when it needs to be steadiedAnd every time you catch it slipping off to feed on something else ask yourself Why are you going thereWhat good do you get out of that kind of feedingA lot of the discernment comes in seeing that the other things youve been feeding on all through your life really are not worth the effortYouve really got something much better hereOnly when youve been able to use the concentration as a basis for overcoming passion especially sensual passion do you have to transcend the concentration itselfThats when your sense of nibbida or disenchantment can turn to the concentration because youve discovered something in the mind that doesnt need to feed on anything anymore even on the pleasure and the rapture the equanimity of concentrationThats when nibbida and viraga or dispassion become totalThats when they can liberate the mindAs you can see the meditation involves a long series of different emotionsThe Buddha sometimes talks about the grief and the joy of being on the pathThose get involved as wellThe grief is simply the realization that there are a lot of dangers in life and you havent reached the goal yetBut you learn how to use even the grief as a spur to your practiceAt the same time it should be combined with a sense of confidence conviction desire leading to the joy that comes when you can actually see yourself making progressThe mind can settle down more than it used to has a greater sense of wellbeing wholeness and fullness than it had beforeYou can take joy in thatSo even though the path involves figuring things out intellectually thats not all it isIts also a matter of learning how to marshal these different emotions some of which are normally regarded as negative samvega grief disenchantment disgustBut they have their uses so learn how to cultivate them all along the wayWithout these emotions the practice doesnt go anywhereWith them it can take you to releaseAjaan Suwat would often begin his evening Dhamma talks by saying to put yourself in a good mood to approach the meditation with a sense of confidence reminding yourself that youre doing something thats very goodIt may be difficult but its goodAnd it requires that you keep yourself in a good mood no matter what happens no matter how poorly it goesGrace under pressure is an important skill in the meditation the ability to smile to yourself no matter what happens  what the Thais call smiling in defiance of the tigersThat ability has saved a lot of meditators from going off course getting discouraged and letting their meditation crashSo whatever comes up in the meditation treat it with good humorThe ability to laugh at yourself is probably one of the most important abilities you have as a meditatorIts a matter of perspective and also of balanceAfter all you have to keep a certain amount of pressure on yourself as you meditateThis is an earnest endeavor were involved in but you cant let it get grimFind out for yourself what exactly is the right amount of pressure to put on yourself and how to apply the pressure skillfullyYouve probably heard the story about the monk who was so delicately brought up that he even had hair on the soles of his feetWhen he spent hours doing walking meditation of course his feet started wearing through getting all bloody and this got him discouragedWell he said to himself maybe Id better return to the lay life That was back in the days when the Buddha was still alive so the Buddha levitated there  dont you wish you had the Buddha levitating to you when your meditation got badThe Buddha came and said to the monk When you were a lay person you used to play the lute right The monk said Yes Well what happened when the strings were too tight They would snap And when they were too loose You couldnt get a good sound out of themThe Buddha then said Its the same with the meditationFirst tune your level of energy the amount of effort you can put into the meditationAnd then tune everything else all the other faculties  conviction mindfulness concentration discernment  to the level of energy you can manage Its like tuning a guitarFirst you tune one string and then you tune the other strings to the first oneIn meditating your first string is the amount of energy at your disposalYou want to put enough pressure on yourself to actually get results but not so much that you snapAnd one good way of putting a lot of pressure on yourself without snapping is to keep a good sense of humor about the whole thing to keep yourself in a good moodThis involves the way you talk to yourself as the meditation goes onWhen things dont go well just drop whatever it is thats not going wellMove back to a level where youre pretty sure you can do things properlyAnd dont engage in a lot of recriminations because they dont help anything at allJust remind yourself that thats not what were here for drop it and go onWhen you develop this sense of good mood you can ratchet up the level of pressure  the amount of time you spend with the meditation the persistence with which you pursue it  without snappingSo whatever comes up in the meditation whether its good or bad or whatever always try to keep a good sense of humorEven when things seem to be going well maintain a good sense of humorDont get swollen up with your importance or your accomplishment because then you get complacent and its easy to crashWhen I went to study with Ajaan Fuang one of the first things that really drew me to him was his sense of humorA good sense of humor usually goes with wisdomThe ability to step back and keep things in perspective Thats what makes you wiseIts precisely what you need as a meditatorSo when things start getting grim when nothing seems to work just step back for a bit and try to regain your good humorYoull find that that more than anything else will carry you throughResearchers have done studies showing that people who regularly suppress their emotions tend to be stupider than people who dontTheyre less observant and have trouble thinking through things clearlyAnd so the question is when youre meditating are you making yourself stupidIt depends on how you meditateBut first you have to understand what it means to suppress an emotion You deny that its thereIn other words suppressing it doesnt just mean that youre simply not expressing it it means that youre also trying to hide it from yourselfThe walls of denial go up in the mindThey make it difficult to think clearly to connect things to see relationshipsAnd it takes a lot of energy to keep those walls up which means you have less energy to observe thingsThis is why suppressing emotions makes you stupidSo as you meditate its important to understand that youre not here to suppress an emotion to deny that it existsYou want to be very clear about whats going on in the mind but at the same time you want to learn how to use the mind wisely to approach your emotions wiselyWhen fear greed anger or delusion come up in the mind its not necessarily helpful to express them outside because sometimes that makes it difficult to observe whats going on tooThere has to be a middle way between the expression and the suppressionThis is importantOften as you meditate you try to tell yourself Dont reactJust be equanimousDont get excitedDont get worked up about things And then you try to convince yourself that thats whats actually happeningYou see ideals of what an enlightened person is like  very calm peaceful equanimous  and you try to clone the calm to clone the equanimityRemember though that Right Cloning is not one of the factors of the PathThe relevant factor is Right Mindfulness having the right frame of reference for dealing with pain and pleasure as they comeIf you view the pleasure simply as something to run toward or the pain as something to fear or run away from youre creating a situation in which the emotions that arise  the liking and the disliking  are going to get in the way of really seeing anythingSo you want to create a different frameInstead of seeing yourself as a person partaking of the pain or the pleasure you want to dismantle that perceptionYou want to have another way of approaching pain and pleasure so that you dont feel threatened by the pain and dont simply indulge in the pleasureThis is why you need a technique as the foundation of your meditationWeve talked many times about meditation as not just a technique but you cant meditate without a technique eitherYou need to view the technique in the context of certain values certain understandings but you cant denigrate technique  because it provides part of your frame of referenceFor example youre dealing here with the breath and you may notice that some ways of breathing are more comfortable than othersThen you begin to realize the connection between the discomfort and the breath the comfort and the breathAnd because the breath is something you can control to a certain extent youve got your handleYou can try breathing in different waysYou can change the rhythmYou can change the texture the depthYou can try heavy breathing light breathing broad or narrow shallow or deepThats changing the mechanics of the breathingYou can also change your perception of the breathWhen you breathe in exactly whats happeningWhats movingAnd whats moving whatOften we have cartoon ideas about the process and those ideas determine which muscles were going to expand which ones were going to contract which sensations we believe have to be part of the inbreath which sensations have to be part of the outbreathBut if you can learn to question those presuppositions you find that the breathing opens upThere are lots more possibilitiesYou can conceive of the body as a sponge When you breathe theres energy coming in and out through every poreIf you apply that perception to the breathing the actual physical sensation of the breathing is going to change as wellThe rhythm is going to changeOr you can think of having an energy core that runs down the center of the bodyThe inbreath comes in to that central core when it goes out it leaves that central coreOr you can think of breathing in and out through parts of the body that normally arent associated with the breathYou can breathe in and out through your legs for example or through your brain or your handsAs you experiment with notions of the breathing you discover lots of varietiesAnd they have different results in terms of feelings of ease or discomfort pleasure or painYou find that patterns of tension in the body that you assumed were a necessary part of having the body sit upright or having the body breathe are actually not necessary at allYou can breathe through them and they begin to loosen upThis leads you to explore other feelings of blockage or pain in the body as wellSay theres a pain in your kneeHow much of that pain is actually the result of physical causes and how much of it is a result of the way youre breathingYou can experiment and in this way the technique gives you a different framework for looking at sensations of pleasure sensations of painIn other words where theres pleasure you realize that to maintain that pleasure you cant just wallow in it or create a sense of yourself as gulping it down because that usually puts an end to itBut if you stay with the breath and maintain your perception of the breathing in the right way you can maintain that sense of pleasure tooIts a positive thingAfter all the pleasure that comes from concentration is one of the factors of the path Right ConcentrationIts something to be developedAs for the pain that also becomes something you can approach with the tools youve learned from your techniqueTry breathing through the tension around the painIf the pain is in your knee you can think of the breath coming in and out right at the kneeOr you can think of it going down the leg and through the pain in the knee and then out through the toesOr if its already coming into the knee you can think of it coming in from the kneecap or coming in from behind the kneeThere are all kinds of ways you can play with your perceptions of the breathAs you experiment with them you find that they have an important impact on the actual feeling of pain and your attitude toward the painYou feel less threatened by itYou begin to develop an inquisitive attitude which as the Buddha said is how you approach the First Noble TruthYou want to comprehend it and that requires you to be inquisitive about pain trying to understand itSo the breathing technique gives you several important approaches for dealing with the painInstead of just sitting here and spinning out over the pain  thinking Here I am sitting and hurting myself by letting my knee get all bent up like this  you can focus instead on Okay what are the mechanics of the painHow do they relate to the energy flow in the body Having a comfortable breath sensation as your basis in some other part of the body gives you a place you can go when the pain gets too much to handleYouve got a place you can turn around and run to and when you have that sense of safety and security then you feel less threatened by the painYoure more inquisitive and at the same time you actually have tools that can lessen the painAnd because your approach is one of being inquisitive rather than trying to push the pain away or squeeze it away your attitude is going to have a huge effect on how you experience the painThere are cases where the change in attitude will make the pain go awayAt other times the pain wont go away but it doesnt matter because youre not involved in trying to feed off the painYou dont find yourself forced to consume the painYoure not a consumer anymoreYoure an experimenter inquiring into Whats the nature of this painHow much does the way you breathe affect the painHow much does your attitude affect the painWhat are you doing that makes the pain hurt the mind After all the pain is something in the bodyIt doesnt have to hurt the mindWere doing unskillful things we have unskillful attitudes unskillful ways of relating to the pain that drag it into the mindWeve got to turn around and look Okay what are we doing that turns the pain into suffering for the mindSo by creating this new frame of reference through the technique youre not suppressing your fear of painYour new frame of reference changes your attitude toward the pain so that you can see it more clearlyWe often believe that our emotions are a given that theyre purely visceral that they come prior to our thoughts but thats not necessarily soA lot of unspoken or poorly articulated attitudes have gotten buried in our minds  a lot of unskillful habits of dealing with pain say that come from way back whenThose are the things that fuel our emotions around painThey also fuel our emotions around pleasureAs we create this new framework though well start stirring up some of those attitudes and calling them into question Who is this me thats been devouring the pleasure and then suddenly finds itself devouring painWho is this consumerAnd is it just consuming or is it also producing the pain producing the pleasure Start questioning these attitudes to get a clearer sense of whats actually going onIn this way youre not trying to clone enlightenment and youre not trying to suppress your emotionsYoure just learning how to deal with your emotions in a more intelligent wayAnd that way the meditation instead of making you dumber actually makes you more perceptive more intelligent better able to see relationshipsIts not a matter of suppressionIts not a matter of pretending that youre awakened when youre notYoure just learning to be very frank about whats actually going on by learning to question your assumptions of what seems to be obvious about whats going onSo the meditation is not a process of programming you to have a certain sort of personality or certain sort of demeanorIts not teaching you to clone anythingIts a series of instructions for how to exploreInstead of piling more denial on top of the denial already there in the mind youre learning how to peel it away and not to be afraid of it not to be afraid of what youre going to find as you peel it away because youve got your tools to deal with whatever comes upThe chants we do in the evening before the meditation are meant to put you in the right frame of mind to do the meditation pointing out skillful ways of thinkingWhether were contemplating the body issues of aging illness death and karma thoughts of goodwill reflection on the nature of the world All of these thoughts are designed to remind you of how important it is to meditateThey also remind you of your motivation for meditationWhether youre here to find something solid in the midst of the world or as an expression of goodwill its useful to remember  each time you sit down to meditate or do walking meditation  why youre doing it the importance of what youre doing so that you do it with an attitude of proper respect and attentionIn other words you dont just go through the motionsYou dont treat it casuallyThis is important work were doing here  a point thats easy to forgetSo we keep reminding ourselves because thinking like this is an integral part of the meditationPeople often believe that were trying to learn how not to think or trying to get the mind away from its conditioning simply by stopping any language from going through the mindBut the Buddhas instructions on meditation involve a lot of thinking training the mind to think in skillful waysBut unlike psychotherapy  which tries to trace your thoughts back to their origins where theyre coming from in time  he focuses on where theyre going where they leadDo they lead you where you want to goAnd he gives some recommendations on ways of thinking that really help you go in the right directionAs you carry through with his ways of thinking part of your mind is going to rebelFor example when you develop thoughts of goodwill there may be a little voice in the back of the mind saying Well I dont really feel goodwill for these people Or I dont give a damn about where my thoughts are leading I want to think about this Dont assume that the purpose of these exercises in directed thinking is to smother up those other thoughts or to pretend they dont existActually the purpose of the exercises is to dig the problems up bring them out into the openIf the question of how you think about the beings in the world isnt brought up you can sail merrily along with all sorts of mixed motives all sorts of mixed attitudes not really being aware of what youre doing or of how your attitudes are coming out in your actionsOr if you have that apathetic feeling It doesnt really matter what I do so I might as well just do what I like  its good to know that its thereThen you can deal with itSo if you find these argumentative thoughts coming up in your mind take note of the factAsk yourself Are you ready to dig into themAre you strong enoughIf you arent you can continue with the meditation leaving them for the time being but at least you know theyre thereThis is importantAs Ajaan Lee once said to practice is to learn about your defilements the things that hide under the surface and exert a lot of pressure and influence on your life often without your knowing itYoure a lot better off knowing theyre there even if you cant quite deal with them yetYoure in a better position knowing theyre there and that theyll have to be dealt withSometimes just bringing them to the surface is enough to make you realize that you dont want to identify with themIf apathy comes up you look at itDo you really want to side with itLook at the lives of other people who are apatheticWhere do they goOr if a voice in your mind has ill will for this or that group of people Is that a voice that you really want to identify withRemember you have the choiceWere not here to hammer out our genuine opinions about things to reach a final judgment on themWere here to see where thinking goes and how to use our thinking in skillful waysThis is part of the trainingIts like training for a marathonOnce youve made up your mind to run the marathon youve got to deal with the thoughts in the mind that resistSome of them you can simply push out of the way as being ludicrous or totally out of line with your real aspirationsOthers you have to sit down with and work throughBut the fact that youve made an aspiration is importantIf youve decided that this is an aspiration you really want to hold to you owe it to yourself to work through all of your resistance because so many of us go through our lives aimlessly without any kind of aspiration at allHere as were meditating weve got a big one putting an end to sufferingAs the Buddha points out in the course of training the mind youve got to learn to deal with skillful and unskillful thoughts  skillful meaning those that lead in the direction of putting an end to suffering unskillful ones those leading in the other directionAt least youve made it clear to yourself where you want to goThat in and of itself is an important accomplishmentEven if you havent devoted yourself  in that direction its important at least that the issue is raisedSo many of us go through life without even thinking about where were headedWe think about it a little bit here and there but not in any concerted way not in a way that makes us sit down and really look at our livesFor a lot of people thinking about the general trajectory of their lives is pretty depressing so they push the issue awayBig issues like aging illness and death get pushed off to the corner until they can no longer be pushed offThen they come out at you with their eyes red and their fangs gleamingYoure not prepared to deal with themOften they hit precisely when youre at your weakest point flat on your backIf you havent prepared for them they come at you while youre downHere while youre meditating at least the issues are raisedYouve got to ask yourself while youre healthy while youre young enough while youre still alive What are you going to do to prepare for the time when aging illness and death and separation move inAnd youre actually given a course of practice something to train in to help you out when those things happenSo when youre given a practice  whether its the precepts or the contemplations that the Buddha recommends  its not that youre going into denial pretending that you dont want to break a precept or pretending that you dont harbor feelings of ill willThese contemplations are meant more to raise the issue Do you really believe that your actions are importantDo you really believe that its important to act skillfullyDo you believe that your thoughts are important that its important to think skillfullyTake some time to probe into those questions because theyre central to your lifeAnd dont let yourself get sucked in by the media out thereTheyd rather that you not ask those questions that you lead a very shortsighted life so youll be content just to buy their thingsSo this is an act of resistance hereIts also an act of wisdomWhen a particular reflection or contemplation brings up uncomfortable issues in the mind realize that thats part of its purpose to bring up those uncomfortable reactions if theyre thereIf theyre not there youre fineIf they are there you want to knowAs I said sometimes when they come up they just wither away in the light of your awarenessOther times you realize that theyre like boulders that have been hidden under the waterThe water has lowered a little bit and now you see that there are boulders down thereYou may not be in a position to dig them up but at least you can avoid them for the time being knowing that someday youre going to have to clear the channelsIn the meantime youre alerted that you have to work on your tools  mindfulness concentration discernment  so that eventually you can dig out those bouldersThen theyll no longer be in the wayGladdening the mindThis is an important skill in the meditationThe Buddha lists it as one of the basic steps in mindfulness of breathingIf your meditation gets dry it starts to seize up like an engine without any lubricantSo you need to keep your mind lubricated keep it refreshed as youre practicingThere are lots of different ways of doing thisAjaan Lee gives the analogy of a parent who hears her child crying and knows when to take it out for some air when to give it something to play with when to feed itIn other words you learn to read the cry and to look at what the child is doing so that you can get an idea of what needs to be done to put the child back in a good moodThe mind is very much like a child  you have to look after its moods every now and thenOne way is to drop the breath for a while and focus on some of the other recollections that the Buddha recommends recollection of the Buddha recollection of the Dhamma recollection of the SanghaWith recollection of the Buddha you remind yourself that youre following a path set out by someone who was totally free of defilement  who had no agendas no ideas he was pushing just for the sake of satisfying or pleasing himselfHe had found what worked and he taught it straightforwardlyNow where are you going to find something like that anywhere else in the worldOne of the reasons why deconstructionism is so prevalent in universities is because people often advance an idea because they want power over other people they want to influence other people to act in ways that are pleasing to themThe purpose of deconstructionism is to see through those agendasBut in the Buddhas case all he asked was that people practice the Dhamma in accordance with the DhammaOn the night of his death when the devas were singing songs throwing down flowers and incense in honor of him he said This is not the way to pay homage to the BuddhaThe way to pay homage is to practice the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma  which means practicing for the sake of dispassion practicing for the sake of disenchantment with things practicing for releaseIn other words you show homage to the Buddha by gaining release from suffering for yourselfThats all he asked forHis was the most compassionate of motivesSo when youre getting discouraged about the path think about the other paths you might be following in life and realize theres nothing quite like this oneEven when you havent yet reached the end of the path its still a good path to be onAnd the same holds true for recollection of the DhammaThink of all the good things the Dhamma has you develop insideOf course being on the path means that theyre not fully developed yet but at least youre headed in the right direction your trajectory is headed to the right placeThe Buddha talks about the grief that comes from not having attained your goal on the path but he said Look its a lot better than the grief that comes from not having sights or sounds or smells or tastes or tactile sensations that you like  he calls that householder grief And where does that grief leadIt leads people to struggling and fighting and grabbing after things that are just going to slip through their fingersWhereas the grief that comes from being on the path doesnt cause strife and it leads in the right directionJust that thought should inspire you to practice further on the pathThe only problem is when the grief gets too heavy the discouragement gets too heavy  thats when you need to gladden the mind by reflecting on all the good things youve done as part of the pathAnd the path is asking you to do only good things things you can be proud of things that feel noble honourableYoure not being asked to compromise your ideals when you practice the DhammaIn fact youre being asked to raise your ideals to a higher standardThen theres recollection of the SanghaWhen your mind feels full of defilement remind yourself that members of the Noble Sangha have all been in the same place you areAnd people of all kinds  men women children rich people poor people educated uneducated healthy sick  theyve all been able to find within themselves the strengths needed to overcome the weaknesses within themIf youre having a long dry stretch in your path read some of the Theri and Theragathas where the monks and nuns tell of long dry stretches in their own practice thirty years or moreAnd yet eventually they still gained AwakeningSo you can take encouragement from thatThen theres recollection of your generosity of your virtue  all the good things youve done as youve been following the pathThis is a valid recollection a good one for gladdening the mind as wellAs for recollection of the devas This doesnt mean you sit thinking about devasYou think about qualities that make a person into a devaThe first is the sense of shame you feel when you think of doing things that are beneath you realizing that youre a better person than thatThe second is fear of the consequences of unskillful actions  which means that you have a wellintegrated sense of self able to deny yourself immediate pleasure thats going to have longterm bad consequences for the sake of actions that may not be so pleasant right now but are going to lead to good results on into the futureThese are qualities that make people devas and you have them within yourselfSo that helps to gladden the mindTheres the story in the Canon of a monk sitting in the forest on a holiday nightOff in the distance he can hear people playing music and having a good time and he feels very discouragedHere he is miserable sitting out alone in the forest and everybody else is having a good timeAnd a deva comes and says Look there are lots of people who really envy you because they see where youre headed as for the people out there having a good time their lives arent headed anywhereSo when the path starts getting discouraging and the mind starts feeling dry these are things you can think about to remind yourself that youre on a good pathIt may be a long path but its a lot better than not being on a path at all or on a path that requires compromises in terms of your ideals in terms of your sense of whats right and honourable and then yields a happiness that laughs in your face and runs awayAnother good way to gladden the mind is with the breath finding ways to breathe that give a sense of ease wellbeing and refreshment both to the body and the mind here in the present momentDont be afraid of those feelings thinking that theyre an attachmentOf course youre going to be attached to them  but its better to be attached to good things than to things that stir up the mind in harmful waysIn the beginning these feelings of refreshment and rapture come and go seemingly without any patternBut over time you begin to realize that they do have a patternWhen you get more and more familiar with them you can tap into them more and more regularlyAnother way of gladdening the mind with the breath is to explore different ways of breathingTry to think of a way of breathing you never thought of before and see what it does for the sense of the bodyThink of the breath energy coming in not from the outside but welling up from withinOr breathing with different parts of the body breathing with your legs breathing with your arms breathing with your fingersNotice which part of the body has been the neglected stepsister  starved of breathenergy  and focus on giving it as much breath energy and attention as you canIn other words use your imaginationIf you feel patterns of tension in the body think of a big knife coming through to cut cut cut cut cut all the patterns of tensionIn other words use your imagination here  not to wander away in fantasy worlds but to explore some of the possibilities in the present momentTry to think of some impossible ways of breathing and then try them  because you can learn a lot about your body that way whats really possible and whats notIts like reading about quantum physicsSome of the things theyve noticed in their experiments as far as they can tell can be explained only by allowing for the idea that certain particles go backwards in timeThat explanation required a real leap of the imaginationTheres so much out there in the world thats counterintuitiveYour sense of the body here in the present moment has a lot of counterintuitive potentials as wellIf you only go with your normal intuition thats all you see what you expect to seeSee if you can surprise yourself with new ways of thinking about the breathSo there are lots of different ways of gladdening the mindAs Ajaan Lee said its like being a good parentYou need lots of different tricks up your sleeveIf the child cries and all you do is feed it every time it cries youre going to end up with a fat grumpy childSometimes the child has to go to the bathroom sometimes its just bored sometimes it needs some fresh air it needs a change of sceneryIf all else fails and nothing in the meditation seems to cheer you up go out and walk around for a whileFind a little job to doNotice some place in the monastery where its not clean where things are disorganized and straighten them outIn other words learn how to find pleasure in doing skillful things of every sortAjaan Fuang once said that when he was a young monk he used to avoid construction projects around the monasteryHed help a little bit and then sneak off to meditateAjaan Lee never said anything about this until they were preparing for the Buddhist year and Ajaan Lee was going to hold a big celebration at Wat AsokaramOne day he said to Ajaan Fuang If you dont help me Im going to die you know So Ajaan Fuang thought about it for a while and finally said to himself Well construction work in the monastery is a form of skillful activityIf I die with a hammer and saw in my hands  well at least I was using the hammer and saw for good thingsSo be the sort of person whos always hunting for something skillful to do because this lifetime is so shortIf you spend your time just being depressed or discouraged you waste so many opportunities for doing goodTheres so much good that needs to be done in the worldStarting from little things like keeping your surroundings clean and neat and working on up Its all worthwhileThere are so many ways you can gladden the mindTheres a story in one of Ajaan Lees talks about an old woman who went to the monastery and noticed that the walking meditation paths werent well sweptSo she swept them and set out some water for washing feetJust that much made her feel cheerfulIt so happened that on her way home she had a heart attack and diedThe next thing she knew she was a deva just from the cheerfulness that came from keeping the place around her cleanThis story illustrates an important principle Whatever you can do to gladden the mind in a wholesome and skillful way is part of your repertoire as a good meditatorTry to make the mind quietTry to make the body quietThere are lots of levels to that quietnessOne means sitting quietly  but of course the body isnt the only thing making noise and chattering awayThe mind is tooAnd just as when you want to hear something very subtle you have to sit very quietly if you want to hear the subtle things going on in your mind you have to make the mind quiet tooFocus it on the breathTry to cut down on all the chatterIf you want to talk to yourself talk about one thingTalk about the breathAsk yourself Is the breath coming inIs it going outWhen it comes in how does it feelWhere do you notice itWhen it goes out how does it feelWhere do you notice itDoes it feel goodDoes it notIf it doesnt feel good you can recommend different ways of changing itTry a little longer try a little shorter deeper more shallow faster slowerFind the rhythm and texture of breathing that feels good for the body right nowIf youre feeling tired try to breathe in a way that gives you more energyIf youre feeling tense try to breathe in a way thats more relaxingYou can talk about these things to yourselfThat kind of chatter is not out of place in the meditationIts called directed thought and evaluation which are two of the basic factors for Right ConcentrationBut otherwise try to keep the mind as quiet as possible  because you want to notice whats going onAnd of course what youre going to notice is that there are a lot of other ideas floating through the mindSometimes they dont just floatThey yell at youThey taunt youThey whisper to youBut you have the power of choiceYou can choose which voices to listen to and which ones to put asideYou dont have to believe everything you thinkYou dont have to obey everything you thinkSo listen carefully to those voicesYoull begin to realize how much they push your life aroundSome of them are wellmeaning voices some of them arentYou dont know where youve picked up a lot of these ideas that you carry around insideOne of the functions of meditation is to give you a place to stand inside and listen very carefully so that you can figure out where these things came fromMore importantly you can see where they leadIf you listen to certain thoughts where are they going to take youAll too often when a thought comes up in the mind its like someone driving up in a carYoure standing on the side of the road someone drives up and says Hop in And so you hop in without asking Where are you goingWho are you If we lived our lives that way wed be dead by nowSomeone would have driven us to a dark place robbed us shot us and dumped our body out the back door of the carBut thats the normal way things are in the mindThoughts come in and you just go with themSo youve got to step backAsk yourself Which thoughts really are my friendsWhich ones arent In other words which ones will to lead to your true happinessWhich ones wontThe chant we recited on friends just now applies both to friends outside and to friends insideThere are true friends there are false friendsYouve got to figure out which is which and to encourage the true friendsNotice that the Buddha said Attend to the true friends earnestly In other words when you figure out that someone really is a true friend you want to encourage that person cherish that person because true friends are hard to come byYears back when I was in Thailand Ajaan Fuang gave me the job of teaching new monks after I had been a monk five or six yearsEvery year wed get a batch of temporary monks coming in because thats the tradition there for young men to ordain for about three or four monthsTheres a textbook for them to study during their period as monksToward the end of the book as theyre beginning to think about disrobing theres a section on lay lifeOne of the teachings covers whos a true friend and whos a false friend because this is a big issue in lifeThe book goes down the list just as we chanted just now People who befriend you to cheat you those who flatter and cajole those who are your companions in ruinous funThose are false friendsAs for true friends the book says those are the ones who are willing to die in your placeAnd every year the comment would come up There are no true friends in the worldThats not really the case of courseThere are someBut you have to look really really hard asking Where is friendship with this person leading meAs the Buddha said if you find someone like that cherish that personWe hear often that the Buddha teaches us nonattachmentActually he teaches nonclinging which is a different sort of thingClinging is when you hold onto something and create sufferingThat he said is something you should try to understandLook for the cause and let goBut in the meantime youve also got the path and thats something you try to developIts something you hold onto as long as you need itYou develop virtue concentration discernmentThese are your friends insideAnd the same principle applies outsideIf you have helpful friends hold onto them cherish themAnd you try to be a good friend a true friend to that person tooSo with regard to the question of holding on and letting go the Buddha said youve got to be selectiveThere are four noble truths to lifeIts not that you let go of them allThe first truth  the suffering that comes with clinging  is something you want to try to comprehendThe cause of suffering the craving that causes you to cling is something you want to let goThen theres the path which you developTo develop it youve got to tend to it youve got to cherish it youve got to hold onto itIts like holding onto the rungs of a ladderIf you try to climb up a ladder without holding onto the rungs you fall offAnd even when you reach the roof  or as Ajaan Suwat said even when youre finished with the path as far as you are concerned you dont need the path anymore but you think of the people who will come behind you and of how easy it is for weeds to grow on the path how easy it is for the path to get obliterated so you still tend to it for their sakeThe same way with true friends If theyve helped you its not that you leave them behindYou show them gratitude because thats one of the most important lessons you can give to other peopleIt reminds them that theres something good in life something that really should be valued because its so rareThats friendship on the outsideAs for friendship on the inside you want to be friends with your wise qualities inside the thoughts that help you that point you in the right directionYou want to learn how to encourage themAfter all meditation is not simply a matter of driving thoughts out of the mindYou first have to learn how to think skillfullyJust listen to all the conversations going on in the mind Should I meditateShould I not meditateNotice all the voices that say No Im too tired I need my rest I want to do something elseAsk yourself Are those your true friendsWhere are they going to take youLearn how to encourage the voices that take you where you really want to goThis is one of the most basic skills in meditationIf you cant master this one you cant do anything else basic like sticking with the breathFor some of us this is easyWeve had parents who encouraged us and weve learned how to listen to those voices of encouragementIf your parents didnt encourage you you have to learn how to train yourself to encourage yourselfThis is part of what they call emotional intelligenceYears back there was an Olympic swimmer  Matt Biondi I think was his nameHe was expected to sweep all the medals in the swimming events but he blew the first eventAll the commentators said Thats itHes probably all shaken upHes going to go down into a tailspin But his coach said Dont write him offHes not that kind of person And sure enough he won all the remaining events  because even though he could have easily gotten discouraged after the first event he knew how to talk to himself to encourage himself so that he didnt give upHe kept his spirits up and kept performing at his bestThats what weve got to do as meditatorsLearn how to talk to yourself so you can stay on the pathWhen things are going well how do you talk to yourself so that you dont get carelessWhen things are not going well how do you talk to yourself to give yourself encouragement to get yourself over those dry patchesThats a basic skill in the meditation learning who your true friends are inside your mind and learning how to encourage themThe Buddha once said that friendship with good people is the whole of the practiceOn the external level that means staying with people who can teach you the practice  because without them how would you know what to doOn your own could you think up the path that the Buddha foundWould you have the stamina to stick with itThe example of other people who have trod the path is what keeps you goingOn the internal level friendship with good people means your ability to figure out who inside your head is your friend and to cherish that friend encourage it listen to itThat ability more than anything else is what keeps you on courseThe mind is like a town meeting lots of people lots of different opinionsSometimes the town meeting is well run  people are reasonable courteous  but often it goes out of controlPeople start shouting and a kind of mob psychology takes overIf youre standing outside the mob its easy enough to see that the people are crazy but if you get down in a mob with enough people who believe say that somebodys a witch you can end up setting her on fireAnd then after its all over you say Gee how did that happenIts the same with the mindEvery now and then some crazy idea comes and takes hold of every voice in the mind and the only way you can not get swept up in the craziness is to step outsideUnfortunately theres no little compartment in your head outside of your brain where you can go to escape the voicesYoure in there with themBut there is an aspect of your awareness thats separate from these voices and finding it is a really important skill in the meditationThere are states of mind that the Buddha called hindrances which can come sweeping through the mindThe problem with each of them  sensual desire ill will torpor and lethargy restlessness and anxiety or uncertainty  is that it blinds youYou start seeing things in line with the hindrance and you lose sight of whats genuinely for your own true benefitIn other words when sensual desire comes along the object really is attractive and you cant stand not pursuing itWhen ill will comes along the person that you dont like is really a bad personThats how it seemsWhen sleepiness comes you can talk yourself into falling asleep taking an extra nap waking up and turning over and falling back to sleep again because the body really needs sleep at a time like thatAnd so on down the listAnd yet after the hindrance has passed you look back on it and realize that you didnt really have to follow through with itYou could have done perfectly well not following the object of your lust or desireYou could have done perfectly well without doing anything nasty to the person that you dont likeIts just that at the time your perceptions were skewedThe Buddha compares each of the hindrances to a different kind of waterSensual desire is water with dye in itSay theres red dye in the water The things in the water look red but when you take them out theyre notIt was just the dye in the waterIll will is like boiling waterIf you try to look down into boiling water you cant see anything clearly because of the turbulenceTorpor and lethargy are like water filled with algaeRestlessness and anxiety are water ruffled by the windUncertainty is like water in the darkEven though the water may be clear by its nature its not in a situation where you can see anything in itWhen the mind is seized by these hindrances you cant really see things for what they areSo youve got to learn how to recognize the hindrances when they come and realize that you dont want to get involved with themIf you can catch them in time in their very early stages you can realize This is a hindranceThis is nothing to get involved with You can separate yourself outThis is one of the basic skills that you need not only as a meditator but also to survive in lifeWhen I visited Ajaan Suwat that last time  hed had some brain damage in his automobile accident  he mentioned that he had the mindfulness to know when his brain wasnt functioning rightHe said that his brain was giving him all sorts of weird perceptionsBut because hed been a good meditator he had developed the mindfulness not to fall in with themThis was very different from my father who developed Parkinsons dementia as he got olderHed see big animals in the house and people committing suicide out in the yard  all kinds of disturbing thingsYoud try to talk him into realizing that they were all illusions but he wouldnt believe youIf there was a black dog in the living room there was a black dog in the living room no matter what evidence you could show that there wasntThis is the difference between a mind thats trained and a mind thats notSo you have to nip these things in the budOtherwise a mob psychology takes over in the mind and its not just voices screaming in your head but also changes in your bodyThe blood starts racing faster the hearts racing faster different feelings of tension and pressure arise in different parts of the bodyWhen youre angry theres a weird feeling in your gutAnd because there are the physical symptoms you say Gee this must be what I really feel But thats not the caseIts just your hormones running amokA hormone gets into your blood and it keeps circulating around in your body even after the particular mind state is goneYouve gotten used to the idea that if youve been angry and the physical symptoms of anger are still in the body then you must still be angryThat makes room for the thought of anger to come back in and take over againSo one thing to remind yourself of is Its just the hormones in the blood and the actual thought of anger comes and goes Its the same with all the other hindrancesJust because theres a physical symptom doesnt mean that the emotion is especially realIts like people presenting argumentsIve been reading through a critique of the monks rules book right now and the person writing the critique has some strong arguments as well as some weak onesThe strong arguments are the ones where he simply points out This is a mistranslation and thats itWhen the arguments are weak thats when he starts getting belligerent throwing in a lot of emotionThis is the way the mind worksWhen a particular defilement knows that it has a weak case it shouts and it screams and it uses every trick it can think of in order to push you into following itSo when things come on that strong learn to recognize them just as the hype of the defilements in the same way that you learn to see through the hype in an advertisementIf all else fails just hunker down for sometimes when these things come on really strong theyve got to run their courseAll you can do is make up your mind that youre not going to fall in line with them youre not going to act under their power and you just hunker down with the breathDont get involved in the conversationsDont get pulled into a shouting matchIts like that storm we had several years back with hundredmileperhour winds There was nothing you could do except stay in your tent or your hut and wait for the storm to passIn the morning when the winds had died down you could come out survey the damage and figure out what needed to be done but while the wind was blowing it was hard to figure out anything at allSo when these strong emotions come blowing through the mind just try to keep yourself separateHunker downAjaan Lee has a good way of viewing these thingsHe says You dont know whos actually speaking in your mindYouve got all those little germs in your bloodMaybe the thoughts in your mind are the thoughts of the little germs passing through your brainOr you may have seen cases of people actually possessed by a spiritMaybe this is a spirit coming and trying to possess your mind In other words learn how not to identify with these crazy voicesAsk yourself If you actually followed through with that particular voice where would it take youAnd if you start getting crazy answers to that question you realize Its impossible to have a conversation here Just hunker downWait for the storm to passWait for the craziness of the mob psychology to run its course but the important thing is that you dont become part of the mobIf you can gain this kind of perspective on your thoughts you can save yourself a lot of griefAs that bumper sticker says Dont believe everything you think Dont identify with everything thats coming through your mindDont fall for the hype of the defilements pressing their caseWhen these things get really strong just hold onto the breath for dear lifeWhen the storm is past youll be glad that you didnt allow yourself to get swept awayTheres a part of the mind thats just awareNo matter what else comes into the mind  greed anger delusion despair depression regret or fear  its just part of the mindTheres also another part thats just aware of these things but it tends to get blocked out when strong emotions come inStill its always there like the hum of the refrigerator always there in the backgroundOr maybe a better analogy would be the hum of the Big Bang the deep Bflat thats still detectable from all directions all the timeOne of the tricks of the meditation is learning to get in touch with that part of the mind not to regard it as something exotic but to have it as the background state of mind the basis of your conscious awarenessThis requires a shift of your center of gravity because for the most part we tend to live in our emotions in our creations in the little worlds we create for ourselvesBut as the Buddha pointed out theres a lot of suffering in those worldsThey all require effort to keep them goingThey have to feed off of somethingWhen the Buddha says that becoming is conditioned by clinging the word clinging can also mean feeding or the act of taking sustenanceAnd the sustenance is the passion of desire  the desire that makes us create these worlds that pulls us into these worlds and impels us to take them as far as they can goTheres always an act of feeding going on  and its stressfulSo youve got to learn how to get out of those little worlds youve created for yourselfOtherwise you can create huge emotional storms that can blow you awayPeople talk about sitting and meditating and being blown away to the point where they cant even sit anymore but if you actually look at the wind from the outside theres no physical wind blowing them off the seatIts just that they let these emotional storms get blown up in the mind and they put themselves in the storms so of course theyre going to get blown aroundWhats important to remember is that theres always an awareness surrounding the stormsIf you can place your center of gravity in that awareness you dont get blown awayIts not that difficult to get out of the storms if you can observe them as they arise as theyre just beginning but theyre hard to extract yourself from if theyre already fullblownSo you need to learn how to change your center of gravity in advance and keep it changedOtherwise the secondary storms  the ones that blow in on the tail of the first storm  can catch you off guardOne of the problems is the impatience that blows up as a separate stormYou get impatient When are these storms going to go awayAnd then you place yourself in that second storm the impatient storm and that can blow you away as wellOr you can get swept up in a storm of boredomA lot of these secondary storms are the ones that throw meditators off balance so you have to watch out for themRemember that theres a space around those storms as wellYou have to learn how to watch those from the outside tooA great deal of the commentary going on in the mind is just this sort of thingYou pull yourself out of the storms whirling around events from the past or future but then you let yourself get caught up in storms of the presentWhen these things come up  regret or impatience or whatever  just watch themThey may seem awfully powerful and awfully real but you can learn to question their realityRemember that although there may be a reality to these things its a created reality  false artificialIts something youre creating right now and you may not even be aware of what youre doingBack when I was younger I used to like to write fictionBasically what a fiction writer does is to inhabit a little mental world exploring what it feels like from insideThe more real you can make that world to yourself the better the story when you write it downWhats uncanny about these worlds is that sometimes a character you create can surprise youThe more real the character becomes in your mind the more it can start doing unexpected thingsWhen that happens you start thinking Maybe this character has its own reality but its actually a figment of your own imaginationThe reason these characters can surprise you is the same reason that you get surprised by things coming into the mind in normal worldcreating thoughtsYoure so oblivious to what youre doing that it can actually surprise youThats when these thoughts begin to seem very real to have an independent existenceWhats happened though is that the part of your mind creating them is behind a wall separated from the part thats watching themThats why they can take unexpected turnsThis is why we have to get the mind really really quiet  both so that we can get closer and closer to the part of the mind that simply observes and to get clearer about where these fabrications are coming fromWhen you can see that second part in operation it offers no surprisesAnd when you get to the point where fabrications offer no surprises you start getting disenchanted with themYou see them for all their artificialityYou can begin to pull yourself out of their worlds more and more consistentlySo whatever storms come brewing up in the mind remember Its just an event in your awareness and theres an awareness surrounding it outside of the stormLearn how to give more weight to that awareness than to the stormsIf youre going to identify with anything  and its natural that we do identify with things all along the path  learn how to identify with that very still awarenessIt may not seem very intelligent very creative but its your salvationIts what you can hold onto thatll keep you from getting blown awayHow many times have you seen people who are very clever very imaginative very creative and then something takes on an independent life in their minds and they can actually end up killing themselves simply because of their thoughtcreationsThey find themselves pushed into all sorts of weird and selfdestructive behavior simply because they cant let go of particular thoughtworlds in their mindsSo for the survival of all thats good and worthwhile in your own mind youve got to learn how to step out of these things realizing that although that simple awareness may not seem interesting or clever its your real friendAnd theres a wisdom in learning how to stay there and watch watch watch not to be impatient to get results not to be impatient to see how things turn outLearn how to be more stable in that watching because the stability is what will allow you to see very subtle things to see the tricks the mind plays on itself the places where it pulls the curtain down or throws up walls to maintain its illusionsYour steady gaze is whats going to enable you to see through those illusionsIn the early stages of the meditation that basic watcher  the observer  may seem as unstable and as fragile as any of the other worlds you might createBut as you get more and more used to placing your center of gravity here you find that its a lot easier to stay here than to keep creating those other worldsThis awareness too is a kind of world and there will come a point where you have to take it apart but in the mean time this is the most stable world at your disposalOver time your center of gravity can begin to shift more and more in this directionOnce its here the qualities of stability and patience and endurance come a lot easier and you come to value them moreAlthough they themselves may not seem all that surprising or entertaining they do allow you to find out some very surprising things about the mindIn particular you learn how to see through this process of creationWhere do these worlds come fromThis is how the Buddha discovered dependent coarising by just watching very patiently putting himself in a position where he didnt get blown awayIts like really good scholarshipEveryone wants to get in on the dialogue of common scholarly assumptions and show that yes they can engage in that dialogue as wellBut the people who say Well stopWait a minuteThese questions dont make senseSomethings wrong here Those are the ones who bring a real advance in knowledgeWhen you step back to get out of a particular dialogue you begin to see its underlying assumptions for what they areThe same thing goes on in the mindThere are little signals and signs that the mind sends to itself and you feel clever in catching their meaning Yes I understand that signal I understand that sign Ill play along with that And then you get sucked into the world of those signals and signsBut it takes real understanding not to get sucked in by the signals to step out of the worlds that those signals createAjaan Suwat once said that one of his greatest insights in meditation was seeing how the mind liked to play makebelieve with itselfYou have these little internal signals and agreements  Well this is this and thats that  and suddenly theres a whole world of becoming just because you thought you were clever in interpreting and catching on to the signsSo sometimes its good to play dumb to say I dont understand this this doesnt make sense And step backThat right there is a lot of the practiceBack when I was in college I majored in historyOne of the big frustrations about majoring in history was that you felt you could never really get to see what it was really like back in the days you were studying aboutStudying about the th century  what was it really likeThink about all the generalizations they make about th century culture in Europe and yet having lived through the th and into the st centuries what kind of generalizations would you say really do justice to the reality of that kind of experienceHow can you sum up a century in a sentence or twoThe more you read the stories that make up history the more you realize they can never take you back thereIts good to reflect on this because look at how we live our lives We tend to live in the narratives that we make about things  what happened in the past what we would like to see happen in the future whats the basic story line looking for development looking for closureHow much does that story line really have to do with realityHow much does it actually stand in the way of our seeing realityThink about that especially as you meditateThere are ways of telling the story of your life that help get you into the meditationFor example you can look at your past suffering recognizing that a lot of it was caused by your own unskillful habits and come to the conclusion that your skillful habits need some workThat kind of story helps bring you into the meditationBut there are a lot of other stories that pull you awayYouve got to watch out for those because they make you impatientThey make you less observant about whats actually going onYou sit here working with your breathMaybe in the back of the mind theres the thought Lets just get this over and done with so we can move onto the next stages which are a lot more interesting So youre not really looking at your breathYoure looking at your plans for the next stage or thinking about whats going to happen tomorrow or whats going to happen the day after thatYoure looking at your thoughts about how much longer youre going to have to be stuck with this until you get resultsThats the kind of story that gets in the way of actually seeing whats happening right here and nowSo when you see those thoughts arising learn how to put them awayThis can be hard because a lot of our sense of who we are is in the storyThis is an area where the teaching on notself is useful to see how artificial and madeup our sense of who we are is and how it gets in the way of the work we need to do in the present momentPeople sometimes believe that the whole purpose of the meditation is to get into the present moment and just stay thereThe Buddha never talked like thatHe always said Theres work to be done in the present moment Thats why you get hereYou want to settle down here with the purpose of understanding the intentions acting here in the present moment because thats the only place where you can really observe your intentions in actionIf theres any greed anger or delusion in the intention youre going to see it only in the present momentAfter its passed that intention is just a memory  and you know how memory tends to color things depending on what you want to see how it fits into a good or bad narrative about yourselfBut its just a narrativeTheres no guarantee that its going to get you to the reality of the intentionThe only way you can really see is by looking in the present momentAnd when the present moment is full of distractions dont think of the process of dealing with your distractions as getting in the way of where you want to goIf you see it simply as getting in the way youre going to overlook it and try to push through it blindlyInstead see it as This is the spot where the Awakening is going to happen where the understanding is going to happen and through the process of watching the breath catching the mind as it wanders off and bringing it back thats where all the insights are going to arise In other words the problems in the present are not something you simply want to push your way through or get out of the way theyre something you want to look into  because the Buddha had an amazing insight about the presentYou may have heard the story that after the night of his Awakening he spent days experiencing the bliss of releaseNot only bliss He learned an awful lot in the course of those daysYou may also know the story of when he was in the forest of simsapa treesSimsapa trees have tiny tiny leaves about the size of a dimeAnd he scooped up a handful of them from the forest floor and asked the monks Which is more the leaves in my hand or the leaves in the forest The monks replied Of course the leaves in the forest are many more than the leaves in your hand And the Buddha said In the same way what I learned in the course of my Awakening is like the leaves in the forestWhat I have brought out to teach is like the leaves in my hand And he focused on the four noble truths as being the leaves in his handThere are other passages where he boiled down the basic insight he gained in his Awakening even further Its a simple principle of causalityWhen you think of all the amazing things he could have talked about its interesting that this is the one he found most worthwhile to teachHis insight was basically that our experience is based on two kinds of causal patternsOne is that when x exists y exists with it when x ceases y does tooIn other words these things come and go togetherThis is causality happening right in the present momentThe other principle is that from the arising of x comes the arising of y from the passing away of x comes the passing away of yThis connection doesnt have to happen immediately in the present momentIt can occur over timeWhen you put these two principles together they mean that any moment of experience is the combination of three things the cause arising in the present plus the effects of that cause and effects coming in from the pastAnd what is that causeYour present intentionAnd where are the effects from the past coming fromPast intentionsThis means we have free willOur intentions shape our lifeAt any moment we can choose what to focus on what to do what to say what to thinkWere not compelled by the pastThere are influences coming in from the past but we can choose which influences were going to let pass which ones were going to work on which ones were going to pick up and what were going to do with themThats what the whole fabric of our experience of time and space comes from the constant input coming from intentionAnd the Buddhas insight was that if you look at where the new input is coming from youll see the way outAnd where are you going to see that new inputRight here right at the intentions in the present momentYou really want to get to know these wellThe best way to get to know your intentions is to set up one intention to see how long you can keep it going and to see what other intentions are going to come in and try to change itThen you learn the skills needed to maintain that original intention  as long as it was a good oneHere the intention is to stay with the breath and to think about the breath to evaluate the breath to make it more comfortable so that you can stay here longer to give more support to your original intentionAs you get more and more sensitive to the breath you find that you also get more and more sensitive to those intentionsThose are the real causal factors in your lifeWhats dismaying about them especially in the beginning of the practice is to see how random they areThis little intention fires off and goes in one direction and then another one comes and goes in the exact opposite direction or other ones come from all over the placeBut dont let yourself get discouraged when you see thisLearn the skills you need to focus on a skillful intention and stay there in the midst of all this randomnessThe randomness helps remind you how artificial your storyline isStorylines if theyre going to maintain your interest have to have a clean trajectoryThere may be a few setbacks here and there to make the story interesting but eventually theres one overall trajectoryIts like the basic shape of a melodyIt may be an arcIt may be a valley between two peaksAnd the individual notes may play around with that go outside of the basic arc a bit but theres a basic shape to what we hearThats what makes the melody satisfyingWhen were creating a narrative out of our lives were trying to string together only the intentions that make sense that seem to fit into a basic shape but when you meditate look at what youve got here intentions running all over the placeThats an important insight right thereEven though its the dismaying insight that comes from seeing how unconcentrated your mind is its a valuable insightIf you take it to heart and use it skillfully itll help deconstruct any narratives that are getting in the way of your practiceThis way youll find it easier to settle down with less and less distractionWhen you can let go of the narratives theres really a lot here to discoverWhether the meditation goes well or not whether it goes in line with your expectations or not thats just another narrativeThe important thing is that you really look at whats right here right now particularly with regard to your intentionsYou have your intention to stay with the breath and whoops theres another intention going off someplace elseBring your focus back to the breathYouve learned something about the mind right thereThe act of bringing it back strengthens your original intention strengthens your resolve and the fact that youre able to catch the mind as its wandering off strengthens your mindfulness and alertnessSo whether things are progressing at the rate youd like to see in your ideal narrative thats not the pointThe point is that youre looking and youre learningSometimes you may have more lessons to learn than you originally thought but if you dont start from where you are where are you going to start fromIf the picture of what your mind is doing in the present moment doesnt fit into your ideal narrative maybe its time to question the narrative and not get impatient with the present momentBecause what is impatienceImpatience is the part of the narrative that makes us judgmental in an unskillful wayWe need our powers of judgment but what turns powers of judgment of being judicious into being judgmental is that we get impatientWe want to come to a decision really quickly before all the evidence is in and as a result the judgment is useless  one more obstacle in the way of seeing things as they actually areSo give the present moment some spaceDont push it too hard thinking youve got to get this or that result in this or that amount of timeReally look at whats going on here without impatience without the narrative that gives the push to impatienceThats when youll get to see whats interesting and unplanned  because the spot where intention enters into the causal pattern the route by which it enters in is also the route by which youre going to get outAnd its right hereIts not in the past its not in the future its right hereAllow yourself to settle down right here and that way youll get to see it to know it and to follow it to releasePatience is an important quality in the practiceThe Pali word for patience khanti also means endurance the willingness to stick with things over the long haulAnd although the practice is a long haul this willingness to stick with things over the long haul translates into the present moment as meticulousnessYoure very careful in the steps youre following right now step by step by step not jumping over any steps not trying to leap from the first floor to the fifthYoure willing to go up the stairway one step at a time paying careful attention to what youre doingYoure willing to put your trust in the little things you can do in the present moment confident that theyll build into the bigger results you wantWe all want the big resultsWe want major happiness major peace major clarity in our mindsWhen we look at the stepbystepbystep increments we have to follow we sometimes get impatient and dont trust themHow could little things like this build up to such big things as release liberation nibbanaThats what we thinkAnd yet its precisely the little unskillful things that get in the way of the big results we want so we have to pay careful attention to them each time the mind pulls away from the desire for peace or the desire for true happinessIts a little pull but over time it adds up to a major habitThe best way to fight this habit is with a path thats made out of little steps that add up over time as wellAt the same time the willingness to look at the details means that your powers of perception your powers of insight get very sharpThere are times when your practice seems to hit a plateau and its not going anywhereAt times like that if you turn around to look at what youve been doing youll realize that you havent been looking very carefullyIn other words your meditation has been put on automatic pilot and youre not paying much attentionYoure just going through the motions so the results just go through the motions as wellThe cure for this lies in being very sensitive and precise about what youre doingFor example focusing on the breath Be really precise about any tiny little bit of tension or discomfort or disease in the breathDont slough over it because paying attention to the little details is what brings you more and more into the present momentIf youre sloughing over the details youre sloughing from the past into the future and skipping over the presentSo pay close attention to each breath to how the process of each breath feels in different parts of the bodyAs you develop your sensitivity working through whatever tension you detect you move from where its really tense to where its less and less tense until things are so calm that you can detect even the slightest bit of tensionWork through it work through it even though it may seem like a little thingIf you leave it it may turn out to be a seedIt may grow into something largerTheres a story in the Canon of a creeper seed that lands next to a sala treeThe devas in the other trees come around to comfort the deva in the sala tree saying Have no fearHave no fearDont worry about that seedMaybe a fire will burn it or a woodsman will chop it or step on it or a peacock will eat it or maybe its not even a seed Well it turns out to be a seedIt sprouts and grows into a creeper and the creeper grows up around the treeAt first the deva in the sala tree doesnt understand why her friends were so concernedAfter all the creepers tendrils seem soft downy and tenderBut then as the creeper grows bigger and bigger it finally forms a canopy over the whole tree pulls down the major limbs and destroys the treeThats when the deva realized why her friends were so concernedThis is one of the reasons why you have to be careful about little things because sometimes theyre seeds that can growAt the same time when youre attentive to little things youre beginning to plant your own seeds in the mind as well different kinds of seeds seeds of stronger mindfulness stronger alertness stronger willpower determinationAll the perfections needed for Awakening start with the little things and they keep growing in little steps little steps through your being very very attentive very very precise in what youre doingAt the same time though you cant be tense in what youre doingYou just watch things very carefullyThis is why theres so much emphasis on keeping a broad sense of awareness in the meditationIf your awareness gets very narrow and tense its hard to maintainBut if your range of awareness is broad and yet your attention to the details of your focus is precise and sharp that state of awareness is not just easy to sustainIt sustains itself and becomes a source of strength for the mindIn that way it sustains youYou want to apply this same attention to detail to all aspects of your life  not only while youre sitting here with your eyes closed but also when youre dealing with other people doing work out in the orchard or at the guesthouse whatever your activityYou want to be as precisely with the present moment as possible so that skillful or unskillful states when they arise in the mind dont pass by unnoticedThis is what it means to be uncomplacent in your practice of concentrationAs we chanted just now One who sees danger and respects being heedful Well the danger comes from little things because little things can turn into big things and sneak up on you from behindTheres another passage in the Canon where the Buddha describes four things you shouldnt overlook simply because theyre smallOne is a small fire another is a small snake another is a small prince  the prince may be small right now but in a couple of years he can grow up and he can carry a grudge from age three to who knows how farThe fourth one is a young contemplative because sometimes young contemplatives have gotten further in their meditation than you might assumeIf you treat them with disrespect that disrespect can backfire on youThose are outside small things that you shouldnt be careless or complacent aboutThe inside ones though are even smaller and yet they can do even more damage on the unskillful sideOn the other side small skillful things can do you a lot of good if you look after themSo dont despise the little victories you achieve in your meditation dont be careless about the little defeats because its step by step by step that you get more and more precisely into the present moment which is where things are going to open upIf youre not paying careful attention here youre not going to see the openingSo focusing on the little things is not a distraction from the larger issues of the practiceIts actually in the little things that the larger ones appearSo always keep this point in mind especially when your meditation has hit a plateau or seems to be sliding downhillOften its a problem of not paying careful attention of simply going through the motionsAjaan Suwat would often describe this as not having enough respect for the little things that youre doing each momentSo try to meditate with an attitude of lightness but at the same time a sense of respect of real dedicationThats how the principles of endurance and patience which sound like longterm principles translate into the present moment being meticulous in what youre doing right here right nowThoughts come and go but we keep trying to make them stayIn fact weve gotten pretty good at making them stayWithout that habit we wouldnt be able to speak to hold conversations to think anything throughSo this habit has its uses but also its drawbacksIt can weigh us down with all kinds of suffering all kinds of stress when the mind goes overboard in its thinkingThe skill in meditation is learning how to think when you want to how not to think when you dontIts not a process of putting yourself into a totally blank state where no thinking is ever possibleAt the same time its not a process of ceaseless thinkingIt means learning the right time and the place for your thoughtsThe problem is that the mind keeps churning out thoughts at the wrong time and the wrong place  thoughts you dont want but they still come inSometimes it seems that the less you want them the more insistent they are in comingThis shows that youve left an opening for themBut before you can see this opening to find exactly what youre doing that admits those thoughts thats fascinated by them you have to get the mind as quiet as you canThis is why in the process of meditation theres a rhythm between periods when you want to keep the mind as quiet as possible and others when you want to investigate and exploreTheres a rhythm to the practiceAnd the mind has its own rhythms tooSometimes it seems like nothing is going on in the mind at other times there seems to be nothing but disturbanceThe skill in the practice lies in learning how to make use of whatever level of concentration youve got to deal with wherever you are in the rhythm of the mindIn periods when the thoughts seem to be few and far between you cant let yourself be complacentBuild up your concentration as solidly as you can so that when the next wave of really obsessive thinking washes over the mind youll have stronger tools for dealing with it stronger tools for not getting swept awayWhen thoughts come in remind yourself that theres always a part of the mind thats not involved in the thinkingThis is easier to realize when youve been working on developing a large frame of reference for your concentrationOnce the breath gets comfortable immediately expand it and let that comfortable sensation spread to other parts of the bodyGet used to having this enlarged frame for otherwise if your mind is totally onepointed focused on being aware of only one little point of the body it gets easily knocked overOne thought can come in and totally overwhelm that one little point without much effort at allYou suddenly find yourself with your concentration destroyed and your mind splashing all over the placeBut if your area of awareness has a broader base  all the way from the feet up to the head all around the body  and if you think of your awareness as a porous space then when the thoughts come and go theres space for them to go through without running into anythingThey just go out the other sideThat way your concentration doesnt get knocked over by the thoughts both because its large and because it doesnt put up a surface of resistanceYou could put up that surface if you want and sometimes its wise to but sometimes it seems to make the thoughts more obstreperousSo if you have to let them in okay let them in but then just let them goThink of the body as a large field of energyTheres nothing solid thereA thought comes in and has nothing to run against so it runs out the other sideThis way you begin to realize that theres nothing you necessarily have to fear about thinkingYou have the choice of focusing on your thoughts or not whichever you wantWhen you realize that you always have another place to focus you can have control over your thinkingYou just switch back to that mode of that enlarged awareness and stay leaving the thoughts to pass away on their ownNow dont think that that enlarged awareness is the Buddhas unconditionedIts more like his reference to the word dhatu which means propertyBack in the Buddhas time they talked about the different properties that make up the body different properties found in the mindThe basic idea behind the concept of dhatu or property is closer to our word potential Theres a potential that gives rise to things when it gets aggravated disturbed or provokedWhen theres no provocation everything stays very stillThis is how they explained fireThey said that the fire potential lies latent in everythingIf you stir it up with a little friction from a fire stick  or nowadays with a match  that aggravates the fire potential and it bursts into flameBut even when its not aggravated the potential is still thereThe mind is like thatTheres a potential for thinking in every little cell of the body it seemsIn every little speck of your awareness theres the potential for a thought to arise if it gets provokedWhen things are still and empty in the mind its simply because nothings been provokedIt doesnt mean that theres no possibility of new things coming outIts just that they havent been aggravatedSometimes theres a strong sense of light that goes along with the stillness and again thats not the light of the unconditionedIts the light of these potentials their energy just waiting to be provokedSo even when nothing seems to be going on in the mind dont get complacentKeep trying to develop your concentration even furtherDevelop this sense of space so that youre really proficient at it so that you can maintain it all the timeDevelop a degree sense of awareness so that when something does get provoked youre quick to see itPart of you will say Oh I thought there was nothing there but the potential for disturbance has been there all alongIts like children in a classroom  at least back in the old days when teachers had some authorityAs long as the teacher was in the classroom the kids were quietTheyd wait until the teacher left the room before theyd start running aroundIf the teacher came back in theyd sit down and get quiet againMy older brother tells a story from when he was in grade schoolHe had a really sharp teacher MrsLaneOne day she left the classroom and went downstairs to the restroom to have a smokeThe kids of course started running around the classroom until they heard her coming back up the stairsEverybody then sat down very quietly  except for my brother who was so excited that he continued running aroundSo of course he got caughtLater after the class MrsLane took him aside and said Look GalenYouve got to learn how to be sneakyListen for when I come up the stairs and then stop running around She was a sharp teacherEven though she was downstairs in the restroom she knew what was going on upstairsBut she was also wiseThe way she spoke to him gave my brother the feeling that she was on his sideShe knew he wanted to have some fun and she was showing him how to do it in a harmless wayMindfulness and alertness are like teachers of the mind and youve got to train them to be sharp and wiseWhen alert mindfulness fills the body fills your awareness then your random thoughts get very quietBut your thoughts are sneakyAs soon as mindfulness slips a little bit a new thought forms in the cornerThen it spreads out to fill up all the areas abandoned by your mindful awarenessBut if you can reestablish that larger frame that larger field of awareness the thought can go through the field and not do any damageIt can do its thing but it wont knock over the frameBut this means that youve got to be very alert very noncomplacentAnd that requires workThen again thats what concentration is Its workBut at least its pleasant work work in the right direction giving us a frame of reference from which we can look at our thoughts with more detachment with less involvement less identificationThis doesnt mean that theres no sense of identification at all thoughActually youve just switched your identificationInstead of identifying with the thoughts you identify with that larger frame that larger field of brightened awarenessNo matter how much you contemplate the teachings on notself the process of identification doesnt end all at onceIt moves from things that are blatant and obvious to things more subtle and refinedOnly when youve pared it down consistently to the refined level can you let it go entirelyThe important point at the beginning is that you learn how to use it so that you dont latch on to things that are blatantly harmful thoughts that pull you off into greed anger and delusion thoughts that stir up any of the unskillful potentials in your mindSo this particular step in the meditation  once the breath gets comfortable start spreading your awareness to fill the whole body and then allow that comfortable breath to fill the whole body as well  is an extremely important part of the meditationIn the Buddhas steps for breath meditation step number three is just this step You train yourself to breathe in and out sensitive to the entire bodyThe Buddha puts this step right up there toward the beginning because its so fundamentalWhen he talks about a mind in concentration he calls it mahagattam cittam  enlarged awarenessThe images he gives for the states of right concentration are all images of enlargementWhen youre first allowing that sense of ease and pleasure to permeate the body he says its like a bathman or a bathmans apprentice who would knead water through a ball of bath powderBack in those days they didnt have soap they had a powder like flour to bathe withTheyd make a dough out of the powder by kneading water into it until no part of the ball of dough was dry and yet the water wouldnt ooze or drip outThis is the stage of working the initial sense of ease and pleasure throughout your whole bodyIn the second and third levels of jhana theres a similar process but with less effortYou let the pleasure or rapture corresponding to that state permeate pervade your whole awareness suffuse your whole bodyThe image given by the Buddha is of a spring of cool water welling up from the bottom of a lake permeating the entire lakeAs for the third jhana which is more quiet and less of an intensely rapturous state he said that its like lotuses submerged in a still lake permeated entirely by the water of the lake from their roots to the tips of their budsWith the fourth jhana the image is of a person with a bright cloth covering the whole body the same way your bright awareness fills the whole bodySo its obvious from these images that jhana is a state of broadened awarenessAnd this broadened awareness is really importantFor one thing it gives you a firm basis so that you dont get knocked over by distracting thoughtsAt the same time it allows your vision to become more allaround degrees allaround so that youre aware of all the little potentials in the body all the little potentials in the mind that can get provoked in one way or anotherThat way you can be quicker and quicker to see the very early stages of provocationWhen the slightest stirring comes youll notice itIts not quite a physical stirring at first nor is it really mentalIts on the borderline between the twoWhen you latch onto it there will be a little bit of tension that you create in the body to provide a place for the mind to stay latched onThis is how the stirring turns into a swellingIn this way thinking is both a mental and physical processIf you have this broadened state of awareness you can dissolve the little swelling before it turns into a thought and can take over your whole awarenessAs you stay with the breath energy in the whole body youre operating right on the borderline between body and mind between physical and mental phenomena  right where those thoughtpotentials begin to swellYou can deal more quickly with the beginning of anything any potential that would come either in the body or the mindThis is why concentration is such an important state for gaining insight  because it improves your visionYour vision becomes more allaround more precise focused on the area where things get provoked this interface between body and mindThen if you want to think you can thinkIf you dont you dont have toWhen the time comes to think the mind will have been properly restedYour thinking will be a lot clearer more to the pointWhen the time comes to stop you keep your thinking under controlIt doesnt keep riding out in all directionsMost peoples thinking is like an uncontrolled nuclear chain reactionOne little neutron shoots out runs into another nucleus which sends out more neutrons which keep on multiplying until suddenly the whole thing explodesConcentration is like exerting control over the reaction building a reactor and inserting graphite rods to make sure the reactions dont go out of controlIf you want to shut everything down you can insert all the rods all the way in and everything will be stillThat doesnt mean that the potential for a reaction isnt there just that its been stilledIf you need to think pull the rods out a little bit to get just the reaction you wantWhen the thinking has done its work you push the rods back inThis way when thoughts come and go you get whatever use you want out of themThey dont take over your mindYou stay in chargeWhen you meditate its easy to get frustratedHere you are looking at the breath and as Ajaan Lee says Just four concentrations and you cant master them The mind keeps slipping off and no matter how determined you are to stay with the breath you find yourself someplace elseOften it doesnt seem like the meditations heading in any particular direction  just kind of mucking around  and you wonder What does this have to do with the DeathlessWhat does this have to do with true happiness Thats when its time to step back and look at the larger perspectiveThe big issue of course is your mindNo matter where you live no matter where you go youve got the mind right thereIf you cant keep it under any kind of control at all youre living with something very dangerous because all kinds of things can happen to itA slight chemical imbalance in the body and the mind gets really depressedIt cant seem to pull itself out of the depressionOr it starts hallucinatingThere are all sorts of things the mind can do all kinds of things the brain can doIts important to keep a distinction between the mind and the brainThe brain is the physical organ while the part of the mind were interested in is just basic awarenessWe use the organ to think but if the organ is damaged in any way out of balance in any way then our thoughts become our enemiesAnd what are you going to do thenIf you have enough mindfulness to pull yourself out of your thought worlds youre safeIf you have enough mindfulness to pull yourself out of anything the mind does youre safeWe talk about the mind clinging the mind hanging on to things but it doesnt have hands to clingWhen it clings to something it just keeps thinking about it over and over and over again it keeps wanting it over and over and over againTo let go of the clinging means that you just let it stopAnd the only way you can let it stop is to get out of it and see it simply as an event in the mindThe last time I went to visit with Ajaan Suwat before he passed away he commented that his brain was sending him all sorts of weird messages and hed learned that he had to put a question mark after everything that came into his mindBut he said that thing I gained from the practice That hasnt gone away That thing was what enabled him to pull out of those messages in order to see that they were strange weird messages and that he didnt have to believe themHe had a foundation so even as the brain was churning out weird perceptions he had access to a dimension where he didnt have to get involvedAs we meditate were working in the direction of that dimensionThe first step is to establish a safe place through concentration to keep our awareness based a place where its protectedAnd thats worth all kinds of effort all kinds of discouragement all the things we have to go through in order to get there because the real sense of solidity and safety that comes with that is more than you can imagineYou realize how long youve been wandering around misled by your thoughts and how totally deluded you were and how much suffering it causedThen when you can step out  really step out even out of that base of concentration  an enormous burden is liftedIn its place you gain both a sense of the solidity of that new dimension and the confidence that nothing can touch it because its outside of space and timeAs for whats going to happen inside of space and time thats a matter of karmaEven awakened people have to age grow ill and die but theyve found the dimension that doesnt age doesnt grow ill doesnt dieAnd how did they find itBy doing what were doing right nowEvery time a thought comes up heres your chance Are you going to fall for the thought or are you going to step back from itThe thoughts may be crazy they may be things you dont want to think about but as long as youre able to step back from them youre in a good positionThis place where youre stepping back may not be as totally solid as youd like it but its heading you in the right directionIf you dont have this you have no safety at allTheres no protection no perspective at allWithout the perspective theres no wisdom no insightAnd without insight youre totally immersed in delusionWhat is it like to be totally deludedYoure totally unsure of thingsDeep down inside things dont seem quite right and theres always an element of fearAs the Buddha said As long as youre uncertain about the true Dhamma theres always the fear of death Whats going to happen when you dieThe only way you can know is by looking at the processes of the mind because its already going through death and birth on a small level all the timeIt just keeps coming back coming back coming backWhatever habitual patterns youve been encouraging in the mind they just keep coming back again and again and againBut the fortunate thing is that you can step out of themThis is what the Buddhas teachings on karma are all aboutNot everything is predetermined in the mindWith every present moment theres always the opportunity to make a new decision to make a new choice but most of us abandon that freedom and just keep flowing along with the same old patterns over and over and over againWe need to learn to appreciate our ability to step back and get some perspective to pull ourselves out of our thought worldsNo matter how fleeting your stepping out may seem as youre practicing each time you do it youre strengthening the skillful habit in the mind the habit thats actually your pathAjaan Maha Boowa tells of how when Ajaan Mun passed away he was really hit with a sense of despair What was he going to do with his life nowWhen issues came up in his meditation to whom would he go for helpHe said he felt like someone whod been depending on a doctor for long years and now the doctor was goneIt was like being a wild animal in the forest with no doctor at allBut then he remembered all the teachings hed gotten from Ajaan Mun in the pastThose would have to be his teachers nowAnd what was the point that Ajaan Mun emphasized more than anything elseWhenever anything comes up in your mind that youre not sure about just step back and stay with that sense of the knower that sense of just basic awareness and no matter what whatever it is in the mind will pass and youll be safe It seems like such a little thing just the sense of the watcher the observer but it can keep you safe because its the faculty of the mind that can pull you outEven when storms are blowing through the mind youre in a safe spotYouve got your haven right hereJust dont let yourself get pulled into the storms because they can blow you all over the placeThe Buddha once said Look at the animal worldSee how variegated it is  all those many many many kinds of animals all the different shapes they take all the different ways they live Then he added The mind is more variegated than that It can get itself into all kinds of fixesBut youve also got your protection right hereIts right close to handIts closer than your eyesThe point in meditation is to learn how to appreciate it how to value itEven though it may seem unstable right now keep coming back coming back coming backIf you dont what lies in storeYou get blown around in the whirlwind like the shades in Dantes InfernoIf you do step back though you find that youre strengthening a very important habitEach time you remember to come back builds a pathway in the mindWhen you come to meditate in a place like this its as if youve got your nose above water youve pulled yourself out a little bit from the floodThats what they call it  the flood all these things that come pouring out of the mindIf youre not careful they can totally immerse youYou can drownBut here youve got your nose above waterYou can breatheIt may not yet be the most stable position but the Buddha says that it can become your islandYouve got your island in the midst of the flood hereIt may not be a big island but its big enoughAs you develop it it opens up to even better things in the mindWithout this sense of awareness what would you haveNothingNothing to hold onto at allYoud be swept around in the storms that the mind cooks upWith this though you have hope  and its not a faroff hopeIts something right hereIf you learn how to value it itll open up and show you all it has to offer  more than you can imagineIts like one of those fairy tales where theres the ugly little troll under the bridge who as it turns out has gold stashed awayThe valuable things in life are often in the places where youd least expect to find them and theyre closer to home than you might thinkSo keep this in mindYouve got gold right here but its covered up by dust and dirt and the dust and the dirt can be cleared awayAside from this gold you have nothingWith the gold you have no more needsTry to gather your awareness around the breathMake the breath your center a center from which you can act speak and have a sense of a good foundationIn Pali the word for the object of the mind arammana literally means a support for the mindWhen you meditate you want to find a good solid support because when your support is solid you can deal with whatevers coming at you from whatever direction whether thoughts inside the mind or things people do or say from outsideYour response  if it comes from a solid foundation  is coming from a position of strengthWhen you come from a position of strength the things you do say and think are well thought outThey arent desperate arent graspingIf your center is based on things outside  if youre really concerned about what this or that person thinks about you  youre putting yourself in a very weak uncertain positionYour foundation isnt solidWhen it isnt solid the things you do arent well basedWhen I first went to Thailand I taught at Chiang Mai UniversityOne of the things I learned in my spare time there was Thai boxingWhen youre first taught Thai boxing all the emphasis is on your stance  the stance from which youre going to hit or kick your opponentIf the stance is solid youre coming from a position of strengthThis may sound a little aggressive but its an important point to remember as you go throughout lifeWhen youre dealing with other people when youre dealing with all the issues in your mind you want to come from a good solid position so you can deal with these things effectivelyThe breath is always hereWhen youre at ease with your breath when you feel comfortable with your breath youve got a good foundationThats where you can take your stanceThen when you respond to things youre coming from a solid positionYour response is more precise more on targetSo try to practice coming back to the breath back to the breath because this is a foundation youve got to buildIt may seem artificial at first but as you get more and more used to it you find that it really does provide a sense of being at homeOne of the Pali terms for a concentrated mind vihara dhamma means just that a home for the mind a place where you feel safe where you feel solidly protected not only from things outside but also from all the issues that come bubbling up from inside as wellBecause the biggest problems in life are not the events from outside but in how you react to themEven before events come at you from outside things come bubbling up from within the mindSometimes anger comes up in the mind and then you go looking for something to be angry aboutIts not in response to anything outside its simply an urge coming up in the mindThen you go out to focus on something outside that you decide you dont like and the anger builds on thatThe same with lust with fear and anxiety Sometimes the feeling comes bubbling up and then you look for an object for it to focus onSo its not the case that all problems come from outsideActually most of them come from within but the fortunate thing is that not everything inside is problematicYouve got good qualities in here as well so you want to give them a place to gather so they can pool their strengthThats why you need this foundationWhen youre staying with the breath youve got mindfulness the ability to keep something in mindYou keep reminding yourself Stay right here with the breath And then theres alertness You watch the breath as it comes in goes out you know whats happeningIts right thereWhether its comfortable or not you knowIf its not comfortable you can change itThis is called evaluationThe basic indicator is Does the breath feel good or not For the Buddha the big issue in life is suffering so we start with a minor version of it  a minor sense of discomfort coming from the breathWhy breathe in a way thats uncomfortableNobodys forcing youIts your own lack of attention that allows the breath to get uncomfortableSo pay attention and then learn to work with the breathSee what kind of rhythm feels good because when the breath goes well it gives you strength a sense of wellbeing a sense of being nourished around which all your other good qualities of mind can gatherWhen they can gather together they strengthen one anotherSo even though staying focused on the breath may require time and effort its an important skill for once you have this center its here not only when you sit with your eyes closedWherever you go theres the breathWhen you learn to relate to the breath in a good way you have a good relation going on insideIn other words you learn to treat the breath with goodwill You want the breath to be comfortableWhen you find that its not comfortable you work to help it Thats compassionWhen it is going well you help to maintain it Thats appreciationAnd when it gets to the point where its as good as you can get it you cant get it any better than that you say For the time being this is as good as its going to get lets sit down and just be right here Thats equanimityIf you learn to relate to your own breath in these ways it becomes a lot easier to relate to events and people outside with the same qualitiesIf theres a turmoil inside then the turmoil tends to affect your relationships with other peopleThe way you relate to yourself inside forms the pattern the template for how you relate to people outsideSo you want to establish a good relation in here a good family relationship with all these good qualities mindfulness alertness your discernment in telling whats comfortable and whats not your ingenuity in figuring out ways to make things more comfortableAnd the qualities of goodwill compassion appreciation and equanimity  they play a role here as wellWhen you learn to relate to the breath with these qualities of mind then every time you get in touch with the breath the qualities can be there as wellThey nurture and inform the way youre going to react to whatever comes up wherever you areWhether its at work or at home or between work and home whether youre alone whether youre with other people  when youve got this good relationship going on inside when you feel at home with all these good qualities in the mind then you can tap into them whenever you wantSo this ability to find a center to establish a foundation in the mind is one of the basic skills we need to be happy to be friends with ourselvesThe chant just now on true friends and false friends doesnt refer just to people outsideIt also refers to qualities of mindSome qualities in the mind  like greed anger and delusion  are false friendsThey come promising all kinds of things and then they dont deliverThey run off to desert you leaving you worse off than beforeThose are your false friends insideThe true friends are the ones who are really helpful like the good qualities were trying to gather around the breath hereSo you attend to them earnestly as the chant saysTry to keep these qualities informing the way you relate to the breath and that becomes the foundation from which you relate to things in all your activitiesWe have a whole hour to work at this skill a skill that you dont leave here when the hour is up but that you take with youIt becomes the basic pattern for how you relate to the body how the mind relates to itselfIt cuts through a lot of the unnecessary stress and frustration unnecessary turmoil in the mindSo look at this hour as an opportunity to provide yourself with a centerAnd then after the hour is over take the center with you wherever you go because its always hereThe breath is the point where the mind and the body meet and as long as youre alive youll have this breath right hereIf you can learn to be at home right here youre going to have a home wherever you goAs a result wherever you go will be your own spaceA large part of our life is spent in feeling that somehow other people have taken possession of our space and we need to depend on their approval so that we can occupy their spaceBut thats not the case hereThis is your spaceWhen youre happy and comfortable inhabiting your space youre coming from a position of strength and wellbeing at all timesIn one of Ajaan Lees last Dhamma talks he compared life to taking a boat across an oceanThe problem out on the ocean is that theres no fresh waterFor most of us meditation is like stopping in a port picking up some fresh water and putting it in the boatThen we go out to sea and discover that weve run out of water so we have to go back to portAs a result we dont get very farIf were not careful the winds will blow us away from the coast and well find ourselves without any water at allIn other words when we meditate we pick up a good sense of ease a sense of inner refreshmentIts like stocking up on waterBut then we take it out and we pour the water out our eyes and ears all over the placeSo we have to come back meditate some more get some more water  back and forth like thisWe never really stock up on enough water to take us across the oceanSo an important lesson we have to learn is how not to pour the water outWhat this means is learning how to maintain your center with the breath inside the body even when you go outside and deal with other peopleThis is one of the big issues in any meditators lifeAjaan Lee has another passage where he compares the meditation to making the mind one and then turning it into zeroNow when you have zeros there are two things you can do with themYou can put them in front of numbers  in which case they have no meaning at all you dont read them they dont count  or else you put them after other numbers in which case turns into and then then and thenIf the zeros get put after youve got lots of issues but if the zeros get put first no matter how many zeros you have they dont add anything dont burden the mind at allIts the same way with the mind You make it zero and then you put the zeros firstThen when you deal with other people what they say doesnt countIts interesting that Ajaan Lee focuses on what other people say as one of the tests for a mind thats really at peaceThe Buddha makes a similar point in one of the Dhammapada versesIf when other people say harsh things to you and you dont reverberate  like a cracked gong  thats a sign that youve attained true peace of mind This might seem strangeWhy does the test lie in how you react to what other people sayThe mind is very sensitive to this issueWe learn very early in our lives that our happiness is going to depend on how other people treat usAs children were surrounded by people a lot more powerful than we are so theres always a sense of fear built into our relationships to the people around usWe become sensitive to other peoples moods sensitive to what they might do what they might sayAs a result our center of gravity is placed outside because were afraid of them and we try to put up a wall outside ourselves to protect ourselves from themWhat this means is that our psychic center of gravity gets moved outside the bodyIf youve ever taken any martial arts classes you know that if your center of gravity is outside your body youre in bad shapeYoure in a weak positionNow the Buddha doesnt say to ignore other people and just be very selfishHe says theres a different way to approach the whole issue of happinessIn other words you find a source for happiness that doesnt take anything away from anyone else so you dont have to be afraid of other peopleWhen youre not afraid of them you find that you can actually be more compassionate to themSo developing and maintaining this center inside is not a selfish thingThe Buddhas not teaching you to be insensitiveHes just saying to put yourself in a stronger position and to trust that youre stronger by not trying to go outside and fix up peoples moods and all the other things that we think we can do with other people when were dealing with themJust stay inside and have a sense of confidence that youre strong insideAfter all your source of happiness lies insideBecause its not taking anything away from anybody else you dont have to be afraid of themEspecially when you can get your awareness to fill the whole body when you get the breath flowing smoothly throughout the whole body This smooth flow of energy builds up a kind of force fieldAn image in the Canon is that the meditator whos able to fill the body with awareness is like a door made out of solid woodIf you were to take a ball of string and throw it at the door it wouldnt make any dent in the door at allThe mind filled with awareness with the breath energy flowing smoothly is the same sort of thingIts solidIt resists outside influencesBut when your awareness doesnt fill the body like this the Buddha says its like a ball of wet clay into which somebody throws a stoneThe stone makes a big dent in the clayIn other words youre in a weak position and you intuitively know youre in a weak positionOther people can invade your inner spaceSo you scramble around and try to build up all sorts of defensesBecause so much energy gets spent in the defenses and the energy is outside the body it knocks you off balanceYou use up the water of your meditation the refreshment of your meditation very quickly this wayThe trick as Ajaan Lee says is to have a little distillery in the boat so that you can take the salt water and put it into the distillery to turn it into fresh waterThen everywhere you go youve got fresh waterIn other words no matter where you go youre right here centered in the body with your awareness filling the bodyYoure not leaving the body unprotected and youre not using up all your energy in those false outside defensesYoure creating a sense of energy here in the body a sense of refreshment and its protecting you as wellThis way you can travel around the world because theres salt water everywhereIf youve got the skill you can turn it into fresh water  as much fresh water as you wantSo as you leave meditation its important that you watch to see How does the mind moveHow does it go flowing out your eyes and ears into the space outside your bodyIf you catch it and bring it back in how is it going to complainTheres going to be a sense of fear or a sense of uncertainty about trying to stay insideIn the beginning you may feel unprotectedDont listen to those voicesThose are voices that took over your mind when you were a little child and didnt know anythingThat was the best you could do at that time but now youve got more skills better skills more understandingLearn how to reason with those voices Heres a good solid place a good safe place a secure place to be  right here inside the body  and youre operating from a position of strength And just that much is not only a gift to yourself but also the people around youTheyll sense the difference as well and it makes your interaction with them a lot easierSo learn to have some trust for this sense of being inside the bodyThe awareness that fills the body the breath energy that fills the body can protect you in a lot of waysIt can provide the nourishment and the refreshment you need at all timesAt the same time it develops a momentum in the practiceIf you keep on creating all the water you need when you have more than enough you can share it with the people around youYour sense of what it means to interact with people will change  will be a lot less fearful  and your sense of what it means to be refreshed will grow deeper and strongerAjaan Lee used to say that there are two steps to getting started in the meditationOne is to get your body into position right leg on top of the left leg or left on top of the right depending on what you find more comfortable your back straight facing forward your eyes closed your hands in your lapThe next step is to get your mind in positionAnd thats more difficult because the mind doesnt usually want to stay in any one particular positionIts always running around always quick like a highstrung cat to jump at anything that comes alongAjaan Mun once talked about the minds song There are rhythms that go through the body rhythms that seem to go through our awarenessAnd we start singing along with them without really realizing it and then were off wherever the melody will take usWhen we put the mind in position we stop singing alongWe just watch whats going onSo you bring it to the breathIts a good way to get out of your head and down into the bodyGive yourself a good comfortable place to stay and be aware of the breath coming in aware of the breath going outNotice how the breathing feels in different parts of the body because the breathing is a wholebody processIf its not a wholebody process thats a sign that theres a blockage someplace youve got to work withBut first get a good breath rhythm going in any one spot where its easy to watchIt might be at the nose the chest the abdomen the neck the middle of the head  any place where all the different pressures of the breath coming in and going out and the pressures of your blood circulation feel right togetherFocus right there and allow the breath to find whatever rhythm feels good feels gratifyingIf the mind wanders off bring it right backIf it wanders off again bring it back againYoure trying to put it in position  which means finding a good comfortable posture for the mind  and then trying to get it to stay in positionIts the staying that makes all the differenceIf you just get into position and then quickly jump away you dont get the benefits of being in positionAnd there are lots of benefitsOne youre giving the mind a place to rest so that it can recover its strength from all that running aroundAnd two when its in position it can watch because if you ever want to watch something carefully you have to be very stillIf youre running around all the time everything is a blurYou snatch a little sight of something here snatch a sight of something there but you dont see anything continuously  which means you dont really understand itSo were trying to put the mind in a position where it can stay and watch continuouslyThis position of the observer is a very important part of the meditation  the observer that doesnt go singing along with the different rhythms or thoughts coming through the mind but watches them as eventsWhen youre watching things as events you can decide which things are worth following through with and which ones are notOf course you sometimes find yourself slipping off into your old habits of singing along but you can catch yourself stop and come back to the breath come back to this position of the observerGet more and more used to being hereThis is where the mind can have a sense of being at home where it can rest where it can accurately watch the movements of the mindWhere are they running toAre they going to a place you want to goIf not you just drop them and whatever reality they seemed to have will dissolve awayIts because you give them a reality that they become solid and imposing and gain power over youBut if you learn simply to watch them as events you can gain the upper handSo what youre doing here is developing a place for the mind to rest  a place where in resting it heals itselfAt the same time it can watchAnd in the watching it learns not to build up new diseasesAs any doctor can tell you there are two parts to maintaining good healthOne is taking the medicine when you need it and the other is having a healthy lifestyleIf you want to be healthy its not good to eat unhealthy food go around smoking eating junk food and then coming to the doctor to ask for medicineThe medicine will help but not nearly as much as when you have a healthy lifestyle where youre not putting the junk into your system to begin withAnd the same holds true for the mindWe come here to meditate to help heal the mind from all the damage it does to itselfWe tend to think more of the stress coming in from outside but actually were playing along with the outside stress were singing along with the outside stress which is why it gets into the mindSo we come here close our eyes sit in a still position and give the mind a chance to wash out all the unhealthy energies its picked upThis is a good thing to be doing but it would be even better if we could maintain this position of the observer all the timeThats a healthy lifestyle for the mindThis is what you want to try to do as the mind gets accustomed to settling down with the breathNot only when youre sitting here but also when you get up and start moving around Try to maintain this same inner position this same inner posture of being the observerAnd try to notice when you lose itThats a sign youve run across something important one of those tricks the mind plays on itself to go someplace it knows it shouldntThats one of the reasons for these lapsesThe other is that it simply forgets itself and just starts singing along with whatever thought comes along whatever mood comes alongThese things seem to have so much reality simply because we sing along with themBut if you can maintain the position of the observer you watch these things as they come and you begin to see the damage they can do if you take them inYou realize that you have the choiceYou dont have to play along with them you dont have to sing along with them you dont have to take them inYoure now in a position of strength a position where you can watch where you can see these things simply as events rather than as the worlds to enter intoIn this way you find that the medicine of sitting meditation can seep deeper and deeper and show more effects than you might have imagined beforeUp to now its simply been a holding actionWhen things are bad you sit down you wash things out of your system you feel better and then you go back to your old habitsAs a result the meditation doesnt get a chance to penetrate deeply to show itself as anything more than simple stress reduction or momentary relief from all the suffering youre carrying aroundBut when you can maintain the position of the observer it becomes a lifestyle a way of living in which youre not bringing in all those other things to burden the mind to begin withNo matter how the body moves no matter how thoughts move you maintain this positionIf you can keep this up then when you come to sit and meditate you find the meditation goes deeper deeper and deeperYou see that it can do more than you might have imaginedIt can address the more subtle diseases in the mind the more subtle harm the mind is doing to itselfIts like maintaining a yoga position or a stretchThe first couple of seconds are hard because you feel stiff but then you relax into the stretchAs you relax you can go further into the stretch because you give it more time more continuous time to work its effectsMeditation is not here simply for coping with the stresses and strains of lifeIts for showing how we can ultimately go beyond causing any suffering or stress for ourselves at all  not only for ourselves but also for the people around usUltimately we learn to drop even the position of the observer to open up to a different dimension in the mind that lies outside of time outside of space outside of all the worlds we can create for ourselvesBut to see that you first have to make the observer strongAnd to do that you have to give the meditation time and you have to make it part of a lifestyle a way of living  an inner posture an inner position that you maintain  this observer who watches the moods come and go watches the thoughts come and go doesnt sing along with them doesnt cause itself the damage it used toOver time you find that the posture of the observer goes deeper and deeperThe observer can see more and more because you give it the time to develop to become strong to become your real home where you settle downSo ideally ultimately when you meditate it wont be a matter of getting in positionYoull get the body in position but the mind will already be in position the habitual position of the observerInstead of running out after things singing along with this tune singing along with that youre stepping back a bitYou have a place to step back and simply watch these thingsIf theres any use to them you follow through with themIf not you let them goThis becomes the basic stance of the mindAs I said when you reach that point the meditation shows that it can do a lot more than you might have imaginedIt can solve problems you didnt even know you had eliminate levels of suffering and stress you didnt even know you were causing because they were always there in the backgroundNow that the mind is even more subtle and still it can see these thingsAnd its only when you see things that you can let them goEvery evening before we meditate we chant the four sublime attitudes goodwill  May all living beings be happy compassion  May they all be free from stress and pain appreciation  May they not lose the happiness theyve foundAnd then theres equanimityInstead of saying All living beings can just go to hell I dont care the chant says All living beings are the owners of their actions heirs to their actionsExactly how is that thought related to equanimityNotice that it comes last in the listIn other words you first cultivate goodwill compassion and appreciationBut then there comes a point where you realize that you can have goodwill for people but theyre not happyYou can have compassion for them and they still dont get released from their sufferingYou can have appreciation for their happiness but they abuse itThey abuse their power they abuse their wealthYou begin to realize that theres only so much you can do not only for other people but also for yourselfThats where the reflection on karma comes inYou realize that certain things are caused by past karma and theres no way you can change themOther peoples karma places limitations on them your own karma places limitations on youYou have to live realistically within those limitationsYou can push them a bit you can push the envelope to see how much you can work for your own happiness and for that of others but there comes a point where the envelope pushes backYou realize that you can only do so much at any given timeYou can do only so much with the energy the talents you haveSo the appropriate response is to put aside the areas where you cant help or cant make a difference so that you can focus on the areas where you canThats what the chant on karma is all about to give you a sense of priorities to remind yourself of whats importantYouve got a limited amount of energy a limited amount of time in this lifeYou help where you can but if you cant help theres no point in getting upset no point in suffering over itTheres no point in expending your energies in areas where you just cant make a difference for you only have so muchEquanimity means making peace with the principle of karma so that you can work within it and use your energy wiselyThats part of what it means to say Whatever you do for good or for evil to that will you fall heir You have to accept the principle of karma if youre going to be skillful in using what youve gotThe teaching on equanimity is not counseling cold indifferenceIts simply reminding you of where your priorities are where your limitations are and that youve got to work within those limitationsIn other words if an issue comes from your past karma you realize you cant change thatWhat you can change what you can shape is what youre doing right nowSo focus thereTheres a passage where the Buddha talks about the skillful and unskillful ways of teaching karma and of thinking about karmaAn unskillful way is to say that everybody who does evil is going to go to hell everybody who does something bad is going to sufferYou look back and you realize that you like everyone else have done some bad things in your life the times when you acted on less than noble or less than your best intentionsIf you simply brood over your big mistakes you put yourself into a spiral that goes down down downIt doesnt help you at allWhat you should do is to remind yourself that even though theres past karma theres also new karma a fresh slateYou can choose freely right now to act as skillfully as possibleWhatever youve done in the past that was unskillful just put it asideMake up your mind that youre not going to make that same mistake againAnd then move onIts not that you deny your mistakesYou freely admit themIts not that youre blas about themYou realize that a mistakes a mistake and you dont want to repeat itBut if you simply brood on the mistakes you made in the past you dont leave yourself the energy needed to act skillfully in the present momentIts a matter of priorities Where are you going to focus your energies to get the best resultsThe reflection connecting the principle of karma with equanimity is meant to clear the decks so that you can focus right there on your present actionsThats where the true issue isThats what underlies the basic structure of realityWhen you can focus here you dont get all caught up in all the what ifs about the past What if I had done thisWhat if I hadnt done that All those what ifs about the past are a massive waste of timeThe important what if is What if I act skillfully now Try that outBuddhism doesnt teach heartlessnessIt starts out with goodwillLook at the path Its a way of working for your own wellbeing and the wellbeing of those around you a way of putting an end to sufferingThats goodwill put into action in spadesThe teaching on equanimity is meant to make sure that your goodwill doesnt run off the road doesnt burn out doesnt waste time getting lost in unskillful bywaysIn other words the Buddha doesnt tell you to be indifferent about your choices in the present moment or to say Who cares what I do in the present moment You cant think that wayYou have to let goodwill compassion and appreciation dominate your choice of how youre going to act right now  and right now and right now as the present keeps moving through timeYou cant be indifferent to thatThere has to be a strong sense of desire purpose and resolve about doing the most skillful thing you can each moment youre aware of your choicesYou have to make yourself more and more aware of exactly what choices youre makingThat requires effort and energyThe development of equanimity husbands your resources so that you can focus them on the spot where theyre most useful where they really will make a differenceYou develop equanimity about the path only when youve obtained the goalEven the equanimity you feel when youve obtained the goal Theres a transcending of that as well in what the texts call nonfashioning In other words you realize that equanimity is a choice you make These are the things youre going to put aside these are the things youre going to focus onThe things you put aside you really do have to let yourself not get worked up about themWhen the path is finally completed thats the point when it too comes into the realm of equanimityYou can let go of itDont fashion anything at all not even the choices of equanimityThats when the mind gains releaseSo you develop universal equanimity in accepting the principle of karma but in applying it to your past and present choices you need a selective equanimity up until the endpoint of the pathThat way instead of being a blanket indifference to everything  which would be like being a dead person  equanimity becomes an important tool in keeping you alive and active making sure all the energy and activity youve got to devote to the present moment is used in the best possible wayOtherwise you drag yourself down by taking on too many responsibilities too many caresWhen that happens nothing much gets accomplished at allOnly when you focus your energies properly can they really pay offAs you develop your meditation try to bring the mind to concentration so that it can maintain this state of equanimity from which you continue your workIn other words you have equanimity for everything else at that point aside from the development of insightThen the equanimity serves to protect you as wellAjaan Fuang once said If you dont have the equanimity of jhana goodwill will cause you suffering because you see how limited your ability to help other people isYou keep running up against the limitations created by your own past karma in exactly how much you can accomplish for them at any one timeYou also run up against the limitations of their past and present karmaIf you develop the proper equanimity to those limitations you dont have to suffer because of themYou simply recognize them and work around them on the areas that are open to youEquanimity is an important way of nourishing you on the path giving you strength making sure that your basic goodwill for yourself and other people gets properly directed and not squanderedDont think of equanimity as a heartless or cold state of mindIts simply a very realistic way of looking at thingsNotice that in the Four Sublime Attitudes the other three are May all living beings be this way May all living beings be that way But when you get to the fourth one the thought is All living beings are the owners of their actions Theres no may in there its just a statement of factYou recognize reality you recognize the limitations in this causal realm in which we operate and you make up your mind to work within those limitations in as creative and effective way as is possibleSomeone once wrote a book on Buddhism called The Intelligent HeartThis is precisely what these four attitudes try to develop an intelligent heart an intelligence in the way your heart your will and your motivation function in your life so as to get the most out of themAnd equanimity is what makes the intelligence possibleOne of the major ironies of how Buddhism has come to the West is how the teaching on dependent coarising has been turned into a teaching on interdependence or interconnectednessWith the original teaching the emphasis was on how things work together to cause suffering whereas the new teaching is something to celebrateIts good that everything works together everything fits togetherWere all interdependent were all interconnected and its a lovely comforting thingBut when you look carefully at the way things are actually interconnected its hard to see much to celebrateThe fit is always a little loose a little awkward and this causes a lot of pain and sufferingExtra water vapor coming off the Atlantic has now killed people in New Orleans and driven up oil prices all over the United StatesIts a weird string of connectionsOr you dont have to look that far afieldJust look at your own body at how things are connected in the bodySee how the human body is constructedThe back As you grow older you begin to realize how poorly designed the human back isIf there is a designer its not a very intelligent design or if there is an intelligence behind it its a malicious intelligenceIts designed for pain its designed to fall apartOr look at how human beings are bornYou start with sex which requires a lot of lust but then lust  whoever designed lust if there was a designer was pretty malicious because lust isnt something you can controlYou start lusting after the wrong people which is what most people seem to do most of the timeAnd lust doesnt only create babiesIt also leads to deception to murder to disease to all kinds of problems and yet its an essential part of the mix to keep the human race goingAnd then theres pregnancy all the pains a woman goes through in bearing a childIn Thailand before each ordination they traditionally have an afternoonlong chantA layperson is hired to chant to remind the young monk candidate of all the suffering his mother went through in raising himIf the chant lasts for about four hours three of those hours are focused on the nine months of pregnancy  the months of morning sickness the months of something kicking in her stomachAnd then theres birthThey say that the most extreme pain that a human being can endure is the pain of giving birthAnd its no fun for the child eitherIf there is a design behind all this if there is an intelligent design its a malicious intelligenceSo this is the world that were born intoThis is how were bornAnd it required a Buddha to approach the world with some compassionate intelligence seeing all this interconnectedness and saying there is a way we can use these interconnected things these dependent things to find a way out of the sufferingThats what he gave his life to both the finding and the teachingAnd its a very fragile teachingIf you look at Buddhist history you see that wherever the Dhamma goes people find all kinds of ways of trying to divert the teaching to other purposes forgetting that its original purpose was the most compassionate showing the way out of sufferingOur imagination is so tied up with the normal way of using connectedness or interdependence that it really has trouble negotiating that compassionate useThis is why the path is so hard It goes against the grainIf anything calls into question the idea of an intelligent designer or a compassionate designer its the fact that the quest for the end to suffering the quest for a true and lasting happiness goes so much against the grain of the human mindKeep that in mind as you practiceIts to be expected that the practice is going to go against the grainAnd because the path requires working with tools that normally fit into another purpose  the survival of the body  its very easy for us to get off trackYou have to keep in mind the fact that deep down inside your deepest desire is a desire for happiness a happiness thats not going to change on you a happiness thats not going to leave you in the lurch a happiness that doesnt have to involve other sufferingThat was the desire the Buddha respected within himself and he respected it within other people as wellThats why he searched for this pathWhen he found it thats why he taught it  to speak to that specific desireAnd yet theres so much in the world that tells us that its unrealistic its too much troubleAll those voices are ready to pounce on any problems that come up in the practiceBut keep that little fire burning inside that if theres any sense to this life at all it lies in finding a true happinessAlways try to protect thatDo what you can to maintain it use your intelligence to sidestep any discouragements that might put it outAfter all this path is made out of conditioned things so there are times when it seems like everything comes crashing down and you have to put it together all over againBut it can always be put together againWhether its going to snuff out that little flame is really up to youThe trick to surviving the bad periods in the path is to keep that long vision in mind and to remember the nature of this path Its a constructed path a fabricated pathIt leads to something unfabricated but the path itself is a fabrication which means that its dependent on conditionsSometimes the conditions arent all they could be but we do have this intelligence within us that can learn how to make the best of difficult things makeshift things to hammer things together in a new waySo do what you can to strengthen your intelligence on the pathThis is a strength composed of five thingsFirst theres the conviction that theres got to be a way out of sufferingSecond theres persistence sticking with that conviction acting on it all the timeThird theres mindfulness You remember to keep that conviction in mind all the time and to apply it to all of your actionsFourth and fifth are concentration and discernmentThe discernment there is to help find ways over the obstacles that we all inevitably find on the path and the concentration is to give your mind the food it needs to keep its energy upThe texts talk about persistence as a requisite for concentration but the relationship goes the other way as wellDo your best just to stick with one objectWhen everything else seems to be crazy in life just say Okay Im going to stay right hereIf I dont know anything else for sure what I do know for sure is that the breath is now coming in the breath is now going outLets just hang out here for the time being In that way you can weather whatever crisis comes up and it gives you the strength to deal with things to recoverI was reading recently about studies theyve done of major disasters and catastrophes  huge hurricanes earthquakes firesTheyve noticed how people immediately after a catastrophe feel a bizarre sense of euphoriaThey develop a sense of common purpose as they drop their normal concerns and band together to rebuild to recoverThen after a while once things get back to normal again everybody goes back to their old waysAs one researcher pointed out right after a catastrophe theres a suspension of time peoples normal narratives stop functioning and theres a sense of liberation from those narratives as youve now got an obvious immediate common purposeIn fact one of the researchers said it sounded a lot like Buddhist meditation to him the idea of dropping the narrative of the past and the future and just staying with the present moment finding a purpose in the present momentThat gave a buoyancy to the rebuilding effortsWell try to use that same attitude when your meditation comes crashing downYouve got some rebuilding work to doIt gives you a purpose and its something you can focus on totally in the present momentThe best way of doing that is to drop the whole narrative thats driving you crazy the fact that things seemed to be going well and now all of a sudden theyve crashedWhether its a sudden crash or a gradual one doesnt really matterWhat matters is that you realize Okay just forget about the narrative and focus on the needs of the present moment Thats all youre responsible forThats all you have to worry aboutYoull find that that will give you the buoyancy the energy you need in order to start the rebuilding workSo again what youre using here is the process of dependent coarising the interconnectedness of conditioned phenomena but youre pointing it in a new directionIn one of the suttas the Buddha describes what one modern teacher has called transcendent dependent coarisingIts the typical pattern starting with ignorance and going through craving and ending up in sufferingAnd the normal reaction to suffering as the Buddha once said is a combination of bewilderment and searchWere bewildered about why this particular type of suffering is happening and we search hoping that somebody else will know a way outWhat usually happens is that the bewilderment simply adds more ignoranceThe search turns into more craving and that leads to more sufferingBut there are times when the search turns into a solid conviction There must be a way outAnd youre going to do whatever is needed to find that way outYouve reflected on life and seen that the design if there is a design is not compassionate at allAll you have to see is someone go through the process of aging illness and death and you realize  if there is a design  how harsh it isBut more likely this is just the way things happen to be without any overarching point or purposeAs you realize that youve got to reflect on the fact that there must be a way outAnd youve got the Buddha and his Noble Disciples to say Yes there is Were fortunate that we have their testimonyTheir testimony is like a challengeAre you up for the challengeIf youre not youre going to have to suffer like everybody elseIf you are up for the challenge though youre still going to suffer for a while but it will be in a different wayIts a suffering that leads to the end of sufferingSo make the most of this opportunity because its the only intelligent way to find happiness  and it doesnt come along all that oftenOne of the most difficult but important principles in the practice is what the Buddha called Learning to see renunciation as freedomFor most of us renunciation seems to be a restriction  as when youre getting the mind to focus on the breathBefore you make up your mind to do that the mind doesnt seem to be restricted doesnt seem to have any violent wishes or disorderliness or unrulinessBut then all of a sudden as soon as you tell it to stay with the breath it finds all sorts of other places where it wants to goIt complains that its being constricted that its being tied downYou have to learn not to listen to those complaints because as the Buddha explains when the mind really does settle down with one object its freed from a lot of restrictions and burdensHe describes progress through stages of concentration as stagebystage releaseSimply getting the mind to stay consistently with the breath youre released from unskillful mental states released from sensual desiresThats a state of freedom but theres a part of the mind that doesnt see it that wayAnd that part of the mind gets a lot of encouragement from the world outside partly because its in other peoples interest to have us chained to our sensual desiresOnce were chained to our sensual desires they have a hook to sell us things to make us buy and our desires play along with thatWe mistrust the impulse toward celibacy toward renunciationI was talking a while back to a Zen practitioner  admittedly someone who wasnt all that advanced  about conflict resolution in the community and I pointed out that having the Vinaya as our standard was very liberatingTo him that was an unusual idea  that rules could be liberatingPart of his quest he said was to learn how to see beyond rules so that you werent confined by themSo how could rules be liberating I pointed out For one thing we dont have to sit around discussing what the standards of behavior in the community are going to be week after week after weekIts all settledThe standards are livable theyre humaneSo having the standards established frees us to have a lot more time to practiceAnd thats just a very basic exampleThere are other ways in which rules are liberating as wellPopular culture likes to hear about monks and nuns who are having trouble with their vows who end up either disrobing or acting out their desires in weird and convoluted waysThis shows that theyre being confined and restricted by their rules that they really miss the things that they gave upThats what popular culture likes to hear  that its offering us all the really good things in life and that the alternatives are bogusBut when you really get a taste of what its like to get the mind to settle down without having to hanker after other things you find how liberating it isWhen you see the rewards youre more and more willing to let go of the things that youre normally attached to in favor of the freedom of not being attachedThis impulse to mistrust the principle of renunciation isnt just an American or a Western issueIt goes way back in Buddhist historyFor example theres the Mahayana ideal that the arahants are stuck in a limited nirvanaThe Mahayanists feel that bodhisattvas have more freedom because they have a foot in both worlds they sayWell nirvana is the opposite of being stuckFor one thing its not a placeWhen theres no place theres no being stuck anywhereSecond the person who attains nirvana is totally undefined with no restrictions whatsoeverFrom the outside it looks uninviting but from the actual experience of the practice  of learning to let go let go let go and be less and less defined by this that or the other attachment  it brings a huge sense of freedomSo as we stick with our efforts to stay with the breath to stay with one thing remember Were sticking but were not stuckWere not being confinedWere learning to give up restrictions learning to get out of the chains that have become so familiar that weve learned to mistrust the idea that anybody could be happy outside of those chainsBut the freedom beyond those chains is just what the Buddhas talking aboutAll his teachings aim in that directionHe said that his teachings all have a single tasteJust as the ocean has the taste of salt  anywhere you go in the ocean the water tastes salty  everywhere you look in his teachings theres the taste of freedom the taste of releaseEven when he teaches restraint of the senses again its for the purpose of liberating the mind from all the unskillful states that would arise if you werent carefulHe says that if youre not careful about how you look at things how you listen to things how you smell things taste things touch things then the mind is assailedIts injured by sense objectsTo many people that amount of restraint sounds confining but when you take the mind to a state of concentration where its not injured in that way you realize the sense of freedom the sense of relief that resultsSo a lot of the practice comes down to a willingness to take the Buddha at his word in spite of all of our fear of what it might be like to renounce things to give things up to show restraintOur preconception is that its very confining and as the song goes The saints are so miserable theyre crying and grievingId rather laugh with the sinners than grieve with the saintsWell the sinners dont laugh all that long  and the saints dont grieve Theyre totally freeSo allow space in your imagination for that possibility that renunciation really is freedom when you do it wisely when you do it to learn and understandOpen up your imagination to the possibility that the Buddha was right  that all these practices and rules really do have the taste of freedomThe Buddha once compared sensory input to being like a flayed cow with no skinEverywhere the cow goes insects bore into its flesh all the timeOur senses are constantly picking up information through the eyes ears nose tongue bodyAnd on top of that the mind is its own senseIt picks up all kinds of ideasThe question is how are you going to find any peace in the midst of all thatAnd the answer is You have to be selectiveThe Buddha talks about restraint of the senses as an essential part of meditationWe often think of meditation as what starts as soon as you sit down and close your eyes but actually its going on all the timeThe word for meditation bhavana means to developYou should stop and look What are you developing in your mindWhen you follow certain trains of thought you develop the habits that go along with themYou create ruts in the mindWhen you give free rein to anger you create an angerrutWhen you develop mindfulness you create a mindfulnessrutThe next time you get anywhere near those patterns of thinking the mind falls into the rut and goes along with itWere doing this all the timeTheyve done study after study to show how selective our process of perception isIt happens on many levelsSome of its conscious some of its not but the upshot is that even before you sit down to close your eyes youre already in a process of developingThe question is is it developing the same thing the meditation is meant to developAre you developing calm or are you developing turmoilAre you developing mental stability or are you developing restlessnessLook into this all the timeEverything you do everything you say is a process of developing somethingIts laying down ruts in the mind so what kind of ruts do you wantWere trying to work on good ones as we sit here with our eyes closed but if the rest of the day youre working on other kinds of ruts its a struggleWhen you look at things what are you looking forWhos doing the lookingIs lust doing the lookingIs anger doing the lookingIf these things are doing the looking they create the ruts for more anger or more lust to keep on doing the lookingSo throughout the course of the day be careful of what you look atThis doesnt mean you cant look at goodlooking thingsIts just that when you see something goodlooking you have to remind yourself that theres another side to it as wellWhen you see something you really hate remind yourself that theres another side to it as wellAs Ajaan Lee used to say Be a person with two eyes The same applies to your listening what you smell what you taste what you touch and especially what you think aboutIts a common pattern that when youre sitting here meditating you try to keep the mind under control but then as soon as you get up its back to its old ways  just wandering around anyplace it wants toAnd that way youre being inconsistentIf the mind is going to go someplace you have to ask yourself Why are you going there Its like that old slogan from World War II Is this trip really necessary Where are you planning to goWhat are you planning to bring backBe deliberate in your thinkingThe Buddhas not saying not to thinkHes just saying to have a sense of why youre thinking what its going to accomplishThe same holds true with the looking and the listening Have a sense of why youre looking at something what youre going to accomplish by looking at itWhy are you listening to certain thingsAll of this is part of the meditation part of the developing because youre creating the environment in your mind and you want to make sure youre creating the right environmentGet your priorities in orderThis way the meditation is less an attempt at a little island of calm in the midst of whirlpoolsIts more a part of an ongoing process  realizing that the mind needs to be trained and that the training is a full time processEven when youre out in the world  not just here at the monastery  youve got to look at where your mind is going what its picking upIn particular notice what its picking up because there are all kinds of bizarre messages out thereAs soon as you turn on the TV pick up a newspaper pick up a magazine the question should always be Why do these people want me to believe this  so that you dont fall for the messages for the unstated valuesIf this makes you a stranger in your surroundings well fineSometimes its good to be a stranger not to pick up everythingOne of the advantages of going to Thailand was just that No matter how much I was absorbed in the culture in the language there was still part of me that was an outsider and that outside perspective was always importantSometimes it helps you keep your sanity because that outsider perspective can be your guide inside your inner teacherThe Buddha talks about the traditions of the noble ones or the customs of the noble onesTo practice in line with these traditions is to make you a person with one foot in two different culturesThe noble ones look at material things and say Remember all the suffering that goes into just providing food clothing and shelter so dont get all wrapped up in having lots of food lots of clothing a big houseRemember that those things have their drawbacks The world out there is saying Buy buy buy but the noble ones are saying No Listening to the noble ones helps keep you biculturalWhen the media push all kinds of materialistic values on you theres a part of you that can say No Youre not sucked into those things and as a result the mind is more independent has a lot more peaceIt can keep its values straight even in crazy societies like oursTheres a phrase in the Dhammapada the people who see shame in whats not shameful or see no shame in what is shamefulA part of the world looks at the values of being moral having principles not fighting tooth and claw to get lots of belongings and see that as shameful as something to be embarrassed aboutThats why youve got to get out of that cultureThis is why we need the culture of the noble onesThat voice of restraint inside is going to be your protectionLearn how to listen to it to strengthen it so that restraint in daytoday life augments the restraint of your meditationYoure trying to focus on one thing and you can stay there because youre used to exercising restraint in a healthy way knowing how much you can rein the mind in when you have to give it a little extra leash so it doesnt feel too confined too cooped up but at the same time knowing how much is too much  this is something you have to learn over timeSo think about the environment youre creating in your mind the environment that allows the mind to settle down the values that allow it to settle down so that when disturbing thoughts arise you dont immediately go with themYou can look at them and say Thats not a thought I want to follow When youre used to saying No to things already its easier to say No to them when youre sitting here with your eyes closed focusing on the breathAnd vice versa When youve got your eyes open you can remind yourself Ive been able to overcome this thought beforeIve been able to say No to it and I havent diedThis way you can maintain your mental health and the meditation really does become an ongoing process of developing  developing the skillful qualities you want mindfulness alertness a sense of calm a sense of wholeness and wellbeing in body and mindAs the Buddha said The mind well trained brings happiness It needs to be well trained because its always doing things so make sure that what its doing is in line with where you want to goLife doesnt teach lessonsIts up to us to learn lessons which means that we have to take the initiativeWe cant wait for the things we need to know to be automatically presented to us as our birthrightAjaan Fuang stressed this point when I first went back to stay with himHe told me You have to think like a thief if you want to learn the Dhamma In other words dont expect everything to be handed to you on a platterIts up to you to be observantWhen youre listening to somebody talk whether theyre aiming at teaching you a lesson or not what can you learn from what they have to sayWhen events happen in your life when events happen to people around you what can you learnWhen you make the willingness to learn the basis for your self esteem that cuts through a lot of other issues as wellAnd its one of the few forms of self esteem that actually keeps you open to changeFor many of us self esteem means thinking that basically were good people  which means that we have to keep trying to look back on our past actions to see evidence of thatAnd then of course we run across things that dont support that idea and so we block them out of our mindsWe dont like to think about themIn many cases those are precisely the things we need to learn fromSo when you detect a tendency not to want to reflect on your past mistakes try to look into the fear around that Why are you afraid of looking at these thingsFear in and of itself is not a bad thingThe problem is when fear is conjoined with greed anger and delusionThe greed anger and delusion are what create the problemFear in and of itself can often be skillfulAfter all a lot of the Buddhas teachings are based on the very rational fear of the suffering that comes with aging illness and deathTheres the word ottappa which means the fear of the consequences of unskillful actionsThats something the Buddha encouragedHe says its a treasureTheres also the word samvega which is sometimes translated as dismay or shockIts related to an adjective samvigga which means terrifiedYou look at the way life goes aimlessly on and on and on and the appropriate reaction is a sense of terrorOne thing leads to another and often nothing seems to lead anywhere worthwhile at allAs the Buddha emphasized the only way out of this sense of terror or dismay is to develop strong confidence and conviction in the principle of karma the principle of actionAnd that requires that you be willing to learn whats skillful whats notSo when you see the mind refusing to look at mistakes youve made in the past you have to ask yourself Whats being threatened by the idea of looking at those mistakes Often you find that its your sense of self esteem your sense of Im basically a good person I wouldnt want to hurt people You dont want to admit the things you did to hurt yourself to hurt othersYou dont want to look at feelings and emotions that you feel guilty or ashamed ofBut if youre really serious about putting an end to suffering you need to develop the strength of mind to look into those things for otherwise the consequences of not looking into them are even more fearsomeSo its not an issue of learning not to have fear its learning where fear should properly be focusedAnd where it should be focused is on the idea that if you dont learn from your past mistakes youre never going to learnAt the very least youre not learning anything right now and in not learning anything right now youre leaving yourself open to all kinds of mistakes in the futureSo look at the sense of self esteem that wants to say Im already good that wants a nice pat on the head and  if nobody else gives one  gives itself a pat on the headLook at the price of trying to keep that sense of self esteem shored up of trying to protect it when its so obviously fragileIf you try to maintain that kind of self esteem youre setting yourself up for a fall because you cant continue to stay in denial foreverEven while youre in denial the suffering that comes from your actions just keeps coming back coming back coming backWe see this pattern in other people and as the Buddha says The wise person is someone who learns lessons from other peoples actions as well Theres that famous sutta about the four types of horsesThe quick welltrained horse only has to see the shadow of the whip and he does what he knows should be doneNext down theres the horse has to feel the whip on his coatThen theres the horse who has to feel the whip cutting into his hide and finally the horse who has to feel the whip cutting into his boneIn other words if were wise we learn to look at the dangers around us and not wait for them to hit us full force before we say Ive had enough of this dangerous samsara Im ready to get out Or Ive had enough of this particular way of acting Ill have to learn how to stopThey say in AA that someone really has to hit rock bottom before hes willing to learn anything from the programThats the way human nature normally isEven then there are people who hit rock bottom and still dont learnSo its more a question of your discernment in seeing when its time to give up a sense of self esteem thats based on a rickety foundation one that constantly has to be shored up to the point where people sufferMost people never learnThey suffer horribly just because they want to retain a little scrap of self respect here or thereSo take that lesson and apply it to yourself looking back at your past mistakesDont be afraid to look there for if youre afraid to look there youre maintaining a delusionAnd that delusion is going to hurt you further down the lineSo its eitherorWhich sense of wellbeing are you going to choose the wellbeing built on the shaky ground of already being a good person or the wellbeing of having the attitude that youre always willing to learnThe first attitude is the one to dropThe second attitude is the one that offers hope thats based on a much more solid foundation for theres always the possibility to keep learning and learning and learningWhen youre dealing with difficult things from the past have the attitude that At least Im going to learn from this That shifts the foundation onto something much more solid so that youre not making your happiness depend on something you know is going to be washed away by the waves of timeIts a foundation based on a much more cleareyed sense of fear focused on what should appropriately be feared  the unwillingness to learn  for thats what keeps people blindThats what keeps people sufferingThis unwillingness to learn is something we all suffer from and we all need to learn how to overcome itOnly when we can overcome it do we actually start learning lessonsOtherwise we go through life refusing to learn the lessons that are potentially thereSo try to be the sort of person who picks up lessons quickly because the more quickly you pick them up the less you sufferIts as simple as thatAnd the suffering that comes from being slow to pick up lessons or from being unwilling to pick up lessons Thats something really worth being afraid ofThe Buddha encouraged his son Rahula to make the willingness to learn at all times the basis for his practiceAnd he explained to Rahula how to learn You look at your actions and you look at the resultsWhen the results turn out to be harmful youre not ashamed to talk them over with someone elseTalk them over with someone who has experience on the pathGet that persons perspective and then resolve not to make that mistake againWhen you do things properly  your intention is skillful and no unhappy results come  then you can take joy in the practiceThis is where that sense of self esteem is properly placed Take joy that youre continuing to grow in the practiceAnd just that shift in attitude makes all the difference in the worldThis path were following Theres a way in which you could call it sensitivity training  getting more and more sensitive to the way the mind creates suffering for itselfAs you deal with a layer of blatant suffering you peel it away and find another more subtle oneThis is a lot of what the training in discernment is about working from the blatant layers to the more subtle ones by trying to stay on the pathThe Buddha called it a middle way and getting that sense of middleness or balance is a lot of our training in discernmentIf youve ever looked at a balance you see that the two sides dont stay balanced all the timeThey swing back and forth before they can come to a point of equilibriumAnd we have to learn to anticipate that in the practiceSometimes you lean too far to the left and then too far to the right back and forth like this before you come to any kind of balanceA lot of the wisdom and discernment that come in the path lie in learning how to negotiate all the back and forth when you follow a particular tack in your practice and then find that it goes too farYouve got to turn around and go back the other way and often youll find youve gone too far the other way too so you have to turn around and come back back and forth like thisThe wisdom lies in learning how to deal with the back and forth and not get frustrated with it realizing that when you make mistakes youre learning lessonsWhen you learn from your mistakes youll ultimately be able to reach balance and learn how to regain it quickly whenever it gets knocked to either sideThe other aspect of the middleness of the path is that its appropriate for whatever comes upIn other words it doesnt just call for middling effort all the timeSometimes your effort has to be strong sometimes it has to be very very subtleAnd again mastering this point requires sensitivityThe Buddha once talked about two kinds of Right EffortSome kinds of suffering he said require a really concerted effort to deal with them others simply require that you watchThis is a lesson we can learn with the breathSometimes there are levels of discomfort in the breath you can actually deal with patterns of tension in the body you can work through by experimenting by trying this trying that making the breath longer shorter deeper more shallow changing your conception of the breathBut sometimes you run up against a brick wallNothing you do seems to helpThe more you meddle with the breath the more muddled it getsEither youre too heavyhanded or too picky about what kind of breathing is good enough for youSo youve got to back off and just watch for a while to see whether the problem is in the breath or in the mindAnd dont be too quick to come to conclusionsWhen you see an opening that seems to make sense  maybe this could be changed a little bit maybe that could be changed a little bit  then you can get back to meddling with the breath againTry things outIf they dont work go back to just watchingThe practice goes back and forth like thisA lot of the discernment in the path comes with learning where the extremes are how far you can push things and when you have to stop and just watch for a while trying to do as little as possibleIf the breath seems too entangled  the more you work with it the worst it gets  just tell yourself Im not going to breatheIf the body wants to breathe then it can do it on its own but Im not going to participate See what happensOf course the body will have to breatheGive it a chance to be unmeddled with for a whileThen you watch what an unmeddled breath is like until you get a sense for itSometimes the issue centers on how far you can get the mind to settle downGiven the level of concentration given the level of mindfulness you have maybe you can only settle it down a little bit for the time being and yet you want moreIts not good enough especially if youve had better meditations in the pastThe current meditation isnt measuring up so you try to push push push it back to where it wasSometimes you can sometimes you cant because the pushing may be part of the problemOr if youve been away from the practice for a while the level of sensitivity in the mind is not what it was particularly your sensitivity to what youre doingWhen this happens get the mind to settle down at least a little bit and then just stay there for a while  it may not be perfect but its good enoughThen watchIf you can see yourself causing any form of stress or suffering you can drop itThat will move you to another level of sensitivity and so you stay at that level for a while and then just watch againSo the middleness of the middle way actually means the appropriateness of what youre doing visavis the circumstances youve gotThere are no hard and fast rules that youre not allowed to meddle with the breath at all or that you have to be meddling all the time or that you always have to push for greater and greater and greater levels of concentrationSometimes you have to learn to be satisfied with what youve gotYou know the story about the foolish inexperienced cowShes got a nice meadow with nice water but she looks over to the other mountain and says to herself Gee the grass over there looks pretty good tooI wonder what the water tastes like over there But to get there she has to go down into a ravineSo the foolish inexperienced cow heads down into the ravine but because shes foolish and inexperienced she gets stuck in the ravineShe cant even get back to her original meadow much less to the other sideWhat this means is that when you find a level of concentration a level of comfort in the breath that seems okay stick with it for a whileSee if you can maintain itWatch itDont push too hard to make it any better until you see clearly that theres a level of stress a level of discomfort a level of disturbance that really doesnt have to be thereThats when you can let that disturbance go because the stillness allows you to seeOne of the things it allows you to see is precisely what needs adjustingSo the two go together  the doing and the watching  and there has to be a balance between the twoIts like walkingThe easy way to walk is first with one foot and then with the otherThats a lot easier than trying to hop along just on your right foot or just on your leftThis is what keeps the path on the middle finding the balance between the two  balance not so much in the sense of a little bit of effort and a little bit of watching but knowing when which one is appropriate because youve got to have bothSometimes you need more of one than the other like the balance that swings back and forth before it comes to a perfect balanceAs Ajaan Chaa once said were groping our way in the practiceWe like to think that we have the whole thing mapped out ahead of us but if we knew the map entirely and if our map were entirely perfect wed already be at the end of the pathThe map we have is just a sketch and we have to feel our wayYour willingness to feel your way to learn from your mistakes is what develops your wisdom develops your discernmentSometimes its a little chastening to see how little wisdom and discernment you have but what are you going to doYou make use of what youve gotTheres no way you can get more without using what youve gotIts like going down to the gymYou want to go to the gym to get exercise but you feel embarrassed because your body is so weak and everybody else is so fit and strongBut if youre embarrassed you never get down there to work outSo you take the body youve got and you exercise thatOnly then will it turn into the body you wantIn the same way if you only have a little bit of discernment and a little bit of concentration make use of what youve gotOnly when you make use of these things will they growBe content with what youve got  content not in the sense that youre going to stay here forever but content with the fact that these are your raw materials these are the tools you haveYou want big muscles but youve only got little musclesYou cant wait until your muscles are big and then exerciseYou exercise the little muscles youve gotThats where big muscles come fromYouve got to start where you areAnd being very clear about what youve got is a lot of what you learn as you practiceThere are times when the practice is intended to throw you up against situations where you come to the end of your rope where you have to use your ingenuity to figure out what you should do nextAs Ajaan Fuang said if everything were handed to you on a platter youd never develop discernment at allIts by testing it and admitting mistakes learning from your mistakes getting clearer and clearer about exactly youve got here Thats how the path opens upThe Buddha described nibbana as being immediately present sanditthiko  right here in the here and now  but remember that time right after he gained Awakening where he reflected on whether he could teach or notHe was discouraged because nibbana was so subtleHe wondered how he could ever teach anybody how anyone could learn what he had to teachBut he realized that people could be led to it step by stepThis is why our path is a gradual one a stepbystep path as we become more and more sensitive to what were doing more sensitive to the results so that gradually we become more and more sensitive to whats actually right hereAnd its in working with this issue  the middleness of the path whats appropriate right now in terms of our concentration in terms of staying with something in terms of pushing a little bit more Thats how we get more and more sensitive to whats going on right hereIn pursuing the middleness of the path we develop our discernmentAnd remember a lot of discernment is seeing how foolish youve been because thats the only way youre going to get wiseSo the image of the path is of the continental shelf off the coast of India a long gradual slope followed by a sudden dropoffWe all like the idea of the sudden dropoff  the momentary insight that reveals everything in a flash  but you cant get to the dropoff without following the gradual slope of getting more and more subtle in your sensitivityAnd a lot of the subtlety lies in seeing just where the middleness of the middle path liesThe Buddha had a very active sense of the truthTrue things on the conditioned level he said dont exist in isolation theyre part of a causal chainThey come from previous and coexisting conditions and they affect conditions that come after them or together with themAnd as for the truths we talk about the truths that can be taught those are active tooThey have an impact on the person who talks about them and on the person who listens they lead to certain kinds of actionsBecause of this the Buddha said that something that was false could not be useful in the genuine sense of the termTheres a passage where he talks about different kinds of speech speech thats true but not useful speech thats true and usefulAnd then theres the question of whether people like to hear it or notBut theres no category for things that are useful and falseWhat this means is that if you want to find a truth one way of testing it is to see the impact it hasIf its genuinely useful then its a truthAnd this is why the Buddha said that his teachings should be put to the test because this is how you can know if theyre true by seeing what impact they have on your behaviorIf you take a teaching and put it into practice what does it doWhat do you doAnd what are the results of what you doIf you find the results really do have a good impact on the mind  thats a truthFor instance the teachings on karma They ask you to accept four things There really is such a thing as an action thats done this is not an illusion its not unrealWe are responsible for our actionsIn particular theres a mental event an intention informed by views that causes those actionsThe action has an effectAnd the quality of the effect is determined by the quality of the mind state causing the actionThe Buddhas proof for these principles is What happens when you put them into actionWhat difference will they makeWell think of what would happen if you didnt believe these things if you felt that your acts didnt really matter that they really werent true that the idea of a good or a bad action was somehow a fiction Imagine the way youd actOr if you felt that you could do something but then hope for some higher being to come along and forgive you and erase the results of that action How would you act thenIf you believe in the principle of action then youre going to be very careful about what you doYoure going to check the resultsAny mistake you make you can take as a lesson  a mistake here being that youve harmed either yourself or the people around youThats the way the teaching is tested and put into effectAnd you can see the effectIt does have a good impact on the way you actYou become more and more skillful create less and less suffering for yourself and othersThats how the Buddha proves the principle of action proves the principle of karmaHe doesnt cite his own memories of previous lifetimes or proof that someone can have a consciousness that goes from one life to the next and then remember what had happened in previous lifetimesThats not the proofWhen people say that all the Buddhas teachings have to be proved in an empirical way they usually use this as an argument against the principle of karma against the principle of rebirthMost people cant remember their past lifetimes therefore they cant prove the teaching therefore its not a relevant teaching maybe not even BuddhistThats the line of reasoningBut that kind of empirical proof is not what the Buddha had in mindHis proof is more pragmatic Take a teaching put it into effect and see what results you getIf you get good results thats a true teachingBut he also has room for what he calls individual truths versus noble truthsSometimes you hear that the Buddha taught two levels of truth but the only time he makes a distinction between two types of truth is this one things that are true for you individually and things that are true for everybody across the boardThats one of the meanings of noble standard universal all across the boardAs were meditating were trying to sort through the things that are true for us individually so that ultimately we can get to noble truths things that are true across the boardYou find that when you meditate  you focus on your breath like this or that  it works it gets good resultsIn the beginning youre dealing for the most part with individual truths because sometimes a particular focus or a particular way of conceiving the breath is going to work for one session  in other words it works for a particular problem  and the next time you sit down and meditate it doesntThats because youve got a different problemThe old approach may have been true for that particular problem but new problems pop up time and againYou have to take note of what you learn from each session of sitting or walking meditation and then test it the next time aroundIf it doesnt work the second time around you can chalk it up either to the fact that you werent observing carefully the first time  there were things that you missed  or that it was a solution to a different problem not the problem youre facing nowIn this way you begin to build up your body of knowledge your body of individual truthsBut if you work with them skillfully you find that they head more and more toward the noble truthsYou learn to sort things out in terms of stress and its cause the path leading to the end of stress and the actual ending of stressIts when you hit that last one which is formally the third noble truth Thats when you know youve hit the noble truths as a wholeYouve understood them properly youve performed the right tasks appropriate to eachEven these truths are active truthsStress is something the Buddha says to comprehendNormally we want to run away from it or push it away but the Buddha says that youve got to comprehend itIf you dont comprehend it you cant get past itIts like that riddle of the Sphinx The Sphinx stands across the road with a riddle anyone who comes up and cant answer the Sphinxs riddle gets eaten upIf you can answer the riddle you get pastIts the same with stress Youve got to be able to answer the riddle of stress so that you can get past itAs the Buddha said our normal reaction to stress and pain is one bewilderment and two a search for a way outThe only way to get beyond your bewilderment is to sit and watch the stressAnd the only way you can do that is to put the mind in a position where it doesnt feel threatened by the stressThats what the path is for  and particularly the heart of the path Right Concentration putting the mind in a state of ease even rapture focused on one thingThis gives the mind a sense of power a sense of safe haven a safe place to goWhen you have this sense of safe haven you can begin to probe into things that youd normally be afraid ofTo make another comparison its like fighting a dragonIf you know you have good strong armor and the dragons breath cant burn you then you can get in close to the dragon and find its weak pointThis is why concentration is such an important part of the pathIt puts you in a position of strength where you can get intimate with the pain and yet not be anxiousIt gives you a sense of confidence that when things get difficult you dont have to worryThis is one of the reasons why the forest ajaans recommend going out into the wilderness for when you get out there all kinds of things can happenIf you sit there worrying about them you cant stayYou end up running backBut if you have your wits about you then you can get the mind into a state of concentration so that it doesnt fixate on all the dangers and problems of being in the wildernessSo thats one level of problem that concentration can help you overcome your fearsSecond when difficult things actually happen you find that you can withstand them with your concentrationTheres a great passage in the Theragatha where the monk is reflecting on the fact that hes in some pretty bad pain hes really sickWhat are you going to do he asks himselfTheres no medicine no doctor and nobody around to helpAs you stay here in the grove what are you going to do  are you going to run away No he answers Im going stay here and Im going to focus on the four frames of reference and the seven factors for AwakeningThatll be the minds protectionIn other words he realizes that his safety lies in looking after the mindYou look after the body to the extent that you can but then you have to realize that this is a dying bodyIts like those cars made with planned obsolescence  its designed to fall apart at some pointThere comes a time when no matter how much you worry about it how much you try to fight off death the bodys still going to go on its ownYour only safety lies in developing these qualities of mindSometimes the power of mind can actually heal the bodyBut there will come times when it cantStill at that point it doesnt matter when the powers of the mind are really strongSo this is why concentration is something you want to developAgain sometimes you hear that when youre meditating being mindful and a good strong state of concentration comes along you have to be wary of getting attached to the concentration so just let it come let it goAnd somehow in that way you transcend the attachmentWell thats not what the Buddha taughtConcentration is to be developedYou take time you work at itEven if it involves a certain amount of attachment its attachment to a good thingIts like holding on to the rungs of a ladder You dont want to let go of one rung unless youve got your hand on another rung or youve finally reached the roofThats when you can get off the ladder totally and youre safe on the roofAs Ajaan Fuang once said dont be afraid of getting attached to a state of concentration be afraid that you wont get to the concentration or that you wont be able to maintain itOnce youre there once youre attached to it then you can work on the attachmentSo the path is nothing to be feared  after all the Buddha said the pleasure of concentration is nothing to be fearedIts something to be developedThis is how you prove the truth of his teachingsYou work with them and you find that they really do lead to the end of sufferingThats when youve got your proofUp to that point things havent yet been provenThey havent gone beyond the level of linguistic conventionCertain things will give you a sense of confidence  you see results here and there  but only when things open up to the Deathless will you have your proofYouve seen suffering stop and nobody can say that you haventThats when you know for sure that what the Buddha taught was true There is a Deathless and it can be attained through human effortBut the teachings require that you too be trueYou have to be honest in your effortWhen your effort doesnt measure up to what the Buddha taught you cant say that youve proven his teachings falseYouve simply chipped away at them a little bit but you havent done enough yet to prove them one way or the otherBe honest with yourself  thats how you can really test the pathIn other words as Ajaan Lee once said to know the truth of the Buddhas teaching you have to be true too  true in the active sense not just knowing true things but true in your actionsAnd the proof of your truth comes when you hit the DeathlessThats when you know that you can rely on yourselfAs the Buddha said those who have reached the stream in this way will never intentionally do anything wrong because theyve seen the principle of action the truth of action and the action of truthAnd theyll never intentionally be false againThe Canon tells us that the Buddhas contemporaries fell into two main camps what you might call absolutists and relativistsThe absolutists were the ones who had a theory about the nature of reality saying that their theory was true and everything else was falseThe world is made out of atoms Thats one of their theoriesOr The world is infinite The world is not infinite The world is eternal The world is not eternal a long list of views about the world outsideAnd what those views usually come down to is that its impossible for human action to have any real impact on things because the nature of the world is fixedAt the other extreme are the relativists those who hold that what you say about reality all depends on how you look at things or who refuse to take any stance at allTheir stance if you follow it to its logical conclusion makes it impossible to do anything either because if the world is totally chaotic totally random  nothing is really set nothing is really for certain  what are you going to doJust muddle aroundSome of them advised grabbing whatever pleasure you can because theres no telling whats going to happen the next moment the next day down the lineJust now we chanted the Buddhas first sermon and you notice that he doesnt start out with either an absolutist or a relativist stanceHes talking about courses of actionHe says that if you do this these are the resultsIf you indulge in sensuality these are the resultsIf you indulge in selfmortification those are the results and neither gets any really good resultsHowever he said there is a middle path and its not a path worked out by reasoning through or applying logicIt was arrived at simply by trying different paths and seeing what workedHe said this middle path is the path that leads to really desirable results the end of sufferingIt gives rise to vision gives rise to knowledge brings about peace knowledge nibbanaSo thats what makes the Buddhas teaching special He had found a path of actionThats whats worth talking about looking at which paths of action lead to suffering which ones lead to the end of suffering and then following the one that leads to the end of suffering whether you like the path or notTheres a poem in China attributed to the third patriarch which starts out saying that the great way is not hard for those with no preferencesI dont know what the third patriarch had in mind when he said that but if you apply it to the Buddhas approach the only way to make sense of it is this You do what has to be done whether you like it or notTheres a sutta where the Buddha defines wisdom and discernment in terms of how you handle four courses of actionThe first two are the things you like to do that give good results and the things you dont like to do that give bad resultsThose two are not hardTheyre nobrainersYou avoid the things that you dont like and give bad results and you do the things you like to do and give good resultsIts all very easyThe difficult issues and the ones that really test your discernment are the next two courses of action the things you like to do that give bad results and things you dont like to do that give good resultsThats where your preferences get in the wayThats where your preferences make it hardSo you have to learn how to look past your preferences because there are times when the path really does require a lot of effortYou may say to yourself I dont want to do this I dont like this and you wriggle around and find all kinds of excuses but in the end what happensYou dont get the results you want because youve made it hard for yourselfSometimes you have the other attitude  the macho attitude  and yet there are aspects of the path that require just watching being very patient very stillYour macho side may not like thatAs for the things you like to do you say I dont see whats wrong with this You make all kinds of excuses and again in the end you dont get the results you wantThis is one of those areas where each person has to develop his or her own discernment How are you going to get past your preferencesThe only way is to look at the situation and to try out various things to see what worksWhen you find what works then whether you like it or not you follow itIf your preferences complain figure out ways of dealing with them to put them asideDiscernment doesnt mean just seeing the right course of action it also involves mastering the right way to put your preferences asideRemind yourself that your preferences have gotten in the way have gummed up the works for a long long timeHow much longer are you going to side with themAnd how do you put them asideLearn to observe them and see how they arise and pass awaySee how theyre notself that you dont have to identify with themWhen you see something and a sense of liking or a disliking arises you dont have to get involvedWhen the liking and disliking have nobody to play with they go awayIts like that other Zen conundrum the sound of one handWhen the liking comes up and you dont respond Thats the sound of one handOnce you get down to doing what simply has to be done the path gets a lot easierIn other words youre not adding difficulties on top of itIf you dont make it unnecessarily difficult its pretty manageableLook at the elements of the path It doesnt contain anything superhuman anything that requires you to exhaust yourselfIn fact a lot of the path lies in learning how to husband your energy so that you dont waste it on unskillful thingsWhen you dont waste it on unskillful things youve got extra energy for the skillful onesSo on the days when the situation really does require that you sit for a long period of time to work through a difficult issue youve got the energy to draw on because you didnt fritter it away with trivial pursuitsIn particular you havent frittered it away trying to justify your preferencesThis is the way life is Its going to present you with difficult situations many many times whether you want them or notIf you can put yourself in the mood where youre up for whatever arises things are lot easierThe day is going to come when your death is going to stare you right in your face and of course most people dont want thatThey run away and they try to wiggle out of it in all kinds of ways yet the more they wiggle the worse things getBut if youve been following the path with no regard for your preferences then when death comes you can tell yourself This is what Ive been practicing for all this time so lets do it right this time Memories of your life will start arising at that point and youll see things youre going to miss things you regret having doneYou cant let yourself get involved with those things for they make things harderThis is why we sit here pulling the mind away from its distractionsWhen you die there are going to be monstrous distractions and theyre going to pull you strongly in their direction right when youre at your weakestIf you simply give in to them its going to have a major impact on how your rebirth is going to goIf you can maintain your calm center in the midst of whatever comes up things will be a lot easierBad things will come up good things will come up so youll want to maintain your centerDont get excited by the good thingsDont get upset by the badIt sounds like meditation instructions but its also death instructions how to die properlyDeath is easy for those with no preferences  and one aspect of this great way were practicing here is getting ready for that factLife of course is a lot easier if you have no preferences tooThis doesnt mean that you dont have any goals or desires at all simply that you do what has to be doneIf when you sit down your mind is a mess you dont say Well today is a bad day to meditate Im going to wait until some other time You learn how to sit with a mind thats a mess and begin to see the little threads of the possibility of finding some peace in the midst of the messWhen you can do that youve learned a really important lesson a much more important lesson than if you say Well things are bad so Im just not going to tackle them That doesnt teach you any lessons at allThe mind may not settle down as much as youd like but at least youve learned some important skills in how to deal with difficult situationsYou may think I dont want a difficult situation right now but there it isWhat are you going to doYou do your bestAnd you figure out what is the best you can do given the situationThen there are the times when things are easyThe mind settles down quickly and is very still and the mind says Okay whats nextLets move on to insight Well maybe you have to get your concentration solidified before youre really ready to develop insightThere are many many examples of people whove gotten a little bit of stillness and wanted to jump straight for insight and end up jumping right off the cliffSo wherever you are on the path you do what has to be doneDont let your preferences get in the wayWhen you can manage that then its not a question of being easy or difficult You just do what has to be doneWhen you develop that attitude  that youre willing to do what has to be done  you get the results you wantAnd sometimes the results are better than what you could have ever thought of wantingThe Buddha once said that one of the prerequisites for concentration is a sense of comfort ease and wellbeing  both physical and mentalOne of the reasons we recite those chants on goodwill compassion appreciation and equanimity is to create a sense of wellbeing in the mindThoughts of goodwill are good thoughts to thinkThey feel goodThey put the mind at easeYou dont have to struggle with anybodyYou dont have to settle any old scoresIt feels good to be thinking good thoughtsIt helps put you in the right mood to meditatePhysically you work first with your postureYou want to sit straightYou dont want to lean over or sit hunched overKeep your back straight  comfortably straightThen you work with the breathDoes the breath feel goodNotice where exactly you feel the breath  which parts of the body have sensations that let you know that now the breath is coming in now the breath is going outHow do those sensations feelAre they tight restrictedIf they are think of their loosening up a little bitOr do they get tight at a particular spot in the breath cycleYou may want to shorten the breath or lengthen itApproach this as you would any skillYou learn from your mistakesOne of the first things you learn as you work with the breath is that youre clumsyYou tend to put too much pressure on itYou approach it with an attitude thats too controlling or too tightBut that doesnt mean you should stop working with the breathIts like the first time you sit down to play the pianoYou sit down and realize you cant play BeethovenThere are three ways of reacting to thatOne is to get up and never touch the piano againAnother is to keep playing   the John Cage piece where you just sit at the piano and dont do anything at allAnd the other is to keep practicing starting with simple piecesLearn to listen to your playing see what you can improve and gradually get better and better until you can play BeethovenThis is how piano playing becomes a skillThis is how any skill gets developedYou explore that boundary line between what you can control and what you cantThe way to explore it is by poking here adjusting there knowing that you probably will make some mistakes but not getting too worried about it because you learn from your mistakesOver time you get more and more sensitive to exactly how much control is too much how much is too little and you develop a wide range of techniquesWhen theres pain in the body whats the best way to breatheWhen youre tired whats the best way to breatheWhen youre tense whats the best way to breatheThese are things you can exploreThe whole point of this is that in the course of doing these things you develop your own sensitivity as to what works and what doesntYour standards for what works and what doesnt get more refinedThis is how discernment gets developed in the practiceIts not a matter of reading a few books getting a few ideas and then cloning your mind to those ideas so that you see things as theyre described in the booksThats not discernmentIts just adding one more layer of perceptions on top of the layers you already haveDiscernment comes from your ability to see the mind in action and to be sensitive as to when the minds actions are giving good results and when they arentYou have to be your own judgeIn other words instead of throwing all the responsibility onto the texts or onto the teachers you take on the job of learning to be a good judge of your actionsAjaan Fuang once said that meditators tend to be like little puppiesThey go out and defecate and then come running to their mothers to have their mothers lick them offThey havent learned how to lick themselves off yetSo as a meditator you need to learn how to lick yourself offIf things dont go well learn how to pick yourself up dust yourself off and then figure out what went wrongTake responsibility for your meditationTake responsibility for your insightsThis is what the Buddha didThis is what every meditator has to doIf you go to a teacher saying youve had a certain experience and the teacher identifies it as a level of jhana or a level of insight can you be sureDo you really want to hand those judgments over to somebody elseOr do you want to learn how to judge things on your own so that you can trust yourselfIf you let the other people do the judging theres always going to be an element of doubt Do they know what theyre sayingAt the same time youre absolving yourself of any responsibilityDiscernment becomes their duty and not yoursThats not a good attitude for a meditator to takeYouve got to learn to look to try a few thingsFor instance what is it like just to let the breath come in and out on its ownWhat is it going to doFigure out how to watch itThen figure out how to nudge it what to think in order to make it more comfortableThen figure out how to judge the resultsThis is how discernment is developed how meditation becomes a skillAs it becomes more and more of a skill you become more sensitive to even the slightest bit of discomfort both in the body and in the mindThats how you see the four noble truthsYou see stress you see how its caused you connect it to your own actionsYou see what you do or dont do that lets the stress be shed awaySo think of the meditation as an experiment something you tryYoure trying to prove a hypothesis that you can put an end to sufferingNow scientists like to see their hypothesis proved but good scientists are willing to admit when it isnt when the experiment actually proves something elseYou chalk it up to experience and you try againThe instructions for breath meditation involve discernment and they also involve training yourselfTo train in any skill you need desire  the desire to actually do the practice  and you have to be open and aboveboard about thatDont try to deny the fact that theres desireJust learn how to use it skillfullyThen there has to be persistenceYou stick with the practiceTry it again and again and againBut persistence is not just a matter of the hours you put inYou also have to be intent to pay very careful attention to what youre doing what the results areFinally you need to use your intelligence which means using ingenuity and being discerning in what works what doesnt and how you might try to improve on bothThese four qualities are called the bases for successTheyre essential to any skillSo approach the meditation as a skillRemember how you learned skills in the pastIf it was music or art a sport carpentry whatever How did you go about mastering that skillA lot of times you made mistakesYou noticed that they were mistakes but you didnt give upYou went back and tried it over again trying to observe what you did wrong what you did right what worked and what didntOver time your hands  which originally seemed to be all thumbs  gradually became human hands a carpenters hands a violinists handsAnd your mind became a craftsmans mindYou reached a point where you didnt have to go running to somebody else to pass judgment on whether you did it right or notYou began to know yourself whether it was right or notThats when you really mastered the skillThe same principle applies to the breathWe spend so much of our lives being desensitized to the breath energy in the body  how we actually feel the body from withinWeve been so intent on learning other things outside that to make room for them weve blocked out this part of our awarenessNows the time to back up and get more sensitive to this area of your awareness again to see how it feels to see how your perceptions of what the breath does are going to affect how the breath actually flows through the bodyExperiment to see how you can work both with the breath and with the perceptions of the breath to make it more comfortable so that youve got that prerequisite for the mind to settle down and get concentrated a sense of ease a sense of wellbeingThe body sitting here seems to have a nice flow of energy throughoutIts not blockedThe blood seems to be flowing through all parts of the bodyYour focus isnt interfering with itYou feel good just sitting hereThe amount of pressure you put on the present moment is just right not too light not too heavyThats something that comes with practiceSo pay careful attention to what youre doing because thats how you learnThats how the meditation becomes your ownVery few things in life are certainEven the thoughts we know to be true To what extent are they really trueIf you think of truth as the correspondence between your thought and the thing it represents no thought can be totally trueEach thought is just a sketchTheres no one thought that can comprehend all the many levels of truth out thereEach thought is just an approximationSo the question turns from representation to one of pragmatism To what extent is the approximation usefulIt may leave a lot out it may not really encompass the thing but if it serves a purpose the thought is usefulThe question then is whats the best purpose for thoughts to serveThats where you have to look for a truth thats not just a thought something you really can be certain about in and of itselfAnd theres really only one truth that can pass that test only one truth you really can be certain about and thats when theres suffering and when theres notYou dont have to askIf you experience it you knowAnd right there is where the Buddha staked all of his teachings suffering arising suffering passing awayEverything else he taught is arranged around that even Right View Its right to the extent that it helps put an end to sufferingYour thoughts are skillful or unskillful your words and your deeds are skillful and unskillful depending on the extent to which they put an end to sufferingSo always keep this principle in mind as thoughts come in and out of your mindYou may have heard that the Buddha taught say that there is no selfTo what extent is the nonself teaching skillfulWhere is it not skillfulThose are the questions he would have you look at not the question of whether there is or is not a selfThere are a lot of things that could be true but this may not be the right time to think about those thingsThe Buddha has a teaching on Right Speech where he says that speech can be true or not true beneficial or not beneficial welcome or unwelcomeHe said to speak only those things that are true and beneficialAnd as for the question of whether theyre welcome or not welcome he said look for the right time and place to speakThe same principle applies to our thoughtsTheres a time and a place for different types of thinkingThere are times when having a strong sense of self is very useful very beneficial and other times when its precisely the thing that gets in the wayThe question is How do you know And the answer is Through trial and error  something we dont like to hearWed like to have a nice formula set outSometimes the Buddha does set out a formula for us but in many areas he doesnt precisely because its more important for us to gain our own sensitivity to our thoughts and their resultsWhen you think something what happens as a resultAnd particularly to what extent does it cause stressThats what youve got to look into and thats why were meditating here to get a greater sense of sensitivity as to whats causing stress in our minds to see how its not necessary to see how we can let go of the causeThen when there seems to be relief keep watching it for a while because there may still be some stress in thereThe Buddha maps things out in terms of levels of stressEven in the practice of Right Concentration there are levels of stressJust because the mind seems still doesnt mean that the job is doneEven when theres a great sense of luminosity or of allencompassing awareness the job may not be overYouve got to learn how to keep lookingIve known some people whove been through the sort of education that aims at fostering self esteem and the problem with that is that it fosters complacencyIt teaches them not to learn how to judge the results of their actionsEverything they do is supposed to be good a cause for self esteem and yet they may be doing a lot of harmSo the important thing is for them to learn how to be sensitive to the harm that comes from their thoughts words and deedsThis applies not only outwardly but also inwardly in the practice of meditationWhen you do something look for the resultsWhen you say something look for the resultsWhen you think something look for the resultsWhen you work with the breath look for the resultsBreath training is an especially good way to learn how to be sensitive to the results of your thinkingThere are different ways of focusing on the breath different ways of conceiving the breath different ways of dealing with the hindrancesAnd your job is to learn how to be sensitive to the results of those ways to figure out which way of focusing is right for right now which way of thinking is right for right now which way of being still is right for right nowThere are some guidelines but the most important thing is to learn how to judge for yourself for without that sensitivity theres no way youre going to see the really subtle levels of stress in the mindThis is where and why we have to be observantWhen the Buddha talks about developing mindfulness and concentration he places a lot of emphasis on alertnessIn the few places where he actually defines alertness he points to being alert to what youre doingIn the body when you move your hand be alert to the fact that youre moving your handWhen you look left look right be alert to the fact that youre looking left looking rightThen moving into the mind When there are feelings be alert to what youre doing in the feeling in the perception in the thought fabrication in the consciousnessEach of these things contains an element of fabrication an element of present intentionDo you ever notice thatDo you see it happeningIf you cant yet see it happening look at what you can see that youre adding to the present momentAnd be sensitive at the same time to any sense of stress thereSee what you can do to minimize the stress for only when you learn how to minimize the stress that you can see do you start becoming sensitive to the subtler levelsIn this way you learn how to be a connoisseur of your actions and particularly a connoisseur of actions and events in the mindA connoisseur of food has to develop a very refined palate a connoisseur of music a very refined earWhat youre trying to do is to develop a refined sensitivity to whats going on in the mindThis requires a whole cluster of mature attitudes concerning how you respond when you do things right when you do things wrong so that you can learn from when youve done things right and done things wrongIf you get depressed over a mistake thats unskillfulNotice thatIf you get careless after doing something right notice that as wellThe Buddha doesnt tell you not to take pride in being skillfulActually a sense of pride a sense of satisfaction when youve done something right is an important inducement in the pathIt gives you the juice you need to keep goingBut youve got to be sensitive to when and where that sense of pride turns into carelessnessThe same when you do things wrong You have to recognize when youve made a mistake but you cant let that recognition become debilitatingAgain learn to be sensitive to the spot where the recognition of a mistake leads to unskillful reactions and learn to cut it off at the passAs you get more sensitive to the results of your actions and to the alternatives open to you you dont have to follow through on unskillful patterns of thoughtAs the Buddha said if you had to stick with the patterns or habits you already have there would be no sense in teaching youIt wouldnt do any goodHe says its because people can learn to be more skillful Thats why he taughtSo learn to be alert to what youre doing alert to the results of what youre doingEven a simple thing like focusing on the breath is an important way to develop your powers of alertness your powers of evaluation and judgmentLearn to be a connoisseur of your breathing and then a connoisseur of the thinking that goes around the breathThats when you find yourself arriving at something really certain even more certain than the arising and passing away of sufferingIts the total ending of sufferingThats when you know for sure that youve done things rightTheres nothing more certain than thatWhat have you got here in the present momentYouve got the body youve got the breath youve got thoughts and youve got your awarenessBut youre also carrying a lot of habitsIn fact this is the main issue in the meditationIf you didnt have certain habits of perception you wouldnt be creating suffering for yourself right nowYou may not seem to be suffering much but theres always some stress that youre creating through a lack of skillAnd this is precisely what were trying to uncover as we meditateSome of the baggage youre bringing into the present moment consists of issues youve picked up in the course of the day things this person said that person did things you yourself said or didIn some cases its as if youve been a garbage collector gathering up the days trashIf youre going to get any peace in the next hour youve got to throw it outBut the issues also go deeper than thatIf that were the only issue you could go off and live alone where you wouldnt have to interact with people and that would be the end of the problemBut its not the end of the problemWhen you go off to live by yourself the habits of the mind start looming even largerThe less contact you have with people the more likely your habits are to go out of boundsYou can get into some really weird feedback loops when youre living aloneSo the Buddha sets out maps he sets out instructions for how to cut through those feedback loops and to understand how your perceptions shape things in a way that brings sufferingHe also shows you how to perceive things in a new way that will end those habits and cut through that suffering so that ultimately when theres a perception of the breath or any of the sensory input you have in the present moment theres no suffering added onThe input is the only disturbance you haveTheres no greed anger or delusion to muck up the worksAs the Buddha said the problem all comes down to ignoranceIgnorance of whatIgnorance of the four noble truths  and hes not talking about not having read about the four noble truthsAll of us here have read about them and thought about themIgnorance means not seeing things in terms of the four noble truthsWe see things in other terms the big ones being our sense of self our sense of the things that belong to us and our sense of the reality of the world out there  what exists what doesnt exist out thereOnce we place our faith in these perceptions we become a slave to themOur idea of objective reality places a lot of imperatives on usOur idea of who we are places a lot of imperatives on us and these are the imperatives that make us sufferSo the Buddha teaches us to learn how to question those perceptionsTheres a passage where he talks about how people are a slave to a duality or a polarity between existence and nonexistence Does the world out there really existDoes it not really existHe advises learning how to avoid that polarity by simply watching things arising and passing away in the present momentStay just at that level and dont get involved in the question of whether theres anything lying behind the mere experience of arising and passing awayAnd the best way to do that is to give yourself a frameworkThis is what the four establishings of mindfulness or four frames of reference are all about giving yourself a framework so that youre not blown away by the events of the worldSee things within the frame of body feelings mind states or mental qualities in and of themselvesMake those your frames of reference  as when youre dealing with the breath right now just the breath coming in going outIn this context thoughts have meaning only to the extent that they pull you away from the breath or dont pull you away from the breathWhile youre sitting here ideally thats the only question how the thoughts impinge on the breathThoughts that are useful in keeping you with the breath are the ones you want to encourageThoughts that pull you away you want to let goIn the Buddhas words you abandon greed and distress with reference to the world  the world here being the world of the sensesOnly when you abandon greed and distress with reference to these things can you look at how theyre directly experiencedSee how sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations are experienced right here in the present moment in and of themselvesIf you can watch these things arising and passing away simply in and of themselves the whole issue of what exists out there or what doesnt exist out there gets put asideAs you watch things arise the idea that theres nothing out there doesnt occur to youAs you watch them pass away the idea that theres something out there permanent lasting existing independently of you doesnt occur to you eitherYou see that the issues of existence and nonexistence matter only if you make them an issueThe Buddhas not saying that things do or dont exist out there its just that in this mental state the issue doesnt occur to youThis is the mental state you want to develop because all thats left is simply the issue of the arising and passing away of stress and sufferingThat gets you right in line with the four noble truths and their imperatives the imperative to comprehend suffering abandon its cause realize its cessation and develop the path leading to its cessationThese imperatives unlike those of the world are liberating which is why you want to take them onThe first one is to comprehend suffering so that you can begin to see what youre doing to give rise to the sufferingThis is what focuses you on the real job at handYou start seeing the fabrication of worlds in the mind realizing that the world as you perceive it out there is really your own mental constructYou have lots of different mental constructs about the world out thereSometimes you think about the world in geological terms sometimes in cosmic astronomical terms sometimes simply in terms of your own personal narrative day to dayThere are many different levels that are useful for different purposesYou want to put yourself in the state of mind where you can choose which view of the world is useful right here right now so youre not a slave to the imperatives that these different views put on youThe same with your notion of self Is there a selfIs there no selfThe Buddha says Dont ask So much of our life depends on the idea of who we areIf you really look at the arising and passing away of your sense of self seeing how its a construct just the way your sense of the world is a construct then youre in a much better positionYou can use different ideas of the self to function in different ways and then drop them when theyre no longer usefulBut all this is possible only if you keep in mind as your basic framework the question of what gives rise to suffering what kind of action doesnt give rise to suffering or what kind of action leads you to the end of suffering  the basic framework of the four noble truths seeing your experience in those terms rather than in terms of the world or the selfThen you can see the activities that you do  the fabrications you make bodily verbal and mental  simply as strategies useful or not skillful or not in line with the imperatives of those four truthsAnd thats liberatingOn the one hand you find that you can function a lot more skillfully as you open up to the idea that there might be more courses of action open to you than you had imaginedIf you have a very definite idea of who you are or the type of person you are you place limits on what you can doIf you have very fixed ideas about the world out there that too limits what you can do in terms of putting an end to suffering and stressSo what were trying to do as we meditate here is give ourselves the frame of reference from which we can call into question our habitual ideas of the world our habitual ideas of the self to see how both of them are fabrications made out of the way we look at things the way we attend to things the way we perceive thingsSimilarly with the intentions that are based on those ways of looking at the world looking at the self We can start calling them into question looking for alternatives testing alternatives with the overriding concern of seeing what we can do to put an end to all the stress and suffering were causing through our unskillful intentionsAs you look at your experience in these terms  the constant questioning of what youre doing and what results youre getting out of what you do  you can open yourself to whole new dimensions insideYou can use your ingenuity to figure out new ways of acting new ways of interacting with your perceptions of the world new ways of interacting with your perceptions of self that free you from the stress and suffering that deep down inside you think are a necessary part of being a human beingThis is so much of what the Buddhas teaching is about freeing you from your own selfimposed limitationsThink of all those people who told young Prince Siddhartha that there was no way he could put an end to sufferingThe best people in the history of the world have all suffered in this way they said so who are you to say that its not necessary Still the prince said there must be some other wayHe had the ability to imagine that there would be another way and the guts to devote his life to finding if it were trueAnd finally he found that yes what he conceived as a possibility wasnt just a leap of the imaginationIt was an actualityThis opened a vast new range of possibilities  for the whole human race  of what a human being can doTake for instance his analysis of the four types of actionMost people would only think of the first three things that give rise to good results within the normal course of the world things that give rise to bad things that give rise to mixed resultsBut the Buddha found that there was another kind of action that leads to the end of action to the end of sufferingThat was his great discoveryNotice it was a kind of action he discovered based on certain views based on certain perceptions based on certain ways of looking at experience and then following through in line with themSo as were practicing meditation remember that perception and attention  the way we perceive things the questions we ask about the things we perceive  are the two main issues we have to focus onThis is one of the reasons we put so much emphasis on concentration for the levels of concentration are perception attainmentsCan you hold onto a particular perception so that the mind can really settle thereSee what it does to your experienceWhen you stick with the perception of the breath as filling the body what does that do to the physical sense of the breathWhen you perceive the breath as being able to come in and out of the body anywhere at all what does that doWhat effect does it have on the mindWhen you get to the formless perceptions such as infinite space What in the realm of your experience right here corresponds to infinite space infinite consciousness nothingness neither perception nor nonperceptionWe investigate these things to see the power of perception so that ultimately we can let it goSo this is a very important thing to focus on as you meditate and as you go through the course of the day how you perceive thingsYou can begin with simply how you perceive your interactions with other peopleNotice how much of your perception of the situation is just that your perceptionWe talk about the garbage we collect in the course of the day How much of that garbage is selfproducedTo put it really crudely how much of it is just your own shit that youre carrying aroundThis is not to say that other people arent behaving in evil outrageous or horrible waysThere are people like that in the world but if your peace of mind were totally dependent on everybody elses behaving themselves youd be their slaveYoud never get freeBut as the Buddha said the whole issue of suffering is something we can overcome through our own effortsThis means that we have to look at the suffering we create for ourselvesAs for what other people are doing thats their responsibilityIt doesnt have to impinge on usAnd as for the baggage we carry around If we had to go back and straighten out all the horrible things we did in the past before we could gain Awakening wed never be doneBut it turns out that when you simply learn to drop old habits Awakening is possibleAfter all the suffering youre experiencing right now is a combination of things coming from the past and things youre doing right now including the way youre perceiving things right nowA frequent image in meditation instructions is that all you have to do is turn on a light and the darkness goes awayNo matter how many eons the darkness has reigned all you have to do is turn on the light once and thats the end of the darknessAll you have to do is work on how youre perceiving things in the present moment and when things finally click you dont have to worry about what other people tell you you dont have to worry about the world you dont have to worry about the self you dont have to worry about what youve done in the past for youve learned a new habit youve developed a new skillAnd the development of that new skill changes everythingOne of the things you notice in meditation as you start looking at your thoughts looking at your feelings looking at sensory input is that the solidity of your world starts dissolving away  both your sense of the world outside and your sense of yourself insideAnd in some cases just that much feels liberating  free from the heavy burdens you normally carry aroundYou begin to see that the heaviness is something you yourself have invested these things withBut that lack of solidity is not total liberationThe reason we want to let things seem less solid in this way is so that we can see patterns wed otherwise missYou notice that when the Buddha summarizes the essence of his Awakening  at least the part thats worth teaching worth passing on  he focuses on the principle of causality the connection between thingsIn particular he focuses on the connections between what he calls name and form on one hand and consciousness on the otherStarting with this connection he points out how suffering is built on top of itThe important elements of name and form are contact and intentionThe way you regard the contact is another element of name and form called attentionBut here contact means not only contact at the senses but also contact among different things going on the in mindFrom that kind of contact you make choices you make up your mind you want to do this you want to do thatYou have an intention that leads to actionsThe Buddha wants you to see thisThis is the process of fabricationThis is how we create our worlds how we create our sense of selfAnd he wants you to look at it directly as its happeningThe reason we dont see it is because we divide things up into things that exist things that dont exist our self and what lies outside of our selfThis set of distinctions tends to point our attention away from what were directly experiencingThe things we experience Do they really existDo they not existIn other words is there something lying behind themIs there nothing lying behind themThis kind of questioning pulls our attention away from what were experiencing to focus on what we assume is either out there behind it or not out there behind itWe find ourselves placing our trust in things we dont even see cant even experienceThe same with the distinction between self and things outside ourselves When something is inside of our self we dont observe it very wellWe identify with itIts like putting your foot into a shoe Your foot starts getting shaped by the shoe without your really noticing itAs for things outside of yourself youre not really responsible for themThey dont matter so muchThats your attitudeSo both of these ways of looking at things pull your attention away from what the Buddha said is the real issue how your intentions give rise to suffering how the process of fabrication gives rise to sufferingHe wants you to look at these things as a process so that you can understand the patternsThe first step is to see what kinds of fabrication are blatantly unskillful so that you can learn how to drop themAnd then as your sensitivity to the idea of skillful and unskillful gets more and more refined you find yourself dropping more and more refined thingsUltimately you can drop the whole process of fabrication altogetherBut first we have to start with blatant thingsThis is why we start with the breathWhat kind of breathing is skillful breathingWhat kind of breathing is unskillful breathingWhat kinds of perceptions are skillful what kinds are unskillfulThe breath and the questions about the breath are all elements in the process of fabricationWhen youre talking to yourself as you meditate what kind of talking is skillful what kind of talking is notThe meditation points you right to this level and asks you to drop your other levels of analyzing other levels of looking at experience because looking at the process of fabrication as its happening is where youre going to see what you really need to seeWhat is the cause what is the effectWhich causes are better than other causesWhich effects are better than other effectsThis is why the Buddhas most important teachings are the four noble truths because they point to cause and effect skillful cause and unskillful cause desirable effect and undesirable effectSimple very basic basic terms pleasure pain ease and stress happiness and sufferingThese are things weve known since even before we could verbalize anything but we havent understood themSo the Buddha is trying to get you to pull the mind down to that preverbal level as much as you canThat becomes your basis for looking at things for mastering the processes of breathing thinking and perceiving so that you can put these processes to the ideal purpose which is finally to go beyond all of themSo try to get to this basic level where youre just looking at the building blocks the very basic basic actions that then get constructed into larger and larger patterns as youre looking at your breath as youre going out and functioning in the worldWhen you dont have any other duties you can simply watch the process of how the eye and forms meet and then the way you comment on them the way you direct your eyes to look at certain things in certain waysThats a process tooYou want to be able to shift in and out of that mode because if you work in this mode all day long you wouldnt be able to function at work wouldnt be able to get along with peopleBut if youre good at shifting in and out of these modes dealing on the level of people when you need to dealing on the level of the building blocks when you have the opportunity you learn a lot of interesting lessons about how the mind works where the elements that lead to unskillfulness  lack of mindfulness lack of discernment lack of concentration  come inYou begin to catch themIts like learning another languageYou dont forget your original language its just that you learn how to function on another level in a new contextAnd people who become bilingual begin to notice that they have a separate personality in the other language a separate sense of how the world works in the other languageThe process of becoming skilled in the other language is a very good lesson in learning how to take things apart in a new way seeing processes as they happenThen you turn around and you have a new perspective on your original language as wellSo were training the mind here to be multilingual able to function in many different contexts and in particular getting good at this context of simply looking at the processes without worrying about what entities do or dont lie behind them or about which part of the process is you and which part is notThe question here is which activities are skillful and which ones are unskillfulLearn to look at things as activities as events in a causal chainAnd this is not just a game of perception because it has a really good purpose release total freedomThats what you can gain as you learn to look at things simply from the perspective of what leads to what which actions lead to which resultsThat way you learn to see things that you never before really thought of as actions simply as actions as part of a causal chainThats one of the things that the Buddha means by the word emptiness You dont load this causal chain down with your preconceived notions or the constructs you tend to build around itInstead you learn how to see events simply as that as events empty of any other questions that would pull you off in other directionsEverything in life is fabricatedIts all put togetherAnd it doesnt just fall together on its ownA lot of effort goes into putting things togetherAnd because we have to put so much effort into life we want to make sure that our effort is well directed our energy is well spentOtherwise you can waste whole lifetimes of a lot of effort a lot of hard hard work and have nothing really to show for itAs the Buddha pointed out the best use of our efforts is to find those spots where the whole fabricated system opens out to something unfabricatedEverything else thats fabricated he said to look at as meansEven our intermediate goals along the path are means to a further end so we have to learn to look at them just as that as meansEven our relations with other people should be regarded as means to this higher endNow this would sound selfish and calculating if it werent for the fact that our goal is one that gives no harm to anyone at allLook at those reflections on the four requisitesJust the fact that youre born with a body means that youre a big consumer of food clothing shelter and medicineSo one of the kindest things you can do for anyone is to get yourself out of the systemThink of all the suffering that goes into keeping you fed and clothed and sheltered and making sure your health stays good  all the work from the plants on up the people who have to grow the plants the people who have to buy the plants transport the plants that so you have food to eatSomeone once traced a sweatshirt from Uzbeki cotton through Iranian mills and South Korean factories and finally showing up in a Gap warehouse in KentuckyAnd thats just clothingIt goes all over the world a couple of times before it gets to you just to meet your need for protection against the elementsThe fact that you have this body means that youre constantly consuming and that a lot of work goes into meeting the bodys needsSo the issue is how to get the best use out of the body because someday youre going to have to throw it awayIf you dont let go of it nicely its going to push you out and before you go youll probably have to put up with disease and all the other problems that come as you begin to lose your grip This part of the body stops functioning that part stops functioning you grow incontinent So you want to learn how to look at the body not as an end in and of itself but as a means as a tool in the practice leading to a happiness beyond the bodyIf you expect too much happiness simply from having a body youre making unrealistic demands on itIts the same with relationshipsIf youre expecting a relationship to provide you with all the happiness you want in the world its going to be a difficult relationshipOften subconsciously thats the kind of relationship we have with our own bodiesSo learn how to look at the body in its true nature so that youre not surprised when it grows ill and does funny things as it grows illOnce when I was in Thailand I was one of a group of monks visiting a man in the hospitalHe had developed liver cancer and didnt know how much longer he was going to live so he wanted to make some meritThats why we wentUnusually for his generation in Thailand hed been a fitness freak and had been very proud all the way up through his fifties that hed stayed slim and trim while all of his friends had gotten paunchyWe talked about how he should meditate but he kept complaining about how ashamed he was that his stomach had bloated up from the liver cancer and that he was no longer in good shapeHe couldnt focus his mind on the breath all because he had developed unrealistic expectations about the bodys potential for healthBut if you learn to expect that the bodys going to grow diseased no matter how well you care for it disease is not such a shock or a problem when it actually comesThis is one of the reasons for that contemplation on the parts of the body  to realize theres the potential for all kinds of stuff to happen in the body to realize that thats the bodys natureAs long as you latch onto it as yours and develop pride around it if you look at its health as a goal in and of itself  whether through exercise or natural foods or whatever else  youre setting yourself up for a problemBut if you see it simply as a means to a higher end youre in a lot better shapeSo when you find the mind growing concerned about the body  and many times its amazing as your life gets more and more simplified as a meditator how you can get more and more obsessed with the body making sure that its healthy making sure its getting the right food and medicines  you have to develop a sense of proportion around those issues so that you can focus on using the body for other thingsAfter all its one of the foundations of mindfulness one of the frames of referenceYou have to learn how to be on friendly terms with itIts funny We contemplate Filled with all sorts of unclean things and at the same time Be friends with the body But thats an important part of being friends with people being very clear about their shortcomings so you dont demand too much out of them and at the same time gaining a clear sense of where their strengths actually lieAnd the body does have a lot of strengthsIts a good place to stayAs long as youre alive you can take it as a frame of referenceAs the Buddha said its one of the ways of creating an island for yourselfAs he was about to die he told his monks You cant depend on the BuddhaYou cant depend on the person of the Tathagata because like every other person his body is going to have to go So he reminded all of his followers to make themselves an islandHe said How do you do thatTake the body in and of itself as your frame of reference ardent alert and mindful putting aside greed and distress with regard to the world Thats one of the four ways of creating your islandIn other words you take the body just as it is as youre immediately experiencing itAnd one way of doing that is to stay with the breath coming in going out being with the sensation of the breathOr you can analyze the parts of the bodyOr the elements of the body the warmth which is the fire element the motion in the body which is the wind element the cool and liquid sensations the water element and the solid and heavy ones the earth elementTry to bring them into a balance as a way of keeping yourself anchored in the present momentOne of the reasons we do this is because there are not that many narratives around these thingsThe breath has one narrative Its in and its out its comfortable and its notThats itNot much of a narrativeAnd its a great dissolver for the narratives the mind spins for itselfOnce the mind spins its narratives it snares itself like a spider caught in its own webSomeone once said that the universe isnt made out of atoms its made out of storiesThat may not be true of the physical universe but the universe of our lives is certainly made out of stories and often theyre oppressive stories stories that create a lot of suffering for ourselves and for the people around usAnd yet we allow ourselves to get caught up in themA good way to cut through those narratives is just to stay with the sensation of the body in and of itself here in the present momentThis helps get you out of the narratives so that you can realize how unreal they areAt the same time you see all the effort that goes into those narrativesAnd what do you get out of themA lot of times its sufferingSome narratives are useful but the important point of this practice is that you put yourself in a position where you can choose which narratives youre going to get involved with and which ones youre notOtherwise youre subject to everything the mind spins outSo whatever way you have of making yourself comfortable with the sensation of the body in the present  working with the breath working with other parts of the body working with the elements  regard that as your island as your safe haven outside of the narrativesThat way the mind has a foundationOnce it has a foundation its not knocked over by thingsEvents in the world can go past you they can go through you as long as youre not latching onto thingsThe sense of the body can provide a larger context for all your experiences of the worldOnce you have this sense of being here in your foundation then the experiences of the world are just sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations all contained within this context of the bodyThis is not to deny that they have reality but look for instance at your experience of color How do you know that the sky is actually blue out there the way you see itWhats blue about the frequency of the light waves scattered by the molecules in the airThe blue is all in your brains reactions to the impulses sent in by the eyes thats allIts something experienced in the context of the bodyAll the objects of the senses are experienced here in the context of the bodyWhen you realize that it helps make this context a lot stronger the foundation gets more deeply setIts more allencompassing less likely to get knocked over by thingsSo the body is good grounding for concentration practiceIts also a good object for insight practice developing insight into the whole issue of which actions are skillful which ones are not which mental qualities lead to suffering which mental qualities lead to the end of suffering which assumptions pile on suffering which assumptions are part of the pathThe word sañña has as one of its meanings assumptions the way you label thingsFor example theres the way you label painSome of the ways you label it cause it to build up make it more and more of an issueOr you can label it in other ways that cut through the issuesOne way of dealing with pain  once the mind settles down and can actually look at pain and not feel threatened by it  is to ferret out when you have a feeling of pain exactly which sensations are the pain sensations and which sensations are the body sensations  again the four elements solidity warmth coolness movementWe tend to glom the whole thing together but when you start taking it apart and seeing it as specific separate sensations you begin to see how fleeting pain is just like pleasureThe actual sensations of the body are more lasting and the pain sensations come and go come and go come and go sometimes in very quick successionEven in a part of the body that seems to be nothing but a mass of pain you can start ferreting out the different sensations to see which sensation precisely is the pain there and which are other sensations  heat solidity  that have somehow gotten glued to the pain by your labelingIf you label them in a different way they get ungluedInstead of your hip or your back or your leg being a whole mass of pain you realize there are just these fleeting sensations of pain together with other fleeting sensationsThis makes pain a lot less threateningIt also shows you the power of your perceptions that what you thought was a given was actually something you had glued together yourselfThis makes you want to turn around and look at the whole process of labeling things in the mind in other areas as wellSo in all these cases youre using the body as an aid in the practice which is aimed at pursuit of true happinessIf youre looking at the body as a goal in and of itself its going to disappoint you  big time  but if you learn to use it as a tool the happiness that results as you use it wisely gets more and more solid more and more secureAs you get more selfreliant in this way you lean less on other peopleYour efforts produce more happiness both for yourself and for the people around you because you spend less time weighing everyone down with your unnecessary burdensSo developing a balanced attitude toward the body is a very important part of the practiceAnd to develop that balance we have different tools Some tend to emphasize the shortcomings of the body others the importance of the bodyInstead of saying that you like some tools and dont like other tools remember that all the tools have their function they all have their time and their placeThe more tools you master the better off you are because you have tools for any situation  whatever comes upPleasure and pain are big issues in our lives  so big that youd think we would understand them betterIts because we let ourselves get pushed around by these things without really looking into them Thats why we suffer so muchAnd one of the reasons we dont look into them is because its hardPain especially is hard to look atWeve been dealing with pleasure and pain ever since we were born and a lot of our habits for dealing with pleasure and pain are things we learned before we could even talk before we could understand anything at allSo theres a lot of ignorance here that we havent exploredMeditating is basically making up our minds to try and understand these two issues  which are basically one issue the issue of feelingWe start out by establishing a beachhead for ourselvesIn the midst of all the chaos of the world we have our little corner hereThats what Ajaan Suwat liked to call the monastery here our quiet corner You have to make a quiet corner in the mind as wellIf you wait for the world to settle down and be a good place to live in where everybodys fair and just youll never have your chance to straighten out your own mindYoull die firstThis is why you have to start here creating this little corner and giving all your attention to this one spot where youre focusing on the breath or whatever your meditation object isThe purpose is to create a little space at least where you can put aside the madness of the world  where you feel solid secure where theres a sense of wellbeingSo you find a spot thats relatively comfortable and you work to make it more comfortableYou learn how to recognize when the breath is too long or too short  because it doesnt feel rightNobody out there can tell you that this kind of breathing is too long or that this kind of breathing is too short too shallow too deep or whateverYouve got to notice these things on your ownLearn how to be sensitive just to this process of breathing and figure out for yourself What is the sign of a breath thats too long or too shortYouve got to develop your own sensitivitiesThis is what insight is all about developing your inner sensitivity to pleasure and pain so that you can detect them on their subtlest levelsIf you wait until theyre really strong you get overwhelmedSo start on this subtle level here just the breathingThen when youve got a spot here that feels good  the breath comes in it feels good the breath goes out it feels good  you can let the sense of boundary around your little spot dissolve awayThink of the sense of ease spreading out from that spot flowing along whatever channels there are in the body that pleasure can flow permeating in all directionsAgain this is up to you to decide what works in your sense of the bodyTeachers can give pointers but youve got to take the pointers and put them into practice and see what works and what doesnt work for youIts a matter of developing the right sensitivityYou cant take someone elses insights and just slap them onto your experience and claim to have wisdomDiscernment comes in three forms the discernment you learn from other people  the things you hear the things you read  thats one level the things you think through  thats another level and then finally the things you learn by trying to develop mindfulness alertness and other good qualities of the mindThe third level is where the insight really becomes your own  its your own sensitivity showing you these thingsOnce youve developed your beachhead your quiet corner work out from thereSee how it relates to other things going on in the body  particularly other feelings of pleasure other feelings of painSome kinds of pain you can work throughAs you expand the sense of the comfortable breath it begins to dissolve the pain awayOr if theres a sense of tension around the pain you can dissolve the tension awayEven though the pain may stay there dissolving the tension around it can help a lotIt makes it a lot easier to live with these thingsSo get as much of the body as comfortable as you canThats when you can really look into the pains still remaining because youve got your foundation and youve been developing sensitivityYou can begin to see which part of the pain is physical and which is mental  in other words which part of the pain comes from actions of the mind the way the mind reacts to the raw data of physical pain the way it puts a label on it the way it constructs dialogues around itAll the wild beasts in your savannah here are going to come gathering around the waterhole of the painThat little child who is always feeling wronged the little child who feels  whatever You find that when you get in touch with your inner child it whines a lotAnd especially here right at the painIf you can learn not to identify with it you learn a lot of interesting thingsYou sense how when this particular thought comes and surrounds the pain it makes the pain worseThis particular thought makes it betterYou see these things through your own sensitivity by having a place to stand and watch where youre not totally threatened by the painAt the same time you learn how to deal with pleasureIts so easy when theres a sense of pleasure in the body just to drop the breath and forget about your meditation and to indulge in the pleasureThats something you also have to work to overcomeIts not that you want to destroy the pleasure its just that you learn how to be with it how to use it and not get sucked in by itIn other words you learn how to change your relationship both to pleasure and to painIf you approach pleasure the right way you can use it as a foundation for stronger and stronger powers of concentration and more and more stillnessThe greater the stillness the more sensitivity you can bring to discerning pleasure and the painSo in both cases youre trying to learn how to deal with pleasure and pain and not be overwhelmed by them to watch how your mind reacts in unskillful ways to them so you can begin to unlearn a lot of the bad habits you developed way back whenAs you learn how to approach both pleasure and pain in more skillful ways  as tools on the path rather than ends in themselves  you find that your new understanding has an impact on the entirety of your life because so much of your life is driven by pleasure and painWhen you can see them both more clearly  and your reactions to them more clearly  youre not drivenYou have a wider range of choiceMore freedomAnd it all starts right here at the basic building blocksThe physical world may be made out of atoms but the world of your experience is made out of little things like this  pleasures and painsSo use the techniques of the meditation to become more skillful in how you deal with the basic building blocksOnce the basic building blocks are well in hand then the whole rest of your life gets rebuiltOne of the purposes of meditation is to sensitize yourself to the fact that youre not simply a passive observer of whats going onLife isnt a television show that you simply sit and watchIts an interactive video gameYoure actively creating the characters designing the plot in addition to watching itThe Buddhas teachings on sankhara fabrication point to this factHe defines fabrication as intentional actsThere is an element of intention in all your experienceEverything you sense whether in the physical world or the mental world has an element of intentionThats what makes it an experienceWithout that intention you wouldnt experience anythingBecause our intentions aim at happiness what were living with right now is the result of our attempts at happiness pleasure wellbeingThats a sobering thoughtYou look at what youre experiencing and some of its happy and some of its notAnd to think that this is the result of every act youve done to achieve happiness It gives you pauseWhen you think in this way you begin to see the areas where youve fallen shortBut at the same time you can focus on the areas where youve had some successAfter all if you hadnt had some success you wouldnt be here meditatingYou wouldnt be a human beingYoud be prowling around as a common animal a hungry ghost a prisoner of hellSo when you practice concentration the Buddha has you focus on the sense of wellbeing youve already got hereWhat you need to do is to learn how to maximize that wellbeing  because one of the reasons were so careless in the way we approach happiness is that we get serious about it only when theres a lot of painWe focus on the painWeve got to fix itAnd theres a sense of desperation about trying to fix our pain fix our sufferingsYet when things get easy we get lazyComplacentAll we want to do is just wallow in that sense of wellbeingAnd of course wallowing in it is not a cause for more happinessIt just eats up what we already haveSo the trick is to learn how to develop a sense of wellbeing and then not to be heedless  to see what further good we can get out of that wellbeingAjaan Lee gives an exampleHe says its like having a tree that gives coconutsIf you want you can eat up all the coconuts but thats all you get  a stomach full of coconuts and soon youre hungry againBut if you take some of the coconuts and plant them you get more trees and then more trees because youre willing to take what youve got and invest some of itIn the same way when you meditate you take what sense of wellbeing you have and invest some of it in creating more wellbeingSo you start by focusing on where the breath feels good coming in feels good going outIf you cant get a good sense of ease with the breath start with thoughts of goodwillWish goodwill for yourself goodwill for other beingsThats a comfortable thought because its not fighting with the wishes of any being anywhereEverybody wants to be happySo you wish them happinessAnd then from that sense of harmonious wellbeing you focus on the breathThere should be at least some spot in the body where the breath feels goodLook for it and then keep watch over it in such a way that you dont spoil itSometimes when you focus on the body you tense up around the part where youre focusingThat makes it tight uncomfortablePart of this comes from envisioning the body as something very solidRemember that what youre experiencing here is an energy field the energy flowing through the bodySome parts of the energy field may seem to feel more solid than others but if you think about the whole thing as the flowing of an energy field then if there are areas where it seems blocked or squeezed you can think of opening up a new channel so that the energy easily flows in flows out without your having to pull it or push it or exert any pressure on it at allIt comes in comes out on its ownAll you have to do is keep tabs on itAllow it to be comfortableThink of it that way Instead of making it comfortable youre going to allow it to be comfortableAnd then allow it to stay that wayDont interfere with itDont mess with itIn other words as long as youre going to be shaping the present moment try to be sensitive to how youre doing itIf things are going well dont mess them upBe alert to what youre doing because every action as the Buddha said aims at happinessBe alert to thatWhat youre experiencing has an element of your intention for happiness built into itBe sensitive to that and also to whether its working or notIf its not working you can changeChange the way you breathe change the way you focus change the way you conceive of your experience of the present the experience of the body sitting here right nowAllow for some more possibilitiesThis is what a lot of the meditation opens up seeing the possibilities of what can be done with the present momentFor example a thought comes into the mindOur tendency is then to just jump with the thought and go into the thoughtworld and ride with it wherever it goesOr in other words we get taken wherever its going to take usBut if youre really observant you begin to notice that its possible for a thought to arise without your going with itIt doesnt have to pull you away from the breathAfter all the breath is still here going in going outIf thoughts destroyed our breathing we would have died a long time agoThoughts come in thoughts go out and the breath is still thereAnd theres a part of your awareness in touch with thatWe tend to block that awareness out so we can get into the thought but the trick here is to allow it to stay open so that when a thought comes it doesnt pull you away the way it used toThat possibility you may not have noticed beforeAnd as you meditate you find other possibilities as wellWere experimenting with the potential for finding happiness so always keep that experimental attitude in mindWhat is experiment except for the belief that maybe not everything is already knownMaybe some of the knowledge that has been passed on from other people or that weve cooked up ourselves isnt rightSomeone once defined science as the belief that the experts can be wrongMeditation serves the same function allowing you to question the things you thought you knew for sureThey may be wrongCheck that outYouve got the breath and the mind here in the present moment as your laboratory so work on these things to create a more stable more satisfying sense of pleasure right here and nowEven though this pleasure is fabricated its part of the pathIts the pleasure part of the pathPeople often complain about how the four noble truths focus on suffering but if you look at them carefully you see that the most important of them is the fourth truth the path to the end of sufferingIts the first one the Buddha taughtIts the one truth that contains all four noble truths right there in Right ViewAt its heart though is Right ConcentrationIf you look at the definition of Right Concentration thats where you find the pleasureThe first jhana starts out with a sense of rapture and ease or rapture and pleasure born of seclusionIn other words you pull the mind away from its outside objects outside distractions and just stay right hereThen as you create a greater sense of pleasure a greater sense of ease in the present moment thats the heart of the pathIts something you developSo were here trying to maximize the pleasure weve got not simply to bliss out  although its nice to be able to bliss out  but also to be alert to be mindful to still have a sense of heedfulnessWhats the use of this blissThats the next stepWhen you have this sense of pleasure born from seclusion you can see things more clearly  if you handle the pleasure right if your attitude toward the pleasure is rightWhen the mind has a sense of ease and wellbeing you can look at your attachments you can look at all of the other mistakes youve been making with a much greater sense of fairness a much greater sense of objectivity with less sense of being desperateIts like the difference between people who have to worry about where tomorrows meal is coming from as opposed to those who dont have to worry about that at allWhen you dont have to worry about your next meal you have a lot more time to think about things to look at things to ponder them objectivelySo when we meditate were developing a skill that gives us a sense of ease right now that we can begin to trust that we can tap into again and again and againWe dont have to worry about where our next hit of happiness is going to come fromThat changes the way the mind approaches its experiences its pleasures and painsIt becomes a lot less desperateOf course theres always the danger of complacency when you figure you can tap into the breath at any time but if you can overcome that complacency you begin to realize that this is an extremely useful state of mind  a very skillful way of approaching happiness and a very skillful way of providing a foundation for yourself so that you can find greater happinessAs the Buddha said the noble path is fabricatedIts the highest fabrication of allSo when we know its fabricated we should do it mindfully with a sense of alertness to what were doing and to the results were gettingThis is what makes it a skillAnd we see the results not only in the immediate present but also over timeAs I said earlier what were living with is the results of our attempts at happinessAnd as we practice we find that the results get better and better because were clearer and clearer about what were doingAll of the Buddhas teachings are meant to help us in this quest for a true happiness the ultimate happiness nibbanaThats where theyre all aimedIts a happiness that isnt fabricated but the only way you can get there the only way you can get beyond fabrication is to learn how to fabricate wellSometimes at the end of suttas when the Buddha has been teaching the monks he concludes by telling them to go meditateActually what he says is to go do jhana because thats the kind of meditation he taughtSome people think that jhana is only one of two types of meditation he taught that he also taught vipassana but theres never any passage where he tells anybody to go do vipassanaIts always Go do jhana This is because he saw jhana as a practice where you develop both tranquility and insight togetherIn other words you need to develop tranquility and insight just to get into jhana to begin with to get into good states of concentrationThen when youve developed that concentration you can use it to develop qualities of tranquility and insight even furtherSo try not to see the two qualities as separateWhen youre steadying the mind youve got to have some understanding of what youre doingAfter all the first jhana involves directed thought and evaluation which are called sankharas  verbal sankharas  and sankharas are the topics of insightWhen you direct your thoughts to the breath and then evaluate the breath this is how you settle downThe more precisely you evaluate the breath the more sensitive you are to the breath sensations in the body then the more you can make them a comfortable place to beAnd in the course of doing that you learn things both about the breath and about the mind what kinds of sensations the mind likes what kinds it doesnt like how the mind affects the breath how the breath affects the mindRight there is a lot of raw material for insightBut in the beginning your purpose is more to settle the mindThis is the tranquility side of meditation practice finding the sensations that are easiest to stay with and learning how to maximize those sensations so that you can develop a oneness of mind around themOneness here means not only being steadily with one object but also allowing the object to fill your awareness so that its the one thing youre aware ofWhen you focus on breathing its not just the air coming in and out of the lungsIts a sensation of energy that flows through the whole body and youre sitting in the middle of this vast breathing process that affects every nerve every muscleThe whole experience of your body is related to the breathThe more you can perceive the breath in that way the easier it is to settle downAnd the easier it is to stay settled down working on what the Buddha calls the enlarged mind  mahaggatam cittam  an awareness thats all aroundThat kind of awareness is what allows you to see things for what they areIts the foundation for the vipassana side of jhana practiceIn other words the Buddha doesnt say to stop doing jhana in order to start doing vipassanaHe just says to learn how to look at the jhana in a different way as a process of fabrication how its put togetherWe often think that vipassana means seeing things as they are the idea being that theres something already out there  things as they are  and theyre all covered over by our preconceived notions our mental fabricationsWhat weve got to do is clear those fabrications away and that will leave just the pristine things as they areBut thats not really how insight worksThat understanding actually gets in the way of insights arising because the Buddha didnt say things as they are He said things as theyve come to be how theyve come into beingThats a process of fabricationIts not the case that fabrications lie on top of pristine things as they areFabrication is how those things have come into being in the first placeSo once the mind is settled down you want to look at the fabricating that goes on in the mind to see how the things you experience contain a very large element of fabricationThe fabrication is your intentional input Thats what the Buddha wants you to seeYou might think that if only you could get rid of your fabrication you would see the pristine things as they are but if you take away the fabrication the things are no longer thereYour experience of the world is a process of fabrication to gain insight you have to see that fabrication in actionAnd the best place to see it in action is when the mind is really still when youre fabricating a state of stillness in the mindTo get really familiar with the fabrication process you have to keep doing it with as much skill as you canIts like learning about eggsYou could sit and look at an egg for days but what would you know about itNot very much for all you can see is the shellBut what if you can crack it openYou see whats insideAnd then you can take whats inside and make it into different thingsYou can make it into scrambled eggs fried eggs omelets soufflsAnd the more skilled you are at making different egg dishes the more you understand eggs how they react to different kinds of heat what they do when you put them over low heat what they do when you put them over high heat what they do when you mix them with different ingredientsThe more you work with the eggs in this way the more you understand themIts the same with the mindIf you really want to understand the fabrication of the mind make it into a nice soufflIn other words very purposefully fabricate something really good with your mind like a nice state of concentration with a nice comfortable breathAnd in doing so you learn a lot more about the mind than you would simply looking at it without any knowledge of cause and effectYouve got to manipulate it to see how cause and effect are operatingThats when you understand the process of fabricationYou get the mind really still and try to develop an allaround awarenessThen you protect that awarenessThats when you start seeing fabrication in actionAs you try to maintain your concentration what destroys itAt first we think that its destroyed by things coming in from the outside but thats not the caseA lot of the inside fabrication comes bubbling up to destroy it as wellSounds dont destroy your concentration its your reaction to soundsWhat other people do doesnt destroy your concentration its what you doAs Ajaan Chaa says sounds dont disturb you you disturb the soundsIf you want to really see this clearly the best place to see it is in the mind with this allaround awarenessDont leave this awarenessIf you leave jhana in order to gain insight youve lost your foundation and you just thrash aroundAnd the mind can get very anxious very alienated very threatened by the insights you try to push on it because it realizes it doesnt have a foundationSo stay in your foundation and look to see whats going to arise thereLike a spider on a web You want to be sensitive to the whole body in the same way that the spider is sensitive to the whole webThe best way to do that is to have all the different strands connectedThats why we work on connecting all the comfortable sensations in the body so that they form a network a network of heightened sensitivity insideThen all you have to do is stay in touch with the networkAs soon as anything comes up  maybe a little stirring here and there on the boundary line between the body and mind  you sense it through the networkAs soon as you sense it you can zap itA little stirring forms and you can tease it out unform it zap itIf youre not quick to zap it the mind will identify it as a thought about this or that and then you create a whole thoughtworld based on the way you labeled the stirringThe best way to see the stages in how that happens is to try to stop them as soon as you notice them and dissolve the thought awayYou may find that a part of the mind gets frustrated when you zap things in this wayIt wants to continue weaving those thoughts exploring those thoughtworldsIf you want to understand that compulsion to keep creating these thoughtworlds one of the best ways is to thwart itKeep saying Nope nope nope As soon as theres the slightest little bit of recognition that this is a thought about that thats a thought about this dissolve it  no matter what the thought may seem to be  and see which part of the mind starts screamingThats how you start understanding the will the intentional element behind the fabricationOnce you understand it you can dismantle it bit by bit by bitThis way you get more and more sensitive to the parts of the mind that you used to keep hidden from yourselfAs you bring them out into the open thats where insight can do its workThese things dont come out of their lair unless you stand in the entrance to keep their food from coming inOr its like people who live in underground strongholds who like to pull the strings They wont come out unless they feel frustrated because they cant pull the strings anymore so you have to step on their stringsThis is how you ultimately come to understand the whole process of fabricationAnd where do you look for itWherever theres stressAjaan Suwat used to mention this often Look at where theres stress and thats where youll see fabrication where you see fabrication is where you see the ignorance thats been causing you to sufferAs you bring more and more of that ignorance out into the open there comes a point where it just stops  because you see even the slightest little things that would cause stressIn seeing these things you replace the ignorance with knowledgeAll of the background commentating that goes on in the mind and is trying to direct everything starts coming more and more to the foreWhen you see it clearly you can allow it to stopAnd thats when you come to see something unfabricated where the stress really endsYou dont have to go out of concentration in order to see itYou take the concentration apart from withinSo this is why when youre trying to gain insight and youre feeling strung out and anxious its a sign youve lost your foundationYoure looking in the wrong placeGet the mind into a good state of concentration have it allaround aware and then start looking at the process of fabrication as it appears from this viewpointYou dont have to go anywhere elseSomeone once asked me how I dealt with people who found the experience of Awakening to be disorientingThats about as wrongheaded a question as you can getAwakening is very orienting  the most orienting thing in lifeIt shows you that theres something a lot more solid and reliable than youd ever imagined beforeIt shows you something deathless and totally free from sufferingAnd where do you look for itYou look right here right where the mind is settled and stillThen you learn to see that settled stillness as a process of fabrication and you start taking it apart right where its happeningYou dont have to go anywhere elseBring the mind to the breath for this is where everything important is happeningYou want to be as still as possible so that you can catch sight of all these important things happening because most often we dont see that theres anything important hereThe breath goes in goes outThats all we see weve got other business to do so we let it go on automatic pilotAs a result we miss a lot of the things that are going onBut when we meditate we stop to take time to look at this processAjaan Lee once made the comment that when you have the mind with the breath youve got all four of the foundations of mindfulness right here all four of the potential frames of reference that you can use in your practiceTheres body feelings mindstates and the mental qualities that are either helping or hindering you in seeing whats going onIts all hereIf you want to see the relationships among these things you watch right hereYou dont watch anywhere elseWhat are you watching forWell you want to see how the mind shapes thingsAjaan Suwat once made the comment that if youre looking for ignorance you dont have to look very farJust look at the fabrications of the mindThe principle of dependent coarising says that fabrications are conditioned by ignoranceSo if youre wondering where this ignorance is that were trying to track down its right here where the mind is fashioning things  fashioning bodily sensations and mental eventsFrom fabrication comes consciousness and consciousness leads to name and form physical and mental phenomenaIts worth thinking about Fabrication this process of making comes before phenomena themselvesWe hear so often how people shape their reality how our perceptions tend to filter the ways we see reality and yet we dont see it as its actually happening even though it happens very directly right hereEven in your own sense of the body there are lots of different sensations coming in through the various nerve endsThe mind has its habits for selecting among these sensations to present itself with a picture of whats going onSometimes the physical sensations get mixed up with the mental sensations for lots of mental information is coming in at the same timeAnd so we select things block some things out highlight others to create the story of our mind our sense of whats going on in hereAnd theres ignorance underlying it allWhat were trying to do here is to replace that ignorance with clear knowingThis is why we bring the mind to the present moment so we can watch this process as it happensBring it right to that frontier where the body and the mind meet where mental and physical phenomena meet the mind watching the breathIts right here that you can see the process of fabrication really clearly if you lookBut first youve got to create the conditions for it to be clearThis is why we practice concentrationWeve got to get the mind still and engaged in mastering a skill the skill of being stillThats when its easiest to see the mind when the mind is clearest when its aware of what its doing and of what the results areEven if its not doing anything at all you want to be aware of the fact that its not doing anything and aware of the results of not doing anythingPeople often talk about how when theyre practicing a skill if they get really good at it there come times when they get into what they call the zone where everything seems automatic and even the slightest things become apparent  where theyre one with the baseball or one with the bat or one with the basketballIn the same way when you meditate you want to get one with the breathTry to get fluent in the breathTry to get on good terms be comfortable be familiar with the breath so that there comes a point where it seems like your awareness and the breath become oneOnly when we allow them to be one and to stay that way will they actually begin to separate out naturally through the process of fabricationYou can see it clearly as it happensThis is why we work so much with the breath One the mind working with the breath puts itself in a good position to observe itselfTwo by working with the breath things get calmed downIts a lot easier to see events in the mind when the breath is very still than when the breath is moving all over the placeThats why step number four in breath meditation after youre aware of the whole body is to allow what they call bodily fabrication to calm downBodily fabrication means the inandout breathYou allow the breath to calm downTry to be sensitive to whatever mechanical ways you have of breathing or to any unthoughtout ideas of what the breath should beOften those ideas will keep you pumping and pumping and pumping even when the bodys full of breath energy and doesnt need much moreIt can get by with very little inandout breathingAjaan Fuangs analogy is of a big water jar  you see these all over Thailand enormous jars for catching rainwater running off house roofsAs he says there comes a point when the jar is full and no matter how much more it rains you cant put any more water in the jarThe same with the breath energy in the body There comes a point where its fullYoure sitting here and the breath energy seems perfectly capable of just being there without pumping much in pumping much out  just an energyexchange around the edgesTry to be aware of that the sensation of energy at your skinIf you feel any tightness in your skin anywhere think of its opening up all around youThat allows all those little muscles in the pores to open up a bit and that in turn allows the breath energy to come inAs the mind settles down and is still in the midst of all this you need less and less and less oxygenIts not that youre stifling the breath or forcing it to stopYoure just getting more and more sensitive to how heavy or long the breathing has to beAfter a while you find that it naturally gets lighter and shorter if youre paying attentionThere may be longer and longer gaps between an inbreath and an outbreath  thats perfectly fine  until everything gets stillThere may be a little bit of breathing in and out right at the surfaceAjaan Lees analogy is of the vapor coming off of an ice cubeBut otherwise what youve got here seems to be a big energy fieldAnd its hard to say whether its a physical energy field or a mental energy fieldIts just an energy field  energetic but stillLearn to stay there for a good long while because this is where the interesting things happenThis is also where you get the energy you needWhen youve got the energy flowing around everything is connectedThis gives you strength gives your meditation strengthIt gives you the range in which you can watch the process of fabricationLittle things seem to stir here stir thereSometimes they dont amount to anythingSometimes they catch hold and turn into thoughtsOr else they turn into major physical sensationsIt depends on which way you interpret them how you read themJust this in itself allows you to see how much the mind shapes thingsBut for the time being you dont want to follow these thingsYou want to get good at zapping themIn other words where theres a slight complication in the energy field just comb it outOpen it up so that it doesnt tighten up into somethingGet good at that again and again and againLike those cartoon frogs with very long tongues They sit there and a fly comes by and no matter which direction the fly comes from zap they get the fly and then the tongue goes back into the mouthIn other words your center is right here wherever you have a sense of being centered in the bodyAnd then your awareness goes out to zap any of those little fabrications as they comeThen you return to your centerWhy do you do thisSo that you can get clearer and clearer about how the process of fabrication beginsWhere are those points when the mind begins to label thingsAh  this is a thought of the future this is a thought of the pastThis is your armThis is your legThis is warmthThis is coolnessThis is energyThis is solidity The mind can choose these things  choose what to focus on how to label itAnd once it chooses to give a particular interpretation it will find all sorts of evidence elsewhere in that range of your awareness to support it to provide the context for whatever that perception wasIf you get hoodwinked into those little worlds you cant see what theyre doing because all of a sudden youve got a different contextSo instead you want to maintain this context of a broad awareness at the borderline between whats physical and mentalAs you get more and more used to being here you start seeing a lot of interesting things about the processes of the mindThose are the processes we want to understand the fabrication the sankharas the Buddha talks aboutUnless you see very clearly how they happen theres no way youre going to find whats unfabricated because you keep falling into their little worlds the little contexts they create for youAnd you miss the processing itselfIts like the difference between getting involved in the story of a TV show and watching it to see how the director manipulates thingsSo much of our lives is spent in these storiesIts a good idea to step back and ask  Whos directing this and How are they directing it and What skill do they have How do they draw you inWhats the hook To make another analogy its like learning how to write magazine articlesThe editors will tell you that the first sentence the first paragraph needs a hook something to draw the reader inOtherwise the reader wont get into your contextThis is how the mind works It hooks you into a little world and takes you wherever it wants you to goAnd the raw materials are pretty meager  just this energy that begins to collect here and to clot there and turn into somethingLike those little seed crystals they use to make rainThe water vapor gathers around the seed crystals and turns into raindropsAs the raindrops add up they become a rainstormWithout the seed crystals the vapor wouldnt coalesceThese little seed crystals of fabrication form in the mind then thoughts and other things form around them and all of a sudden youve got a thought stormYou dont see this until you learn how to hang around this place where youre just with the field of energy awareness energy breath energyIt has the potential to turn into any kind of energy depending on how you interpret itIf you hang out here you start seeing lots of interesting things learn a lot about the mind  which is why we use the breath to bring us hereAnd why we continue using the breath to help us maintain this stanceWhen Ajaan Fuangs students would get to this point in their meditation hed have them play with the elements fire water earth space and consciousnessYou begin to see that the way you sense your body depends on exactly what you focus onThe potential for all six elements is all here throughout this range of energyIt depends on which sensations youre going to focus on which ones you emphasizeSeeing this serves three purposes One it gets you really focused on the present momentTwo it helps make you more comfortable being hereAnd three you see the process of fabrication at workYou see how youve got raw materials here in the present moment and how the element of fabrication shapes them into experiencesAs a meditator you want to see this clearly again and again and again so that ultimately you can detect even the most subtle of fabrications and zap those as wellSo this is why were here to get rid of our ignorance as to why there are fabrications going on why our intentions are constantly shaping thingsWe want to see if we can find that spot where we stop fabrication  not by stomping it out or holding it in suspension but finding the point where theres no intentionThe mind gets corneredIt knows that no matter which direction it goes its going to head toward fabricationIts going to reap the results of fabrication which are stressfulIt sees an opening and it goes for itThats how this strange practice of just focusing on your breath can lead you to the end of sufferingYou reach the point where you can confirm for yourself that what the Buddha taught about there being a deathless element is really trueAnd that the Buddha said is even better than sole dominion over the entire EarthSo check and see if thats true tooIn all the passages where the Buddha describes his Awakening he talks about first going through the different levels of jhanaOnce he had stabilized his mind in good solid strong states of concentration he directed it to insight  which means that the insights he got were the way experience looks from the point of view of someone in good strong concentrationThats where all the terms all the ideas and concepts come fromSo if you want to understand the ideas and concepts you have to put yourself in the same placeThis is why we spend so much time working on concentration to get the mind in the right spot  centered in the fourth jhana with bright awareness filling the whole bodyThe inandout breathing at that point is stillThe mind is stillBreath energy still exists in the body but the inandout breathing has calmed down and stoppedAnd you learn to stay thereThe issues that come up in the mind while youre learning to stay there Those are the issues that shaped the Buddhas terminologyThe concepts he used say about fabrication What does fabrication look like to someone in good solid concentrationThe Buddha talks about three levels of fabrication bodily fabrication which is the breath verbal fabrication which is directed thought and evaluation and then mental fabrication feelings and perceptionsAs you move the mind through the levels of jhana directed thought and evaluation get abandoned on the second levelThats where they grow stillThen bodily fabrication the inandout breath grows still in the fourthWhat youve got left at that point are feelings and perceptionsThese are the big issues because as the Buddha pointed out feelings are the basis for cravingWhen the mind is there in the fourth jhana you can see this very clearlyThe perceptions are what shape your awareness of what youre experiencingYou can see this fact clearly as wellThere are other passages where the Buddha talks about the formless levels and each of them is based on the fourth jhanaYou take the same equanimity the same mindfulness you developed in the fourth jhana and simply change the perceptionSo when you want to understand feeling or perception this is the place to do itGet the mind really well centered and then you can watch these things as they affect the mindYou can see where they come from where they goYou can see their allure you can see their drawbacksAll the things youre supposed to see are best seen right hereWhen you divide things up in the mind before you hit this spot its like taking a knife and cutting across the grain or cutting things up in whatever shapes you may wantYoure not cutting them up from the right perspectiveAnd so you often misapply the terms you misunderstand what the Buddha is getting at because youre not in the same place where he wasIts like taking a guidebook to Paris and then landing in RomeYou look around Rome and you try to identify all of the landmarks in Paris  this is a guidebook without picturesYou see a tall tower and tell yourself Well that must be the Eiffel Tower You see Saint Peters and tell yourself That must be the Cathedral of Notre Dame But youre looking from the wrong spotThis is why the practice of good strong concentration lies at the heart of the pathYoure putting yourself in the Buddhas placeYoure standing where the Buddha stoodThat way you can learn in the same way that the Buddha learnedTheres passage in Richard Feynman where he says that the duty of every generation of scientists is to try to prove or disprove what has been handed down in the traditionThe same holds true in the practice of the DhammaWere here to prove or disprove what the Buddha taughtThe way to do it is to follow his methodAnd this is his method Get the mind centeredIn the course of centering the mind you develop good qualities mindfulness alertness the ability to keep the mind with one frame of reference without slipping off to other frames of referenceThats why mindfulness practice is such an important buildup to concentration practiceThe Buddha also says that you have to develop tranquility and powers of insightTranquility is developed by steadying the mind insight by investigating this process of fabricationConcentration practice is a good place to see this because you see different levels of fabrication falling away as the mind gets more and more still  and these are the important fabricationsThe fact that trees and mountains are fabricated Thats their business their issueOur issue is the fabrications coming up in the mind what they do to us and what we do to themSo you get the mind centered and start asking questionsActually as youve been centering it youre already asking questions Why is it that some days you follow a particular set of steps and they lead to one set of results while the next day they lead to a different set of resultsWhat did you do differentlyWhere will you lookSometimes you have to look at where the mind is to begin withAnd then you have to look at exactly how clearly you remember the series of steps youve followed and how clearly youre aware of what youre doing right now how honest you are with yourselfAs the Buddha once said that was the prerequisite for all Dhamma practiceGive me a person who is honest he said and I will teach that person the Dhamma And he doesnt mean just being honest with the teacherYou have to be honest with yourself about what youre doing what results youre gettingOnce the mind settles down and youre in this spot of being centered  with the breath still with your awareness filling the body  theres a more refined level of questions to askThis is where you have to improviseAs the Buddha said sometimes looking at things in terms of the five aggregates is what provides the important insights sometimes you have to look in terms of the six sense spheres sometimes in terms of dependent coarising sometimes in terms of the six elementsYou never know beforehand which kind of analysis is going to be right for youYou have to notice as youre meditating which kind of analysis you feel more of an affinity for more of a rapport withYouve got to test itYouve got to play with these thingsSome people dont like the word play because it doesnt sound serious enough but all intelligence comes from the ability to improviseIf you simply do whats in the books youre not following the Buddhas methodThe Buddha didnt follow what was in booksHe had to use his own powers of ingenuityWe have the advantage that were building on the discoveries he made but we still have to go back and make those same discoveries for ourselvesWe have to use the same method he usedAnd one element in that method is this ability to improviseAgain Richard Feynman A British physicist who went to study with Feynman in Cornell was amazed by on the one hand how brilliant he was in physics but also how playful he wasAfter a while he realized that the two were connectedIf you dont learn to play around with ideas you dont see new thingsIf you dont learn to play around with whats happening in the mind you dont make any discoveriesThe Buddha was the type of person who made discoveriesYou have to make yourself the type of person who makes discoveries even if its simply to reconfirm what he discoveredYou have to go through the same process really testing thingsAjaan Maha Boowa would often say Try to prove the Buddha wrong  because its only when youve done your best to prove him wrong that you can be sure that youve really proved him rightOtherwise theres always a possibility that youre simply programming your mind to think in a certain wayYou tell yourself Ah if you see theres no self if you see that all things are empty that must be Awakening But thats not the caseYou cant clone AwakeningIts always an unexpected discovery when it comesIt never comes quite the way you conceived itSo even though the Buddha gave us his discoveries and theyve been passed down for all these generations we have to keep reproving them for ourselves because we have to keep checking our understanding of what he had to sayAll of the discoveries he tells us about are in words that we can look up in the dictionaryWe can understand the words but were coming from ignorance so our understanding of the words is an ignorant understandingWe can never be quite sure that we really understand what he had to sayIf we really understood things would open upThered be AwakeningBut the fact that theres no Awakening yet means that we dont yet understandSo we have to keep testing things trying new approaches to figure where were still ignorant where our blind spots still areIf you dont improvise if you dont play you dont seeThe intelligence of a new discovery just doesnt happenSo the important thing here is the method and the heart of the method is how to get the mind centered in such a way that its both still and alert aware all around with everything very stillSee what the movements of the mind look like from that perspectiveSee how you can experiment with them from that perspective asking the kinds of questions the Buddha recommendsWatch things arise watch them pass away look for what their allure is what makes them attractiveLook for their drawbacks look for their escape from them the release from themThe Buddha was confident enough in his method that he encouraged people to test it for themselvesYou cant go just by what your teacher says he told the KalamasSo when youre testing his teaching make sure youve got the method right and see if you can prove for yourself whether what the Buddha said was true that there really is a deathless element and that you really can achieve it through your own effortsOne of the standard analogies for meditation is that youre going into battle with all the habits of the mind that create sufferingTheyre called defilements because they darken the mindAs the Buddha once said the mind is luminous but these defilements come creeping inIf the mind didnt have some luminosity you wouldnt be able to develop itEverything would stay murky and darkBut the mind does have a knowing natureIt does have the capability of seeing things clearly both inside and out  just that the defilements get in the wayTheyre like clouds that obscure the sunSo these are the things that were going to battleFortunately theyre not cloudsIf you tried to do battle with clouds youd really be up a creekIf you tried to cut through a cloud what would there be to cut throughBut if you take the analogy that youre going into battle you can start thinking about how people wage war how they engage in a successful fightThe first thing of course is learning how to pick your battlesThere are a lot of things you could fight about but youd waste your energyIf you waste your energy on the trivial things then when the important things come youre not up for themThis is why we have to focus our energies on one issue and that issue is Why does the mind create suffering for itselfEverything we do we think were doing it for the sake of happiness for the sake of our wellbeing and yet we end up doing things that cause suffering both for ourselves and for those around usMany times we see it very blatantly right before our eyes that yes this suffering is dependent on what were doing and yet we seem compelled to do itThis is the important issueIf you can take care of this one issue all other issues are going to get resolvedSo you focus on the qualities of mind that lead you to cause sufferingThose are the things youre going to battleOnce youve chosen your battle the next step is to find a good stronghold a place where youre secure where you have the advantage over the enemyThis is why we practice concentration this is why we develop mindfulness of the present momentThis is going to be your stronghold because this is where you can see these things in actionSo you want to create a place here in the present thats comfortable where you feel at ease where you feel secure where you feel solidStart out by staying with the breath  and just keep reminding yourself not to get entangled in any other issues right nowIf other issues do come up fend them off just to the extent you need in order to create a space so you can get back to the breath to a sense of ease a sense of wellbeing with the breath so that the breath feels full as you breathe in full as you breathe outYoure not squeezing out the energy of the body as you breathe out youre not building up tension as you breathe inAllow the breath to come in and out with a sense of fullness that you can maintain both through the inbreath and through the outThen let that sense of fullness spread through the bodyThats your strongholdGet so that you can stay here in all situations because youre going to need your stronghold in all situationsThere will be times when you venture out to do battle with the enemy and realize that the enemy has more troops than you expected so you need to beat a strategic retreatYou need a good place to retreat to a place to come back to no matter what the situationSo try to get familiar with this spot where the breath feels comfortable in the body where the mind feels at ease with the breathThats your strongholdIts from this position that you can do your work of insightThe qualities of insight discernment wisdom are like a swordThey cut through all the confusion they cut through all the connections that keep those defilements together that keep them strongAs you get to know the movements of your mind you begin to see that there are lots of little events in the mind that you tie togetherYou connect this one with that one that one with this one and all of a sudden youve strung together a huge enemyYou tell narratives that connect this event with that feeling and that feeling with that event and then it becomes a huge web by which you catch yourselfSo youve got to learn to cut through that webThe nature of insight as the Buddha said is in seeing things in five ways or in understanding five things about whatever the defilement is whatever the story isStep one is learning simply how to watch it ariseStep two watch it pass awayLearn to see these things simply as events that come and go in the mindThat helps give you some distance from themIn other words when a story world comes up in your mind you dont jump into the worldYou look at it as an outsiderIts the same as when you drive past a drivein theater and see a film up on the screenIf you allow yourself to get sucked into the idea that theres actually a story being portrayed up there you could drive off the roadBut if you simply see it as lights moving on the screen you dont get sucked inThat helps to dismantle any reality youd give to the filmThe same holds true with the mind We give all kinds of trust and reality to the thought constructs that come up in the mind but if you learn to see them simply as events little firings of the synapses you cut through any compulsion to get involved in that story line all over againWhen you can pull yourself out of that thoughtworld you begin to see the construction that goes into maintaining itAnd particularly you want to see two things about the way its constructedThese are steps three and fourThree is What gratification do you get out of that thoughtworldEven though it may be causing you suffering there must be some pleasure some gratification in creating itOtherwise you wouldnt indulge in itIt would hold no attraction at allSo learn to look for where that gratification isSometimes when you see it youll feel ashamed that you could have fallen for itThen step four look for the drawbacks If you stick with that thoughtworld what is it going to doWhere does it lead youSome of the drawbacks youll see immediately with the sense of tension with the sense of disease that arises both mentally and physically as you create and consume that thoughtworldSome of the drawbacks will come laterYouve got to learn to look for bothThe most difficult step is the fifth Learn to see the escape from that thoughtworld from that pattern from that habitSometimes just looking at the arising and passing away of the thoughtworld is enough to undercut any sense of reality or trustworthiness in the thoughtworld and it will go awayOther thoughtworlds are more compellingYou have to look very carefully to see the gratification to see the drawbacks and you have to use your imagination to find the escapeThis is not just a passive process of watching arising and passing awayYou have to see where in the mind theres that little voice telling you that youve got to believe in this narrative about that thoughtworld that you cant do it any other wayThere will be that voice with its repeated messageThats why its called a compulsionA lot of our compulsions come from the fact that we cant imagine any other way of reacting to a particular memory or a particular ideaOur imaginations are limited  and sometimes dishonestTo break out of the limitations and shake out the dishonesty you have to sit down and very consciously try to think of other ways of reactingOne compulsion is the part of you that says Youve got to get upset whenever this memory comes backIf you dont get upset youre just being a milquetoastPeople are going to walk all over you Put a question mark next to that and then check to see what other voices come upWhatever the voices learn how to put question marks next to them tooThe simple act of questioning reminds you that theres an alternativeAsk yourself Does that have to be trueWhat if the opposite were true And just that much can be enough to jolt your imagination to think in other ways to get out of the rut of that particular defilement whether its greed anger delusion lust fear pride jealousy whateverLearning how to cut through any defilement requires a knowledge that has these five aspects seeing it arising seeing it passing away seeing its gratification seeing its drawbacks and then seeing the escape from itWhen your sword can cut in all five directions in this way you begin to appreciate what meditation can doIt really does free you from the minds old habits of creating suffering for itself  the habits that keep telling you Im doing this Im doing that because I want to be happyYou have to do things this way in order for happiness to be found and yet turning up with unhappiness as a resultTheres a wrong connection in there that youve got to cut through and this fiveedged knowledge is what allows you to cut itSo these are your basic strategies your basic weaponsFirst youve got to choose the right battleThats why we have Right ViewThen you need a stronghold a safe place from which to launch your attackThats what the concentration is forAnd then you have to look at the events in the mind from these five anglesThats your swordWhen youre equipped in this way you can take on the really essential battle in life which is to free yourself from sufferingYouve got the tools the weapons you need to winIts all very basic but so many times in life we miss out on the good things because we overlook the basicsSo learn how to appreciate the basics because theyre the things that can really help youThat phrase in the chant just now  those who dont discern suffering  sounds a little strange doesnt itYoud think that everybody would discern suffering but the verb here is importantEverybody experiences suffering but not everybody discerns itDiscerning means to understand to see it for what it is to the point where you can let it go and put an end to itThat requires looking at it very carefullyAnd for all the suffering we go through in our lives we look at so little very carefullyThats our problemWe have a lot of ideas about suffering but have you ever stopped to ask yourself Where did you pick up those ideas Some of them go way back to before you even knew languageThe first thing that happened after you were born was that you cried  unless you were too stunned even to cry and they had to spank you to make you cryYou even experienced suffering in the wombTheres a story in the Canon about a young boy who stayed in his mothers womb for years and when he finally came out he was able to speakThe first thing he talked about was how miserable he was there in the womb in that bloody prisonSo weve been suffering all along and the way we dealt with our suffering from those very early times probably still has an impact on how we deal with it nowSay theres a pain in your legYou probably have a mental image of that pain  maybe a visual image a tactile image a sense of its shapeBack as a child when you believed in ghosts you may have seen the pain as a ghostIt was a thing with a will and you thought it was coming after youYou didnt know any betterBut even though your conscious mind knows better now a lot of your subconscious thoughts may not know betterThis is one of the reasons why we have to meditate  to get the mind still enough so you can see these subconscious thoughts in actionYou have to understand that the minds not divided into two sections the conscious mind and the unconscious mindIts just that theres conscious behavior in the mind and unconscious behavior conscious events and unconscious eventsOne of the purposes of meditation is to get the mind more still so that things that used to be subconscious can become consciousIts like bringing them up into the light of dayOr you can compare it to tuning in to a radio stationThe more precisely youre on the frequency the less static there isThe less static the more clearly you can hear the signalYou pick up a lot of the subtleties you couldnt hear before because the static was obscuring themYou get the mind still so that you can begin to discern the suffering around the painYoull be working on two levelsOne is the physical pain itself and the other is the mental sufferingDoctors have shown that our perception of pain is really dependent on a lot of mental factorsThis is something youre going to see as you meditate  and its something that we can each know only for ourselvesDoctors can run tests and not find any physical basis for the pain in the body but the person really is experiencing painThey can look at the pain center in the brain to see whether its activated or not but they cant tell you how your pain feelsSo just the physical pain itself has a lot of mental factors and the most important one is the factor of perception  the way we label thingsSometimes the word sañña is also translated as memory which is not really accurateMemory plays a role in perception  we apply our old perceptions of pain to our new experience of pain  but memory deals with the pastHere were trying to focus on the present and yet we use our memories from the past to cover up the present to shape our experience of the presentSay when theres a pain in your leg a pain in your waist a pain in the back what perceptions does the mind apply to itIf you cant see the process in action you can try consciously applying different perceptionsAs you work in concentration you should be getting some practice in this  because after all each of the stages of concentration all the way up to the dimension of nothingness is called a perception attainmentFor example when youre working with the breath the label of breath should be your primary perceptionThe label you apply to your experience of the body is breath Not only the inandout breath Try to experience all the different parts of your body as types of breath energyIf your arm really were breath energy would it be good breath energy or blocked breath energyJust try applying that label very consistently to the sensation of the arm and after a while your experience of the arm is going to changeTry applying it to all the different parts of your bodySee how that changes the way you experience those partsYoull see that the actual physical experience of the body is going to change because of the mental labelAnd the advantage of this is that you can start doing different things with the sensationsIf you perceive a particular sensation as something solid theres not much you can do with itIf you perceive it as blocked energy there are ways to unblock energyYou can figure out how to redirect it how to loosen up the blockageIn other words the perception is useful because you can do things with itIf you stick with that perception of the breath trying to keep it as constant as possible you learn two thingsOne is that you get more and more sensitive as to what youre doing in order to maintain the perceptionYou start seeing the process of perception a lot more clearlyTwo you get the breath to calm down so that its really really stillOnce the breath energy throughout the body seems to flow nicely itll get more and more subtleIf you stick with your one perception you find that the brain uses a lot less oxygenAnd so you need to breathe less until you finally get to the point where the oxygen coming in and out of your pores is all you needThe inandout breath grows stillWhen the breath gets still your sense of the shape of the body begins to changeThe sense of boundary between inside and outside the body begins to dissolve awayYouve just got a mist of sensations and you can change your perception right thereInstead of focusing on the mist you can focus on the space between those little bits of sensation and all of a sudden youre with spaceIf you can hold onto that perception of space long enough its going to change your experience of the present moment your sense of what its like to have a physical body hereThe potential for being a physical body is there but you choose not to stir up that potentialJust stay with the spaceJust this much teaches you a lot about perceptionOr before you go to space you might focus on the different properties in the body  the warmth the coolness the sense of heavinessPerceive the body as all fire or as all water or as all solid Just that perception will change the way you experience the body physicallyThen perceive all these various properties as balanced not too cold not too hot not too heavy not too lightEverything all mixed together just rightThis will also teach you a lot about perceptionYou begin to see the labels youre using a lot more clearlyAs you get more and more familiar with your conscious perceptions you begin to detect the less conscious ones as wellAnd youre ready to start taking pain apartOne of the first things you notice when you look at a pain is the sense that it seems to be a solid mass in the bodyIs it reallyOr is it the result of your perceptionTry changing your perception to see what happensAgain think of the pain as just tiny dots of sensation that can move around that have space between themThe breath can flow through the painThe blood can flow easily through the painTry to distinguish which of those sensations are just body sensations and which are the pain sensations and you begin to realize that all the things you used to glom together are actually lots of different kinds of sensationOnly the way you perceived them was what made them so threateningYou may have picked up that old way of perceiving because you thought that putting a boundary around the pain was a good way of dealing with itPutting a boundary around the pain you thought might keep it from spreadingBut when you really look at the process of putting up and maintaining that boundary you begin to see that often its an unskillful way of dealing with the painSo you can replace that perception with more skillful onesThen you can look at the other perceptions and thoughtfabrications that gather around the pain  the stories the mind tells itself about how long youve had this pain or how much youve suffered in life and poor you all this suffering all this painYou begin to ask yourself Do you really have to believe those storiesCan you stop making the stories for a little while See what happensPain is an excellent place to start seeing all the different processes in the mind because you begin to see that its not only a physical painTheres a lot of mental activity around the pain that can cause the really important pain the really important suffering in other words the mental burden you build up around the painIf you look carefully you can see these different stories these different perceptions simply as events in the mind and you can just drop the habit of listening to them and believing themSee what happensWhat youre doing is not totally dropping the habit of perceptionYoure applying new perceptions because you find them more skillfulThis is the Buddhas approach to all of the aggregatesYoure not trying to do away with form feeling perception thought constructs and consciousness  at least not right awayThe first thing youve got to do is learn how to convert them into the pathThey use the word aggregates heaps for the word khandha You might think of them as big heaps of gravelAnd you have the choice You can put the gravel in a bag and carry it around on your shoulder weighing yourself down or you can figure out a way of turning it into an asphalt covering for your roadPut it down on the ground mix it with a binding agent  and then you have a smooth road to walk onThe binding agent here is mindfulness and alertness learning to be very mindful and alert about how you use these different aggregatesAfter all the aggregates themselves arent really thingsTheyre activitiesTheyre events in the mindYou begin to see that even your experience of form itself is affected by perceptionAnd you begin to approach all these things by being mindful and alertMindful means keeping what you want to do in mind keeping in mind your desire to put an end to stressAlert means seeing if youre really doing it and at the same time seeing the results of what youre doingBoth of these qualities require perceptionsAnd then theres ardencyBeing ardent means that if you see yourself causing stress you try your best to figure out other ways of actingThese three qualities  mindfulness alertness and ardency  are the binding agents that turn these events these aggregates into the pathAnd they require perceptions concepts in order to do their workSo were not condemning the conceptual mind were not condemning the mind that perceives things and puts labels on themWere learning to look at the process of perception and figure out how to do it more skillfullyUltimately you do get to an experience that goes beyond the aggregates but the only way to get there is to develop this path  turning the aggregates from a burden on your shoulder to a smooth road under your feetSo if you want to understand perception the first thing youve got to do is learn how to do it consciouslyThe more consciously you stick with a particular perception  such as breath or space  the more you can understand how the mind fashions perceptionsYou begin to detect where to look to see the less conscious perceptions the ones causing stress and painYou see them in action and you can drop them replacing them with other perceptions that are more skillful  until finally you get to the point where you dont need them at allThose chants are often juxtaposed just before we meditate The world is swept away This body is filled with all sorts of unclean things And then May I be happy The purpose of this juxtaposition is to make you stop and think Given this sweptaway world this unclean decaying body where does true happiness lieWhere does a safe and secure happiness lieThis is the big question we have to ask ourselves because everybody wants happinessAs the Buddha said all things all phenomena that you can experience are rooted in desireAnd what is the desireIts the desire for happinessThe body events in the mind They all come from our desire for happinessAnd we act on that desire sometimes in skillful and sometimes in unskillful waysThats why the situation were living in is such a mixed bag in terms of being satisfactory or notYou have to look carefully at your actions to see which ones really are conducive to happiness and which ones are notYou cant rest secure in the notion that theres somebody out there taking care of everything and its all going to turn out all right in the endWe are the ones who are shaping our experience and if were not careful were going to shape things in an unskillful wayThe Buddha saw that all of our activities are aimed at happinessAnd what was especially interesting is that he saw how much of what we experience is an activityEven our sense of self of who we are is an activityIts a fabricationWe fabricate the decision to identify with certain thingsThe thought that I am the thought of identification is an act of putting things togetherIts a fabrication an activity aimed at happinessAnd to some extent it worksPeople who have a very poorly formed sense of self have trouble managing their livesA certain level of identification is needed a certain sense of self is needed just to function properlyAnd so in learning to be more skillful the Buddha has us take that sense of self and try to make it more coherent so that it can promote your desire for true happiness a happiness that lastsThen you ask yourself What am I doing thats actually leading in that directionWhat am I doing thats leading in the other direction This involves maintaining a sense of what in Pali is called hiri and ottappa shame and fear of evilIn other words shame at the idea of doing something you know would be harmful and fear of the consequences of doing harmful thingsThis type of fear the Buddha said is a useful kind of fearIts what keeps us on the pathAnd it requires a certain sense of self a certain sense of selfesteem and the opposite of apathy  realizing that what you do is important for its going to have consequences down the line and you dont want to suffer the consequences of unskillfulnessThis is what keeps you on the path the sense that there are dangers out there and that the dangers lie in your unskillful actionsBut this training also implies trust trust that you can do things in the proper way trust in the principle that your actions really do matter and trust that the quest for happiness is a good quest if you do it properlyIf you take your quest for happiness seriously the Buddha says you actually end up developing qualities that are the opposite of selfishness compassion wisdom and purityFirst compassion You realize that if your happiness depends on the suffering of other people its not going to lastOther people want happiness too and theyre not going to sit around and allow you to maintain any happiness that oppresses themTheyre going to destroy itSo if youre really sincere about happiness you also want to include their happiness in the equationYou develop the quality of compassion taking the happiness of other people into accountAs for wisdom the Buddha said that the sign of a wise person is realizing that sometimes the things you like to do are going to cause suffering and the things you dont like to do are going to cause happinessIts a measure of your wisdom to realize that and to act accordinglyIn other words you have to appreciate the principle of causality for its going to affect your happinessThat way you get wiser and wiser about causes and effectsIf youre wise youll look for a happiness thats secure and longterm rather than just simply what you can grab at any momentAnd as for purity as the Buddha told his son Rahula really paying careful attention to your actions and their results and resolving not to repeat mistakes that cause suffering for yourself or for other people Thats how people attain puritySo compassion wisdom and purity  the qualities we associate with the Buddha  come from taking our quest for happiness seriouslyGood things come from this sense of self that wants to find a longterm happinessUltimately though as we all know the Buddha also teaches notself  in other words showing us that the things we tend to identify with can get in the way of a higher level of happinessBut always keep in mind that even here the quest for happiness lies in the backgroundIts the overriding issueYou first have to become skillful in the way you manage your happiness realizing that being generous being virtuous training the mind are things you have to do that youre responsible for your happiness and have to develop these qualities that are harmless both to yourself and to othersOnce youve got that principle firmly in mind then you can start turning to the teaching on notselfYou see that the various things you identify with leave you open to all kinds of dangersIf you identify with things that are impermanent things that can be changed by causal conditions beyond your control youre putting yourself in a weak position an exposed dangerous positionAnd this is where the teaching on notself comes inAjaan Maha Boowa compares this teaching to a stick that you use hit the hand of a monkey thats always grabbing at thingsIts a warning to yourself that if you reach into fire its going to burn you so you have to slap your hand away from the fireMany people resist the teaching on notself and all the teachings that are preparatory for that like the chant we had just now on the bodyThey feel that these teachings are going to deprive them of the strategies they use to find happinessBut these teachings are meant to protect you from sufferingTheyre there to remind you that if you latch onto the body as yours in a really strong sense youre going to sufferIf you can see it as a tool that you use toward happiness thats a different issueBut so many of us dont see it in that wayThe body is usIts oursBut what happens to the bodyIt gets old and it can get sick in all sorts of horrible ways even before you get oldAnd its not the case that these things happen only to people who dont take care of their bodiesThey happen to everybody and can happen at any timeIf you identify with the body youre leaving yourself exposed to all sorts of problems to all sorts of dangersThe same holds true for feelings perceptions thought constructs and consciousnessBut the Buddha doesnt have you just drop and abandon these things  he has you turn them into the pathIn other words you take these things you identify with and you turn them into toolsOnce theyre tools its possible to get a sense of distance from them and yet still get some use out of them as wellIn this way the strategy of notself instead of depriving you of your strategies for happiness actually provides you with a wider range of strategiesAs were meditating here what are we focusing onWere focusing on the body focusing on the breathWere learning to maximize the feelings of pleasure that come from the breathWere learning ways of perceiving the breath energy in the body that create stronger and stronger states of concentrationWere learning to direct our thoughts and evaluate the breath  thats fabrication  and to be consciously aware of all thisSo youve got all five aggregates here turned into a pathThere will be a sense of identification with the path but its different from just plain old straight identifying with these thingsTheres a more skillful use of them so that they lead to a greater and greater sense of wellbeing and securityAs you get more identified with the path in this way the other things outside that you used to identify as you and yours  that if they changed were going to cause big trouble in your life You can pull away from those attitudes because you have a better place to beYou try to focus all of your desires around maintaining this sense of peace and wellbeing in the mindAt some point when that peace and wellbeing is really secure you can undercut those desires as well seeing that even here in this state of concentration theres still inconstancy theres still stressIn seeing that you can let go entirelyYouve seen that its possible for there to be a dimension where theres no sense of I am no sense of identification and yet its not annihilationIn fact it is just the oppositeThe only thing that gets annihilated there are stress and sufferingThats what were aiming for as we learn to take our desire for happiness seriously and to follow it through in a consistent wayThen as Ajaan Suwat once said when you reach the ultimate happiness who cares if theres a self or not a self or whether you can find someone whos experiencing this or whatIt doesnt matter for what is there is the ultimate happinessEven though the Buddha talks a lot about suffering and stress the unattractiveness of the body the lack of control you have over things its not for a negative or pessimistic purposeIts to focus your desire for happiness in another directionIn effect he says Look you cant find true happiness in these placesYouve got to look someplace else This is the theme underlying all of his teachings that true happiness really does matterIts importantIts worth giving yourself over toThe desire for true happiness is worth taking seriously because it actually leads to true happiness if you follow through with it skillfullySo although sometimes we may resist his teachings  because they seem to threaten our ideas about what we need to do and to believe in order to be happy  its good to step back and question our assumptionsThere are many many people who have followed the Buddhas way and found that yes it does lead to a true happiness  and that the happiness you get from following other paths doesnt nearly compareWhen you see fear in your practice remember There is skillful fear and unskillful fearSkillful fear focuses on the harm and suffering that comes from doing unskillful thingsUnskillful fear comes from holding onto things that you know are going to changeOnce you understand this you can work on refining your sense of self and ultimately learn to adopt the teaching on notself as wellWhen you learn how to use these teachings skillfully  at their appropriate times in the appropriate places  and you find they really are conducive to happiness then you see that theres nothing to criticize in the Buddhas teachingsTheyre there to help us find the happiness we wantHes not forcing them on anybodyTheres no power play involved here at allHe offers his teachings out of compassionHes found that these practices work for him and they work for other people as wellIts simply a question of whether we understand them properly and learn how to use them skillfullyWhen we do there are no more issuesTheres a passage in the Dhammapada where the Buddha says that life as a householder is difficult life as a monk gone forth is difficultThen he ends by saying So be neither Of course what he means by that is to find a way of not having to be anything at allThat requires practiceIts a skill  the skill were working on right here the skill that takes you out of having to live the household life or have to live the life of a monkWithout this skill those are the only choices you haveDerived from them are lots of other little choices but theyre all trapped inside those two categoriesWhat were looking for is a path of practice that leads to freedom from any kind of category at allAs the Buddha said what you are is limited measured by what you cling toSo the path beyond categories has to be a path that gets rid of clingingWhen you hold onto the body thats what you areWhen you hold onto any of the other aggregates youre classified as a feelingclinger a perceptionclinger a mentalfabrication or consciousnessclingerYou create your identity by what you cling toThis is why the Buddha never answered questions about what a human being is because a human being can be almost anythingSo this noble eightfold path that were following here is a path that gets us out of having to be identified with anything of having to be limited to anythingThats the skill were working onIts not an easy skill but when you realize that all of the alternatives out there are difficult then you realize that it doesnt make much sense to focus on the difficulties of the path for at the very least this is a path that leads to a way outThree years ago when I sensed that Ajaan Suwat was about to pass away I went to see him in ThailandIt was inspiring and heartening to see him because even though he went through a lot of difficulties after his accident  paralyzed from the base of the spine on down brain damage lung damage having to deal with very difficult people looking after him  he always maintained his good cheerOne of the last things he said to me was that he had begun to notice that the perceptions his brain was sending to him were getting weirder and weirder all the timeHe had to learn how not to listen to themThen he said But that thing I got from the meditation That hasnt changedThats always thereThat thing is what he called itThats the freedom were working toward so that no matter what happens in terms of aging illness and death there is always that thing thereThats what we want to ferret outThats what we want to knowSo we foster the customs of the noble ones which focus on taking delight in this path this path of letting go and developingYou let go of the patterns of thought speech and action that get in the way of clear knowingYou develop the qualities that encourage clear knowing Right View Right Effort Right Mindfulness Right ConcentrationYou learn to take enjoyment in these thingsYou let them capture your imaginationTheyve done studies of people who are expert in fields involving skill and dexterity and theyve discovered that what sets the experts apart from people who are just good at those skills is that the skill captures their imaginationsOne they like doing it two they like rising to the challengeIf they make mistakes they try to learn from themOne article tells of the admissions office in a very famous school of surgeryFor years they were working on the questions asked at the applicant interviews to try to figure out which questions would ferret out the people who didnt have the potential to be surgeons as opposed to those who didBecause it was one of the best schools in the country all the applicants had great grades great recommendations but that was no guarantee that theyd actually do well when faced with a patient on the tableThe admissions people discovered a pair of questions that were most accurate in figuring out who to admit and who not to admitThe first was Can you tell us about a mistake you made recently If the applicant said No I cant think of any mistakes I made recently he or she would be rejectedThe second question was What would you do differently if you had the chance to do it again If the person was able to jump right in and say I thought that next time around I might try this that was the sort of person they wanted  someone who would look at his or her actions recognize a mistake and then immediately want to figure out how to not make that mistake again someone who exercised ingenuity in trying to figure out another approachAll across the board the ones who excel at their skills  whether as musicians sportsmen or craftsmen  are the ones who find that the skill captures their imaginationThats why the effort put into the skill is no big deal for themThey get so absorbed that the effort becomes enjoyableThey like thinking about it they like figuring out the problems they face and sometimes detecting problems that other people might not even noticeThen they try working out solutionsThese are the kind of people who do wellThe same principle applies in the customs of the noble onesYou delight in letting go you delight in developingWorking on the qualities of your mind really captures your imaginationThat way the difficulties of living in a community with other people who are also practicing arent big issuesYouve got the rules youve got the structure youve got the support to do the practiceIts not so much that youre here to learn about Buddhism youre learning to use the tools that Buddhism offers to sort out your own mindFirst the tools help you look at the habits the things the mind is doingThen when you notice that what youre doing is causing suffering to yourself or other people you have the tools to change those habitsIf the classic tools dont work you can use your own ingenuity to extrapolate on themWhen you find that that captures your imagination then the difficulties dont really impress themselves on your mindThe whole purpose of this practice is to focus on whats actually happening in your mindThe big questions are What are you doing thats causing unnecessary suffering for yourself or for other peopleWhat can you do to stop doing that These questions apply not only to things you do and say but also the way your mind operates the way the mind treats itself the way it deals with its own thoughts and feelingsYou want these questions to take chargeThis requires a shift in your center of gravity because for a lot of us we have a strong sense of who we are with our activities as something secondary something in service of the who that we areIf we take our sense of our self of who we are as the absolute then the question of what were doing becomes relativeThen the preferences of that self take over and the path becomes hardBut if you switch things around so that the question of becoming more skillful in your actions becomes your absolute while your sense of who you are becomes relative to that question then the path becomes a lot easierIts a lot more enjoyableIt makes senseThis is why the Buddha focused his four noble truths on precisely this question because thats what the four truths are an issue of skillful action desirable result unskillful action undesirable resultTheyre a way of sorting those issues outAs for the other questions  concerning the world the oneness or plurality of the universe the existence of a self the nature of the life force the fate of an awakened person after death Those questions get set asideThose are not the issuesThe issues are what is skillful what is notWhen those questions become the center of your concern when they capture your imagination then issues of world and self fall to the waysideThis gives you a beginning sense of what its like to be freed from the question of who you are what kind of person you are because you realize that those issues are all determined by the skill with which you act particularly the skill with which you approach your clingings your attachmentsThose are the determining issuesWhen you learn how to practice developing concentration and discernment to see through those clingings then the whole need to identify yourself limit yourself measure yourselfgoes by the waysideAs you follow the path the sufferings caused by the need to define yourself grow lighter and lighterEven more so when all the clinging is gone Thats it  no need to be defined by anything at allTheres a passage where a monk has been asked by some people from outside of the Buddhas teachings about how the Buddha answers the question of whether the awakened person exists or not after deathThe monk extemporizing answers that there has to be an answer beside the four that are usually given existing not existing both neitherHis questioners all make fun of himYou dont know anything about the Buddhas teaching they sneerEven people outside the teaching knew thatSo the monk goes to see the BuddhaThe Buddha says How can you say anything like thatCan you identify where the Tathagata is right nowCan you define him in terms of any of the five aggregates Well noAs something separate from the five aggregates NoTheres nothing that you could point to even here in the present moment  unlike your ordinary person who can be identified with his clingingsThe Buddha went on to say When you cant even identify the Tathagata here and now how can you say anything about what he is after death or how he exists or what his mode of being is after deathTotal freedomIndescribable and undefinedThats what this practice is all aboutIf the idea of total freedom captures your imagination then the difficulties get smaller and smallerEven though they may be large in your mind right now they start looming smaller and smaller as you stick with the pathThe Buddha once said that if you could make a deal that every day for years youd be speared with spears in the morning spears at noon spears in the evening  spearwounds every day  but with a guarantee that in years youd gain full Awakening that would be a deal worth takingWhen the Awakening came you wouldnt consider that it had been gained with difficulty
