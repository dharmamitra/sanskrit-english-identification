These two qualities have a share in clear knowing
Which two
Tranquillity  insight
When tranquillity is developed what purpose does it serve
The mind is developed
And when the mind is developed what purpose does it serve
Passion is abandoned
When insight is developed what purpose does it serve
Discernment is developed
And when discernment is developed what purpose does it serve
Ignorance is abandoned
Suppose that there were a royal frontier fortress with strong ramparts strong walls  arches and six gates
In it would be a wise competent knowledgeable gatekeeper to keep out those he didn't know and to let in those he did
A swift pair of messengers coming from the east would say to the gatekeeper 'Where my good man is the commander of this fortress' He would say 'There he is sirs sitting in the central square' The swift pair of messengers delivering their accurate report to the commander of the fortress would then go back by the route by which they had come
Then a swift pair of messengers coming from the west the north the south would say to the gatekeeper 'Where my good man is the commander of this fortress' He would say 'There he is sirs sitting in the central square' The swift pair of messengers delivering their accurate report to the commander of the fortress would then go back by the route by which they had come
I have given you this simile to convey a message
The message is this The fortress stands for this body  composed of four elements born of mother  father nourished with rice  barley gruel subject to constant rubbing  abrasion to breaking  falling apart
The six gates stand for the six internal sense media
The gatekeeper stands for mindfulness
The swift pair of messengers stands for tranquillity and insight
The commander of the fortress stands for consciousness
The central square stands for the four great elements the earthproperty the liquidproperty the fireproperty  the windproperty
The accurate report stands for Unbinding
The route by which they had come stands for the noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
On one occasion Ven
Ananda was staying in Kosambi at Ghosita's monastery
There he addressed the monks Friends
Yes friend the monks responded
Ven
Ananda said Friends whoever  monk or nun  declares the attainment of arahantship in my presence they all do it by means of one or another of four paths
Which four
There is the case where a monk has developed insight preceded by tranquillity
As he develops insight preceded by tranquillity the path is born
He follows that path develops it pursues it
As he follows the path developing it  pursuing it  his fetters are abandoned his obsessions destroyed
Then there is the case where a monk has developed tranquillity preceded by insight
As he develops tranquillity preceded by insight the path is born
He follows that path develops it pursues it
As he follows the path developing it  pursuing it  his fetters are abandoned his obsessions destroyed
Then there is the case where a monk has developed tranquillity in tandem with insight
As he develops tranquillity in tandem with insight the path is born
He follows that path develops it pursues it
As he follows the path developing it  pursuing it  his fetters are abandoned his obsessions destroyed
Then there is the case where a monk's mind has its restlessness concerning the Dhamma well under control
There comes a time when his mind grows steady inwardly settles down and becomes unified  concentrated
In him the path is born
He follows that path develops it pursues it
As he follows the path developing it  pursuing it  his fetters are abandoned his obsessions destroyed
Whoever  monk or nun  declares the attainment of arahantship in my presence they all do it by means of one or another of these four paths
Monks these four types of individuals are to be found existing in the world
Which four
There is the case of the individual who has attained internal tranquillity of awareness but not insight into phenomena through heightened discernment
Then there is the case of the individual who has attained insight into phenomena through heightened discernment but not internal tranquillity of awareness
Then there is the case of the individual who has attained neither internal tranquillity of awareness nor insight into phenomena through heightened discernment
And then there is the case of the individual who has attained both internal tranquillity of awareness  insight into phenomena through heightened discernment
The individual who has attained internal tranquillity of awareness but not insight into phenomena through heightened discernment should approach an individual who has attained insight into phenomena through heightened discernment and ask him 'How should fabrications be regarded
How should they be investigated
How should they be seen with insight' The other will answer in line with what he has seen  experienced 'Fabrications should be regarded in this way
Fabrications should be investigated in this way
Fabrications should be seen in this way with insight' Then eventually he will become one who has attained both internal tranquillity of awareness  insight into phenomena through heightened discernment
As for the individual who has attained insight into phenomena through heightened discernment but not internal tranquillity of awareness he should approach an individual who has attained internal tranquillity of awareness and ask him 'How should the mind be steadied
How should it be made to settle down
How should it be unified
How should it be concentrated' The other will answer in line with what he has seen  experienced 'The mind should be steadied in this way
The mind should be made to settle down in this way
The mind should be unified in this way
The mind should be concentrated in this way' Then eventually he will become one who has attained both internal tranquillity of awareness  insight into phenomena through heightened discernment
As for the individual who has attained neither internal tranquillity of awareness nor insight into phenomena through heightened discernment he should approach an individual who has attained both internal tranquillity of awareness  insight into phenomena through heightened discernmentand ask him 'How should the mind be steadied
How should it be made to settle down
How should it be unified
How should it be concentrated
How should fabrications be regarded
How should they be investigated
How should they be seen with insight' The other will answer in line with what he has seen  experienced 'The mind should be steadied in this way
The mind should be made to settle down in this way
The mind should be unified in this way
The mind should be concentrated in this way
Fabrications should be regarded in this way
Fabrications should be investigated in this way
Fabrications should be seen in this way with insight' Then eventually he will become one who has attained both internal tranquillity of awareness  insight into phenomena through heightened discernment
As for the individual who has attained both internal tranquillity of awareness  insight into phenomena through heightened discernment his duty is to make an effort in establishing those very same skillful qualities to a higher degree for the ending of the fermentations
These are four types of individuals to be found existing in the world
Not knowing not seeing the body as it actually is present not knowing not seeing tactile sensations consciousness at the body contact at the body as they actually are present not knowing not seeing whatever arises conditioned through contact at the body  experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain  as it actually is present one is infatuated with the body ideas consciousness at the body contact at the body whatever arises conditioned by contact at the body and is experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain
For him  infatuated attached confused not remaining focused on their drawbacks  the five clingingaggregates head toward future accumulation
The craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion  delight relishing now this  now that  grows within him
His bodily disturbances  mental disturbances grow
His bodily torments  mental torments grow
His bodily distresses  mental distresses grow
He is sensitive both to bodily stress  mental stress
However knowing  seeing the body as it actually is present knowing  seeing tactile sensations consciousness at the body contact at the body as they actually are present knowing  seeing whatever arises conditioned through contact at the body  experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain  as it actually is present one is not infatuated with the body tactile sensations consciousness at the body contact at the body whatever arises conditioned by contact at the body and is experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain
For him  uninfatuated unattached unconfused remaining focused on their drawbacks  the five clingingaggregates head toward future diminution
The craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion  delight relishing now this  now that  is abandoned by him
His bodily disturbances  mental disturbances are abandoned
His bodily torments  mental torments are abandoned
His bodily distresses  mental distresses are abandoned
He is sensitive both to ease of body  ease of awareness
Any view belonging to one who has come to be like this is his right view
Any resolve his right resolve
Any effort his right effort
Any mindfulness his right mindfulness
Any concentration his right concentration just as earlier his actions speech  livelihood were already wellpurified
Thus for him having thus developed the noble eightfold path the four frames of reference go to the culmination of their development
The four right exertions the four bases of power the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors for awakening go to the culmination of their development
for him these two qualities occur in tandem tranquillity  insight
He comprehends through direct knowledge whatever qualities are to be comprehended through direct knowledge abandons through direct knowledge whatever qualities are to be abandoned through direct knowledge develops through direct knowledge whatever qualities are to be developed through direct knowledge and realizes through direct knowledge whatever qualities are to be realized through direct knowledge
And what qualities are to be comprehended through direct knowledge
'The five clingingaggregates' should be the reply
Which five
Form as a clingingaggregate feeling perception fabrications consciousness as a clingingaggregate
These are the qualities that are to be comprehended through direct knowledge
And what qualities are to be abandoned through direct knowledge
Ignorance  craving for becoming these are the qualities that are to be abandoned through direct knowledge
And what qualities are to be developed through direct knowledge
tranquillity  insight these are the qualities that are to be developed through direct knowledge
And what qualities are to be realized through direct knowledge
Clear knowing  release these are the qualities that are to be realized through direct knowledge
If a monk would wish 'May I attain  whenever I want without strain without difficulty  the four jhanas that are heightened mental states pleasant abidings in the herenow' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness who does not neglect jhana who is endowed with insight and who frequents empty dwellings
Visakha Now what is concentration what qualities are its themes what qualities are its requisites and what is its development
Sister Dhammadinna Singleness of mind is concentration the four frames of reference are its themes the four right exertions are its requisites and any cultivation development  pursuit of these qualities is its development
May the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma in brief
May the One Wellgone teach me the Dhamma in brief
It may well be that I will understand the Blessed One's words
It may well be that I will become an heir to the Blessed One's words
Then monk you should train yourself thus 'My mind will be established inwardly wellcomposed
No evil unskillful qualities once they have arisen will remain consuming the mind' That's how you should train yourself
Then you should train yourself thus 'Goodwill as my awarenessrelease will be developed pursued given a means of transport given a grounding steadied consolidated  wellundertaken' That's how you should train yourself
When you have developed this concentration in this way you should develop this concentration with directed thought  evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  a modicum of evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  no evaluation you should develop it accompanied by rapture not accompanied by rapture endowed with a sense of enjoyment you should develop it endowed with equanimity
When this concentration is thus developed thus welldeveloped by you you should then train yourself thus 'Compassion as my awarenessrelease Appreciation as my awarenessrelease Equanimity as my awarenessrelease will be developed pursued given a means of transport given a grounding steadied consolidated  wellundertaken' That's how you should train yourself
When you have developed this concentration in this way you should develop this concentration with directed thought  evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  a modicum of evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  no evaluation you should develop it accompanied by rapture not accompanied by rapture endowed with a sense of enjoyment you should develop it endowed with equanimity
When this concentration is thus developed thus welldeveloped by you you should then train yourself thus 'I will remain focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world' That's how you should train yourself
When you have developed this concentration in this way you should develop this concentration with directed thought  evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  a modicum of evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  no evaluation you should develop it accompanied by rapture not accompanied by rapture endowed with a sense of enjoyment you should develop it endowed with equanimity
When this concentration is thus developed thus welldeveloped by you you should train yourself 'I will remain focused on feelings in  of themselves the mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world' That's how you should train yourself
When you have developed this concentration in this way you should develop this concentration with directed thought  evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  a modicum of evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  no evaluation you should develop it accompanied by rapture not accompanied by rapture endowed with a sense of enjoyment you should develop it endowed with equanimity
When this concentration is thus developed thus welldeveloped by you then wherever you go you will go in comfort
Wherever you stand you will stand in comfort
Wherever you sit you will sit in comfort
Wherever you lie down you will lie down in comfort
Then that monk having been admonished by the admonishment from the Blessed One got up from his seat and bowed down to the Blessed One circled around him keeping the Blessed One to his right side and left
Then dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now
He knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus he became another one of the arahants
Having abandoned the five hindrances  imperfections of awareness that weaken discernment  the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelingsmindmental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
Just as if an elephant trainer were to plant a large post in the ground and were to bind a forest elephant to it by the neck in order to break it of its forest habits its forest memories  resolves its distraction fatigue  fever over leaving the forest to make it delight in the town and to inculcate in it habits congenial to human beings in the same way these four frames of reference are bindings for the awareness of the disciple of the noble ones to break him of his household habits his household memories  resolves his distraction fatigue  fever over leaving the household life for the attainment of the right method and the realization of Unbinding
Then the Tathagata trains him further 'Come monk remain focused on the body in  of itself but do not think any thoughts connected with the body
Remain focused on feelings in  of themselves but do not think any thoughts connected with feelings
Remain focused on the mind in  of itself but do not think any thoughts connected with mind
Remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves but do not think any thoughts connected with mental qualities' With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters the second jhana
Monks those who are new not long goneforth only recently come to this doctrine  discipline should be roused encouraged  exhorted by you to develop the four frames of reference
'Come friends remain focused on the body in  of itself  being ardent alert with your minds unified clear concentrated  singleminded for knowledge of the body as it actually is
Remain focused on feelings in  of themselvesfocused on the mind in  of itselffocused on mental qualities in  of themselves  being ardent alert onepointed with your minds unified clear concentrated  singleminded for knowledge of mental qualities as they actually are'
Monks even those who are learners  who have yet to attain their hearts' desire who stay resolved on the unsurpassed security from bondage  even they remain focused on the body in  of itself  being ardent alert onepointed with their minds unified clear concentrated  singleminded for complete comprehension of the body
They remain focused on feelings in  of themselvesfocused on the mind in  of itselffocused on mental qualities in  of themselves  being ardent alert onepointed with their minds unified clear concentrated  singleminded for complete comprehension of mental qualities
Even those who are arahants  whose mental effluents are ended who have reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and who are released through right gnosis  even they remain focused on the body in  of itself  being ardent alert onepointed with their minds unified clear concentrated  singleminded disjoined from the body
They remain focused on feelings in  of themselvesfocused on the mind in  of itselffocused on mental qualities in  of themselves  being ardent alert onepointed with their minds unified clear concentrated  singleminded disjoined from mental qualities
So even those who are new not long goneforth only recently come to this doctrine  discipline should be roused encouraged  exhorted by you to develop the four frames of reference
Suppose that there is a foolish inexperienced unskillful cook who has presented a king or a king's minister with various kinds of curry mainly sour mainly bitter mainly peppery mainly sweet alkaline or nonalkaline salty or nonsalty
He does not take note of his master thinking 'Today my master likes this curry or he reaches out for that curry or he takes a lot of this curry or he praises that curry' As a result he is not rewarded with clothing or wages or gifts
Why is that
Because the foolish inexperienced unskillful cook does not pick up on the theme of his own master
In the same way there are cases where a foolish inexperienced unskillful monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
As he remains thus focused on the body in  of itself his mind does not become concentrated his defilements are not abandoned
He does not take note of that fact
He remains focused on feelings in  of themselvesthe mind in  of itselfmental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
As he remains thus focused on mental qualities in  of themselves his mind does not become concentrated his defilements are not abandoned
He does not take note of that fact
As a result he is not rewarded with a pleasant abiding here  now nor with mindfulness  alertness
Why is that
Because the foolish inexperienced unskillful monk does not take note of his own mind
Now suppose that there is a wise experienced skillful cook who has presented a king or a king's minister with various kinds of curry He takes note of his master thinking 'Today my master likes this curry or he reaches out for that curry or he takes a lot of this curry or he praises that curry' As a result he is rewarded with clothing wages  gifts
Why is that
Because the wise experienced skillful cook picks up on the theme of his own master
In the same way there are cases where a wise experienced skillful monk remains focused on the body in  of itselffeelings in  of themselvesthe mind in  of itselfmental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
As he remains thus focused on mental qualities in  of themselves his mind becomes concentrated his defilements are abandoned
He takes note of that fact
As a result he is rewarded with a pleasant abiding here  now together with mindfulness  alertness
Why is that
Because the wise experienced skillful monk picks up on the theme of his own mind
Ananda if a monk or nun remains with mind well established in the four frames of reference heshe may be expected to realize greaterthanever distinction
There is the case of a monk who remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
As he remains thus focused on the body in  of itself a fever based on the body arises within his body or there is sluggishness in his awareness or his mind becomes scattered externally
He should then direct his mind to any inspiring theme
As his mind is directed to any inspiring theme delight arises within him
In one who feels delight rapture arises
In one whose mind is enraptured the body grows serene
His body serene he feels pleasure
As he feels pleasure his mind grows concentrated
He reflects 'I have attained the aim to which my mind was directed
Let me withdraw' He withdraws  engages neither in directed thought nor in evaluation
He discerns 'I am not thinking or evaluating
I am inwardly mindful  at ease'
Furthermore he remains focused on feelingsmindmental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
As he remains thus focused on mental qualities in  of themselves a fever based on mental qualities arises within his body or there is sluggishness in his awareness or his mind becomes scattered externally
He should then direct his mind to any inspiring theme
As his mind is directed to any inspiring theme delight arises within him
In one who feels delight rapture arises
In one whose mind is enraptured the body grows serene
His body serene he is sensitive to pleasure
As he feels pleasure his mind grows concentrated
He reflects 'I have attained the aim to which my mind was directed
Let me withdraw' He withdraws  engages neither in directed thought nor in evaluation
He discerns 'I am not thinking or evaluating
I am inwardly mindful  at ease'
This Ananda is development based on directing
And what is development based on not directing
A monk when not directing his mind to external things discerns 'My mind is not directed to external things
It is not attentive to what is in front or behind
It is released  undirected
And furthermore I remain focused on the body in  of itself
I am ardent alert mindful  at ease'
When not directing his mind to external things he discerns 'My mind is not directed to external things
It is not attentive to what is in front or behind
It is released  undirected
And furthermore I remain focused on feelings mindmental qualities in  of themselves
I am ardent alert mindful  at ease'
This Ananda is development based on not directing
Now Ananda I have taught you development based on directing and development based on not directing
What a teacher should do out of compassion for his disciples seeking their welfare that I have done for you
Over there are the foot of trees
Over there are empty dwellings
Practice jhana Ananda
Do not be heedless
Do not be remorseful in the future
That is our instruction to you all
If a monk would wish 'May I  with the ending of mental fermentations  remain in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known  realized them for myself right in the herenow' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness who does not neglect jhana who is endowed with insight and who frequents empty dwellings
Monks Sariputta is wise of great discernment deep discernment widejoyousrapidquickpenetrating discernment There is the case where Sariputtaenters  remains in the first jhana
Whatever qualities there are in the first jhana  applied thought evaluation rapture pleasure singleness of mind contact feeling perception intention consciousness desire decision persistence mindfulness equanimity  attention  he ferrets them out one by one
Known to him they arise known to him they remain known to him they subside
He discerns 'So this is how these qualities not having been come into play
Having been they vanish' He remains unattracted  unrepelled with regard to those qualities independent detached released dissociated with an awareness rid of barriers
He understands 'There is a further escape' and pursuing it he confirms that 'There is' 
Furthermore completely transcending the dimension of nothingness he enters  remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
He emerges mindful from that attainment
On emerginghe regards the past qualities that have ceased  changed 'So this is how these qualities not having been come into play
Having been they vanish' He remains unattracted  unrepelled with regard to those qualities independent detached released dissociated with an awareness rid of barriers
He understands 'There is a further escape' and pursuing it he confirms that 'There is'
Furthermore completely transcending the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception he enters  remains in the cessation of feeling  perception
When he sees with discernment his effluents are totally ended
He emerges mindful from that attainment
On emerginghe regards the past qualities that have ceased  changed 'So this is how these qualities not having been come into play
Having been they vanish' He remains unattracted  unrepelled with regard to those qualities independent detached released dissociated with an awareness rid of barriers
He understands 'There is no further escape' and pursuing it he confirms that 'There isn't'
If someone rightly describing a person were to say 'He has attained mastery  perfection in noble virtuenoble concentrationnoble discernmentnoble release' he would be rightly describing Sariputta Sariputta takes the unexcelled wheel of Dhamma set rolling by the Tathagata and keeps it rolling rightly
I tell you the ending of the effluents depends on the first jhanathe second jhanathe thirdthe fourththe dimension of the infinitude of spacethe dimension of the infinitude of consciousnessthe dimension of nothingnessthe dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
'I tell you the ending of the effluents depends on the first jhana' Thus it has been said
In reference to what was it said Suppose that an archer or archer's apprentice were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay so that after a while he would become able to shoot long distances to fire accurate shots in rapid succession and to pierce great masses
In the same way there is the case where a monkenters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born of withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perceptions fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration a void notself
He turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness 'This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding'
Staying right there he reaches the ending of the mental effluents
Or if not then  through this very dhammapassion this very dhammadelight and from the total wasting away of the first of the five Fetters  he is due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that world
'I tell you the ending of the effluents depends on the first jhana' Thus it was said and in reference to this was it said
Thus as far as the perceptionattainments go that is as far as gnosispenetration goes
As for these two dimensions  the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception  the attainment of the cessation of feeling  perception  I tell you that they are to be rightly explained by those monks who are meditators skilled in attaining skilled in attaining  emerging who have attained  emerged in dependence on them
Then Dasama the householder from the city of Atthaka went to where Ven
Ananda was staying and on arrival having bowed down sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Ananda Is there venerable sir any one condition explained by the Blessed Onewhereby a monk  dwelling heedful ardent  resolute  releases his mind that is as yet unreleased or whereby the effluents not yet brought to an end come to an end or whereby he attains the unsurpassed security from bondage that he has not yet attained
Ananda Yes householder there isThere is the case where a monkenters  remains in the first jhanaHe notices that 'This first jhana is fabricated  willed' He discerns 'Whatever is fabricated  willed is inconstant  subject to cessation' Staying right there he reaches the ending of the effluents
Or if not then  through passion  delight for this very phenomenon and from the total ending of the first five Fetters  he is due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that world
Sariputta This Unbinding is pleasant friends
This Unbinding is pleasant
Udayin But what is the pleasure here my friend where there is nothing felt
Sariputta Just that is the pleasure here my friend where there is nothing felt
There are these five strands of sensuality
Which five
Forms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing soundssmellstastestactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
Whatever pleasure or joy arises in dependence on these five strands of sensuality that is sensual pleasure
Now there is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhanaIf as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with sensuality that is an affliction for him
Just as pain arises as an affliction for a healthy person even so the attention to perceptions dealing with sensuality that beset the monk is an affliction for him
Now the Blessed One has said that whatever is an affliction is stress
So by this line of reasoning it may be known how Unbinding is pleasant
Furthermore there is the case where a monkenters  remains in the second jhanaIf as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with directed thought that is an affliction for him
Furthermore there is the case where a monkenters  remains in the third jhanaIf as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with rapture that is an affliction for him
Furthermore there is the case where a monkenters  remains in the fourth jhanaIf as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with equanimity that is an affliction for him
Furthermore there is the case where a monkenters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space
If as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with form that is an affliction for him
Furthermore there is the case where a monkenters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
If as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with the dimension of the infinitude of space that is an affliction for him
Furthermore there is the case where a monkenters  remains in the dimension of nothingness
If as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness that is an affliction for him
Furthermore there is the case where a monkenters  remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
If as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with the dimension of nothingness that is an affliction for himwhatever is an affliction is stress
So by this line of reasoning it may be known how Unbinding is pleasant
Furthermore there is the case where a monkenters  remains in the cessation of perception  feeling
And having seen with discernment his effluents are completely ended
So by this line of reasoning it may be known how Unbinding is pleasant
 there remains only equanimity pure  bright pliant malleable  luminous
Just as if a skilled goldsmith or goldsmith's apprentice were to prepare a furnace heat up a crucible and taking gold with a pair of tongs place it in the crucible
He would blow on it periodically sprinkle water on it periodically examine it periodically so that the gold would become refined wellrefined thoroughly refined flawless free from dross pliant malleable  luminous
Then whatever sort of ornament he had in mind  whether a belt an earring a necklace or a gold chain  it would serve his purpose
In the same way there remains only equanimity pure  bright pliant malleable  luminous
He discerns that 'If I were to direct equanimity as pure  bright as this toward the dimension of the infinitude of space I would develop the mind along those lines and thus this equanimity of mine  thus supported thus sustained  would last for a long time
'
He discerns that 'If I were to direct equanimity as pure  bright as this toward the dimension of the infinitude of space and to develop the mind along those lines that would be fabricated
' He neither fabricates nor wills for the sake of becoming or unbecoming
This being the case he is not sustained by anything in the world
Unsustained he is not agitated
Unagitated he is totally unbound right within
He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
The technique I'll be teaching is breath meditation
It's a good topic no matter what your religious background
As my teacher once said the breath doesn't belong to Buddhism or Christianity or anyone at all
It's common property that anyone can meditate on
At the same time of all the meditation topics there are it's probably the most beneficial to the body for when we're dealing with the breath we're dealing not only with the air coming in and out of the lungs but also with all the feelings of energy that course throughout the body with each breath
If you can learn to become sensitive to these feelings and let them flow smoothly and unobstructed you can help the body function more easily and give the mind a handle for dealing with pain
So let's all meditate for a few minutes
Sit comfortably erect in a balanced position
You don't have to be ramrod straight like a soldier
Just try not to lean forward or back to the left or the right
Close your eyes and say to yourself 'May I be truly happy and free from suffering' This may sound like a strange even selfish way to start meditating but there are good reasons for it
One if you can't wish for your own happiness there is no way that you can honestly wish for the happiness of others
Some people need to remind themselves constantly that they deserve happiness  we all deserve it but if we don't believe it we will constantly find ways to punish ourselves and we will end up punishing others in subtle or blatant ways as well
Two it's important to reflect on what true happiness is and where it can be found
A moment's reflection will show that you can't find it in the past or the future
The past is gone and your memory of it is undependable
The future is a blank uncertainty
So the only place we can really find happiness is in the present
But even here you have to know where to look
If you try to base your happiness on things that change  sights sounds sensations in general people and things outside  you're setting yourself up for disappointment like building your house on a cliff where there have been repeated landslides in the past
So true happiness has to be sought within
Meditation is thus like a treasure hunt to find what has solid and unchanging worth in the mind something that even death cannot touch
To find this treasure we need tools
The first tool is to do what we're doing right now to develop good will for ourselves
The second is to spread that good will to other living beings
Tell yourself 'All living beings no matter who they are no matter what they have done to you in the past  may they all find true happiness too' If you don't cultivate this thought and instead carry grudges into your meditation that's all you'll be able to see when you look inside
Only when you have cleared the mind in this way and set outside matters aside are you ready to focus on the breath
Bring your attention to the sensation of breathing
Breathe in long and out long for a couple of times focusing on any spot in the body where the breathing is easy to notice and your mind feels comfortable focusing
This could be at the nose at the chest at the abdomen or any spot at all
Stay with that spot noticing how it feels as you breathe in and out
Don't force the breath or bear down too heavily with your focus
Let the breath flow naturally and simply keep track of how it feels
Savor it as if it were an exquisite sensation you wanted to prolong
If your mind wanders off simply bring it back
Don't get discouraged
If it wanders times bring it back times
Show it that you mean business and eventually it will listen to you
If you want you can experiment with different kinds of breathing
If long breathing feels comfortable stick with it
If it doesn't change it to whatever rhythm feels soothing to the body
You can try short breathing fast breathing slow breathing deep breathing shallow breathing  whatever feels most comfortable to you right now
Once you have the breath comfortable at your chosen spot move your attention to notice how the breathing feels in other parts of the body
Start by focusing on the area just below your navel
Breathe in and out and notice how that area feels
If you don't feel any motion there just be aware of the fact that there's no motion
If you do feel motion notice the quality of the motion to see if the breathing feels uneven there or if there's any tension or tightness
If there's tension think of relaxing it
If the breathing feels jagged or uneven think of smoothing it out Now move your attention over to the right of that spot  to the lower righthand corner of the abdomen  and repeat the same process Then over to the lower lefthand corner of the abdomen Then up to the navel right left to the solar plexus right left the middle of the chest right left to the base of the throat right left to the middle of the head
If you were meditating at home you could continue this process through your entire body  over the head down the back out the arms  legs to the tips of your finger  toes  but since our time is limited I'll ask you to return your focus now to any one of the spots we've already covered
Let your attention settle comfortably there and then let your conscious awareness spread to fill the entire body from the head down to the toes so that you're like a spider sitting in the middle of a web It's sitting in one spot but it's sensitive to the entire web
Keep your awareness expanded like this  you have to work at this for its tendency will be to shrink to a single spot  and think of the breath coming in  out your entire body through every pore
Let your awareness simply stay right there for a while  there's no where else you have to go nothing else you have to think about And then gently come out of meditation
The daily schedule at Metta Forest Monastery includes a group interview in the late afternoon and a chanting session followed by a group meditation period later in the evening
The Dhamma talks included in this volume were given during the evening meditation sessions and in many cases covered issues raised at the interviews  either in the questions asked or lurking behind the questions
Often these issues touched on a variety of topics on a variety of different levels in the practice
This explains the range of topics covered in individual talks
I have edited the talks with an eye to making them readable while at the same time trying to preserve some of the flavor of the spoken word
In a few instances I have added passages or rearranged the material to make the treatment of specific topics more coherent and complete but for the most part I have kept the editing to a minimum
Don't expect polished essays
The people listening to these talks were familiar with the meditation instructions included in Method  in Keeping the Breath in Mind by Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo and my own essay A Guided Meditation If you are not familiar with these instructions you might want to read through them before reading the talks in this book
Further Dhamma talks are available on the Metta Forest Monastery website
I would like to thank Bok Lim Kim for making the recording of these talks possible
She more than anyone else is responsible for overcoming my initial reluctance to have the talks taped
I would also like to thank the following people for transcribing the tapes andor helping to edit the transcriptions Paul and Debra Breger Richard Heiman Jane Yudelman Dhammattho Bhikkhu Gunaddho Bhikkhu Susuddho Bhikkhu and Khematto Bhikkhu
May they all be happy
Whatever merit there may be to these talks comes from the training I received from my teachers Ajaan Fuang Jotiko and Ajaan Suwat Suvaco
This book is dedicated to their memory with utmost gratitude
Several years ago when Ajaan Suwat was teaching a retreat at IMS I was his interpreter
After the second or third day of the retreat he turned to me and said I notice that when these people meditate they're awfully grim You'd look out across the room and all the people were sitting there very seriously their faces tense their eyes closed tight
It was almost as if they had Nirvana or Bust written across their foreheads
He attributed their grimness to the fact that most people here in the West come to Buddhist meditation without any preparation in other Buddhist teachings
They haven't had any experience in being generous in line with the Buddha's teachings on giving
They haven't had any experience in developing virtue in line with the Buddhist precepts
They come to the Buddha's teachings without having tested them in daily life so they don't have the sense of confidence they need to get them through the hard parts of the meditation
They feel they have to rely on sheer determination instead
If you look at the way meditation virtue and generosity are taught here it's the exact opposite of the order in which they're taught in Asia
Here people sign up for a retreat to learn some meditation and only when they show up at the retreat center do they learn they're going to have to observe some precepts during the retreat
And then at the very end of the retreat they learn that before they'll be allowed to go home they're going to have to be generous
It's all backwards
Over in Thailand children's first exposure to Buddhism after they've learned the gesture of respect is in giving
You see parents taking their children by the hand as a monk comes past on his alms round lifting them up and helping them put a spoonful of rice into the monk's bowl
Over time as the children start doing it themselves the process becomes less and less mechanical and after a while they begin to take pleasure in giving
At first this pleasure may seem counterintuitive
The idea that you gain happiness by giving things away doesn't come automatically to a young child's mind
But with practice you find that it's true
After all when you give you put yourself in a position of wealth
The gift is proof that you have more than enough
At the same time it gives you a sense of your worth as a person
You're able to help other people
The act of giving also creates a sense of spaciousness in the mind because the world we live in is created by our actions and the act of giving creates a spacious world a world where generosity is an operating principle a world where people have more than enough enough to share
And it creates a good feeling in the mind
From there the children are exposed to virtue the practice of the precepts
And again from a child's point of view it's counterintuitive that you're going to be happy by not doing certain things you want to do  as when you want to take something or when you want to lie to cover up your embarrassment or to protect yourself from criticism and punishment
But over time you begin to discover that yes there is a sense of happiness there is a sense of wellbeing that comes from being principled from not having to cover up for any lies from avoiding unskillful actions from having a sense that unskillful actions are beneath you
So by the time you come to meditation through the route of giving and being virtuous you've already had experience in learning that there are counterintuitive forms of happiness in the world
When you've been trained through exposure to the Buddha's teachings you've learned the deeper happiness that comes from giving the deeper happiness that comes from restraining yourself from unskillful actions no matter how much you might want to do them
By the time you come to the meditation you've developed a certain sense of confidence that so far the Buddha has been right so you give him the benefit of the doubt on meditation
This confidence is what allows you to overcome a lot of the initial difficulties the distractions the pain
At the same time the spaciousness that comes from generosity gives you the right mindset for the concentration practice gives you the right mindset for insight practice  because when you sit down and focus on the breath what kind of mind do you have
The mind you've been creating through your generous and virtuous actions
A spacious mind not the narrow mind of a person who doesn't have enough
It's the spacious mind of a person who has more than enough to share the mind of a person who has no regrets or denial over past actions
In short it's the mind of a person who realizes that true happiness doesn't see a sharp dichotomy between your own wellbeing and the wellbeing of others
The whole idea that happiness has to consist either in doing things only for your own selfish motives or for other people to the sacrifice of yourself  the dichotomy between the two  is something very Western but it's antithetical to the Buddha's teachings
According to the Buddha's teachings true happiness is something that by its nature gets spread around
By working for your own true benefit you're working for the benefit of others
And by working for the benefit of others you're working for your own
In the act of giving to others you gain rewards
In the act of holding fast to the precepts holding fast to your principles protecting others from your unskillful behavior you gain as well
You gain in mindfulness you gain in your own sense of worth as a person your own selfesteem
You protect yourself
So you come to the meditation ready to apply the same principles to training in tranquillity and insight
You realize that the meditation is not a selfish project
You're sitting here trying to understand your greed anger and delusion trying to bring them under control  which means that you're not the only person who's going to benefit from the meditation
Other people will benefit  are benefiting  as well
As you become more mindful more alert more skillful in undercutting the hindrances in your mind other people are less subject to those hindrances as well
Less greed anger and delusion come out in your actions and so the people around you suffer less
Your meditating is a gift to them
The quality of generosity what they call caga in Pali is included in many sets of Dhamma teachings
One is the set of practices leading to a fortunate rebirth
This doesn't apply only to the rebirth that comes after death but also to the states of being the states of mind you create for yourself moment to moment that you move into with each moment
You create the world in which you live through your actions
By being generous  not only with material things but also with your time your energy your forgiveness your willingness to be fair and just with other people  you create a good world in which to live
If your habits tend more toward being stingy they create a very confining world because there's never enough
There's always a lack of this or a lack of that or a fear that something is going to slip away or get taken away from you
So it's a narrow fearful world you create when you're not generous as opposed to the confident and wideopen world you create through acts of generosity
Generosity also counts as one of the forms of Noble Wealth because what is wealth aside from a sense of having more than enough
Many people who are materially poor are in terms of their attitude very wealthy
And many people with a lot of material wealth are extremely poor
The ones who never have enough They're the ones who always need more security always need more to stash away
Those are the people who have to build walls around their houses who have to live in gated communities for fear that other people will take away what they've got
That's a very poor kind of life a confined kind of life
But as you practice generosity you realize that you can get by on less and that there's a pleasure that comes with giving to people
Right there is a sense of wealth
You have more than enough
At the same time you break down barriers
Monetary transactions create barriers
Somebody hands you something you have to hand them money back so there's a barrier right there
Otherwise if you didn't pay the object wouldn't come to you over the barrier
But if something is freely given it breaks down a barrier
You become part of that person's extended family
In Thailand the terms of address that monks use with their lay supporters are the same they use with relatives
The gift of support creates a sense of relatedness
The monastery where I stayed  and this includes the lay supporters as well as the monks  was like a large extended family
This is true of many of the monasteries in Thailand
There's a sense of relatedness a lack of boundary
We hear so much talk on interconnectedness Many times it's explained in terms of the teaching on dependent coarising which is really an inappropriate use of the teaching
Dependent coarising teaches the connectedness of ignorance to suffering the connectedness of craving to suffering
That's a connectedness within the mind and it's a connectedness that we need to cut because it keeps suffering going on and on and on over and over again in many many cycles
But there's another kind of connectedness an intentional connectedness that comes through our actions
These are kamma connections
Now we in the West often have problems with the teachings on kamma which may be why we want the teachings on connectedness without the kamma
So we go looking elsewhere in the Buddha's teachings to find a rationale or a basis for a teaching on connectedness but the real basis for a sense of connectedness comes through kamma
When you interact with another person a connection is made
Now it can be a positive or a negative connection depending on the intention
With generosity you create a positive connection a helpful connection a connection where you're glad that the boundary is down a connection where good things can flow back and forth
If it's unskillful kamma you're creating a connection you're creating an opening that sooner or later you're going to regret
There's a saying in the Dhammapada that a hand without a wound can hold poison and not be harmed
In other words if you don't have any bad kamma the results of bad kamma won't come to you
But if you have a wound on your hand then if you hold poison it will seep through the wound and kill you
Unskillful kamma is just that a wound
It's an opening for poisonous things to come in
The opposite principle also works
If there's a connection of skillful behavior a good connection is formed
This sort of positive connection starts with generosity and grows with the gift of virtue
As the Buddha said when you hold to your precepts no matter what with no exceptions it's a gift of security to all beings
You give unlimited security to everyone and so you have a share in that unlimited security as well
With the gift of meditation you protect other people from the effects of your greed anger and delusion
And you get protected as well
So this is what generosity does It makes your mind more spacious and creates good connections with the people around you
It dissolves the boundaries that otherwise would keep the happiness from spreading around
When you come to the meditation with that state of mind it totally changes the way you approach meditating
So many people come to meditation with the question What am I going to get out of this time I spend meditating Particularly in the modern world time is something we're very poor in
So the question of getting getting getting out of the meditation is always there in the background
We're advised to erase this idea of getting yet you can't erase it if you've been cultivating it as a habitual part of your mind
But if you come to the meditation with experience in being generous the question becomes What do I give to the meditation You give it your full attention
You give it the effort you're happy to put in the effort because you've learned from experience that good effort put into the practice of the Dhamma brings good results
And so that internal poverty of What am I getting out of this meditation gets erased
You come to the meditation with a sense of wealth What can I give to this practice
You find of course that you end up getting a lot more if you start with the attitude of giving
The mind is more up for challenges How about if I give it more time
How about meditating later into the night than I usually do
How about getting up earlier in the morning
How about giving more constant attention to what I'm doing
How about sitting longer through pain The meditation then becomes a process of giving and of course you still get the results
When you're not so grudging of your efforts or time you place fewer and fewer limitations on the process of meditation
That way the results are sure to be less grudging more unlimited as well
So it's important that we develop the Noble Wealth of generosity to bring to our meditation
The texts mention that when you get discouraged in your meditation when the meditation gets dry you should look back on past generosity
This gives you a sense of selfesteem a sense of encouragement
Of course what generosity are you going to look back on if there is none
This is why it's important that you approach the meditation having practiced generosity very consciously
Many times we ask How do I take the meditation back into the world But it's also important that you bring good qualities of the world into your meditation good qualities of your daytoday life and that you develop them regularly
Thinking back on past acts of generosity gets dry after a while if there's only been one act of generosity that happened a long time ago
You need fresh generosity to give you encouragement
So this is why when the Buddha talked about the forms of merit he said Don't be afraid of merit for merit is another word for happiness The first of the three main forms of merit is dana giving which is the expression of generosity
The gift of being virtuous builds on the simple act of giving and the gift of meditation builds on both
Of course a large part of the meditation is letting go letting go of distractions letting go of unskillful thoughts
If you're used to letting go of material things it comes a lot easier to begin experimenting with letting go of unskillful mental attitudes  things that you've held on to for so long that you think you need them but when you really look at them you find you don't
In fact you see that they're an unnecessary burden that causes suffering
When you see the suffering and the fact that it's needless you can let go
In this way the momentum of giving carries all the way through the practice and you realize that it's not depriving you of anything
It's more like a trade
You give away a material object and you gain in generous qualities of mind
You give away your defilements and you gain freedom
Two important questions you have to answer about meditation are how and why  how to do it and why you are doing it  because meditation is not just a technique
There's a context for the practice and only when you see the practice in context can you really understand what you're doing and get the most out of it
The how is pretty simple
With breath meditation sit straight hands in your lap right hand on top of your left hand your legs crossed right leg on top of the left leg your eyes closed
That's getting your body into position
Getting your mind into position means focusing it in on the present moment
Think about the breath and then notice how the breath feels as it comes in how it feels as it goes out
Be aware of the breathing
That means you have two qualities at work the thinking or mindfulness which reminds you where to stay and the alertness which tells you what's happening with the breath
Those are two of the qualities you want
The third quality is what the Buddha called atappa or ardency which means you really put an effort into it
You really focus on what you're doing
You're not just playing around
You give it your whole attention
You try to be ardently mindful and ardently alert
Ardently mindful means that you try to keep your mindfulness as continuous as possible without any gaps
If you find that your mind has slipped off the breath you bring it right back
You don't let it dawdle here or sniff at the flowers there
You've got work to do and you want to get it done as quickly as thoroughly as possible
You have to maintain that kind of attitude
As the Buddha said it's like realizing that your head is on fire
You put it out as fast as possible
The issues we're dealing with are serious issues urgent issues aging illness and death
They're like fires burning away inside us
So you have to maintain that sense of ardency because you never know when these fires are going to flare up
You want to be as prepared as possible as quickly as possible
So when the mind wanders off be ardent in bringing it back
Ardently alert means that when the mind is staying with the breath you try to be as sensitive as possible in adjusting it to make it feel good and in monitoring the results of your efforts
Try long breathing to see how it feels
Try short breathing heavy breathing light breathing deep shallow
The more refined you can make your awareness the better the meditation goes because you can make the breath more and more refined a more and more comfortable place for the mind to stay
Then you can let that sense of comfort spread throughout the body
Think of the breath not simply as the air coming in and out the lungs but as the flow of energy throughout the whole body
The more refined your awareness the more sensitive you can be to that flow
The more sensitive you are the more refined the breath becomes the more gratifying the more absorbing it becomes as a place to stay
This is the basic trick in getting the mind to settle down in the present moment  you've got to give it something that it likes to stay with
If it's here against its will it's going to be like a balloon you push under the water
As long as your hand has a good grasp on the balloon it's not going to pop up but as soon as you slip a little bit the balloon pops up out of the water
If the mind is forced to stay on an object that it really finds unpleasant it's not going to stay
As soon as your mindfulness slips just a little bit it's gone
Or you can compare it to parents raising a child
If the parents are constantly beating the child the child is going to run away from home as soon as it finds the chance
Even if they lock the windows and doors it's going to look for an opening
As soon as they turn their backs it's gone
But if the parents are kind to the child  give it good things to play with interesting things to do at home lots of warmth and love  the child will want to stay home even if the windows and doors are left wide open
So it is with the mind
Be friendly with it
Give it something good to stay with in the present moment  like comfortable breathing
Maybe you can't make the whole body comfortable but make at least part of the body comfortable and stay with that part
As for the pains let them be in the other part
They have every right to be there so make an arrangement with them
They stay in one part you stay in another
But the essential point is that you have a place where the mind feels stable secure and comfortable in the present moment
These are the beginning steps in meditation
This kind of meditation can be used for all sorts of purposes but the Buddha realized that the most important purpose is to get the mind out of the whole cycle of aging illness and death
And when you think about it there's nothing more important than that
That's the big problem in life and yet society tends to slough off the problems of aging illness and death tends to push them off to the side because other things seem more pressing
Making a lot of money is more important
Having fulfilling relationships is more important
Whatever
And the big issues in life  the fact that you're headed for the sufferings and indignities that come with an aging ill or dying body  get pushed off pushed out of the way
Not yet not yet maybe some other time And of course when that other time does arrive and these things come barging in they won't accept your not yet won't be pushed out anymore
If you haven't prepared yourself for them you'll really be up the creek at a total loss
So these are the most important things you need to prepare for
A lot of other things in life are uncertain but a couple of things are certain
Aging comes
Illness comes
Death is going to come for sure
So when you know something is going to come for sure you have to prepare for it
And when you realize that this is the most important issue in life you have to look at the way you live your life
Meditation  the practice of the Buddha's teachings  is not just a question of sitting with your eyes closed every now and then
It's about how you order your priorities
As the Buddha said when you see there's a greater level of happiness that can be found by sacrificing lesser forms of happiness you sacrifice the lesser ones
Look at your life and the things you hold onto the little places where the mind finds its pleasure but doesn't gain any real fulfillment Are those the things you really want to hold onto
Are you going to let them be the factors governing your life
And then you can think of larger issues
The chance for a happiness that goes beyond aging illness and death Will that be the first priority in your life
These are questions we all have to ask within ourselves
The Buddha doesn't force our answers
He simply sets out what the situation is
He says that there is a possibility for happiness lying beyond the happiness that comes from simply eating and sleeping looking after the body and having a comfortable time
This possibility is the good news in the Buddha's teachings especially since most of the world says Well this is all there is to life so make the most of it
Satisfy yourself with these immediate pleasures and don't think about other things
Don't let yourself get dissatisfied with what you've got When you think about this attitude it's really depressing because all it means is that you grab at what you can before you die
And when you die you can't take it with you
But the Buddha said there's a form of happiness there's a form of knowing in the mind that goes beyond aging illness and death and that can be attained through human effort if you're skillful enough
So that's both good news and a challenge
Are you going to let yourself just live an ordinary life frittering your time away
Or are you going to accept the challenge to devote yourself to more important things devote yourself to this possibility
The Buddha was the sort of person who put his life on the line
He didn't have anyone telling him that this was a possibility but he thought that the only way life would have any dignity any honor would be if you could find a happiness that doesn't age doesn't grow ill doesn't die
And he ran up against all the things he would have to sacrifice in order to find that happiness
So he made those sacrifices  not because he wanted to sacrifice those things but because he had to
As a result he was able to find what he was looking for
So the story of his life and his teachings are meant as a challenge for us  how are we going to lead our lives
Here we are sitting together meditating
What are you going to do with a still mind once it's become still
If you wanted to you could simply use concentration practice as a method of relaxation or a way of calming the nerves
However the Buddha says that there's more to it than that
When the mind is really still you can dig deep down into the mind and begin to see all the currents that lie underground within it
You can start sorting them out understanding what drives the mind
Where is the greed
Where is the anger
Where are the delusions that keep you spinning around
How can you cut through them
These are the questions these are the issues that can be tackled in the meditation  as long as you have a sense of their importance that they're your real priorities
If you don't have that sense you don't want to touch them because they're big issues and they snarl at you when you get near
But if you really dig down you find that they're just paper tigers
I once saw a meditation manual that contained a drawing of a tiger
The face of a tiger was very realistic  all the details were very scary  but its body was made out of folded paper
And that's what a lot of issues are in the mind
They come at you looking really intimidating but if you face them down they turn into origami
But in order to face them down you've got to have a sense that these are the really important issues in life and you're willing to give up an awful lot for their sake
You're willing to give up whatever you have to give up
That's what makes the difference between a practice that goes someplace that really knocks down the walls in the mind and a practice that simply rearranges the furniture in the room
So when you practice meditation you realize there is both the how and the why and the why is really important
Often the why gets pushed off to the side
You simply follow this or that technique and then what you want to do with it is up to you  which is true in a way but doesn't take into account the possibilities
When you put the possibilities into the context of the Buddha's teachings you see the values that underlie the practice
You see how deep the practice goes how much it can accomplish and what an enormous job you're taking on
It's enormous but the results are enormous as well
And the issues are urgent
Aging illness and death can come at any time and you have to ask yourself Are you prepared
Are you ready to die Ask yourself in all honesty and if you're not ready what's the problem
What are you still lacking
Where are you still holding on
Why do you want to hold on
When the mind settles down and is still you can start digging into these issues
And the more you dig the more you uncover within the mind  layers and layers of things that you didn't suspect that have been governing your life since who knows when
You dig them out you see them for what they are and you're free from them
You realize all the stupid things that have been running your life picked up from who knows where
You can't blame anyone else
You're the one who picked them up and you played along with them
Now when you realize that nothing is accomplished by playing along  that it's better not to play along with these things and you don't have to  then you can let them go
And they let you go
What's left is total freedom
The Buddha said that it's so total it can't even be described by words
So that's the possibility the meditation points to and it's up to each of us to decide how far we want to go in that direction how much we do really care for our true happiness for our own true wellbeing
You would think that everyone would say Of course I care for my happiness and true wellbeing But if you look at the way people live their lives you can see that they really don't put that much energy or thought into the quest for true happiness
People usually see other people do things in this or that way so they follow along without looking for themselves as if true happiness were so unimportant that you could leave it up to other people to make your choices for you
Meditation though is a chance to look for yourself at what's really important in life and then do something about it
Days and nights fly past fly past What am I doing right now
The Buddha has you ask that question every day both to keep yourself from being complacent and to remind yourself that the practice is one of doing
Even though we're sitting here very still there's still a doing going on in the mind
There's the intention to focus on the breath the intention to maintain that focus and the intention to keep watch over how the breath and the mind are behaving
Meditation as a whole is a doing
Even when you practice nonreactivity or being the knowing there's a still an element of intention
That's what the doing is
That was one of the Buddha's most important insights that even when you're sitting perfectly still with the intention not to do anything there's still the intention and the intention itself is a doing
It's a sankhara a fabrication
It's what we live with all the time
In fact all of our experience is based on fabrication
The fact that you sense your body feelings perceptions thoughtconstructs consciousness  all of these aggregates To be able to experience them in the present moment you have to fabricate a potential into an actual aggregate
You fabricate the potential for form into an actual experience of form the potential for feeling into an actual experience of feeling and so on
This element of fabrication lies in the background all the time
It's like the background noise of the Big Bang which hums throughout the whole universe and doesn't go away
The element of fabrication is always there shaping our experience and it's so consistently present that we lose sight of it
We don't realize what we're doing
What you're trying to do as you meditate is to strip things down so you can see the very elemental fabrications going on in the mind the kamma you're creating with every moment
We're not making the mind still simply to have a nice restful place to be a nice experience of ease to soothe our stressedout nerves
That may be part of it but it's not the whole practice
The other part is to see clearly what's going on to see the potential of human action What are we doing all the time
What are the potentials contained in this doing
Then we apply that understanding of human action to see how far we can go in stripping away the unnecessary stress and suffering that come from acting in unskillful ways
It's important that we always keep this in mind as we meditate
Remember We're here to understand human action in particular our own human actions
Otherwise we sit here hoping that we don't have to do anything that we can just wait for some Imax experiences to come whap us upside the head or some nice glowing sense of oneness to come welling up inside
And sometimes things like that can come unexpectedly but if they come without your understanding how or why they came they're not all that helpful
They're restful for a while or amazing for a while but then they go away and you have to deal with your desire to get them back
And of course no amount of desire is going to get them back if it's not accompanied by understanding
You can't totally drop human action until you understand the nature of action
This is really important
We like to think that we can simply stop doing stop doing stop doing and things will settle down get calm and open up to emptiness
But that's more like zoning out than meditating
There is an element of stopping in the meditation an element of letting go but you can't really master it until you understand what you're trying to stop what you're letting go
So try to watch out for that
When you come out of a good meditation don't simply get up and go back to the kitchen have a cocoa and go back to sleep
Reflect on what you did so as to understand the pattern of cause and effect to see exactly what you fabricated in the process of bringing the mind down to a state of calm
After all the path is a fabricated path
It's the ultimate fabrication
As the Buddha said of all the fabricated phenomena there are in the world the highest is the noble eightfold path
This is the path we're trying to follow right now
It's something put together and you won't understand it until you see the puttingtogether as you're doing it
So always have that in the back of your mind that you are doing something here
Sometimes it seems frustrating that the whole hour may be spent just pulling back pulling back pulling the mind back to the breath
It wanders off so you pull it back again and then it wanders  when is the peace and calm going to come
Well before it can come you have to develop some understanding
So when you pull it back try to understand what you're doing
When it wanders off try to understand what's happening what you did to encourage or allow it to wander off
In particular try to uncover all the skillful and unskillful intentions that go into this backandforth process
When you understand how the mind goes back and forth you'll reach the point where you can keep it from going back and forth
At the same time you'll develop the kind of insight we want in the meditation insight into actions
The Buddha said discernment involves comprehending the process of fabrication the process of action that's going on in the mind all the time
And all the basic building blocks of action are right here
There's the physical fabrication that leads to action  in other words the breath
Without the breath you couldn't do any other physical actions at all
Then there's verbal fabrication directed thought and evaluation
Without those you wouldn't be able to speak
And then there's mental fabrication perceptions and feelings
Without those the process of mental fabrication wouldn't have any building blocks to build with
These are all the most basic forms of activity physical verbal and mental
So we bring them all together right here when we've got the mind with the breath
We're focused on the breath directing our thoughts to the breath evaluating the breath aware of all the mental labels that label the breath and all the feelings that come with the breath pleasant or unpleasant
All the basic building blocks are right here
These building blocks are not things they're activities
You might call them basic activity units
These are the things you have to bring together in order to get the mind to settle down
Otherwise it goes off and elaborates all kinds of other worlds to inhabit pulling its attention away from the basic activity units and hoping to live in their endproducts
So you keep reminding yourself to come back to this level this level this level where things are basic and you try to manipulate these things skillfully so as to still the mind
It's an intentional stilling so there's an element of doing even in the being still but it's a doing for the purpose of knowing
Most of our doing is for the purpose of ignorance
It comes out of ignorance and heads toward ignorance covering up our intentions so that we can forget the effort that goes into the doing and simply enjoy the endproduct experiences that our doing creates
Some people think that Buddhism is a religion of experiences
We want to have a religious experience when we come here we want to have an experience of release or an experience of peace
Actually though the Dhamma is meant to take us beyond our incessant habit of producing and consuming experiences
And to do that we have to understand the nature of action that underlies the producing and consuming to see exactly what it is to be a human being who acts
What does it mean to act
How does the mind act
What is an intention
Why does the mind have intentions
Are these processes really pleasant or are they burdensome
What would it be like if we didn't have to do them
We need to look into these things we need to understand these processes before we can get to where we really want to go
If you don't understand human action you won't be able to explore the full limits of human action
You won't be able to understand how far human action can take you
So we're here to study we're here to learn from our actions
This teaching on action is something particular to the Buddha's teachings  this sense of what an action is and how far an action can go
It's easy to say that all the great religions focus on having experiences beyond what words can describe
Sounds nice
Very friendly
Very ecumenical
But when you compare what the various religions say about action  what it means to act what the potentials of human action are  you see that they differ greatly
Some teachings say that we don't really act at all that there's an outside force acting through us that everything's predetermined
Others say that we do act but our actions have no real consequences
Or that there are lots of limitations on what we can do to produce true happiness so we need some outside power to help us
You can't lump these various teachings on action together and pretend that the differences don't count
The fact is They don't jibe
They're diametrically opposed
They get in one another's way
This was why the early Buddhists kept insisting that the teaching on action was what set Buddhism apart that it was the most important issue where people have to make a choice and take a stand
And this was why the Buddha's last words were that we need to be heedful
He didn't end his teaching career with some nice platitudes on emptiness or nibbana
He said to be heedful  to see our actions as important and to keep that importance in mind at all times
So this is where you have to make a choice Which theory of action are you planning to place your hopes on
That's what you're asked to commit to when you take refuge in the Triple Gem the teaching on action the teaching on kamma
Taking refuge is not a warm fuzzy cowardly copout
It's the act of taking on full responsibility for your choices and intentions
How far are you planning to go with your actions
How far are you willing to push the envelope
These are questions that we all have to answer for ourselves and no one can force the answer on us
But just remember The Buddha said that it's possible for human action to go to the end of action  in other words to go to a dimension in the mind where ultimately there is no more intention
He says that that's the highest happiness
Now we can take that statement merely as an historical curiosity or we can take that as a personal challenge
It's up to us
At the very least when you're sitting here meditating and things don't seem to be going right don't blame it on the weather
Don't blame it on the time of day
Just look at what you're doing
Look at the raw material you have to work with and your skill in fashioning that raw material into a state of calm
From the Buddhist point of view that raw material comes from past actions
You can't change the fact that this is the raw material you have at hand but you can fashion that raw material in different ways
That freedom of choice is always present
So if things aren't going well in your meditation look at your intentions to see what you might change
Look at your perceptions at the questions you're posing in the mind
Experiment
Improvise
See what makes a difference
When things are going well try to maintain them well
See how you can develop that sense of wellness even further
This is Right Effort
This is where we encounter the element of intention the element of action directly in our own minds
If you sit here complaining about how things aren't going well in your meditation that's your choice You chose to complain
Is that the most skillful thing to do
If it's not try something else
You've always got that freedom
When things are going well you can always choose to get complacent
If you get complacent where does that take you
You can choose to manipulate things too much too little or just right
The choices are here
It's important that we keep that in mind
Otherwise we find ourselves trapped in a particular situation and can't think our way out because we don't realize the range of available possibilities
Try to keep your sense of those possibilities as alive as possible so that the doing of the meditation becomes a skillful doing and not just a thrashing around
You observe you watch you look into this question What does it mean to have an intention
How can I see the results of my intentions
Where do they show their results They show their results both in your state of mind and in your breathing so look right here make your adjustments right here
And even if you're not consciously thinking about the nature of human action you're learning a lot about your own actions as you work with the breath trying to keep the mind with the breath trying to make the breath a good place for the mind to stay
You're muddling around here in the basic elements of human action like a young kid fooling around with a guitar After a while if the kid is observant the fooling around turns into music
The more observant you are in the way you relate to the breath the more your muddle will turn into a process of discovery
When you try to settle into the present moment sometimes you find sticks rocks and thorns
They can be either in the body or in the mind and you have to do your best to deal with them
It would be nice if you could simply follow some easy stepbystep instructions first you do this and then you do that and then the results come without your having to figure anything out on your own
And sometimes there are instructions like that in meditation books  but often the mind doesn't fall in line with them
Ideally you should be able to let the mind settle down and grow calm and then deal with difficult issues but sometimes before you can settle down you've got to deal with some difficulties first
It's not only the case that discernment requires concentration
Concentration also requires discernment  learning how to bypass whatever issues you can bypass and how to deal directly with the ones you have to deal with before you can get the mind to settle down
If there's rampant lust or anger in the mind you've got to deal with it
You can't pretend it's not there
You can't shove it off into the corner for it'll keep jumping out of the corner back at you
So you remind yourself of the drawbacks of that kind of thinking you look to see where there's a lack of reasoning or a lack of logic in that kind of thinking
Many times that thinking simply comes at you with a lot of force just as a belligerent person comes at you with a lot of force to make up for his lack of reason
So you look at your lust look at your anger look at your fears and try to see What are they actually saying Sometimes you have to listen to them
If you listen really carefully you'll see that after a while they don't make any sense
When you can see that it's a lot easier to put them aside
When they come back at you say You're not making any sense at all Then you've got a handle on them
The same with physical pain
Sometimes when you sit down to meditate there's pain in the body and it has nothing to do with the meditation posture
It's simply there no matter what your posture
So you have to learn how to deal with it
Focus on other parts of the body so you get at least some sense of having a beachhead in the present moment a place where you can stay and you're okay
Then you work from that position of strength
Once you get a sense of the breath going smoothly and comfortably you let it expand from that spot into other parts of the body moving through the part where there's pain and out the feet and out the hands
You begin to realize that those thorns in the present are not just a given
There has to be a part of you that's playing along with them that's making them a problem
Once you see that the thorns are a lot easier to deal with
Sometimes there's a pain in the body and the way you're breathing is actually maintaining it
Sometimes the problem is your fear that it's going to spread which makes you build a little shell of tension around it  and while that shell of tension may keep the pain from spreading it also keeps it in existence
The breath energy doesn't flow smoothly there and that helps maintain the pain
When you catch yourself doing this you get an interesting insight The present moment is not just something given
You're participating in it
An element of your intention is shaping it
Then you can turn around and use this same principle with the mind
When there's lust or anger part of it may be coming from past habit but another part from your present participation
It's easy to understand this in the case of lust
You're enjoying it and so you want to continue it
Actually part of the mind is enjoying it while another part is suffering
What you want to do is bring the suffering part out give it voice give it some space to express itself
This is especially needed in our culture
People who don't submit to their lust are said to be repressed and have all kinds of warped beasts in the basement
So the part of the mind that thrives when it's freed from lust doesn't get a chance
It gets pushed into the corner of the basement
It becomes the repressed part
But if you can ferret out the part of the mind that's really enjoying the lust and say Hey wait a minute what kind of enjoyment is this
How about that stress over there
How about that discomfort over there
The sense of dissatisfaction that comes along with the lust the cloudiness that comes into the mind because of the lust  how about that You can start to highlight the part of the mind that really doesn't enjoy the lust
Then you have a better chance of dealing with the lust and working your way out from under its thumb
The same with anger Try to find the part of the mind that's enjoying the anger
See what kind of happiness it gets from indulging in the anger
See how piddling and miserable that happiness is
That way you strengthen the part of the mind that really doesn't want to play along
The same goes with other emotions such as fear or greed Once you catch the part of the mind that's enjoying it  participating keeping it going right now  learn to undercut it
Learn how to emphasize the part that doesn't want to play along
Then you can start applying the same principle to positive mind states the ones that you're trying to develop
If you're conscious of the part of the mind that doesn't want to stay with the breath try to find the part of the mind that does that really appreciates having a chance to settle down and let go of its burdens
The potential is there simply that it's not emphasized
So learn to give yourself pep talks
People who get easily discouraged are the ones who haven't learned that talent
You have to learn how to give yourself encouragement See
You did that
You brought the mind back
See if you can do it again the next time
See if you can do it faster That's the kind of encouragement you need the kind that keeps you participating in getting states of concentration going
After all if the present isn't just a given why don't you learn how to shape a good present
Emphasize the positive things so they really do get stronger
That way you find that you're less and less a victim of events
You come to play a stronger more positive role in shaping your experience of the present
We talk many times about how ultimately you want to discontinue that participation in the present so that you can open up to the Deathless
But before you do that you've got to get skillful in how you participate in the present moment
You can't skip straight from unskillful participation to the ultimate skill of learning how to open up to the Deathless
You've got to go through all of the stages of learning how to make the present a more positive experience  through the way you breathe the way you focus on the breath the way you deal with the various states positive or negative that come up in the mind
You've got to learn how to be a better manager of the present moment before you can develop the even more refined skills of learning how to take all of this participation apart
So when you sit down to meditate you've got to realize that not everything is a given
You're participating right now
What kind of participation do you want to develop
What kind of participation do you want to discontinue to drop
These pains  the stones and thorns and all the other things that make it hard to settle down They're not just a given
Your element of participation helps create the stones helps sharpen the thorns
If you can catch yourself doing that and can unlearn the habit you find it a lot easier to settle down and stay settled
You can see more clearly what's going on and your skill in dealing with the present gets more and more refined
Psychologists have done studies of people who've mastered skills trying to figure out why some people are simply very good at a particular skill while other people really master it
One of their discoveries is that for people to really master a skill it has to capture their imagination
They like to think about it
They like to try different ways of conceptualizing the skill approaching the skill applying the skill in unusual and unexpected ways
And although we often don't think of imagination as being involved in meditation  in fact we think that meditation is antiimagination  actually that's not the case
To master concentration it has to capture your imagination just as with any other skill
When you practice concentration what are you doing
You're creating a state in the mind
That requires imagination
The noble eightfold path as a whole is something fabricated something put together
It brings you into the present but when you get into the present you discover how much input your intentions have in each present moment
The practice of the path is designed to make you more and more sensitive to that fact to see how you put things together how you can put things together in a way that creates suffering or how you can get more skillful at putting things together in a way that creates less and less suffering until finally you reach a point where the whole thing gets taken apart and there's no suffering left
But to get to that last point you have to understand what you're doing
You can't simply make up your mind that you're going to be totally uninvolved in the present moment and simply be an observer without participating because what happens is that your participation goes underground
You don't see it but it's still there
So instead you have to be very open about the fact that you're shaping the present moment simply by choosing what you focus on
That's a decision right there The sensations you choose to focus on and the way you focus on them are going to shape your experience of the present moment
You're creating a state of becoming  the Pali word here is bhava  and although one of the things we're trying to learn to overcome is the process of becoming we can't simply drop the process
We have to understand it before we can let it go
We have to understand it to the point of dispassion and then let go
To do that we have to keep creating more and more and more of these states but we have to create a type of state that's comfortable to stay with easy to analyze easy to take apart  which is why we practice concentration
A senior monk in Bangkok once asked Ajaan Lee When you're practicing concentration aren't you creating states of becoming in the mind And Ajaan Lee responded Yes that's precisely what you're doing He went on to say that you can't take the process apart until you can do it really well
He said It's like having a hen that lays eggs
You use some of the eggs to eat while the others you crack open and take apart In other words part of the role of concentration is to keep the mind nourished on the path
The other part is to give you something to take apart while at the same time putting the mind in a position where it can take these present states apart
So when you're conscious of that fact look at the way you put the present moment together
You have choices you know different things you can focus on different ways you can focus on them
If you focus on the breath you discover that there are many different ways of conceiving and monitoring the breath your way of labeling the breath sensations the way you decide when an inbreath is long enough when it's too long when it's too short
A lot of these decisions get put on automatic pilot but as you're meditating you have a chance to examine them
You can look at them carefully and adjust them to see if there are more skillful ways of deciding how long a good long inbreath is what signs indicate that the breath is just long enough
The same holds true with the outbreaths the depth the rhythm the texture of the breath
There's a lot to play with here and the word play is important because you've got to enjoy the process
Otherwise there's no enthusiasm for the meditation you simply go through the motions because it's time to meditate
And when there's no enthusiasm no joy in the process you have a hard time sticking with it
The mind is going to lose interest get bored and try to find something else to think about something else to fill up the hour
And what you end up doing is filling up the hour with filler  straw shredded paper and Styrofoam peanuts  things that are not nearly as helpful as learning about the breath
The reason we're here is not just to put in time
We're here to see how the mind is creating unnecessary suffering for itself and to learn how to stop doing it
One helpful way of understanding the process is to look at the ways psychologists have analyzed imagination
They've discovered that it involves four skills
The first is being able to generate an image in the mind  simply giving rise to an image of one kind or another
The second is to maintain the image
The third is to inspect it look at its details explore some of its ramifications
And then the fourth ability is to alter the image making changes and then inspecting it again to see what happens as you alter it
And although the psychologists who discovered these four skills were concerned primarily with mental pictures in the mind you'll discover that any kind of creative work  writing creating a tune whatever  involves these same four steps
When you compare the four steps to concentration you find that they apply here as well
In fact they correspond to the four bases of success desire persistence intentness and ingenuity
In terms of concentration the first step corresponds to giving rise to a nice pleasant state right here in the present moment
Can you do that
If you want to you can
As the Buddha said all phenomena are rooted in desire
So how are you going to use desire to give rise to that pleasant state
You can adjust the breath
You can adjust your focus
Breathe in such a way that gives rise to a pleasant feeling in at least one part of the body
Then the next step once you've learned how to generate that state is to maintain it keep it going
And you'll discover that you need mindfulness alertness steadiness to do that
Sometimes you find it's like surfing The wave changes beneath you but you learn to keep your balance
In other words the needs of the body will change but you can keep that pleasant sensation going in spite of those changes
When you first sit down the body may need a fairly heavy rate of breathing in order to feel comfortable but then as it feels more comfortable the body's needs will change
And so you have to learn how to ride that change in the wave
Adjust the rate of breathing so that it's just right for the body right now right now right now
This makes you more and more sensitive to the fact that the body's needs change but you can learn how to maintain a particular balance as you get more and more sensitive in responding to those needs in giving the body the kind of breathing it wants
Of course the body's not going to sit there saying I want this
I want that but you get more and more sensitive to the signs the sensations that tell you that certain parts of the body are starved of breath energy and you can consciously breathe into them
The third step is inspection
You look at the state you have in the body Are there places where it's still uncomfortable places where it still feels tense where it feels tight
Well you can think of ways to change the breath
That's the fourth step
The third and fourth steps play off each other in this way Once you change things you inspect them again to see if the change has made any improvement or if it's made things worse
If it's made things worse you can try another change
Keep inspecting keep adjusting
In Pali this is called vicara or evaluation
And as things get more and more comfortable you find that the range of comfort you've been able to create for yourself begins to expand
You can breathe in with a sense that the breath energy in the body is connected in all its parts
You breathe out and the energy feels connected your awareness keeps filling the body saturating the body
After a while you get to a point where you really can't improve the breath any further
It's just right as it is
As Ajaan Fuang once said it's like pouring water into a water jar
You finally reach the point where you've filled the jar and no matter how much water you try to add after that you can't get it any fuller than that
So you stop adding water
The same with the breath When you reach the point of fullness you stop making so many adjustments so many changes
You can just be with the breathing
From this point on it's more a question of how the mind relates to the breath whether it feels that it's separate from the breath and watching it or whether it's more immersed in the breathing
As it gets more immersed the rate of breathing is going to change not so much because you made up your mind to change it but simply because you've changed your relationship to the breath
As you get more fully immersed in the body and breath you develop a sturdy feeling of unification and ease
The breathing will grow more subtle to the point where it finally stops not because you've forced it to stop but because the mind has slowed down enough to the point where it needs less and less and less oxygen
The oxygen exchange at the skin is enough to keep the body going so that it doesn't have to keep pumping in pumping out
Ajaan Lee compares this state to an ice cube with vapor coming off of it The body feels very still but around the edges there's a kind of effortless vapor that you feel with the inandout breathing
Then after a while even that stops and everything is perfectly still
All of this comes from creating that spot in the body where it feels good to stay focused
Then learning how to maintain it
Then inspecting it to see where you can expand it where you can make it more stable
And then adjusting it in various ways using your imagination to think at least of the possibility that the breath could be more comfortable the breath could saturate the body
You could think of all the cells of the body being bathed in the breath  whatever way you have of conceiving the breath that makes it more and more comfortable a better and better place to stay
In this way the four aspects of imagination apply to what you're doing right here even though you're not trying to create a mental picture
Sometimes there will be mental pictures behind it but you're more concerned with the actual sensation of the breath as you feel it coming in as you feel it going out as you play with it as you create a sense of very intense wellbeing right here
Even though it's something created something fabricated it's a good thing to create a good thing to fabricate
As the Buddha said right concentration is the heart of the path
The other factors are its requisites
And for discernment to do its work of insight in the present moment the heart of the path has to stay healthy and strong
You have to create and maintain a good solid basis through concentration
So because it's a created state you have to be creative about it imaginative about it
And you find that the more your imagination opens up to the possibilities already present the more new possibilities your imagination opens up
As long as you're frank about the process that you're creating this state you don't have to worry about getting attached to it  even though you probably will get attached to it  because deep down inside you know it's something you've created and eventually you'll have to take it apart
But in the mean time learn how to do it well
The more solid the concentration the more you want to stay here
The more you stay here the more familiar you get with the territory
And it's through that familiarity that the practice of concentration turns into the practice of insight the kind of insight that can liberate you
Without this stability and familiarity your insights are simply ideas you've heard from Dhamma talks read in books notions you've picked up from outside
They don't seep deep into the mind because the mind hasn't softened up the territory here in the present moment
Only through the practice of concentration can the hardness in the present moment begin to soften up and give the insights a chance to seep deeper and deeper
So when you have this kind of understanding about what you're doing you find it a lot easier to go about it
And you begin to realize it's not a mechanical process
It's a creative process
That way it can capture your imagination
When it captures your imagination you get more interested in what you can do with the breath not just when you're sitting here with your eyes closed but any time of the day
How you deal with the breath how you get centered in the breath can help you deal with anger
It makes you more sensitive to what anger does to the body and you can breathe through the physical manifestations of the anger so that you don't feel like they've taken over
When there's fear you can try using the breath to deal with fear
Get in touch with the physical side of the fear and breathe right through it
Notice how the breath can help deal with boredom how it can help deal with illness how it can help deal with pain
There's a lot to explore here
And as the possibilities of the breath capture your imagination you find that this skill is useful not only when you're trying to sit with your eyes closed but also wherever the present may be wherever you may be in the present
Whatever the context whatever the situation you find that the breath has something to offer  if you explore it
And to explore it you have to get a sense that it can capture your imagination
It gives you that kind of challenge along with the sense of reward that comes when you've explored something and discovered something new a valuable skill
This is how meditation can start permeating your whole life
When it permeates your whole life when you're more and more familiar with it that's when the insights arise unexpected insights sometimes insights that you won't always find in the books but very personal very much relevant to how you relate to events in the body and mind
And you realize that they've come to you because you've opened up your imagination to what's possible with the raw materials of the present
Ajaan Suwat often recommended putting yourself in a good mood each time before you meditate
This may sound a little backwards for many of us because we meditate in order to put ourselves in a good mood and yet he says to start out with a good mood
But when you stop to think about it there's really no way you can get good results out of the meditation unless the mind has at least some good qualities in it some cheerfulness some patience some wisdom
These are qualities that act as seeds that allow the meditation to develop
We're not totally emptyhanded when we come to the meditation
We do have good qualities in the mind and there are plenty of things we can think about to put the mind in a good mood
This is why we have the chant on goodwill to start out the meditation each and every time
Goodwill is a good thing to think about
You look at yourself spreading thoughts of goodwill and you feel good about yourself
You're not totally selfish not totally angry vindictive whatever
There's at least some goodness inside you
You take that as your starting capital
As with any investment you need to have something to begin with
If you don't have money at least you've got strength or you've got your intelligence
You take whatever good things you've got and you invest them
That's how they grow
So when we sit here to meditate we do our best to make the mind patient to lift it above its ordinary cares and concerns of the day and then bring it to the meditation object
That way you can relate to the breath or whatever your object in a friendly way
Being in a good mood puts the breath in good shape as well
If you feel frustrated about your breathing or frustrated about your meditation that's going to do funny things to your breath make it harder and harder to stay with the breath
So think in whatever way helps the mind get ready to meditate in the mood to meditate
This is part of the first basis of success chanda the desire to meditate
You want to meditate
You feel an inclination an attraction to the meditation
If you sit down and you feel yourself totally disinclined to meditate don't just force yourself to do it
Remind yourself of the good reasons for why you're doing it
Think of ways to make it interesting ways to make it entertaining
You can do all kinds of things with the breath
Look at Ajaan Lee's Dhamma talks When he defines the different levels of breathing in the body he hardly ever repeats himself
There's always something new something different that he's found from his meditation
We don't have to memorize all his ways of analyzing the breath
We should give them a try of course but we should also look at our ways of analyzing the breath energy and see what works for us
When you feel depressed what kind of breathing feels uplifting and energizing
When you feel manic what kind of breathing feels grounding
When you feel lazy what kind of breathing energizes you
When you feel tense what kind of breathing relaxes you
There's a lot to explore and in the exploration you get absorbed in the breath without even thinking about forcing yourself or holding a whip over the mind
This way the mind can be on good terms with the breath the breath can be good and it's easier and easier to settle down
So always take stock of your mind before you meditate to see what kind of shape it's in
Don't let thoughts of frustration or discouragement take charge of the mind
The Dalai Lama once said the thing he found most surprising about Westerners was their selfhatred
In Tibet he said only the village idiots feel selfhatred
Of course he said that smiling but it's a pretty harsh judgment
And it's also true I noticed in Thailand
Perhaps not so much any more As modern culture moves in it really does teach people to hate themselves to feel bad about themselves
It holds up all sorts of images of physical and financial perfection that nobody can live up to
But in traditional culture one of the basic skills of being a human being was essentially how to feel good about yourself how to love yourself how to wish yourself well and how to act intelligently on that wish
Only really stupid people would hate themselves and yet that kind of stupidity is rampant now in the modern world
Be careful not to pick it up
The mind has the potential for all kinds of moods
Sometimes simply sitting and taking stock of things for a few minutes learning how to use our powers of thought  not to destroy ourselves as many of us do but as an assistance to the meditation  can make all the difference
We often think that to meditate is to stop thinking
Well you have to learn how to think properly before your thoughts can stop in a skillful way
If you're thinking in ways that are selfdestructive in ways that are really harmful to yourself and you simply stop it's like running a truck into a wall
You can get thrown through the windshield or suffer whiplash
But if you learn how to think in ways that are for your own true benefit  like the things we chant about every evening which are always beneficial to think about  then when the time comes for the mind to settle down and think less and less and less and get more and more absorbed in the present moment it's a lot easier
There's a natural deceleration
So the way you prepare yourself to meditate the attitudes you bring to the meditation are very important
This doesn't mean that you should meditate only when you're in a good mood
If you're in a bad mood think in ways that will improve your mood that will improve your attitude toward the meditation your attitude toward the object that you're going to be focusing on
Remind yourself that the breath is your friend and you're here to develop the friendship even further
In that way your thinking instead of being a distraction is actually a component part of the meditation
It's an important step that can't be overlooked
We've all read how the practice of meditation can dismantle our sense of self as we take a good hard look at the things we identify as me or mine
When you meditate you're supposed to come into the present moment and drop all reference to the future or the past and simply look at things as they arise
But some futures and pasts are easier to drop than others
Even if you can drop them for the time you're in meditation you've got to come back and live with them when you come out of meditation
This whole issue of the narratives of our lives the stories we tell ourselves If we could just drop them and be done with them life would be awfully easy
Meditation would be easy
But some narratives are stickier than others
We know that the Buddha's teachings involve learning to drop a lot of things but in some cases before you can drop them you have to learn how to do them skillfully
The stories you tell yourself about your life are among the things you have to learn how to do skillfully
Otherwise you can come out of a nice peaceful meditation and meet up with the same old rotten story all over again
You'll find yourself relating to it and getting tied up in it again and again and again
Or else you find that you can't even get into the meditation to begin with because no matter how hard you try to drop the story it stays stuck to your hand
So a good part of the meditation is often not just being with the breath but  if you find you've got a story that keeps obsessing the mind stirring up greed anger delusion fear whatever  learning how to deal with that story learning how to tell yourself new stories
Learn a corrective to the old stories
One of the basic ways of doing this is to reflect on the passage we chanted just now developing thoughts of goodwill compassion appreciation and equanimity
Try to develop these attitudes with respect to those stories so that you can tell yourself new stories that are easier to let go of in a liberating way
In other words you don't just push the stories away
You weave a new story and then you get to the point in the story where it's time to settle down and meditate
That way the story will leave you alone
When you come back out of meditation the story may still be there but it's not the kind of story that's going to get you all worked up
It's been refashioned
Learn to get more and more skillful at the way you tell stories in the mind starting out with an attitude of goodwill
First goodwill for yourself
You realize that if you sit here telling yourself bad stories over and over again you're going to suffer
Do you want to suffer
Well no
Do you want other people to suffer
Well maybe
You may think about people who've wronged you and of how much you'd like to see them get their just desserts
In cases like this you have to ask yourself what you're going to gain from their suffering
You don't benefit in any way from their suffering
The fact that you're sitting there wishing suffering on them is harming you right now getting in the way of your meditation
So what you want is a story for yourself that ends up with your being happy and their being happy
That's your wish
That's the basic foundation for all the rest of the sublime attitudes
Now in some cases you see where people are actually harming themselves harming you harming others
That's where you need compassion
Think about it
You really wish they could stop
And of course the same thing applies to you
When you're harming yourself you wish you could stop causing that harm
It would be good for that harm not to happen
It would be good for those people not to suffer Remind yourself of that attitude
For appreciation you remind yourself of your goodness of the goodness of other people the things you've done that make you deserve to be happy the things that other people have done that make them deserve to be happy
You're not jealous or resentful of their happiness and you don't downplay their good points
Finally equanimity when you realize that some things are simply beyond your control No matter how much goodwill you feel for other people no matter how much appreciation and compassion you feel some things lie totally beyond what you can change
Number one the past cannot be changed
You have to develop equanimity toward the past
Look at what the Buddha has you think about to develop equanimity the principle of kamma
Old kamma is old kamma and cannot be undone
What's important is your new kamma what you're doing right now
Now that can effect some things but there are other things beyond the power of new kamma largely through the continuance of old kamma
You've got to think about that and learn how to develop equanimity in cases where equanimity is appropriate
The Buddha isn't saying that equanimity is better than the other three attitudes
You just learn which situations require which attitude which situations require goodwill which require compassion which require appreciation which require equanimity
In this way equanimity is not simply passive acceptance
It's an ordering of your priorities telling you to stop wasting energy on things that can't be changed and to focus it instead on areas where good will compassion and appreciation can make a difference
So you look at the stories you're telling yourself and try to inject them with these attitudes and especially the teaching on kamma
There's no wrong that goes unpunished no good that goes unrewarded
That's simply the way kamma is
Therefore we don't have to carry around ledger sheets  which person did this which person did that  with the fear that if the ledger sheet disappears then that person's not going to get the retribution he or she deserves
The principle of kamma takes care of that
But remember that it also takes care of you as well
When you look at the satisfaction you get out of unskillful storytelling you realize that it's pretty miserable
It's nothing you really want
It's nothing that stands up to any real scrutiny
When you see this you find it easier to let go
You've got these other attitudes that will bring you into the present moment in a way that allows you to feel good about yourself
You're not allowing yourself to be victimized
At the same time you're not wishing ill on anybody
You do what can be done given the situation
And when the time comes where the mind needs a rest the mind needs to settle down that's what should be done right now
That's the best thing you can do right now
And that way the narrative leads you into the present moment
You want to look at the attitudes you're fostering in your mind and make sure they're skillful ones  because the whole issue of kamma boils down to this What you do right now is important
What was done in the past may have some influence on what you can do right now but what you do right now is what's really important
And the possibility of doing something skillful right now is always present
When bad things come you accept them as the results of past kamma but if you realize you're doing bad kamma in the present as well that's something you can't have equanimity for
You've got to change it
You can do your best in whatever the situation is confident that it will work out  that if you keep on doing and saying and thinking skillful things the results will have to be good
So no matter how bad the situation your hope lies in what you're doing right now
And the more you think about this the more it brings the mind into the present moment
That's when it's ready to meditate
If you look in the texts where the Buddha talks about the past some of them go back many aeons many cycles of the universe describing how this happened how that happened where this came from where that came from long stories about past lives or cycles of lives
But these texts all end up by pointing to the basic principle that has shaped these things and is going to shape the future the principle of kamma
And where's kamma being made
Right here right now
So focus right here
The same with all the cosmologies
When the Buddha describes the levels of being the discussion comes down to where these levels of being come from
They come from the mind from what the mind is doing in the present
Right here right now
Whatever the narratives are when you tell them skillfully they bring you back to the present moment
So learn how to be a good storyteller telling yourself the right stories stories that will bring you into the present with a sense of confidence in your own abilities with a sense of wellbeing a sense of the importance of stilling the mind
No matter what the stories are  no matter what other people have done no matter what you've done  there's a way of looking at them that can put the mind at rest
To try to find that way This is what all the teachings on kamma all the teachings on the sublime attitudes are about
You weave new stories in the mind stories in which you have a change of heart new stories that come together right here enabling you to stay right here with a sense of wellbeing clarity concentration mindfulness and discernment
Without anything tugging you back into the past pulling you into the future you're able to just be right here right now aware right here right now healing the mind right here right now
That's how you use the mind's storytelling ability to bring it to a point where it can just stop telling stories and look at what you've got
Learn to be skillful with what you've got right here right now
That's what the Buddha's teachings all come down to this principle of skillfulness
How skillfully can you relate to the different things going on in your mind for your own wellbeing for the wellbeing of others around you
Meditation doesn't mean that you're cutting off any mental faculties
The mind has to tell stories
Even arahants can tell stories can reflect on the past and plan for the future
They've simply learned to do it in a way that doesn't cause any suffering
And it's not just from their bringing the mind into the present moment
It also comes from reflecting on things in a certain way using the Buddha's teachings as proper tools to weave skillful narratives
Let all the ways that the mind relates to itself in terms of past future narratives stories worldviews cosmologies  all your views  become skillful
Let them no longer be a cause for suffering
Think of the practice as an allaround way of training the mind
You're not here just to get very skillful at noting or at being with the breath
You want the mind to become very skillful in all its activities
Ajaan Fuang once said to me when I went back to reordain that being a meditator requires being skillful in everything not just sitting here with your eyes closed
You approach everything as an interesting challenge What's the most skillful way of dealing with this
What's the most skillful way of dealing with that When you have that attitude when you've developed it and trained it in your daily life then when you come to the meditation things go a lot easier
A frequent question is How can you tell if you're making progress in your meditation
And one of the answers is When the mind slips off its object you get faster and faster at bringing it back
Notice the answer isn't The mind doesn't slip off at all
It's You're expected to slip off it's a normal part of the practice a normal part of the training
The point lies in being more alert to what's going on and quicker to remedy the situation when you've slipped off the breath
So an important part of learning how to meditate is learning how to fall
They say that when you start learning Aikido the first thing they teach is how to fall without hurting yourself
The purpose is that it makes you less and less afraid to fall less and less damaged of course by the fall and also less likely to fall more willing to take chances
So the trick when you meditate is learning how to bring the mind back with a minimum amount of recrimination a minimum amount of selfcriticism with just the simple observation I haven't come here to think about next week's schedule or last night's fiascoes or whatever
I'm here to focus on the breath Simply leave those other things and come back
Learn how to do it without tying your mind up in knots
In our modern educational system we're quickly channeled into the activities where we have a natural talent
As a result we don't learn how to become good at things that don't come easily
So when we make an effort at something that doesn't come naturally the easiest thing in the world seems to be to slip and fall and then just go with the fall and plop down fallen
That's called not knowing how to fall
The trick when you fall is to notice that there is a certain amount of momentum but you don't have to give in to the momentum
You can notice this when you've made a vow to give up something for a particular period of time
Last summer it was popular here at the monastery to give up chocolate in the evening
But then came the temptation What's wrong with a little bit of chocolate Well there's nothing really wrong with chocolate per se so it was easy to rationalize and come to the decision to drop the vow to go for the chocolate
The problem of course is that the important part of the vow wasn't the chocolate it was the training in sticking to your vow no matter what
All too often we assume that once that decision to drop a vow has been made it can't be unmade you're powerless and have to follow through with the momentum
But it is possible to unmake that decision  in the next moment or two moments later three moments later
This is called learning how to fall properly
In other words you don't give in to the momentum that leads you away
You realize that you're always free to change your mind immediately and come back
When you notice yourself slipping off the breath don't just give in to the momentum of having slipped
Catch yourself I can just turn around and you'll be amazed at how quickly you can turn around
Now the mind may come up with other reasons Oh no you can't turn around now you've committed yourself Well that's interesting
You've suddenly committed yourself to the distraction  which isn't committed to you  and you don't feel you've committed yourself to your meditation
This is one of the many tricks the mind plays on itself
The important point is learning how to see through those tricks not to believe them and to have a few tricks of you own
There's a part of the mind that says it's a lot more natural to take the easy way out but that begs the question of nature versus nurture
If you go to a psychotherapist you learn very clearly how your particular habits got developed by a particular way your parents raised you or by particular experiences you had when you were a kid
That means those habits are not necessarily natural
They were learned
They're there they're ingrained but you can unlearn them
You can nurture the mind in the other direction which is what we're doing as we train it in meditation
We're reeducating the mind
And not only are we teaching it how to stay on one topic as we stay with the breath but we're also teaching it how to come back to the breath more quickly how to catch yourself as the mind begins to let go of the breath and latch on to something else and to just turn right around without any problem at all and latch back onto the breath
This way you learn to discipline yourself without the harshness that we usually associate with the word discipline We're learning a more matteroffact way of dealing with our own mind
You find that this cuts through a lot of the garbage
And as a result there are fewer hooks for your defilements to hang on to
Instead of dealing with abstractions such as my personality my character the way I am just keep focused on the present moment
Whatever decision was made it was made in total freedom and if you see it's a bad decision you have total freedom to make another decision
When you clear away your selfimage  which is another hiding ground for all kinds of defilements  the playing field is a lot clearer and there are a lot fewer places for the defilements to hide
A woman I know in Laguna Beach once went to a meditation retreat where she was taught to bring meditation practice into daily life by viewing daily life as an interplay between the absolute and the relative
Those are pretty big abstractions about as big as you can get
And after trying to think in these terms for a week she came to the Sunday sitting group with a very convoluted question about how to manage her life in those terms
I must admit the question was so convoluted that I couldn't follow it but the problem was obvious The more abstract the abstraction the more difficult it is to see your way clearly in the path and the easier it is to get tied up in knots
We tend to think of abstractions as being clean and neat and Mondrian but actually they leave room for lots of convolutions
They place lots of veils over what's really happening
When you clear away the abstractions you have the mind right here with the breath
It can decide to stay with the breath or it can decide to move away
It's as simple as that
The same principle applies throughout the practice
Once you've made up your mind to stick with the precepts you keep deciding with every moment whether you're going to stick with that vow
Once you've made up your mind to stick with the breath you keep deciding with every moment whether you're going to stick with that intention
And the more you keep things on simple terms basic terms downtoearth nononsense straighttalking terms in the mind  without bringing in issues about your past without bringing in issues about your selfimage to complicate matters  you find it's a lot easier to stay on the path
It's a lot easier to bring yourself back when you fall off because there are fewer convolutions in the terrain you're falling on
So not only when you're meditating but also when you're practicing every aspect of the path try to keep things as simple as possible as downtoearth momenttomoment as possible
When I was staying with Ajaan Fuang he would sometimes ask me to do things like Tonight sit up and meditate all night long Omigosh I responded the first time he said that I can't do that I didn't get enough sleep last night and had a long tiring day And so on
And he said Is it going to kill you Well no Then you can do it
As simple as that
Of course it wasn't easy but it was simple
And when you keep things simple they eventually do become easier
You just stay with that momenttomoment decision not thinking about All night all night I've got to keep this up all night You just think about This breath this breath this breath Find ways to keep yourself interested in each breath as it comes and you'll make it to morning
That's how you bring the meditation into daily life Keep things simple strip them down
Once things are stripped down in the mind the defilements don't have many places to hide
And when you do fall you fall in a place that's easier to get up from
You don't have to give in to the momentum of the fall or get stuck in a quagmire
You catch yourself and regain your balance right away
My mother once said that the event that first attracted her to my father happened during a meal at her home
My uncle her brother had invited my dad home from college for a visit
Then one day during a meal my dad knocked a glass of milk off the table but he caught the glass before it hit the floor
And that's why my mother married him
I know it sounds kind of crazy  I owe my existence to my father's quick reflexes  but it says something very interesting
And it's the kind of quality you want as a meditator If you knock yourself over well you can pick yourself right back up
If you can do it before you hit the floor so much the better
But even when you're flat on the floor you're not a glass
You haven't shattered
You can still pick yourself up
Try to keep it as simple as that
When I first went to stay with Ajaan Fuang one of the questions I asked him was What do you need to believe in order to meditate He answered that there was only one thing the principle of kamma
Now when we hear the word kamma we usually think kammaandrebirth but he meant specifically the principle of action that what you do shapes your experience
If you're convinced of this you can do the meditation because after all the meditation is a doing
You're not just sitting here biding your time waiting for the accident of Awakening to happen
Even in very still states of meditation there's an activity going on
Even the act of being the knowing is still a doing
It's a fabrication a sankhara
In one of the suttas the Buddha says that all the different khandhas all the different aggregates that make up experience as a whole have to get shaped into aggregates by the process of fabrication
In other words there's a potential for a form a potential for a feeling potential for perception fabrication consciousness and the act of fabricating is what turns these potentials into actual aggregates
It sounds abstract but it's a very important lesson for the meditation even from the very beginning
You sit here in the body  and of course that's a fabrication right there the idea that you're sitting in the body  but given all the many different things you could focus on right now there's the possibility of choice
This possibility of choice is where kamma comes in
You can choose any of the sensations that are coming into your awareness
It's as if there were a buzz in all the different parts of the body
There's a potential for pain here a potential for pleasure over there
All these different sensations are presenting themselves to you for you to do something about them and you have the choice as to which ones you'll notice
Doctors have done studies showing that pain isn't just a physical phenomenon
It isn't totally a given
There are so many different messages coming into your brain right now that you can't possibly process them all so you choose to focus on just some of them
And the mind has a tendency to focus on pain because it's usually a warning signal
But we don't have to focus there
In other words there can be a slight discomfort in a part of the body and you can focus on it and make it more and more intense more and more of an issue
That's one thing you can do right now but  even if you may not realize it  you have the choice of whether or not to do that
You can choose not to make it more intense
You can choose even to ignore it entirely
Many times we have habitual ways of relating to sensations and they're so habitual and so consistent that we think there's no choice at all
This is the way things have to be we think but they don't
That's the other implication of the principle of kamma You can change your actions
If some parts of experience are dependent on choice and fabrication you can choose to change
You see this really clearly when you focus on the breath
The breath is always there in the body and if you look carefully you'll discover that it has many levels
It's like looking up in the sky Sometimes you feel a breeze coming from the south but you look up in the sky and see a layer of clouds moving east and another higher layer of clouds moving west
There are lots of different layers of wind in the atmosphere and in the same way there are lots of different layers of breath in the body
You can choose which ones to focus on
It's like having a radio receiver You can choose to tunein to different stations
The radio waves from all the nearby radio stations all the different frequencies are all in the air around us
There are radio waves from Los Angeles radio waves from San Diego even short wave radio waves from whoknowswhere all over the place
They're going through this room right now
They're going through your body right now
And when you turn on the radio you choose which frequency you want to focus on which one you want to listen to
The same with the body
You sort out of all the possible sensations just one type of sensation to focus on the breathness of the breath
Wherever you feel the sensation of the inandout breath most clearly you focus right there
Now some of us have a radio we haven't taken very good care of and as soon as we tune it in to one station it slips over to another
So you've got to keep tuning it back tuning it back
But the problem isn't just the tuning
It's what you do with the sensation once you've tunedin to it
Again you can focus on the breath in a way that makes it painful or you can focus on it in a way that makes it comfortable
You're not faced just with the givenness of the breath
What you do with it can make it more or less painful more or less comfortable
To continue the analogy it's like having a volume control on the radio You can turn it way up loud so that it hurts your ears or you can turn it way down soft so that you can hardly hear it at all
But as you get more skillful with your volume control you get a sense of what's just right so that you can adjust the level and the pressure of your focus for maximum enjoyment
As you get tunedin more and more precisely you discover there are other subtleties as well
Again like the radio when you really get tuned very precisely onto the frequency the static goes away and you can hear subtleties in the signal that you couldn't hear before
You can play with them turn up the treble turn up the base whatever you want
So even though the radio signal is a given you can do a lot with it
That's the element of kamma in your meditation right now It's what you're doing with the breath
You can learn how to be more skillful in how you relate to it so that you can sense not only the very obvious breath of the air coming in and out of the lungs but also the sensations that go through the whole body as you breathe in as you breathe out the patterns of movement in the body that actually bring the air into the lungs and let it go out
There's a wave going through the body each time you breathe
As you become sensitive to it you begin to sense where there's tension in the body and where there's not where the subtle breath flows properly and where it doesn't
And again it's not just a given
You can do things with that flow
You can improve the flow
If you notice tension in a certain part of the body you relax it and oftentimes doing this improves the breath flow not only at that one spot but also in other parts of the body as well
You begin to have a sense of the body as a whole series of different interconnected energy patterns
A tightening up here may lead to a tightening up over there and it all gets connected in a feeling of overall constriction of bands of tension squeezing the body
Or you can loosen it up
That's your choice
You can relax this bit of tension here and find that it leads to an unraveling of tension over there
Or you might find that everything gets so loose that you drift off
This means that you've got to learn how to gain a sense of just right so that you can stay with the sensation keep your focus and even if the radio signal begins to drift a little bit you can follow it precisely and stay right with it
At this point you can let go of the sensation of the inandout breath  the coarse breath the obvious breath  and focus more on the subtle breath flow in the body
As you work through all the different parts of the body where it feels tense or blocked or sort of squeezed out you let the breath sensations fill all those little nooks and crannies and there comes a greater and greater sense of fullness refreshment
That's what piti means
It's the drinkingin of the good sensation
We normally translate piti as rapture but it's also related to the word for drinking pivati
You drinkin this nice sensation
It feels full it feels refreshing all the way through the body because you've opened up all the little cells in the body and allowed the breath to enter
When you get that sense of fullness it's easier to relax
This may not be a pretty image but the mind at this point is like a mosquito when it's finally hit a big vein in your body
It sticks its little proboscis in and just stays right there bathed in bliss
Its wings go weak its feet go weak and no matter how much you try to brush it away it just doesn't want to go
It's just drinkingin what it wants
The same with the mind As soon as that refreshing breath sensation begins to fill up in the body you let go of everything else
No matter what other disturbances come you're not the least bit interested because you've got something really satisfying
You could almost say that it's a sensation to die for
You let down your guard let go of everything else because this sensation is so totally absorbing
You've opened up every part of the body every part of your awareness for this sensation to come in
As you stay there and the mind grows more and more still you become aware of a deeper sensation of absolute fullness with no sense of flowing back and forth  a real stillness in the body
There's a slight sense of air exchange on the very surface of the body the surface of your awareness but deep down inside there's a great stillness
There's no longer the sense of drinkingin because you're absolutely full
Ajaan Lee uses the image of an ice cube There's a vapor coming off the cube  a very vaporous movement around the edge of your awareness  but everything else is solid and still
And then finally even that vapor stops and the solidity fills your whole awareness
It's accompanied by a sense of brightness even though you may not sense this brightness as a light
It's a peculiar quality a physical sensation a feeling tone of brightness clarity filling the whole body and you're just sitting there in the middle of it
There's no need to rush through these stages no need to go jumping through hoops
In fact it's best if you not try to rush
Just find one sensation you can tunein to
Stay right there and it will develop on its own simply because of the consistency of your focus
When you finally reach that sense of solid stillness and stay there you begin to realize that you can choose to give a shape to it or not
You can focus on the sensations that give you a sense of the shape of the body or you can choose to ignore them
This is where you really see the principle of kamma coming into play in the meditation
It's almost as if the various sensations of the body have turned into a mist
There are these little breath droplets just shimmering there and you sense the space in between them
The whole body is filled with this space which also extends outside the body in every direction
Instead of focusing on the little droplets you can focus on the space
This gives you a really clear lesson in how much choice you have in how you experience the present moment
Just the simple sensation of having a body here comes from subconscious shapegiving choices you've made
You realize there are lots of different sensations you can focus on and there's a skill in how you choose your sensations in how you magnify the ones you want and how you just put aside the ones you don't
So even though this is just training in concentration there's also a lot of discernment involved
As the Buddha once said both tranquillity and insight are required for getting good strong states of absorption
And he never talked about insight without framing it in terms of kamma in terms of the skillfulness of what you're doing
So this practice is what lays the groundwork so that  when the time comes to consider issues of inconstancy stress and notself  you've got the proper context
You've created a good space inside a good space in the present moment so that there's no hungry sense of having to grasp after this or grasp after that
When you've drunk your fill of the fullness and stillness you're in a much better mood to consider things for what they actually are  so that when insight comes it's not destabilizing
Without this solid foundation thinking about inconstancy stress or notself can get really disorienting
But when you start thinking about these issues in the context of what you're doing in the meditation they make it even more stabilizing
This is where concentration tranquillity insight and discernment all come together in a healthy and balanced way
When there's a Dhamma talk you don't have to listen
The important thing is to stay with your breath
When the breath comes in you know it's coming in when it goes out you know it's going out
Try to make that experience of the breath fill your awareness as much as possible
The Dhamma talk here is a fence to keep you corralled with the breath
When the mind wanders off here's the sound of the Dhamma to remind you to go back to the breath but when you're with the breath you don't need reminding
You do your own reminding
That's what the mindfulness does in the meditation
Each time you breathe in each time you breathe out remind yourself to stay with the breath
Make just a little mental note This is where you want to stay this is where you want to stay
And try not to think of yourself as inhabiting one part of the body watching the breath in another part of the body
Think of the breath as all around you
It's coming in and out the front coming in and out the back down from the top all the way out to your fingers all the way out to your toes
There's a subtle breath energy coming in and out of the body all the time
If you're in one part of the body watching the breath in the other part you're probably blocking the breath energy to make space for that sense of you in the part of the body that's watching
So think of yourself as totally surrounded by the breath bathed in the breath and then survey the whole body to see where there are still sections of the body that are tense or tight that are preventing the breath from coming in and going out
Allow them to loosen up
This way you allow for the fullness of the breath to come in go out each time there's an inbreath each time there's an outbreath
Actually the fullness doesn't go in and out
There's just a quality of fullness that's bathed by the breath coming in bathed by the breath going out
It's not squeezed out by the breath
It's not forced out by the breath
Each nerve in the body is allowed to relax and have a sense of fullness right here right now
Simply try to maintain that sense of fullness by the way you breathe
Your focus is on the breath but you can't help but notice the fullness
If you can't get that sense of fullness going throughout the whole body find at least some part of the body that doesn't feel squeezed out that feels open and expansive and then see if you can copy that same feeling tone in other parts of the body
Notice the other different parts of the body where it feels open like that and allow them to connect
At first nothing much will happen from that sense of connection but allow it to stay open stay open
Each time you breathe in each time you breathe out maintain that sense of openness openness and the sense of connection will get stronger
This is why the ability to stay with these sensations is so important for your staying with them is what allows them to grow
If you move off to someplace else if you're thinking of something else there will have to be a tensingup in the body to allow that thought to happen
Whatever sense of fullness might have developed  say in your arms or your legs in different parts of the body down your back  doesn't have a chance to develop
It gets squeezed off because you're not paying attention to it any more
This is why the Buddha talks about concentration as mahaggatam cittam an enlarged awareness
If your awareness is limited just to one little spot everything else gets squeezed out everything else gets blotted out  and what is that if not ignorance
You're trying to make your awareness degrees all around in all directions because the habit of the mind is to focus its awareness in one spot here then one spot there moving around but there's always the one spot one spot one spot
It opens up a little bit and then squeezes off again opens up a little bit squeezes off again and nothing has a chance to grow
But if you allow things to open up throughout the whole body you realize that if you think about anything at all you destroy that openness
So you've got to be very very careful very very still to allow this open fullness to develop
So these qualities of consistency care and heedfulness are important in allowing this state of concentration to develop
Without them nothing much seems to happen
You have a little bit of concentration then you step on it a little bit of concentration then you squeeze it off as you go looking at something else thinking about something else
And so whatever little bits and pieces of concentration you do have don't seem very remarkable
They don't get a chance to be remarkable
Concentration takes time  and our society's pretty extraordinary in fostering the expectation that things should happen quickly
If anything's going to be good it has to happen quickly it has to be instant
And so by and large we've lost the ability to stay with things as they develop slowly
We've lost the ability to keep chipping away chipping away chipping away at a large task that's going to take time and can't be speeded up
When the Buddha gives images for practicing concentration he often relates them to skills
Skills take time and he was teaching people who had taken the time to master many useful skills
In Thailand they still sharpen knives against stones and it's a skill you have to learn how not to ruin the knife as you're sharpening it
If you get impatient and try to speed things up you'll ruin the sharpness the straightness of the blade
So you have to be very still
The mind has to be still and you have to maintain just the right amount of pressure constantly as you sharpen the blade
At first it may seem like nothing is happening but over time the blade does get sharper and sharper
The consistency of your pressure is what guarantees that the blade won't get worn in one particular spot  too sharp in one spot and not sharp enough in another too sharp in the sense that the blade is no longer straight
You've worn it down too much in one spot
There are a lot of things you have to watch out for simply in the act of sharpening a blade
But if you have that skill in your repertoire then when the time comes to meditate it's easier to relate to what you're doing that same kind of consistency that same evenness of pressure the continual mindfulness and alertness that are needed to maintain the proper pressure
Another skill sometimes used as an analogy is that of a hunter
A hunter has to be very quiet so as not to scare the animals off and at the same time very alert so as not to miss when a particular animal comes by
In the same way we as meditators have to be careful not to slip off in either direction into too much stillness or too much mental activity
You have to find the proper balance
I was once talking to an anthropologist who said that of all the skills in primitive societies that anthropologists try to learn the hardest is hunting
It requires the strongest concentration the most sensitivity
So here we're not hunting animals but we're hunting concentration which is even more subtle and requires even more stillness and alertness
Sometimes we in the West think that we come to the Dhamma with an advantage We've got so much education we're so wellread
But we have a major disadvantage in that we lack the patience and consistency that come with mastering a skill
So keep that in mind as you're meditating when you find yourself getting impatient for results
You have to be watchful and consistent
You need that sense of being bathed by the breath being open to the breathing sensations in all parts of the body down to every little pore of your skin
Then you learn the sensitivity that's required the consistency that's required to maintain that
That way the sense of fullness can grow and grow and grow until it becomes really gratifying really satisfying to give your concentration the kind of strength the sense of refreshment the sense of nourishment it needs in order to keep going
Ajaan Fuang once said that without this sense of fullness refreshment or rapture your meditation gets dry
You need this lubricant to keep things smooth and running the sense of wellbeing and refreshment the immediate visceral pleasure of being in a concentrated state
At the same time it heals all our mental wounds any sense of tiredness of being stressedout mistreated abused
It's like medicine for these mental wounds
Now medicine often takes time to work especially soothing and reconstituting medicine
Think of the creams you put on chapped skin
The skin isn't immediately cured when you first rub on the cream
It takes time
The skin has to be exposed to the cream for long periods of time to allow the cream to do its work
The same with concentration
It's a treatment that takes time
Your nervous system needs to be exposed to the sense of fullness for a long period of time giving it a chance to breathe in breath out all around so that the mindfulness and the breath together can do their healing work
So don't get impatient
Don't feel that nothing is happening
A lot of things that are very important require time and they do their work subtly
If you give them the time they need you find that you're more than repaid
After all you could be sitting for the whole hour planning next week planning next month planning next year
What will you have at the end of the hour
A lot of plans
And part of you may feel satisfied that you've provided for the future but when you reflect on how many of your past plans have actually borne results you'll realize the odds against your new plans' ever amounting to much
What would you have to show for your hour then
Nothing very certain
Maybe nothing but mousedroppings and straw
But if you give the breath an hour to do its healing work totally opening up the body to allow the breath to bathe every nerve out to every pore you know that you'll come out at the end of the hour with a body and mind in much better shape
The body will be soothed the mind bright and alert
And you don't need to stop being bathed in the breath when the hour is up
You can keep it going in all your activities
That way even though you may not be armed with a whole set of plans for facing the future at least you're in a position where you don't need that kind of armor
You've got the armor of a healthy body and mind
You've got an invisible armor the forcefield of this allencompassing breath continually streaming out from your center to every pore protecting you on all sides
That's something you feel in every cell of your body something you know for sure for you can sense it all around you right here right now
And you know that whatever the future brings you're prepared
You can handle it
This sense of fullness brightness alertness That's all you'll need to keep the mind capable healthy and strong
When the Buddha teaches breath meditation he teaches sixteen steps in all
They're the most detailed meditation instructions in the Canon
And the breath is the topic he recommends most highly most frequently  because the breath is not only a place where the mind can settle down and gain concentration but it's also something the mind can analyze
It's where all the insights needed for Awakening can arise  while the mind is being mindful of the breath alert to the breath and also conscious of how it relates to the breath
In the later stages of breath meditation the emphasis is focused less on the breath than on the mind as it relates to the breath
In the beginning stages though the emphasis is on the breath itself on using the breath to snare the mind and bring it into the present moment
In the first two steps you're simply with long breathing and short breathing sensitizing yourself to what long and short breathing feel like
Beginning with the third step though there's an element of volition
You train yourself and the first thing you train yourself to do is to be aware of the whole body as you breathe in aware of the whole body as you breathe out
When the Buddha describes concentration states he doesn't use images of singlepointedness
He uses images of wholebody awareness
When a sense of rapture and pleasure comes from the breath he tells you to knead that sense of rapture and pleasure through the whole body the way you would knead water into flour to make dough
Another image is of the rapture welling up from within the body and filling the body just like a spring of cool water coming up from within a lake filling the entire lake with its coolness
Another image is of lotuses standing in a lake Some of the lotuses don't go above the water but stay totally immersed in the water saturated from their roots to their tips with the stillness and coolness of the water in the lake
Still another image is of a person wrapped in white cloth totally surrounded by the white cloth from head to foot so that all of his body is covered by the white cloth
These are all images of wholebody awareness of a sense of rapture pleasure or bright awareness filling the entire body
That's what you want to work on when you get to know the breath because the type of awareness that allows insight to arise is not restricted to one point
When you're focused on one point and blot out everything else that leaves a lot of blind spots in the mind
But when you try to get a more allaround awareness it helps eliminate the blind spots
In other words you want to be immersed in the breath aware of the breath all around you
One of the phrases they use for this  kayagatasati  is mindfulness immersed in the body
The body is saturated with awareness and the awareness itself gets immersed in the body is surrounded by the body
So it's not that you're up in one spot  say in the back of the head  looking at the rest of the body from that one spot or trying to block awareness of the rest of the body from that one spot of awareness
You've got to have a wholebody awareness allaround degrees so as to eliminate the blind spots in the mind
Once you have this type of awareness you work at maintaining it  although the work here is not like other work
You work at not moving your attention at not letting it shrink
You work at not taking on other responsibilities
With time though the work becomes more natural more secondnature
You feel more and more settled and at home
As the mind settles in its usual nervous energy begins to dissolve
The body actually needs less and less oxygen because the level of your brain activity begins to grow calm and so the breath gets more and more refined
It can even grow perfectly still for all the oxygen you need is coming in through the pores of your skin
At this point the breath and your awareness seem to have melted into each other
It's hard to draw a line between the two and for the time being you don't try
Allow the awareness and the breath to interpenetrate to become one
You have to allow this awareness this sense of oneness to get really solid
Otherwise it's easily destroyed because the tendency of the mind is to shrink up
As soon as we think we shrink up the energy field in certain parts of the body to block them out of our awareness which is why there's tension in the body every time a thought occurs
This part of the body gets tense so you can think that thought that part of the body gets tense so you can think this one back and forth this way
It's no wonder that the simple process of thinking takes a lot out of the body
According to some Chinese medical treatises a person whose work is mental tends to use up energy at three times the rate of a person whose work is totally physical
This is because thinking involves tension in the body
And in particular thoughts that go off into the past or into the future have to create whole worlds for themselves to inhabit
When we're getting the mind concentrated we're thinking in a different way
In the beginning stages we're still thinking but we're thinking solely about the present moment observing solely the present moment being alert and mindful to what's going on here so we don't have to create worlds of past and future
This imposes less stress on the body
In order to maintain that present focus and not go slipping off to your old habits you've got to keep your awareness as broad as possible
That's what keeps you rooted in the present moment all the way down to your fingers and toes
When your awareness stays broad it prevents the kind of shrinking up that allows the mind to slip out after thoughts of past and future
You stay fully inhabiting the present
The need to think gets more and more attenuated
When fewer and fewer thoughts interfere with the flow of the breath energy a sense of fullness develops throughout the body
The texts refer to this fullness as rapture and the sense of ease accompanying it as pleasure
You let this sense of easy fullness suffuse the body but you still maintain your focus on the breath energy even if it's totally still
Eventually  and you don't have to rush this  the point will come when the body and mind have had enough of the rapture and ease and you can allow them to subside
Or there may be times when the rapture gets too overpowering in which case you try to refine your awareness of the breath so that it can come in under the radar of the rapture and you move to a level of total ease
Then even the ease  the sense of imbibing the pleasure  subsides leaving you with total stillness
After you've become settled in the stillness you can start looking for the dividing line between awareness and the breath
Up to this point you've been manipulating the breath trying to get more and more sensitive to what feels comfortable in the breathing and what doesn't so that your manipulation gets more and more subtle to the point where you can drop the manipulation and just be with the breath
This allows the breath to grow more and more refined until it's absolutely still
When things are really solid really still your awareness and the object of your awareness naturally separate out like chemicals in a suspension that's allowed to stay still
Once the awareness separates out you can begin directly manipulating the factors of the mind the feelings and perceptions that shape your awareness
You can watch them as they do this for now the breath is out of the way
It's like tuningin to a radio station As long as there's static as long as you aren't precisely tunedin to the station's frequency you can't hear the subtleties of the signal
But once you're right at the frequency the static goes away and all the subtleties become clear
When you're tunedin to the mind you can see the subtleties of feeling and perception as they move
You can see the results they give the impact they have on your awareness and after a while you get the sense that the more refined that impact the better
So you allow them to calm down
When they're calmed down you're left with awareness itself
But even this awareness has its ups and downs and to get you past them the Buddha has you manipulate them just as you manipulated the breath and the mental factors of feeling and perception
The text talks about gladdening the mind steadying the mind and releasing the mind
In other words as you get more and more used to the stages of concentration you begin to gain a sense of which kind of concentration your awareness needs right now
If it seems unstable what can you do to steady it
How do you change your perception of the breath or adjust your focus to make the mind more solid
When the meditation starts getting dry what can you do to gladden the mind
And as you're moving from one stage of concentration to the next exactly what do you let go that releases the mind from the weaker stage of concentration and allows it to settle in a stronger one
When the Buddha talks about releasing the mind at this point in the practice he's not talking about ultimate release
He's talking about the kind of release that occurs as you let go say of the directed thought and evaluation of the first jhana releasing yourself from the burden of those factors as you move into the second jhana and so on through the different levels of concentration
As you do this you begin to see how much those levels of concentration are willed
This is important
Insight can come while you're in concentration as you move from one stage to the next as you notice out of the corner of your mind's eye what you do to move from one way of experiencing the breath to the next one level of solidity to the next
And you see how much this is a produced phenomenon
This finally leads to the stages of breath meditation associated with insight
First there's insight into inconstancy both in the breath but more importantly in the mind as you see that even these stable very refreshing levels of concentration are willed
Underlying all the refreshment all the stability is a repeated willing willing willing to keep the state of concentration going
There's an element of burdensomeness there
Insight into inconstancy or impermanence has less to do with how you consume experiences than it does with how you produce them
You see all the effort that goes into producing a particular type of experience and the question becomes Is it worth it
Isn't this burdensome having to keep making making making these experiences all the time
Then the problem becomes What are you going to do to let go of this burden If you don't fabricate these states of concentration is your only choice to go back to fabricating other kinds of experiences
Or is it possible not to fabricate any experience at all
All of our normal experiences from moment to moment to moment whether in concentration or out have an element of intention an element of will
And now you've come to the point where that element of will that element of intention begins to stand out as an obvious burden
Particularly when you look around to ask Who am I producing this for
Exactly who is consuming this You come to see that your sense of who you are who this consumer is is difficult to pin down because it's all made out of the aggregates and the aggregates themselves are inconstant stressful and notself
This consumer is something produced as well
This gives rise to a quality the texts call nibbida which can be translated as disenchantment or disillusionment
Sometimes the translation gets stronger revulsion
In all cases it's a sense that you've had enough of this
You feel trapped by this process
You no longer find any satisfaction here
You want to find a way out
So you focus on letting go
According to the texts first there's a focus on dispassion then a focus on cessation then finally a focus on total relinquishment
In other words in the final stage you let go of every kind of doing every kind of volition of the producer of the consumer of the observer even of the perceptions and the thoughtfabrications that make up the path
When the pathfactors have done their job you can let them go as well
All of this takes place right at the breath at the point where the mind and the body meet at the breath
This is why the Buddha never has you totally drop the breath as your theme of meditation
Progress along the path comes simply from staying right here and growing more and more aware of what's going on all around right here
You develop a more allaround awareness not only allaround in the body but also allaround in the mind
You see through the blind spots that allowed you to consume experiences obliviously forgetting the fact that you had to produce them
It's like watching a movie  two hours of lights flashing up on a screen  and then later seeing a documentary about how they made the movie
You realize that months sometimes years of labor went into it and the question becomes Was it worth it A few brief hours of empty enjoyment and then you forget about it  despite all the work all the suffering that went into making it
So when you look at all your experiences in the same way seeing all the effort that goes into their production and asking if it's worth it That's when you really get disillusioned disenchanted when you can really let go
You let go not only of perceptions or feelings as they come and go but also of the act of creating these things
You see that this act of creating is allpervasive covers all your experiences
You're always creating either skillfully or unskillfully
There is constant production every time there's an intention every time there's a choice in the mind
This is what begins to seem oppressive this is what finally impels you to let go
You let go of the producing you let go of the creation and the lettinggo really opens things up
The mind opens to another dimension entirely one that's not made up that's not created where there's no arising or passing away
And that too is touched right here although at that moment there's no sense of breath no sense of the body no sense of the mind as a functioning creating consumer or producer
When the Buddha talks about it all his words are analogies and all the analogies are of freedom
That's about all that can be said when you try to describe it but there's a lot that can be said about how to get there
That's why the Buddha's teachings are so extensive
He goes into a lot of detail on how to get there outlining all of the steps
But if you want to know what the goal is like don't go looking for extensive descriptions
Just follow the steps and you'll know for yourself right here
Sometimes meditation is easy sometimes it's hard
But whether it's easy or hard we have to keep our minds on an even keel
When it gets easy don't get complacent
If you get complacent things start loosening up like screws loosening up in your car
After a while things begin to rattle and then they fall off
At the same time when things don't go well don't get upset
Rule number one in either case is to keep the mind on an even keel
Have a strong sense of the observer the part of the mind that's simply watching what's going on and identify as much as you can with that
Ajaan Suwat once mentioned that when he first went to stay with Ajaan Mun his mind seemed to be all over the place
He'd sit and meditate and be thinking about this thinking about that and he was afraid to tell Ajaan Mun for fear of what Ajaan Mun might say
But then he realized I'm here to learn So he went to see Ajaan Mun to see what kind of advice he would give
And Ajaan Mun's response was this Well at least you're aware of what's happening
That's better than not being aware of your distractions at all Then he quoted the Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness Being aware of a scattered mind when it's scattered counts as one of the foundations of mindfulness
Ajaan Suwat handled that lesson really well
He realized that Ajaan Mun was not praising him but simply giving him some comfort giving him some encouragement
He wasn't saying that where he was was just fine but he was reminding him that it wasn't a total disaster that the fact that he was meditating was better than not meditating at all
This often happens with people Things don't go well in their meditation and they say Well tonight's just not my night to meditate
I'd do better to stop Not meditating is not the answer
Even though it may not be pleasant sitting through a bad meditation is better than not meditating
There may be some point in the course of the meditation when you finally come to your senses when you see something in there that you didn't see before
This is why that sense of the observer is so important
In the Canon they talk about the person who's got his or her theme of meditation well in hand and the image they use is of a person sitting who's watching someone lying down or of a person standing who's watching someone sitting
In other words you place yourself a little bit above what's going on and you watch it
You step back to see what's happening from a better perspective to get a sense of where the imbalance is in your mind to watch what you're doing and to think about what you might do differently
Exactly why is the meditation going poorly
What's lacking
Ajaan Fuang once advised making a mental note of the seven factors that Ajaan Lee sets out in his Method  and then comparing your meditation with them to see what's lacking
If you've got all seven component factors then the mind is going to settle down for sure mindful solid and still
So check to see what's lacking
Are you not clear about the lengths of the breaths
Are you not clear about whether the breath is comfortable
Are you not spreading the comfortable breath sensations
Do you not have a resting place for the mind for the breath in the body
Just go down the list and if you find that any of the component factors are missing try to make up for the lack
But again to do this you need that sense of the observer the person who's watching and doesn't get upset by what's happening doesn't get carried away but just watches in total neutrality
When you can watch in this way then even a bad meditation isn't a total disaster
You take it as a challenge
Tonight's meditation may be a little bit different from last night's
Last night's went well but you start out tonight and things don't seem to be going so well
Instead of getting flustered just ask Is it a question of the body
Is something wrong with the breath
Is something wrong with your energy level
Are you too manic
Too depressed Lots of different factors can be playing a role here either factors in the mind or factors in the body
If your energy level is too low you can change the way you breathe to energize yourself
If your energy is too frenetic you can breathe in a way that calms you down
Try to be as precisely observant as possible
Many times what makes a difference in the meditation is the details the little things and if you're not paying careful attention simply going through the motions you miss a lot
You may be missing something important even though it seems minor
Try to go through every aspect very meticulously try to be very observant be close in your powers of observation
There's a word in Thai thii that's used to describe the closeness say of the teeth in your comb or the pickets in a fence  any series of things
It's also used to describe the frequency of a radio signal
The higher the frequency the closer the frequency
So you want your acts of mindfulness your acts of alertness to be very close right next to each other with no gaps
Otherwise if you leave a lot of gaps there's plenty of time for the curtains to come down in the mind
The backstage crew can change the scenery and when the curtain comes up again you're off someplace else
But if your mindfulness is close like this then they have no time to bring down the curtain
If they change the scenery you see it happening and that destroys the illusion that otherwise would carry you away
So whatever happens in the meditation always stop and take stock of Where's the observer right now  in other words the part of the mind that can simply watch and not be moved by events at all
We're so used to living in the part of the mind that's constantly pushed around by events that it almost seems traitorous to step back and be in the part that's not moved by anything at all not touched by anything at all that just watches seeing what's going on
There's always that corner in the mind
So try to locate it get familiar with it
Learn how to make that the basis of your stance so that no matter what happens you see the events clearly for what they are
You clearly see the connection between cause and effect
That puts you in a position where you can use your ingenuity to make changes adjust things here adjust things there try this try that
Even if what you try doesn't work out you've learned something
You've learned that that particular tactic doesn't work here which is something worth knowing
If you take this attitude then no matter how well the meditation goes no matter how poorly it goes it's always an opportunity to learn
One of the most difficult but necessary skills we need to develop as meditators is learning how to be judicious without being judgmental
And as a preliminary step to developing that skill it's good to reflect on the difference between the two
Being judgmental is basically an effort to get rid of something we don't understand and probably don't want to understand
We see something we don't like and we try to dismiss it to stamp it out without taking the time to understand it
We're impatient
Whatever we're being judgmental about we just want to get rid of it quickly
Being judicious however requires patience together with understanding
A judicious choice is one you've made after understanding all the options all the sides of a question
That way your choice is based on knowledge not on greed aversion or delusion
This is why the Buddha in his analysis of the four truths said that our task with the regard to the first truth  the truth of suffering or stress  is to comprehend it
All too often we treat pain in the same way we treat anything we don't like We want to get rid of it as fast as possible without taking the time to understand it
So what we're learning as we practice is how not to be judgmental about the things we don't like inside ourselves
We develop the patience and the skill we need in order to stop and take a good long look at these things so that we can deal with them judiciously so we can deal with them through understanding
We give them space so that we can watch them can understand them so that when we finally decide that they really are unskillful that we really don't want to have them going on in our mind we can get rid of them neatly effectively
The problem with being judgmental is that it's not effective
We try to stamp out things here and they go springing up someplace else as in the old movie The Thing
The Thing would go underground and suddenly spring up someplace else
If you cut off one head here one identity here its underground roots and tentacles would spring up with a new even more horrific identity someplace else
The same thing happens when we try to get rid of anything in the mind when we don't understand its roots don't understand where it's coming from
Being judicious though is more effective
It's more precise
We see what's really skillful what's really unskillful in the mind and we learn how to disentangle the two
Often our skillful and unskillful habits get entangled
The things we don't like within ourselves actually do have some good in them but we don't notice it
We focus instead on what we don't like or what we're afraid of and we end up trying to stamp it all out the good along with the bad
So this is why we meditate to step back a bit to watch things patiently so that we can see them for what they are and deal with them effectively
Our concentration practice gives us a comfortable center in our awareness where we can rest where we feel less threatened by things
When we feel less threatened and less oppressed we have the resilience to be more patient to look into what's going on in the mind and to develop the proper attitudes toward what is skillful and what isn't
This is where the four sublime attitudes come in
Back in the 's I read a book about Buddhism whose author tried to organize everything around the four noble truths but couldn't figure how the four sublime attitudes fit into the framework of the four truths
They just didn't seem to connect anyplace at all so the author ended up treating them as an entirely separate topic
But actually the four sublime attitudes underlie the whole practice
They're the reason the Buddha focused his teaching on the four noble truths
You need a sense of goodwill to be even interested in the question of trying to understand suffering because you want to find an effective way of dealing with it
You want to be rid of suffering to experience wellbeing precisely because you have goodwill for yourself and for others
So as meditators we try to use that attitude that desire as a way of developing the center we need in order to work toward that wellbeing from a position of strength
If you don't have that basic sense of goodwill you'll have a hard time trying to stir up the energy needed to master the concentration to keep with the breath to keep coming back to the breath no matter how many times you wander off
Now you may want to be at a more advanced stage than trying to rein in the mind
You want to sit down and Bung there it is the first jhana
But when it doesn't happen quickly you get frustrated
So put that frustration aside
Put away all the pride and the shadow side of pride which is the shame
Just put those things aside and remind yourself that this is the way things are this is where you are and be willing just to keep coming back coming back to stick with those simple tasks
The people who master any kind of skill are the ones who are willing to step back and master the simple steps to practice them over and over again because it's in doing the simple steps and being observant that you learn many of your most important lessons
These steps are not just a mechanical process that you have to bulldoze your way through as quickly as possible
You have to pay attention to what you're doing even when things are not going well
Pay attention to how the mind slips off pay attention to how you bring it back and you'll learn an awful lot right there
Underlying all this has to be an attitude of goodnatured goodwill
If there's a sense of frustration remember that you're here because of goodwill not for the sake of frustration not for the sake of finding some new thing to beat yourself over the head about or to be judgmental about
You're here for the sake of goodwill for the sake of giving the mind a place where it can settle in and be at ease
Develop compassion for yourself
Think of all the suffering you could be causing yourself if you weren't meditating
Think of all the suffering you might be causing others if you weren't meditating
This helps to remind you that when things aren't going all that well in the meditation it's still a lot better than most of the things that people do in their lives
It's a good beneficial use of your time
Then develop an attitude of sympathetic joy appreciating the happiness you can develop through the practice appreciating the happiness of others
Of all the four sublime attitudes sympathetic joy gets the least press
It's often the hardest to develop
There seem to be voices in our heads that resent happiness  either the happiness of other people or if other people have resented our happiness we've picked up their voices someplace and can even be distrustful of our own happiness
So we have to counter those voices by realizing that there is nothing wrong with happiness
It comes through our actions
If the happiness that someone is experiencing right now doesn't seem to be deserved in terms of his or her present actions there must be something in the past to account for it
At the same time remind yourself that an attitude of resentment doesn't help you or anyone else at all
Sometimes it seems unfair that some people are happy and others are not
But for the time being just put the question of fairness or unfairness aside
Wherever there's a sense of wellbeing in the mind learn how to appreciate that sense of wellbeing
It has its uses
Most people when they experience happiness get complacent which is one of the reasons why the quest for happiness is often branded as selfish
People enjoying power or beauty or wealth tend to get complacent and as a result of their complacency start doing very unskillful things
But if you approach happiness from the attitude of someone who's practicing as the Buddha taught there is a use for happiness
It's a quality in the mind that if properly used can bring about peace of mind
After all the concentration we're looking for in our practice has to have some basis in wellbeing
Otherwise the mind wouldn't be able to stay here
So if you learn how to use that sense of wellbeing properly without complacency it has no drawbacks
The Buddha when he was practicing austerities all those years and years in the wilderness prior to his Awakening had a very unhealthy attitude toward happiness
He was afraid of it
He was afraid of pleasure afraid that it would lead to all kinds of detrimental things in the mind
Only by reflecting carefully on the sense of pleasure in jhana and realizing that there was nothing to fear that there were no drawbacks in that type of pleasure was he able to give himself wholeheartedly to the practice of jhana
It's good to remember that whatever issues we have in the practice the Buddha went through them all
It's not that there's something especially wrong with us
These are natural human tendencies
The Buddha was a human being and had to overcome natural human tendencies too
So we're in good company
We've got his example to show that they can be overcome and his assurance that we as human beings have what it takes to do it
Finally there's the attitude of equanimity which is useful in many ways
When we're working here in the meditation and the results aren't coming as fast as we'd like equanimity teaches patience
It reminds us that the principle of action often requires that things take time
If you're working on something that takes time try to develop equanimity
That makes it easier to be patient
Realize that things don't necessarily have to go the way you want them to right away
When you're willing to admit what the situation actually is then you can actually act more effectively with it
Again this is a matter of being patient taking the time to understand what's going on
So when we work at these sublime attitudes and bring them to the meditation we find that they create a sense of patience a sense of wellbeing an ability to work at a task that takes time
Sometimes the practice seems to require that we do mindless things over and over again Just bring the mind back to the breath bring the mind back to the breath
Why
Don't ask questions right now just bring the mind back to the breath
But be observant while you do it because as you catch the mind going off you can learn some very interesting things
You come to a point where you can see the mind beginning to move and you have the choice to go with it or not
Once you catch yourself at that point then it's a lot easier to stay with the breath
You've learned an important lesson about how to read the movements of your mind
The same principle applies to how you bring the mind back when you realize it's wandered off
Do you bring it back in a judgmental way or in a more judicious way
If you find that your attitude is judgmental can you find other ways of simply bringing it back without all the extra baggage
Just very matteroffactly bring it back and leave it at that
Just this simple process in and of itself teaches you a lot of lessons about the difference between being judgmental and being judicious
In other words you try to understand you try to look for patterns so that the way you order the mind around or try to create some sense of control in here is actually effective
The reason control freaks have a bad reputation is because they're ineffective
They're judgmental they're not judicious in how they control things
Actually control isn't a bad thing
But  as with being judicious  it has to be done skillfully
And that takes time requires powers of observation
Watch what you're doing watch the results
If things don't work admit the fact and try something else
When you do this you find it easier and easier to tell the difference being judgmental and being judicious
At the same time you start getting better results from your meditation because you've taken the time to watch to observe to understand what's going on
One of the main problems in modern life is that people have so little time
When they meditate they want to cram as much of their meditation as possible into their little bits and pieces of spare time
Of course that aggravates the whole problem of being judgmental
So keep reminding yourself that meditation is a longterm project
When you have a sense of that long arc of time it's a lot easier to sit back and work very carefully at the basic steps
It's like learning any skill
If in one afternoon you want to gain all the skills you're going to need to play tennis you end up doing them all very sloppily and won't get the results you want
But if you realize that this may take time you can work on one skill at a time How do you keep your eye on the ball
How long is your backswing
Take the skill apart step by step by step and be willing to work on small things like this bit by bit by bit so that you really understand them deep down in your bones
That way when the time comes to make choices they'll be judicious choices not judgmental choices and you'll get the results you want
There's a character in Through the Looking Glass who says that he likes to think about two or three impossible things every morning before breakfast
It helps air out his mind
That's a good strategy for us as meditators  think about a couple of impossible things every day that you're going to master the concentration you're going to taste the Deathless
Of course these things strictly speaking are not impossible but a lot of voices in our minds seem to insist that they are
So it's good to think about impossibilities every now and again to change the tone of the conversation
Remind yourself that your life isn't already written in stone that you're not a slave to fate or a little nameless cog in the big machine
You're actually a doer a mover a shaper
You can shape your life in the direction you want it to go
The Buddha said that there are four types of action in the world things we like to do that give good results things we don't like to do that give bad results things we like to do that give bad results and things we don't like to do that give good results
The first two are nobrainers
Without even thinking you do the things that you like to do and give good results
There's no conflict in the mind
The same holds true for things you don't like to do that give bad results
You don't want to do them
There's no discussion
The committee is unanimous
The difficult actions are the ones you like to do but give bad results and the ones you don't like to do but give good results
The Buddha had an interesting comment on these two
He said they're a measure of a person's wisdom and discernment
He didn't say they're a measure of your willpower
You need to use discernment to do the things you don't like to do but give good results and to not do the things you like to do but give bad results
The discernment lies not only in seeing the connection between cause and effect in each case but also in outmaneuvering the committee members who just want to do what they want to do regardless
It learns to see through the blockades that the mind puts up for itself the difficulties it creates for itself and figures out how to get past them
One of the biggest difficulties we create for ourselves is our selfimage
We notice that it's difficult to do things that are good for us and easy to do things that are not good for us and we come to think that our nature is to be lazy or that the lazy side of the mind is our true self because the other side obviously takes effort
The lazy side of the mind is the one that just goes with the flow so that must be who we truly are
That's what we think but that kind of thinking is really selfdestructive
We may remember the times when we've done the right thing  when we've meditated followed the precepts lived in line with the Dhamma  but all we can think about is how much effort it took
So we say That must not truly be me
That must be somebody else
I must be the person who does things that are easy I must be lazy I must have very poor willpower That kind of attitude is a huge misunderstanding
The things that are difficult are hard for everybody
Rather than creating a selfimage about it though wise people just think How can I maneuver around this laziness
How can I maneuver around this negative attitude They experiment and try different approaches until they find what works
This is what you have to try to do in your meditation
If you find yourself up against that kind of obstacle learn to take your selfimage apart
Realize that your self is not a given the image itself is not a given
It's a pattern it's a habit this kind of selfimaging you have
If it gets in the way of what you really want then no matter how much it screams that this is your true self you have to question it
You have to take it apart
Don't believe it
No matter how much the mind may say it doesn't want to struggle that's just one part of the mind
There's another part that does want to attempt the struggle does want to have the strength does want to see things through
The lazy side has sabotaged that by saying That's not really me Well who is this lazy side
Why would you want to identify with it
You have the choice
Try to find the holes in its arguments learn how to take things apart
You have to learn to deconstruct the negative habits in the mind
The first step is to question their truth their validity
After all the Buddha said that the mind can be trained and that happiness comes from the training
If people couldn't change there'd be no point in teaching the Dhamma
There'd be no point in trying to practice
The truth of the matter though is that we all have the potential for change
Each moment is a new moment a moment with an element of freedom
Then there's the part of the mind that says Okay you can choose to do the right thing right now but it's not going to last very long You have to question that too
The best way to question it is to choose to do the right thing for at least the next moment and the next moment and the next moment and then say See
I can do it The negative side will come up with all kinds of other arguments but you have to be determined not to listen to them not to believe them
Try to figure out ways to undercut the part of the mind that does believe them
It's kind of like internal politics
There are certain voices that come screaming at you all the time and you've learned to give in to them sometimes simply because of their force
If you stop and really look at them though you see that there's not much there that you'd really like to give in to
So you have to create other voices in the mind
The path is something you create after all
It's something you put together
In technical terms it's sankhata dhamma something you put together
The question is not whether you naturally like it or not
That's one of the main common misunderstandings in American Buddhism right now this sense that you can choose whichever path you like and it won't matter because all the paths come out the same in the end
Well there are paths that work and there are paths that don't
A path you happen to like isn't necessarily going to take you where you really want to go
So there has to be an element of struggle
There has to be an element of putting something new together of not falling back into old ways
When you stop to think of it when you fall into old ways there's an element of construction you're creating that old sense of self over and over every time you give in to it
Is that the kind of self you want to create
You have the option to create something else
For many of us we don't like the responsibility because if we're responsible that means we're going to be responsible for our mistakes
So you have to ask Well so what Everybody makes mistakes
Even the Buddha made mistakes before he became the Buddha
This is where we're all coming from
This is why sanghanussati recollection of the Sangha is such a useful contemplation
Sometimes it's hard to compare yourself to the Buddha but you can compare yourself to members of the noble Sangha
People who followed the Buddha's teachings were of all kinds
There were lepers poor people rich people all kinds of people
One famous pair was Mahapandaka and Culapandaka
They were brothers
Mahapandaka was the older brother Culapandaka the younger brother
Mahapandaka was very smart Culapandaka was very dumb yet both of them became arahants
There are all kinds of people in the noble Sangha
Everyone in the noble Sangha has been where you are now in terms of the strengths and weaknesses of their minds
What made the difference is that they finally decided that they were going to use those strengths to overcome those weaknesses
And the first step was simply thinking that it could be done
If they could do it so can you
It may seem impossible but you can get used to thinking impossible things
After all the Buddha was told that it was impossible the idea that there could be a Deathless that there could be something better than what he already had
There he was wealthy educated good looking powerful
He had all the sensual objects and pleasures that anyone could imagine and he still wasn't satisfied
His family and friends said Don't kid yourself
The Deathless isn't possible
This is as good as it gets
He said Well if this is as good as it gets then life is pretty miserable because it's all going to fall apart someday So he set out to find the impossible  and he found it
We may not feel up to comparing ourselves to the Buddha but there are lots of noble disciples who must have felt at some point that true happiness must be an impossibility that for them to change must be an impossible thing
But then one day they decided to do the impossible
That's how they ended up being members of the noble Sangha
The point being of course that what we think is impossible is not necessarily impossible
We've just allowed ourselves to be limited
When I first ordained I found that the scariest part of being ordained was that so much more was demanded of me
When you live in normal society people's expectations people's standards are not all that high
It's not all that difficult to live up to them
But suddenly when there's the possibility of working for the Deathless it seems overwhelming
There's part of the mind that wants to run back to the shelter of what seems easier to handle
But of course what's easier to handle also brings on more suffering
As the Buddha said Lay life is hard
Life as a renunciate is hard But at least life as a renunciate takes you someplace really worth going to
When you finally make up your mind that you're really going to train yourself it makes that goal less of an impossibility
So try to overcome that barrier in your mind that deep down someplace says I can't do this Question it
Why would you want to believe that
Who in your mind is saying that
It's the part of the mind that doesn't want to make an effort
Do you want to identify with that part of the mind
You can if you want to but you don't have to
You have the opportunity of identifying with better voices in the mind
It's your choice
No matter how impossible it may seem it is your choice
Every time you sit down to work with the breath remember the story of the foolish inexperienced cow
The cow is in a nice meadow on the hillside has plenty of green grass and water but sees another meadow over on another hillside and starts wondering What's the grass like over there
What's the water like over there And so because she's a foolish inexperienced cow she sets out
She doesn't know how to go down the hillside cross over the ravine and go up the other hillside so she gets lost in between
She doesn't get to the other hillside and can't get back to where she originally was
This stands for the mind that once it gets into a state of concentration wonders where to go next to get something better
The trick is to learn how to stay in your meadow so the grass has a chance to grow so you have a chance to enjoy the water right where you already are
And the place where you are will develop into deeper and deeper states of concentration
This is why it's so important that before you start working with the breath here or there adjusting it here or there you find at least some spot where it's comfortable and focus on that
To make another comparison it's like starting a fire on a windy day
You have your tiny little flame so you cup it in your hands and make sure that it doesn't get blown out
At the same time you don't cut off the oxygen
You cup it in your hands just right keeping that one little flame going and after a while it will catch
Then it will spread throughout all the timber you've piled up
But it's important that you get that first little flame going
The same with the breath Find at least one little spot and stay right there for a while
It doesn't have to be a big spot just a small spot
And content yourself with that small spot for the time being
Allow it to be comfortable
After a while it will catch
Then you can start spreading that sense of comfort throughout the body because you're working from a position of strength
You're working from a position of comfort not a position of desperation or anxiety or restlessness thinking that this has to be like that or that has to be like this
Just content yourself with what you've got and allow it to grow
Content yourself at first with the small things and ultimately with practice they'll grow into a greater and greater sense of wellbeing
Remember that the word jhana comes from the verb jhayati or burning
This verb isn't used to describe just any kind of burning it's used to describe the burning of an oil lamp
When an oil lamp burns the flame is steady
It may not be a big flame but its steadiness is what helps it illuminate the room
You can read by it
If it were a flickering flame you couldn't read by it no matter how bright it was for the shadows would be jumping all over the place
But the steadiness of the oillamp flame is what enables you to read even in an otherwise dark room
It's the same with the state of your concentration
You stay steadily with one spot
The steadiness the consistency of your gaze is what allows this one spot to become really comfortable
In the beginning it may not be all that comfortable just an okay spot someplace in the body
The breath feels okay coming in feels okay coming out
No big deal nothing special
But you find if you allow yourself to settle into it that it solves a basic problem in the mind the underlying tension where it's ready to jump at a moment's notice like a cat settled in one spot but coiled up ready to spring
If you could take a picture of the mind that's what it would look like a cat coiled ready to spring
When it lands on an object part of it is ready to spring away from that object as soon as it doesn't like the object as soon as the object turns into something unpleasant because that's the way it's been dealing with objects all along
But here you allow it to settle into one little spot and let that sense of tension in the mind melt away
You melt into the object of your concentration and then let that melting sensation spread into the body all the way down to your fingers and toes
This way the meditation goes a lot better than if you're constantly fighting and figuring things out too much
You've got to learn how to apply just the right amount of pressure just the right amount of pushing not too much not too little
The more sensitive you are in your meditation the better it goes
So you've got a meadow someplace in your body
It may not be a big one but it's there
You don't sit around worrying about where the next meadow's going to be or what other meadows you have around you
Just stay right where you are and the grass will grow
The water will flow
And you find that the place where you are starts to develop
That's the kind of concentration you can really live with
In other words it's the kind of concentration you can pick up and take with you wherever you go not where you prefashion things too much and preconceive things too much and have to do this and have to do that and adjust this and adjust that and it all becomes very theoretical
Just an inner sense of allowing it to feel just right right here to feel good right here and wherever you go you're still with right here You can identify where that good feeling is and carry it with you wherever you go
That's the kind of concentration that grows
It's the kind of concentration that seeps into your life and begins to make a difference in how you think how you act and how you speak because it's there all the time
It doesn't require too much fashioning
It may require a little bit of looking after but not based on what you've read in books
It's just a sense of wellbeing right here
You've got your little spot and you take it with you
Ajaan Fuang once said that mindfulness and concentration are little tiny things but you've got to keep at them all the time
The statement sounded better in Thai because it was a pun
There's the word nit which means little but there's also the word nit  spelled differently but pronounced the same way  which means constantly
So concentration is a little tiny thing that you do constantly
When it comes from this beginning sense of wellbeing it's a lot more stable
You can maintain it a lot longer
The sense of wellbeing begins to glow throughout the body and the mind when you allow it to happen when you allow the grass to grow and the water to flow
Or in terms of the image of the flame when you give it enough space and protection to allow it to catch hold
In one of Ajaan Lee's talks he says that big things have to start from little things
Sometimes you have to content yourself with just a little bit of concentration a little comfortable spot but you stick with it constantly
You plant one banana tree and after a while it will grow and provide you with the seeds to plant more banana trees
So you take the seeds out of the banana  in Thailand they have bananas with seeds  you plant them and after a while you've got a whole banana orchard
Or even better mangoes You've got one tree that you take really good care of
You don't yet worry about planting the rest of your land
You've got your one tree and after a while it gives mangoes and bit by bit you can plant a whole orchard with the seeds you got from the fruit of the one tree
At the same time you get to eat the flesh of the mangoes
You can enjoy yourself
After all this is a part of the path the part where the Buddha explicitly mentions rapture pleasure and ease as factors of the path
If you don't have that sense of wellbeing the practice gets very dry
As you're planting the mangoes and eating their flesh you find that the path becomes a really nice place to be a good path to follow  not only because you know it's going to take you to a good place but also because it's a good path to be on while you're there
You're not going through the desert
You're going through orchards and lush countryside
If you learn to recognize which plants are food and which ones are medicine for which disease there's plenty to keep you healthy and energized all along the way
We're an impatient society
Everything has to be done fast the results have to come fast or else we lose interest quickly
It's because we're so impatient that we don't understand what patience is all about
When we're told to be patient many times we think it's a sign that we shouldn't care about the results that we don't have to be so committed to the practice that we can let things take their course whenever they want to
We think that patience means a lack of resolution a lack of dedication that you're a carefree and indifferent about when things are going to come together when the results are going to show
That's not what patience means
Patience means sticking with the causes of your practice no matter how long it takes to get the results
In other words you're resolute in doing the practice you stick with it you stay with it slow and steady
Khanti the Pali word we often translate as patience also means endurance
It means that you stick with things even when they take a long time to show results
You don't get frustrated
You remind yourself This a path that takes time
After all we're unlearning a lot of habits that we've been indulging for who knows how long
So it only stands to reason that it's going to take time to unlearn those habits
The only way to unlearn them is to actually stick with the practice to be resolute in what you're doing
This firm resolution is what's going to make the difference
Ajaan Thate talks about being patient like farmers
Those of you who've never lived on a farm even you know that farmers don't have an easy life
They work hard especially in Thailand where they don't have a lot of laborsaving devices
When the time comes to do what needs to be done they have to do it quickly
In other words when the rice grains are ready you have to harvest them quickly before the mice get to them
You have to take care of them quickly winnow the rice quickly before any late season rain comes to spoil it
So it's not a matter of being slow or casual this patience of a farmer
The patience of a farmer is the sort that knows you can't plant the rice today and expect to have the grains ripened tomorrow
It's going to take time and during that time it's going to require work
Fortunately for farmers they have experience
They know from previous years how long it takes
We however don't have that kind of experience
We're working on something new developing new habits in the mind
Sometimes we read the passages in the Satipatthana Sutta about how you can gain Awakening in seven days if you're really dedicated and we come away with unrealistic ideas about how quickly we should see results in order to deem our practice successful
This is not to say that it's not possible but just that most of the people who could get results in seven days have already gotten results and gone to nibbana
That leaves the rest of us here muddling along  which doesn't mean we should be any less dedicated in our practice
We should just realize that it's going to take time
Good things always take time
The trees with the most solid heartwood are the ones that take the longest to grow
So we do the practice focusing on what we're doing rather than getting into an internal dialogue about when the results are going to come what they're going to be like and how we can speed up the practice
Many times our efforts to speed things up actually get in the way
Our practice is pretty simple
Stay with the breath allow the mind to settle in with the breath be friends with the breath
Allow the breath to open up and get more and more gentle more and more porous so your awareness can seep into the breath
That's all you have to do
Of course we want to add things on top of that to make the results come faster but the things we add on top get in the way
So try to keep things simple
Just stay with the breath
If the mind is going to get into any dialogue engage in a dialogue about how the breath feels right now reminding yourself to stay with breath catching the mind when it's going to slip off
There's a lot of work to do even when you try to keep it simple just keeping the mind with the breath
As for whether the results are coming as quickly as you'd like or when they come whether they're going to stay as long as you'd like That's going to depend on what you're doing right here with the breath
Our desire to have the results come our desire to have them stay is not going to keep them here
The actual doing of the practice is what will make the difference
There's a passage in the texts where the Buddha talks about a hen incubating her eggs
Whether or not the hen has a desire for the eggs to hatch they're going to develop
Whether or not she has a little dialogue about how quickly she wants them to come and why aren't they coming any faster than this all those little questions that she probably doesn't have the brain to ask Our problem is that we do have brains that ask those questions and they get in the way
If you're going to ask questions ask questions about what you're doing right now
Is that you wandering off
Where are you going
Are you looking for trouble
Or are you staying right here That's all you have to ask
Just be really consistent and resolute in sticking with what you know you have to do
If you find yourself flagging learn how to give yourself pep talks encouraging yourself along the way
Do what you can to keep the mind right here as consistently and steadily as possible
Consistency is what builds up momentum
Although we'd like momentum to build up fast sometimes our minds are pretty massive and the massive minds are the ones that take time to accelerate
So try to streamline things as much as you can
Stay focused
Stay resolute in what you're doing
As for the results that's what you're patient about
Don't allow yourself to be patient or tolerant about vagrant thoughts that will pull you away from the breath
Patience relates to the process of causality in the sense that you can't push the results to appear unless the causes are right
Sometimes the causes take a while to come together
But you can rest assured that when they do they'll bring the results without your having to concoct a lot of preconceived notions about them
When they do come don't abandon the causes
When the mind finally does get a sense that it's settling in feeling comfortable don't leave the breath to focus on the comfort
The comfort's there you can think of it spreading through the body but spread it through the body by means of the breath
If you abandon the breath it's like letting the foundation of a house rot away
You like the house it's a comfortable place but if you don't look after the foundation you'll soon have no place to stay
So the focus should always be on the causes and you should apply yourself to the causes with as much commitment and resolution as you can muster
Let go of your thoughts about how long you've been practicing what the results used to be in the past
Focus on what you're doing totally on what you're doing right now
When we train the mind it's not just a question of using a meditation technique to bludgeon the mind into the present moment
If that's our approach the mind is going to start rebelling finding ways of slipping around our defenses because there are times when the meditation technique is right for the situation and times when it isn't
The times when it isn't That's when the mind is going to rebel if you singlemindedly use just that one technique and don't have other techniques or approaches up your sleeve as well
Meditation is not just a question of technique
In training the mind you have to remember there's a whole committee in there
In the past the committee has had its balance of power its likes and dislikes and the politics among the various voices in your mind
Each of them has different tricks for pushing its agenda on the rest
So just as these defilements have lots of tricks up their sleeves you as a meditator need to have lots of tricks up your sleeve too
One really basic trick is for when the mind says I've got to do this
I want to do that
I don't want to meditate You've got to ask Well why And play kind of dumb so that the mind really has to explain itself
It's like lesson number one in any journalism class If you really want to get a good interview out of people you have to play dumb ask stupid questions so that they think they have to explain things to you very carefully
And oftentimes they reveal all kinds of things they wouldn't have otherwise
It's the same with your own mind
When greed anger and delusion come into the mind they usually barge in with a lot of force and expect to push you right over
So one thing you have to do is to ask Well why
Why should we follow that
Why should we want instant gratification And there will be an of courseness to their answer the first time around
Of course you want it this way
Of course you want it that way Well why If you're persistent in being blockheaded like this all the defilements will start revealing themselves
You'll see how shabby they are
You'll be able to get around them more easily
It's like training a little child
Sometimes you have to be strict with the child other times you have to offer rewards patiently explain things
Other times you have to make up little games
In other words you have to use your full psychology with the mind
But this time around you're not using it for the purpose of deception which is what the mind ordinarily does with itself
You're using it for the purpose of truth and honesty for what's really in your own best interest
What does the wandering mind do for you
It gives a little bit of instant gratification and then that gratification goes with nothing left to show for itself
If you keep allowing this to happen where are you going to pick up the skills you'll really need when aging illness and death hit with full force
This is why the Buddha stressed the principle of heedfulness all the time
We can't just spend our time sniffing the flowers and looking at the sky
There's work to be done
When the mind is untrained it causes us a lot of unhappiness
If the mind is well trained if it's more tractable it can bring a lot of happiness our way
In order for that to happen you have to learn how to psyche yourself into the mood to meditate
Once it starts meditating and begins to see the results it gets more willing and tractable  most of the time
Then there are times it starts rebelling all over again totally irrationally
So you've got to sit down with it again work things through with it again to see exactly what issue got covered up the last time around and is only now getting exposed
This is one of the ways in which you learn a lot about your defilements
It's not that you have to wait for a totally solid concentration before you can see the defilements clearly
A lot of learning about the defilements lies in learning how to struggle with them as you bring the mind to stillness
You begin to see Oh this is how greed works this is how aversion works this is how I've fallen for this stuff before in the past
Well this time around I'm not going to fall
Sometimes it's like a battle
Other times it's more a question of learning how to work together in a way that's for your own best interests how to be a mediator a negotiator or a patient teacher
You've got to have lots of ways of relating to the different elements in your mind
The times when you can win the defilements over to your side That's when it's best
Your desire turns into a desire to practice
Your hatred turns into a hatred of the defilements
You learn how to use the energy of these things for your own true benefit
That's when you can be said to be a discerning meditator
You can't gain insight simply by following the rules
Somebody says For insight you need to do one two three four five six and seven
So you do one two three four five six seven without any thinking without any reflection on what you're doing and yet that doesn't give you any true insights
It gives you preprogrammed insights sometimes but the actual startling new understandings that can come through the meditation don't happen because you're too busy following the directions
The directions are there for you to apply to the mind and then to observe to look at what happens to reflect on what happens to make adjustments
Make the meditation your own and not just somebody else's bulldozer running through your head
After all the big issue is how you relate to yourself how you relate to the body how you relate to feelings perceptions thoughtfabrications and consciousness
That's the area where you're causing yourself suffering so that's the area where you've got to gain sensitivity and insight
Nobody else can get into your head and straighten these things out for you
You use the techniques of meditation to see what they reveal about the mind
Then you build on those lessons so that the meditation becomes your own
In Thai they have a word for practice  patibat  which also means looking after someone to attend to someone's needs
In the practice of the Dhamma you're looking after your own mind attending to your own mind's needs
It's not so much that you're learning about Buddhism
You're learning about your own mind looking after your own mind
That's when the meditation really starts showing its value
It rearranges all the power balances in the mind so that truth begins to take over wisdom begins to take over discernment begins to take charge
These become the big powers in your mind the ones in charge of any discussion
When that's the kind of mind you have it's a really good mind to live in
We live in physical places only for a certain amount of time but in our own minds all the time
Try to make the mind a good place to live so that no matter what else happens outside at least the mind is on proper terms with itself not fighting itself not doing stupid things that aren't in its own best interest
Get so that it really does know how to deal with the aggregates as they arise how to deal with pain so it doesn't turn it into suffering how to deal with pleasure so it doesn't turn it into suffering
Get so that the mind develops a basic intelligence in sorting itself out managing itself so that all your mental powers suddenly become powers you can truly put to good use
As we were saying today there are times when for your own good you don't want to be focused on the breath
There are things you have to think about things you've got to plan for things you have to ponder where you take all the powers of the mind you've trained in concentration and put them to other uses
That way the benefits of the concentration permeate your whole life everything you do
So it's an allaround training not just learning to relate to the breath but learning how to relate to everything else going on in the mind as well so that skillful thoughts take over and unskillful thoughts get left behind
That's when you can say that the meditation is a wholemind process
That's when it gives results penetrating throughout your whole life
The committee members learn how to live together
The unskillful ones get outvoted
The ones who should be in charge the skillful qualities take over and run the show in such a way that nobody suffers
The Buddha teaches that there are two sides to the path of practice the side of developing and the side of letting go
And it's important that you see the practice in both perspectives that your practice contains both sides
If you practice just letting go you'll throw away the baby with the bath water
Everything good will get thrown out because you let go of everything and leave nothing left
On the other hand if yours is just a practice of developing and working and doing you miss the things that happen on their own that happen when you do let go
So an important part of the practice is realizing which is which
This is what discernment is all about realizing which qualities in the mind are skillful the ones that are your friends and which qualities are unskillful the ones that are your enemies
The ones that are your friends are those that help make your knowledge clearer make you see things more clearly  things like mindfulness concentration and discernment together with the qualities they depend on virtue morality persistence
These are the good guys in the mind
These are the ones you have to nurture the ones you have to work at
If you don't work at them they won't come on their own
Some people think that practice is simply a matter of letting the mind go with its own flow but the flow of the mind tends to flow down just as water flows downhill which is why the mind needs to be trained
In training the mind we're not creating the unconditioned or unfabricated in the mind
It's more like polishing wood
The grain is already there in the wood but unless you polish it it doesn't shimmer it doesn't shine
If you want to see the beauty of the grain you have to polish it to work at it
You don't create the grain but the polishing is what brings out the grain already there
If you don't polish it it doesn't have the same shimmer it doesn't have the same beauty as it does when it's polished
So practicing the Buddha's path is like polishing away at the mind to see what's of real value there within the mind
That's what the mindfulness the persistence the ardency and all the other terms the Buddha uses that suggest effort and exertion That's what they're for
This is why we have rules in the practice rules in terms of the precepts rules for the monks to follow
They provide work for the mind and it's good work
They're not just makework rules
When you hold by the rules when you hold by the precepts the result is that you learn an awful lot about the mind at the same time you're making life a lot easier for yourself and the people around you
In the beginning it may seem harder to have the rules to follow but once you start living by them they open up all kinds of possibilities that weren't there before when everything was confined by the riverbanks of your old habits going along with the flow
This is why there has to be effort
This is why there has to be work in the practice
As the Buddha said right effort has four sides
Abandoning is only one of the four
There's also preventing  preventing unskillful things from arising
When unskillful things have arisen those are the things you abandon
Then there's the effort to give rise to skillful qualities and the effort to maintain them once they are there
You develop these skillful qualities and then you keep them going so that they develop to higher and higher levels
So sometimes when you're reflecting on your practice it's useful to focus on exactly what you're developing here  the good qualities like mindfulness and alertness
At other times it's helpful to focus on the things you have to let go of the things you have to work at preventing
You see right effort very easily when doing concentration practice because you have to focus on where you want the mind to be to be aware of where you don't want it to be and also to be ready to fight off anything that's going to come in to disturb your stillness of mind
When you're focusing on your meditation topic you pick it up and say that this is what you're going to focus on for the next hour
By doing this you're giving rise to skillful qualities
And then you try to keep your focus there
You've got to keep reminding yourself that this is what you're doing here
You're not just sitting you're sitting here to develop the mind
So you keep your mind on the topic you've chosen like the breath and then you work at bringing the mind back whenever it slips off bringing it here keeping it here at the same time being aware that any moment it can slip off again
This second level of awareness is what keeps you from drifting off obliviously and then coming back to the surface five minutes later suddenly realizing that you were off whoknowswhere in the mean time
If you're prepared for the fact that the mind can leave at any point then you can watch for it
In other words you're watching both the breath and the mind looking for the first sign that it's going to leap off onto something else
This is a heightened level of awareness that allows you to see the subtle stirrings in the mind
The mind is often like an inchworm standing at the edge of a leaf
Even though the inchworm's back feet may still be on this leaf its front feet are up in the air swaying around searching around for another leaf to land on
As soon as that other leaf comes boomph it's off
And so it is with the mind
If you're not aware of the fact that it's getting ready to leave the breath it comes as a real surprise when you realize that you've slipped off someplace else
But when you have a sense of when the mind is beginning to get a little bit antsy and ready to move you can do something about it
In other words you can't be complacent in the practice
Even if the mind seems to be staying with the breath sometimes it's ready to move on and you've got to have that second level of awareness going as well so that you can be aware both of the breath and of the mind together  so that you have a sense of when the mind is snug with its object and when it's beginning to get a little bit loose
If you see it loosening its grip do what you can to make it more snug
Is the breath uncomfortable
Could it be more comfortable
Could it be finer
Could it be longer shorter whatever
Explore it
The mind is telling you on its own that it isn't happy there anymore
It wants to move
So look at the quality of the breath and then turn around and look at the quality of the mind  this sense of boredom this wanting to move
What's actually causing it
Sometimes it comes from the breath and sometimes it's just a trait that arises in the mind a trait that stirs up trouble
Try to be sensitive to what's going on to see whether the problem is coming from the mind or the object the mind is focused on
If it's coming from a simple sense of boredom that's moved in let the boredom move on
You don't have to latch onto it
You don't have to identify with it saying that it's your boredom
As soon as you identify with the boredom the mind has left the breath and is on the boredom
Even though the breath may be there in the background the boredom has come into the forefront
Your inchworm has moved off to the other leaf
So if the mind is getting antsy and saying Well move
Find something new refuse for a while and see what happens
What is the strength lying behind that need to move
What's giving it power
Sometimes you'll find that it's actually a physical sensation someplace in the body that you've overlooked so work on that
Other times it's more an attitude the attitude that you picked up someplace that said Just sitting here not thinking about anything is the most stupid thing you can do
You aren't learning anything you aren't picking up anything new
Your mind isn't being exercised Ask yourself Where is that voice coming from It's coming from somebody who never meditated who didn't understand all the good things that come from being still in the present moment
Only when the mind is really still right here can it begin to resonate with the body
When there's a resonance between the breath and the mind it gives rise to a much greater sense of wholeness and oneness
This is the positive aspect of the practice that you want to focus on because if the mind is one place and the body someplace else there's no resonance
It's as if they were singing two completely different tunes
But if you get them together it's like having one chord with lots of overtones
And then you come to appreciate how when there's this sense of resonance between the body and mind you begin to open up
You begin to see things in the mind and in the body that you didn't see before
It's healing for both the body and the mind
It's also eyeopening in the sense that the more subtle things that were there suddenly appear
You gain a sense of appreciation for this that this is a very important thing to do with the mind
The mind needs this for its own sanity for its own health
So when the mind starts getting antsy and wants to move around and think about things and analyze things and it starts telling you that you're stupid to sit here and not think remind it that not everything has to be thought through not everything has to be analyzed
Some things have to be experienced directly
When you analyze things where does the analysis come from
It comes mostly from your old ignorant ways of thinking
And what we're doing as we get the mind to settle down is to put those ways of thinking and those ways of dividing up reality aside
For a state of concentration you want to get the mind together with the body and to foster a sense of oneness a sense of resonance between the two
Once they've had chance to be together then you can begin to see how things begin to separate out on their own
And this is a totally different way of separating
It's not the kind of separating that comes from ordinary thinking
It's actually seeing that even though the body and mind are resonating they are two separate things like two tuning forks
You strike one tuning fork and put another one next to it
The second tuning fork picks up the resonance from the first one but they're two separate forks
Once the body and mind have had a chance to resonate for a while you begin to see that they are two separate things
Knowing is different from the object of knowing
The body is the object the mind is the knowing
And this way when they separate out they don't separate out because you have some preconceived notion of how they should be
You watch it actually happening
It's a natural occurrence
It's like the grain of the wood When you polish it the grain appears but not because you designed the grain
It's been there in the wood all along
The same with your meditation You're simply giving yourself a chance really to see your experience of body and mind for what it is instead of coming in with preconceived notions about how things should get divided up how things should be analyzed
There's a natural separation line between name and form body and mind
They come together but they're separate things
When you learn how to allow them to separate out that's when real discernment comes in
This is why the discernment that comes with concentration is a special kind of discernment
It's not your ordinary mode of thinking
It comes from giving things a chance to settle down
Like a chemical mixture If everything gets jostled around the two chemicals are always mixed together and you can't tell that there are two in there
There seems to be just the one mixture
But if you let the mixture sit for a while the chemicals will separate
The lighter one will rise to the top the heavier one will settle to the bottom
You'll see at a glance that there actually are two separate chemicals there
They separate themselves out on their own because you've created the conditions that allow them to act on their own
The same with the mind A lot of things begin to separate out on their own if you simply give the mind a chance to be still enough and you're watchful enough
If you're not watchful the stillness drifts off into drowsiness
So you need the mindfulness together with the stillness for this to happen properly
With the stillness you're letting go of a lot of nervous activity you're letting go of a lot of unskillful things in the mind
With the mindfulness you're developing the skillful qualities you need to see clearly
This is how the lettinggo and the knowing come together
When the Buddha discusses the four noble truths he talks about the duty appropriate to each
Your duty with regard to craving the second noble truth is to let it go
Then there's a third noble truth which is the cessation of suffering
And what is that
It's the lettinggo of the craving at the same time you're aware of what's happening
So the task appropriate to the cessation of suffering is a double process knowing together with the lettinggo and this makes all the difference in the world
Most of the time when we let go of craving we're not aware of what's happening so it's nothing special
It's just the ordinary way of life as we move from one craving to another
But when the mind has been still enough and the mindfulness welldeveloped enough then when the craving gets abandoned you're aware of it as well and this opens up something new in the mind
This is why the factors of the noble eightfold path fall into two types the ones that develop and the ones that let go
The ones that let go abandon all the mind's unskillful activities that obscure knowledge
The developing ones are the ones that enable you to see clearly right view right mindfulness right concentration
They all work at awareness so that you can know clearly what's actually happening in the present moment
So there are these two sides to the practice and you want to make sure that you're engaged in both sides for your practice to be complete
It's not just a practice of relaxing and letting go and it's not just a practice of staying up all night and meditating ten hours at a stretch really pushing pushing pushing yourself
You have to find a balance between clear knowing and effort a balance between developing and letting go knowing which is which and how to get that balance just right
That's the skill of the practice
And when you have both sides of the practice perfectly balanced they come together and are no longer separate
You've got the mind in a perfectly clear state where the knowing and the lettinggo become almost the same thing
But the balance doesn't occur without practice
You may ask Why do we keep practicing
When do we get to perform Well we're practicing for the time when ultimately we can master these things
When the practice gets balanced the path performs and that's when things really open up in the mind
The Buddha often compared himself to a doctor healing the diseases of the hearts and minds of his listeners
Now we normally think about heart disease as meaning hardening of the arteries and mental disease as insanity but he said the real diseases of the heart the real diseases of the mind are three passion aversion and delusion
They burn like a fever in the heart a fever in the body
And the reason he taught about these diseases is because there is a way to gain release from them
If they were impossible to cure he wouldn't have bothered to teach
So we have to learn to take his teaching as treatment for our own hearts our own minds
That's when we're using them properly
Treating these kinds of diseases is in some way similar to treating ordinary mental diseases ordinary bodily diseases
And in some ways it's different
With ordinary diseases the doctor can give you medicine you take the medicine and that's it
With the Buddha's treatment though you are the one who administers the cure
You simply learn about the cure from the Buddha
As he says he simply points out the way but you're the one who actually has to carry through and administer the treatment to yourself
So you're both the doctor and the patient  you're a student doctor
You're learning the treatment
Sometimes the symptoms of the disease don't quite match what's printed in the texts don't quite sound like the things you've heard people say That's why you need an experienced doctor to help you along
But also you need your own ingenuity because there are times as in a hospital when the experienced doctor isn't on call
Sometimes a really drastic case comes in and there's nobody but interns around
The interns have to figure out what to do on their own
So it's not simply a matter of following what's in the books
You also have to learn how to apply the teachings to all kinds of unexpected situations to learn which teachings are the basic principles and which are secondary details
The similarity between the two types of diseases  outer diseases and inner diseases  is that in both cases there are two kinds of sources for the disease inner and outer
Some bodily diseases you can blame on germs
They come in from the outside and they wreak a lot of havoc in the body
But on a more basic level the question is Why do the germs take over  because sometimes you have enough resistance to fight them off and sometimes you don't
In this sense the basic cause comes from inside from your inner lack of resistance
The same holds true with the mind
Many times we blame problems within the mind on things from outside  what other people do what other people say the general atmosphere around us the values we grew up with the things we learned as children
And these do play a role but the most important problem is what comes from the mind
Why is it susceptible to those influences
After all you find some people staying in a certain environment and they're perfectly okay they pick up no negative influences while other people get into the same environment and come out all warped
Two kids growing up in the same family hear the same lessons from their parents but take away totally different messages
This is because of what you bring to life when you come what weak points and what strong points are already there in the mind
So you have to focus in on the mind as the main problem
You can't go blaming things outside
If the mind had really good powers of resistance a really good immune system nothing could stir it to passion nothing could stir it to anger nothing could stir it to delusion
Fortunately you can train the mind develop that immunity
That's the kind of mind you want to develop
That's the mind that the Buddha defines as health
This is why the training focuses inside looking at your own mind and seeing where things set it off
When germs come into the mind where is your resistance strong and where is it weak
What is your line of resistance
This is what we're developing in the meditation lines of resistance
Concentration virtue generosity these are all our first lines of resistance against the invading germs
Sitting here with our eyes closed instead of trying to change things outside we change things inside
Some people think that the practice is simply a matter of learning how to accept everything just as it is
Well some things you do accept and some you don't
You learn to accept the fact that the outside world is going to be the way it is
There are always going to be external problems
And the phrase outside world here doesn't refer just to other people
Your own body is part of the outside world from the point of view of the Dhamma
And the body contains aging illness and death
That's the nature of the body
You can't change that but what you can change is the mind
This is where you can't just sit around and be equanimous accepting the mind as it is
You've got to accept that the mind has the potential to change
So you've really got to stir yourself to look into the mind to see which potentials need to be weakened and which ones need to be enhanced
This is where right effort comes in  when you learn how to distinguish skillful and unskillful states in the mind
The skillful ones are the ones that can keep up your resistance against greed anger and delusion
The unskillful ones are the ones that give in the ones that are susceptible to infection
And because delusion is part of the problem the first thing you need to learn how to do is to distinguish which states are skillful and which ones aren't
This is why you need instructions
This is why you need a technique in your meditation  you've got a focal point the breath as a measuring stick for the movements of the mind
You watch the breath as it's coming in and going out and you notice when you get pulled away from it That's a good measure of when the mind is being influenced by something
If you don't have this kind of focus it's hard to tell when anger comes and when it goes
There's nothing to measure it against
Like the clouds in the sky You can't tell how fast they're moving unless you've got something still and solid on the ground to use as your reference point  a tree a telephone pole
If you focus on that one point then you can see whether the clouds are moving north or south and how fast they're going in relation to that point
It's the same with the mind once it has a focal point like the breath As soon as your attention gets pulled away from the breath you know something has happened
Then you check to see what it is
In the beginning you simply notice what it is and  realizing that if you follow that you're drifting away from where you want to be  you bring the mind back
This is on the basic level of just getting the mind to learn how to be still for a while how to stick with your original intention to stay centered and how to settle down
But as your powers of concentration your powers of mindfulness get stronger and stronger you find you can actually investigate what's pulling you away  or what would have pulled you away if you hadn't caught yourself in time
This is when your powers of resistance are getting stronger when you begin to see exactly how you get hooked to that pull
It's as if your mind is covered with Velcro hooks and you investigate to see what comes along and ends up stuck in them
Actually those little Velcro hooks are choices
They're not necessary
You don't have to get stuck on things
There is actually a place in the mind where you're making a choice to latch on
Only when things get really still in the mind and your awareness is really clear can you see that choice as an act  that you made the choice to lower your resistance and latch onto the germs when you didn't have to
That's where you can let go
One you see the drawbacks of the diseases caused by the germs and two you realize that you don't really have to come down with those diseases
They're not really necessary
When you can identify the particular disease patterns they will never be necessary
They seem necessary only when you can't conceive of anything else
Things have to be that way or so the mind tells itself
If the mind had to be that way there would be no purpose in meditating there would be no purpose in the Buddha's teaching
He could have sat around under the Bodhi tree for the rest of his life and just enjoyed the bliss of Awakening
He realized though that teaching would serve a purpose
So that's what we're doing  we're carrying out that purpose putting his teachings into practice so we can gain the results that he wanted to see from the effort he put into his teaching
All this comes under right effort realizing when you have skillful states realizing when you have unskillful states and being determined that once an unskillful state has arisen you're not going to feed it you're not going to follow along with it
Some people have problems with this especially with the issue of struggling or effort or having a goal
The problem though doesn't lie with effort or goals in and of themselves
It lies with your attitude toward them
You need to have a healthy attitude toward this struggle
You need to have a healthy attitude toward the effort toward the goal because the goal is what gives you a direction in life
Without goals life would just be floundering around like fish flopping around in a puddle
So you need to have a direction
You realize that maybe this is a bigger task than other tasks you have taken on so you don't berate yourself for not getting to the goal immediately or not catching on right away
You learn through experience what your pace is and you stick to it
Sometimes you push yourself a little too hard in order to know what it means to push yourself too hard and then you let off
And you find that you tend to vacillate back and forth between pushing too hard and not pushing enough but as long as you're sensitive to this fact you begin to get a better and better sense of what just right is
When the Buddha talks about the Middle Way it's not necessarily what our preconceived notions of the Middle Way are
You have to test them
And the effort required is not blind effort
Right effort involves using your eyes knowing what's skillful in the mind what's unskillful being determined to let go of anything unskillful that arises in the mind and trying to prevent more unskillful things from arising in the mind
At the same time you try to realize when skillful qualities have appeared
You try to maintain them develop them make them strong
So there's both the lettinggo and the developing and the function of discernment is to tell when which is appropriate
You have to listen very carefully to what's happening in the mind watch things in the mind be observant
This is why a lot of the meditation instructions throw things back on you on your own powers of observation because only by developing those powers can you develop the discernment you're going to need
Sometimes in the Buddha's teachings it's almost as if he purposely leaves a few blanks doesn't explain everything leaves things for you to figure out on your own because if everything were handed to you on a platter where would your discernment get engaged
How would it develop
You'd be a restaurant critic picky and choosy about what's served to you but totally ignorant about how to fix the food yourself
So sometimes the Buddha gives the teachings as riddles and your willingness to try to figure them out make mistakes come back and try again is what will make you grow
This is the healthy attitude toward right effort realizing that sometimes it's going to take a lot of persistence a lot of endurance a lot of tenacity
But not always
There are times when it gets very easy and enjoyable and everything seems to flow
So you learn to adjust your effort so that it's just right for whatever the situation
That's when right effort is really right when you start getting your own sense of how things vary and how things need to be adjusted
That's when the practice becomes more and more your own practice the practice you've made your own not just something that somebody outside is telling you to do
And this is where you turn from a student doctor into an experienced doctor
Luckily with the diseases of the mind it's not the case that your patients are all going to die
This particular patient the mind keeps coming back
So there's room for mistakes  but you can't be too complacent
After all you're the patient
You're the one who suffers from the mistakes
Some of those mistakes can lead you down a path that ends up far away and it'll be a long time before you find your way back
So again you need an attitude of balance You don't berate yourself for not attaining the goal but at the same time you don't get complacent
Much of the practice is this one issue figuring out where that balance is
Other people can help give you pointers but you yourself really have to listen to your own practice look carefully at the results as they come  because this ability to see cause and effect in the mind is what lies at the essence of discernment and discernment is what makes all the difference
It's the ultimate medicine in the Buddha's medicine box  and yet he can't just hand it to you
It's like an herbal medicine that you have to grow yourself
He describes it and tells you how to find it how to grow it and then how to take it
So get used to this image that you're both the doctor and the patient and learn to have a very strong sense of the doctor looking after the patient
Don't identify totally with the patient because if you do it's hard to see a cure hard to see even the possibility of a cure
But if you have the attitude of the doctor there has to be a notion of what health is and how to recognize illness whenever it shows its face
At the same time you have to develop the ability to step back and look at the whole situation to figure out the cure
Here's another image Ann Landers
People who write letters to Ann Landers are so thoroughly immersed in their problems that they can't step back
They have trouble even formulating a letter
But all Ann Landers has to do is read the letter once it's formulated and usually she can give an answer right off the bat because she's not immersed in the situation
From her perspective the issue is already formulated
Her job is not all that hard
You'll find your own practice gets a lot easier too when you can step back to recognize the problem and articulate it to yourself
Once the problem is clearly delineated you've got your answer
As in the case of the doctor the real difficulty lies in learning to diagnose the illness
Once you've got the diagnosis right the choice of medicine is easy
So the first step is learning how to be the doctor
Identify at least part of your mind as the doctor
This is the part you want to train
And the funny thing is that in training the doctor the patient gets cured
The Dhamma is like medicine
You can see this from the way the Buddha teaches
He starts off with the four noble truths which are very much like an analysis of how to care for a disease
In his case he's offering a cure for the basic disease of the mind the suffering that comes from craving and ignorance
That's what we've got to cure
So he analyzes the symptoms of the disease diagnoses it explains its causation discusses what it's like to be free of the disease and then shows a path of treatment that leads to the end of the disease to a state of health
It's important that we keep this in mind as we practice here together We're working on the diseases of our own minds
Each of us has illnesses
And although the basic causes of illness are the same  craving ignorance  our cravings are different
Our particular brands of ignorance are different as well
This is why we have to make allowances for each other because different people have to undergo different courses of treatment
It's like going into a hospital
It's not the case that everyone in the hospital has the same diseases
Some people have cancer some have heart diseases some have liver diseases
Some people have diseases from eating too much some from eating too little
There are all kinds of different diseases in the hospital
And it's the same way here in the monastery
We each have our own particular diseases
And our duty here is to take care of our own diseases without picking up diseases from other people  and at the same time not getting upset that somebody else is taking a different kind of medicine than you are
Each of us has his or her own diseases requiring specific kinds of medicine
Some medicines are bitter and unpleasant to take other medicines are a lot easier to swallow
So each of us has his or her own course of treatment
It's important that we pay attention to our own course of treatment and not worry about the treatments of others
If some people don't seem to be recovering from their diseases as fast as you would like them to well again it's their disease
Try to keep this is mind
Remember what Ajaan Lee says When you look inside it's Dhamma
When you look outside it's the world And it's not just that you're a detached observer looking at the world
Your whole mind becomes the world as well when you start focusing outside
This person does that this person does this That's the world even if you use the categories of the Dhamma to judge the person
You've taken the Dhamma and you've turned it into the world
So you've got to keep your gaze focused inside
In other words when you get upset at someone else what is this quality of being upset
Focus on that
The events in the mind are the important issues
Those are the things causing your own illness
Do you want to cure your own illness or to aggravate it
Keep this question in mind as you practice
As we live together and practice together we see each other a lot but try to make that fact have the least possible impact on the mind
Try to turn your gaze inside
Even when you're looking outside you want your focus to be inside How is your mind reacting to this
How is your mind reacting to that This is part of restraint of the senses
Several years back we had an elderly visitor from Thailand who was very serious about practicing restraint of the senses
She kept her eyes down and hardly talked to anyone
And then she overheard other people talking about how stuck up and unfriendly she was because she was trying to be so quiet and unresponsive
So she came to me to complain about how other people were not respecting her restraint of the senses
Of course what kind of restraint is that getting upset over what other people are saying about you
Restraint is purely an internal matter
As you go through life you have to hear things see things taste things touch things think about things
The point of restraint is that you don't make those things the main focus
The process of how the mind reacts to the seeing how it directs the seeing and so on with the other senses that should be your focus
If issues come up and aggravate the illness in the mind how are you going to deal with it
The Buddha laid out a lot of medicines for us to choose
The chant on the parts of the body That's basically a reminder of his medicines for dealing with attachment to your own body and lust for the bodies of others
The chant on the four sublime attitudes That's for dealing with not only anger but also with resentment jealousy any cruel intentions in your mind
Many times you can get worked up about things totally beyond your control That's when you should reflect on the principle of kamma to develop equanimity
There are antidotes for all these diseases and our duty here is to use them
Because after all who's suffering because of our diseases
Other people may be suffering to some extent but we're really suffering
We suffer very little from what other people do and a great deal from the lack of skill in our own minds
In the Canon the Buddha talks about how people should not give in to craving and conceit and when we look at other people it's obvious that he's right
Their craving and conceit are obviously causing trouble
The trick though lies in seeing our own craving our own conceit
If you find yourself using these teachings to judge other people stop and ask yourself Well wait a second
Am I the National Bureau of Standards
Then turn around and look at yourself
What about your own craving
You want things to be a certain way and then they aren't the way you want them to be
This is a very important lesson I learned with Ajaan Fuang
He always seemed to fall sick at times that were extremely inconvenient for me
I'd have some project going on around the monastery and it always seemed that just when I was really getting into the project he got sick and I had to drop everything to look after him
I began to notice the sense of frustration growing within me and I finally realized Hey wait a minute
If I let go of the desire to finish that project things go a lot more easily At the same time if I let go of my desire for him to care for his illness in the way I thought best it made things a lot easier around the monastery
Especially for me and  probably in no small measure  for him as well
When you start running into that reality realize Your cravings are the things that are making you suffer so those are the things you have to let go of
When you let go you find you can live with all kinds of situations
Not that you become lazy or apathetic just letting things be whatever way they want to be
You become selective Where can you make a difference
Where can you not make a difference
Where is your craving helping you in the path
Where is it getting in the way
You have to learn how to be selective how to be skillful in where you direct your wants where you direct your aspirations
Again the problem is not outside
The problem is inside
We do suffer to some extent from things outside but the reason we suffer is because things inside are unskillful
That's what we have to work on
Once the inside problem is dealt with the outside problems don't touch us at all
Conceit is another troublemaker
Conceit is not just puffing yourself up and thinking you're better than other people
According to the Buddha it's the tendency of the mind to compare itself with others
Even if you say I'm worse than that other person or I'm equal to that other person that's conceit
There's an I there the Imaking minemaking and tendency to conceit That's a lot of the problem right there a major cause of disease
The Buddha describes the sense of I am as the underlying cause for the mind's tendency to proliferate ideas its tendency to make differentiations to complicate things and all the categories and conflicts that come from those complications These all start with the I am The basic verbalization of craving also starts with I am It then goes on to I was I will be or Am I
Am I not and all the other questions that come up from putting the I and the am together and then identifying with them
You start comparing this I am to other people's to your sense of what they are
So either you're better than they are or you're equal or you're worse
Whichever side you come down on though it's just a big troublemaker all around
Just keep remembering Other people's diseases are their diseases
They've got to cure them
They've got to take their medicine
Your diseases are yours  your prime responsibility
And if the person next to you in the hospital room is not taking his medicine properly that's his problem
You can be helpful and encourage him but there comes a time when you have to say Okay that's his issue
I've got my own disease to take care of This way it's a lot easier for all of us
When these attachments cravings and conceits don't get in the way then any place you practice becomes an ideal place to practice
People often ask Where is the best place to practice And the answer is Right here in the hereandnow It's actually the only place you can practice
But you can do things to make the hereandnow a better place to practice wherever you are both for yourself and for the people around you
It's dependent not so much on changing things outside as it is on changing your inner attitudes
That way the place where we're practicing becomes a good place to practice for us all
When you read Ajaan Lee's autobiography you notice the number of times he made vows vowing to sit all night vowing to meditate so many hours vowing to do this vowing to do without that
The word for vow in Thai is adhithaan which is also translated as determination
You make up your mind you're determined to do something
Making determinations like this gives strength to your practice
Otherwise you just sit and meditate for a while and when the going gets tough  Well that's enough for today You don't push your limits
As a result you don't get a taste of what lies outside the limits of your expectations
As the Buddha said the purpose of the practice is to see what you've never seen before realize what you've never realized before and many of these things you've never seen or realized lie outside the limits of your imagination
In order to see them you have to learn how to push yourself more than you might imagine
But this has to be done with skill
That's why the Buddha said that a good determination involves four qualities discernment truth relinquishment and peace
Discernment here means two things
To begin with it means setting wise goals learning how to recognize a useful vow one that aims at something really worthwhile one in which you're pushing yourself not too little not too much  something that's outside your ordinary expectations but not so far that you come crashing down
Second it means clearly understanding what you have to do to achieve your goals  what causes will lead to the results you want
It's important to have specific goals in your practice That's something many people miss
They think that having a goal means you're constantly depressed about not reaching your goal
Well that's not how to relate to goals in a skillful way
You set a goal that's realistic but challenging you figure out what causes what actions will get you there and then you focus on those actions
You can't practice without a goal for otherwise everything would fall apart and you yourself would start wondering why you're here why you're meditating and why you aren't out sitting on the beach
The trick lies in learning how to relate to your goal in an intelligent way
That's part of the discernment that forms this factor in determination
Sometimes we're taught not to have goals in the meditation
Usually that's on meditation retreats
You're in a highpressure environment you have a limited amount of time and so you push push push
Without any discernment you can do yourself harm
So in a shortterm setting like that it's wise not to focus on any particular results you want to brag about after the retreat I spent two weeks at that monastery or one week at that meditation center and I came back with the first jhana Like a trophy
You usually end up  if you get something that you can call jhana when you go home  with an unripe mango
You've got a green mango on your tree and someone comes along and says A ripe mango is yellow and it's soft So you squeeze your mango to make it soft and paint it yellow to make it look ripe but it's not a ripe mango
It's a ruined mango
A lot of readymix jhana is just like that
You read that it's supposed to be like this composed of this factor and that and so you add a little of this and a pinch of that and presto
 there you are jhana
When you set time limits like that for yourself you end up with whoknowswhat
Now when you're not on a retreat when you're looking at meditation as a daily part of your life you need to have overall longrange goals
Otherwise your practice loses focus and the practice of daily life becomes a fancy word for plain old daily life
You need to keep reminding yourself about why you're meditating about what the meditation really means in the longterm arc of your future
You want true happiness dependable happiness the sort of happiness that will stay with you through thick and thin
Then once you're clear about your goal you have to use discernment both to figure out how to get there and to psyche yourself up for staying on the path you've picked
What this often means is turning your attention from the goal and focusing it on the steps that will take you there
You focus more on what you do than on the results you hope to get from what you do
For example you can't sit here and say I'm going to get the first jhana or the second jhana or whatever but you can say I'm going to stay here and be mindful of every breath for the next whole hour
Each and every one That's focusing on the causes
Whether or not you reach a particular level of jhana lies in the area of results
Without the causes the results won't come so discernment focuses on the causes and lets the causes take care of the results
The next element  once you've decided on your goal and how you're going to approach it  is to stay true to that determination
In other words you really stick to your vow and don't suddenly change your mind in midcourse
The only good reason for changing your mind would be if you find that you're doing serious damage to yourself
Then you might want to reconsider the situation
Otherwise if it's just an inconvenience or a hardship you stick with your determination no matter what
This is your way of learning how to trust yourself
Truthfulness sacca is not simply a matter of speaking the truth
It also means sticking truly to what you've made up your mind to do
If you don't stick truly to that you've become a traitor to yourself
And when you can't rely on yourself who will you rely on
You go hoping for someone else to rely on but they can't do the work you have to do
So you learn to be true to your determination
The third element in a good determination is relinquishment
In other words while you're being true to your determination there are things you're going to have to give up
There's a verse in the Dhammapada If you see a greater happiness that comes from forsaking a lesser happiness be willing to forsake the lesser happiness for the sake of the greater one
A famous Pali scholar once insisted that that couldn't possibly be the meaning of the verse because it was so obvious
But if you look at people's lives it's not obvious at all
Many times they give up longterm happiness for a quick fix
If you take the easy way out for a day then you take the easy way out for the next day and the next and your longterm goal just never materializes
The momentum never builds up
The things that really pull you off the path are those that look good and promise a quicker gratification
But once you've got the results of the quick fix many times you don't get any gratification at all  it was all an illusion
Or you get a little bit but it wasn't worth it
That's one of the reasons why the Buddha presents those strong images for the drawbacks of sensual pleasure
A drop of honey on a knife blade
A burning torch you're holding in front of you upwind as you're running
A little piece of flesh that a small bird has in its claws while other bigger birds are coming to steal it and they're willing to kill the smaller bird if they don't get it
These are pretty harsh images but they're harsh on purpose for when the mind gets fixated on a sensual pleasure it doesn't want to listen to anybody
It's not going to be swayed by soft gentle images
You have to keep reminding yourself in strong terms that if you really look at sensual pleasures there's nothing much no true gratification and a lot of true danger
I once had a dream that depicted the sensual realm as nothing more than two types of people dreamers and criminals
Some people sit around dreaming about what they'd like while others decide that they won't take no for an answer they're going to get what they want even if they have to get violent
It's a very unpleasant world to be in
That's the way the sensual realm really is but we tend to forget because we're so wrapped up in our dreams wrapped up in our desires that we don't look at the reality of what we do in the process of our dreaming what we do in the process of trying to get what we want
So learn to reflect often on these things
This is one of the reasons why your determination should start out with discernment
You have to use discernment all the way along the path to remind yourself that the lesser pleasures really are lesser
They're not worth the effort and especially not worth what you're giving up in terms of a larger pleasure a larger happiness a larger wellbeing
The fourth and final element in a proper determination is peace
You try to keep the mind calm in the course of working toward your goal
Don't get worked up over the difficulties don't get worked up over the things you're having to give up don't get worked up about how much time you've already spent on the path and how much remains to be covered
Focus calmly on the step right ahead of you and try to keep an even temper throughout
The second meaning of peace here is that once you've reached the goal there should be a steady element of calm
If you've reached the goal and the mind is still all stirred up it's a sign that you chose the wrong goal
There should be a deeper pacification a deeper calmness that sets in once you've attained the goal
As the Buddha said it's normal that while you're working toward a goal there's going to be certain amount of dissatisfaction
You want something but you're not there yet
Some people advise that in order to get rid of that dissatisfaction you should just lower your standards
Don't have goals
But that's really selling yourself short and it's a very unskillful way of getting rid of that sense of dissatisfaction
The skillful way is to do what has to be done step by step to arrive at the goal to get what you want
Then the dissatisfaction is replaced if it's a proper goal by peace
So as you look at the goals in your meditation in your life try to keep these four qualities in mind discernment truthfulness relinquishment and peace
Be discerning in your choice of a goal and the path that you're going to follow to get there
Once you've made up your mind that it's a wise goal be true to your determination don't be a traitor to it
Be willing to give up the lesser pleasures that get in the way and try to keep your mind on an even keel as you work toward your goal
That way you find that you stretch yourself  not to the point of breaking but in ways that allow you to grow
As you learn to push yourself a little bit more a little bit more a little bit more than you thought possible you find that each little bit becomes quite a lot
It all adds up and you find that the practice can take you to places that you otherwise wouldn't have imagined
It's always interesting to notice which words disappear from common usage
We have them in our passive vocabulary we know their meaning but they tend to disappear from daytoday conversation  which usually means that they've disappeared from the way we shape our lives
Several years back I gave a Dhamma talk in which I happened to mention the word dignity After the talk a woman in the audience who had emigrated from Russia came to me and said that she had never heard Americans use the word dignity before
She had learned it when she studied English over in Russia but she never heard people use it here
And it's good to think about why
Where and why did it disappear
I think the reason is related to another word that tends to disappear from common usage and that's restraint foregoing certain pleasures not because we have to but because they go against our principles
The opportunity to indulge in those pleasures may be there but we learn how to say No
This of course is related to another word we tend not to use and that's temptation Even though we don't have to believe that there's someone out there actively tempting us there are things all around us that do that tempt us to give in to our desires
And an important part of our practice is that we exercise restraint
As the Buddha says restraint over the eyes ears nose tongue and body is good as is restraint in terms of our actions our speech and our thoughts
What's good about it
Well for one thing if we don't have any restraint we don't have any control over where our lives are going
Anything that comes across our way immediately pulls us in its wake
We don't have any strong sense of priorities of what's really worthwhile of what's not worthwhile of the pleasures we'd gain by saying No to other pleasures
How do we rank the pleasures in our lives the happiness the sense of wellbeing that we get in various ways
Actually there's a sense of wellbeing that comes from being totally independent from not needing other things
If that state of wellbeing doesn't have a chance to develop if we're constantly giving in to our impulse to do this or take that we'll never know what that wellbeing is
At the same time we'll never know our impulses
When you simply ride with your impulses you don't understand their force
They're like the currents below the surface of a river Only if you try to build a dam across the river will you detect those currents and appreciate how strong they are
So we have to look at what's important in life develop a strong sense of priorities and be willing to say No to the currents that would lead to less worthwhile pleasures
As the Buddha said if you see a greater pleasure that comes from forsaking a lesser pleasure well be willing to forsake that lesser pleasure for the sake of the greater one
Sounds like a nobrainer but if you look at the way most people live they don't think in those terms
They want everything that comes their way
They want to have their cake and enlightenment too to win at chess without sacrificing a single pawn
Even when they meditate their purpose in developing mindfulness is for the sake of an even more intense appreciation of the experience of every moment in life
That's something you never see in the Buddha's teachings though
His theme is always that you have to let go of this in order to gain that give this up in order to arrive at that
There's always a tradeoff
So we're not practicing for a more intense appreciation of sights scents sounds tastes smells tactile sensations
We're practicing to realize that the mind doesn't need to depend on those things and that it's healthier without that dependency
Even though the body requires a modicum of the requisites of food clothing shelter and medicine there's an awful lot that it doesn't need
And because our use of the requisites involves suffering both for ourselves and for everyone else involved in their production we owe it to ourselves and to others to keep pushing the envelope in the direction of restraint to give up the things we don't need so as to be as unburdensome as possible
This is why so much of the training lies in learning to put this aside put that aside give this up give that up
Developing this habit on the external level makes us reflect on the internal level What attachments in the mind would be good to give up
Could our mind survive perfectly well without the things we tend to crave
The Buddha's answer is Yes
In fact it's better off that way
Still a very strong part of our mind resists that teaching
We may give up things for a certain while but our attitude is often I gave up this for a certain while I gave up that for so long now I can get back to it That's a typical pattern
Like with the Rains retreat that's winding down right now People tend to make a lot of vows  Well I'll give up cigarettes for the Rains I'll give up newspapers for the Rains  but as soon as the Rains is over they go back to their old ways
They've missed the whole point which is that if you can survive for three months without those things you can probably survive for the rest of the year without them as well
Hopefully during those three months you've seen the advantages of giving them up
So you can decide Okay I'm going to continue giving them up Even though you may have the opportunity to say Yes to your desires you remind yourself to say No
This principle of restraint of giving things up applies to every step of the path
When you're practicing generosity you have to give up things that you might enjoy
You realize the benefits that come from saying No to your greed and allowing other people to enjoy what you're giving away
For example when you're living in a group there's food to be shared by all
If you give up some of your share so others can enjoy a bigger share you're creating a better atmosphere in the group
So you have to ask yourself Is the gratification I get from taking this thing worth the trade And you begin to see the advantages of giving up on this level
This is where dignity begins to come back into our lives We're not just digestive tracts
We're not slaves to our desires
We're their masters
The same with the precepts There may be things that you'd like to do or say but you don't do them you don't say them because they're dishonest or hurtful
Even if you feel that you might get ahead or gain some advantage by saying them you don't say them because they go against your principles
You find that you don't stoop to the activities that you used to and there's a sense of honor a sense of dignity that comes with that that you can't be bought off with those particular pleasures with the temptation to take the easy way out
At the same time you're showing respect for the dignity the worth of those around you
And again this gives dignity to our lives
When you're meditating the same process holds
People sometimes wonder why they can't get their minds to concentrate
It's because they're not willing to give up other interests even for the time being
A thought comes and you just go right after it without checking to see where it's going
This idea comes that sounds interesting that looks intriguing you've got a whole hour to think about whatever you want
If that's your attitude toward the meditation time nothing's going to get accomplished
You have to realize that this is your opportunity to get the mind stable and still
In order to do that you have to give up all kinds of other thoughts
Thoughts about the past thoughts about the future figuring this out planning for that whatever You have to put them all aside
No matter how wonderful or sophisticated those thoughts are you just say No to them
Now if you've been practicing generosity and have really been serious about practicing the precepts you've developed the ability to say No skillfully which is why generosity and the precepts are not optional parts of the practice
They're your foundation for the meditation
When you've made a practice of generosity and virtue the mind's ability to say No to its impulses has been strengthened and given finesse
You've seen the good results that come from being able to restrain yourself in terms of your words and deeds
You've seen that restraint means the opposite of deprivation
Now as you meditate you've got the opportunity to restrain your thoughts and see what good comes from that
If you really are able to say No to your vagrant ideas you find that the mind can settle down with a much greater sense of satisfaction in its state of concentration than could possibly come with those ideas no matter how fantastic they are
You find that the satisfaction of giving in to those distractions just slips through your fingers as if it were never there
It's like trying to grab a handful of water or a fistful of air
But the sense of wellbeing that comes with being able to repeatedly bring your mind to a state of stillness even if you haven't gone all the way begins to permeate everything else in your life
You find that the mind really is a more independent thing than you imagined it could be
It doesn't need to give in to those impulses
It can say No to itself
Even more so when you develop the discernment that's able to dig out the source of those impulses to see where they come from to the point where the whole issue of temptation is no longer an issue because there's nothing tempting
You look at the things that would pull the mind out of its stillness out of its independence and you realize they're just not worth it
In the past you were training the mind in a sense of hunger  that's what we do when we keep giving in to impulses We're training ourselves in hunger
But now you train the mind in the direction of having enough of being free and you realize that the sense of hunger that you used to cultivate is really a major source of suffering
You're much better off without it
It's important that we realize the role that restraint plays in overcoming the problem of suffering and finding true wellbeing for ourselves
You realize that you're not giving up anything you really need
You're a lot better without it
There's a part of the mind that resists this truth and our culture hasn't been very helpful at all because it encourages that resistance Give in to this impulse give in to that impulse obey your thirst
It's good for the economy it's good for you spiritually
Watch out if you repress your desires you're going to get tied up in psychological knots The lessons our culture teaches us  to go out and buy buy buy be greedy be greedy give in give in  are all over the place
And what kind of dignity comes from following those messages
The dignity of fish gobbling down bait
We've got to unlearn those habits unlearn those messages if we want to revive words like dignity and restraint and to reap the rewards that the realities of dignity and restraint have to offer our minds
We're afraid of so many things
There's so much fear in our lives
And yet the texts don't treat fear all that much largely because there are many different kinds of fear  fear associated with greed fear associated with anger fear associated with delusion  and the texts focus more on the emotions behind the fears than on the fears themselves
The implication here is that if you want to understand your fears you have to understand the emotions behind them
You have to analyze fear not as a single solid thing but as a compound of many different factors to see which part of the fear is dependent on the greed or passion which part is dependent on the aversion and which part is dependent on the delusion
Then when you've taken care of the underlying emotions you've taken care of the fear
If there's greed for something or passion for something there's the fear that you're not going to get it or the fear that once you have got it you're going to be deprived of it
Then there's fear based on anger
You know that if a certain thing happens it's going to hurt you're going to suffer
You're averse to it so you're afraid of it
And then there's the whole area of delusion of what you don't know of the great unknown out there
Fear based on delusion can range anywhere from fear of a ghost in the next room or a strange person in this room to general existential angst a sense that something is required of you and you don't know what it is
Human experience seems like such a huge void something very alien
There's the big sense of fear that there may not be any meaning or purpose to life that it's just pointless suffering
So you have to divide out the different kinds of fear because you need to work not so much on the fear as on its root
Unless you dig down to the different factors you won't know what kind of fear it is
You won't be able to get to its root causes
Now fear is complicated by the fact that it's such a physical emotion
When fear arises there are all kinds of reactions in the body
The heartbeat speeds up the stomach juices get churning and we often confuse the physical reactions for the mental state
In other words a single flash of fear floods the mind and then recedes but it sets into motion a huge series of physical reactions that sometimes will take a long time to settle down
And because they don't settle down right away there's a sense that I must still be afraid because here are all the physical symptoms of fear So the first thing in dealing with fear especially strong fear like this is to separate the mental state from the physical state
Some people say they have no trouble reasoning themselves out of the fear but find that they're still afraid
That may be based on a misunderstanding on mistaking the physical symptoms of fear for the actual mental state
We have to separate the physical side of the fear from the mental state because if you're reasoning through the issue the actual fear itself may be at bay
What seems to live on or seems to be unwilling to go away is the physical side and of course it takes a while to go away because of the hormones churned up in your blood stream
It's going to take a while for them to wash out
So your first line of defense is to learn to know when there actually is fear in the mind and when there's no fear in the mind even though there may be the signs of fear in the body
When you can make this distinction you don't feel so overwhelmed by the emotion
You breathe as best you can through the physical manifestations of fear the tension the feelings that come with that shortened breath or the constricted breath that result from the fear
Then consciously expand that sensation of physical relief and open it up to counteract the fear's physical symptoms
At the same time ask yourself Exactly what is this fear What's being threatened Where do you feel weak What is the danger Learn to take the reasons for the fear apart because a lot of the fear lies in the confusion
You don't know exactly what you're afraid of or you don't know exactly what to do
All the avenues seem closed and you can't analyze what's going on
And that multiplies the fear
So you have to sit down if you have the chance to sit down or at least mentally make a note What is this fear
Exactly what sparked it Learn to look at the fear not as something that you're feeling but something that's simply there
And try to look at why it keeps shouting at you over and over and over in the brain
Some fears are neurotic
They're based on gross delusion and they're relatively easy to deal with
Those are the ones that psychotherapists can handle
You had a really bad experience as a child and you've instinctively been avoiding that particular issue that particular feeling ever since but it's gotten to the point where it's totally unrealistic
And because the fear is unrealistic the treatment is to simply look at the situation for what it really is
You confront it you try not to avoid it but actually put yourself into circumstances that will bring up that fear again and watch the disjunction between the fear and the reality
You learn that the reality was not as bad as you thought it would be
As this disjunction grows clearer the fear gets calmer weaker more and more manageable
That's how you handle neurotic fear
Realistic fears require deeper practice
One of the members of our community lost her mother in a war came to the States and became a psychotherapist
As part of her training she had to undergo psychotherapy
After a couple of years of psychotherapy the therapist said It looks like your fears are very realistic
There's nothing I can do for you This is where Dhamma practice comes in facing our realistic fears our fears of aging illness separation and death
These things are real and they do cause suffering  if you don't work your way down into exactly where your attachments are
This is precisely the Buddhist take on fear It comes from clinging and attachment
And the clinging is threatened by impermanence by stress and suffering by the fact that these things are beyond your control
The purpose of our training here is to learn how not to let our happiness be based on things beyond our control because as long as we entrust our happiness to them we're setting ourselves up for suffering setting ourselves up for fear
This is how the meditation in and of itself is a way of dealing with the fears  the deeper fears the realistic fears
Ask yourself What exactly does my happiness depend on Normally people will allow their happiness to depend on a whole lot of conditions
And the more you think about those conditions the more you realize that they're totally beyond your control the economy the climate the political situation the continued beating of certain hearts the stability of the ground beneath your feet all of which are very uncertain
So what do you do
You learn to look inside
Try to create a sense of wellbeing that can come simply with being with the breath
Even though this isn't the total cure it's the path toward the cure
You learn to develop a happiness less and less dependent on things outside and more and more inward something more under your control something you can manage better
And as you work on this happiness you find that it's not a second best
It actually is better than the kind of happiness that was dependent on things outside
It's much more gratifying more stable
It permeates much more deeply into the mind
In fact it allows the mind to open up because for most of us the mind jumps around like a cat
Wherever it lands it's always going to stay tense for it knows it has to be ready to jump again at any moment
But when you find something you can stay with for long periods of time the mind can allow itself to relax
When it knows that it won't have to jump anytime soon it can soften up a bit
When it softens up you find it easier to know the mind in and of itself what it's like where its attachments are where it's still clinging
That allows you to go deeper still
And we find that our ultimate fear is fear of death which is an extremely realistic fear
It's going to happen for sure and for most of us it's a huge mystery
This is where the solution has to lie in the meditation for only meditation can take you to something beyond death beyond space and time
Death is something that happens within space and time but there is something that can be experienced outside of those dimensions
That's what we're looking for
As the texts say there are four reasons why people fear death
One they're attached to their bodies  they know they're going to lose their bodies at death
Two they're attached to sensory pleasures  they know they're going to lose them at death
These two types of fear are based on passion passion for the body passion for our sensual appetites
The third type of fear is based on aversion when people know that they have done cruel things in the past and that they may have to face punishment for those cruel things after death
The fourth type of fear is based on delusion when people are uncertain about the true Dhamma Was the Buddha right
Is there really a Deathless As long as you don't know these things directly for yourself there's always going to be an uncertainty a large amount of ignorance and delusion surrounding death creating fear
The whole purpose of the practice is to counteract these causes for fear so that you aren't dependent on the body you don't have to cling to the body for your happiness you don't have to cling to sensory pleasures for your happiness you train yourself to do good things and you reach the point where you taste the Deathless and know for sure that you're on the right path to the right goal
To do this you have to take apart the basic building blocks of experience as you encounter them in concentration form feeling perceptions thoughtfabrications and consciousness
You look to see where these things are inconstant
Where they're inconstant you realize they're stressful
There's stress right there in the inconstancy
Then when you look at stress look at suffering  although at this level it's more stress than suffering  you ask yourself What am I doing to cause that stress to aggravate that stress
What activities are accompanying the stress You look for the cause and it's right there in your intentional actions
When you can take those intentions apart things open up
Once they open up you realize that you've come to something totally different a totally different dimension outside of space and time
And you realize that death can't touch that
Only with that direct experience can you say that you've overcome your fear of death
The only fear you're left with is the fear you might have lapses of mindfulness where you might do something unskillful
So there is still work to be done
At the very least though in the gross sense of the five precepts you wouldn't intentionally do anything unskillful
So this is how the meditation deals with fear
It breaks the fear down into other emotions looking for the underlying causes in terms of the greed passion anger and delusion that give rise to the fear and keep it going
At the same time the meditation points directly at the way we pin our hopes for happiness on undependable things and opens the way for us to pin our hopes not on something changeable or out of our control but on a dimension beyond the reach of things that could harm it
So the cure for fear is not just a matter of talking yourself out of it but of putting yourself in a position of strength where there really is no danger nothing to fear
So these are a few thoughts on dealing with the emotion of fear as it comes
 Learn to separate the physical from the mental side so you don't misunderstand what's happening in the body so it doesn't stir up more confusion in the mind
 Learn how to focus directly on the mind to see exactly what the problem is where the sense of weakness is where the clinging is because wherever there's clinging there's weakness
And that's what constitutes fear
 Then look to see if that danger is realistic
If it's not there's one way of dealing with it if it's realistic there's another deeper way of dealing with it
This way you find you can not only get a handle on your fear or learn to cope with fear but ultimately put yourself in a position where there truly is nothing to fear
And that's what makes this practice so special
Freud once said that the purpose of psychotherapy is to take people out of their neurotic suffering and leave them with the ordinary miseries of daily life
The Dhamma however takes you from the ordinary miseries of human life and leads you beyond to a dimension where there is no misery no suffering at all
It deals not only with unrealistic fears or fears that are way out of proportion but also with the fears that are genuinely realistic and well founded
It can take you beyond even those to a point where in all reality there is nothing to fear
When we come out to the monastery like this we come to a place cut off from human society  not totally cut off because there are other human beings here but it's a different kind of society a society where the bottom line is the practice the growth of the mind the growth of the heart the development of mindfulness concentration and discernment
That's not the bottom line in the world at large but it is the bottom line here because the mind needs this kind of environment to develop its best qualities
When we live in the world we tend to pick up the values of the world  and what do those values say
They say it doesn't matter what you do as long as you succeed as long as you get ahead as long as you get money
That's the important thing
People try to dress these values up to sound a little better than that but that's basically what they come down to
And when you live with people who hold to these values and you don't have a good solid basis within yourself to withstand that kind of thinking you've got to give in
You tend to follow along with them whether you like it or not
But the Buddha teaches us that true happiness isn't found that way
He says that true happiness comes from developing good qualities in the mind
It has nothing to do with money nothing to do with status nothing to do with the opinions of other people
It's something totally inner and it has to come from inner goodness
This is revolutionary because the world tells you if you want to get ahead you have to develop all sorts of qualities you can't really be proud of the qualities you need to stab people in the back make a quick buck take advantage of other peoples' weaknesses
But the Buddha says that true happiness requires you to develop things like persistence perseverance endurance integrity mindfulness kindness reliability
These are things you can be proud to develop
There's a dignity to the practice that you don't find in the world outside
But if you're living in a worldly environment what the Buddha says sounds like a dream lots of nice ideas but not all that realistic
That's why you need places like this where the values that the Buddha teaches are realistic
It's what life here at the monastery is all about
So being here gives the mind a chance to develop these qualities and to see that they really do lead to happiness
They really are important much more so than the things the world holds to be important
This is why physical seclusion is so essential
You get in touch with yourself out here
You get in touch with what's really important in your life
The issues of birth aging illness and death become very large out here
In the world  the ordinary world  these issues get shunted aside
People don't have time for them and so when aging illness and death do hit it's like a big surprise
The mind isn't prepared
People get blown away even though everyone knows deep down inside that these things have to happen
Yet when you live in a society that doesn't give you time to look at these things to reflect on them and to prepare for them you really get knocked to pieces when they come
So you need a chance to get out and look at what's really important in your life and how you're going to prepare for these things
That's what the meditation is all about  developing a good solid basis in the mind that can withstand these things when they come
The image the Buddha gives for this basis is of a stone column eight cubits long
Four cubits are buried down in the ground in a good solid mountain
Four cubits are above ground
When the wind comes the column doesn't shake at all
It doesn't even shiver
No matter how strong the wind no matter which direction it's coming from the stone column stays put
That's the kind of mental state you need in order to withstand these things  and that's what you develop in the course of the meditation
Then as we all know it's important that you don't cultivate this skill only while you're here this place of physical solitude but that you also take this skill back with you
Many times people come to the monastery and say that it's such a relief for the mind to be out here and they'd like to take that state of mind with them when they go back
Well you can't take a state of mind like that with you
It's a result
What you can take back is the skill the cause of that state of mind
It's not just the environment that allows it to develop
People can come out here and still have their minds a total mess
What makes the difference is that you learn how to make use of the environment to develop the skills you need to straighten out things inside
The skills are the things you can take back with you when you go home  the skillful attitudes the skillful approaches to bringing the mind under control giving it a sense of stability inside
These are the important parts of the practice that train the mind to stand on its own two feet
When you ask yourself Where is the best place to meditate your answer should be Right here wherever you are
That's the best place That's the ideal
But as you're getting started you're like a child learning to ride a bicycle  you need training wheels you need help
You can't just jump on the bicycle and ride off with a perfect sense of balance
You use the training wheels you use the community you use the peaceful environment to help get the mind in the proper attitude
Then you try to develop your own skills so that when the training wheels are taken away you can ride with ease and won't fall over
What are some of these skills
The most basic one is just learning to focus the mind on one thing and to withstand any temptation to let it go
This is an important skill you need whatever your work is
If you can concentrate on your work and don't let the distractions get in your way work gets done and it gets done properly
It's a solid piece of work and not just little bits and pieces that happen to be thrown together because there's a continuity
And when you learn how to focus on one thing like this when you focus in on the breath it changes your attitude toward the other thoughts that come into the mind
If the mind doesn't have a particular focus it can wander around from thought to thought not really noticing what it's doing and not having a sense of direction
It gets lost going in the wrong direction because every direction is just the direction where it's flowing
But when you give it something to hold onto you have a sense of direction
Then you can see how some things pull you away and some things pull you back
It's like the difference of being on the earth and being out in outer space
When you're on the earth there's a definite sense of orientation  there's north south east and west
You've got the earth as your reference point
But if you're out in outer space you don't know which way is up which way is down north south east west  they have no meaning out there
And the mind is just adrift in the stellar currents
But when you're on the earth when you've got a good basis then you have a sense that This way is north this way is south You have a sense of the direction you want to go and you know when you're heading in that direction and when you're not
That's why it's crucial to have a center for the mind
But to maintain that center you have to enjoy it
If you don't it simply becomes one more burden to carry in addition to your other burdens and the mind will keep dropping it when your other burdens get heavy
This is why we spend so much time working on the skill of playing with the breath making it comfortable making it gratifying making it fill your body with a sense of ease
When you have that kind of inner nourishment to feed on you're less hungry for things outside
You don't need to feed on the words and actions of other people
You don't have to look for your happiness there
When you can develop a sense of inner fullness simply by the way you breathe the mind can stay nourished no matter what the situation
You can sit in a boring meeting and yet be blissing out  and nobody else has to know
You can watch all the good and bad events around you with a sense of detachment because you have no need to feed on them
It's not that you're indifferent or apathetic simply that your happiness doesn't have to go up and down with the ups and downs of your life
You're not in a position where people can manipulate you for you're not trying to feed on what they have to offer you
You've got your own source of food inside
At the same time when you have an inner center like this to hold onto you develop a sense of dissociation from the thoughts that arise within the mind
You realize  when you're focused on the breath and a thought comes into the mind  it's not necessarily you thinking or your thought and you're not necessarily responsible for it
You don't have to follow it and check it out or straighten it out
If it comes in halfformed just let it go away halfformed
You don't have to be responsible for it
This is another important skill because if you can learn to step back from the thoughts and emotions that come into the mind and not say that this is my thought or this is my emotion then you can really choose which ones are worth holding onto which ones should be explored and which ones should be let go that you don't have to deal with at all
Some people may say that that's irresponsible that you've got to check everything out
Well that's just what they say
What do they know That's the kind of attitude you have to develop
As the Buddha said his own practice really got started in the right direction when he divided his thoughts into two types skillful and unskillful
What this means is having the ability to step back from your thoughts and look at them not in terms of their content but in terms of where they take you
If you have thoughts motivated by greed anger delusion passion aversion confusion boredom  where do they take you
Well they don't take you to nibbana that's for sure
They don't take you where you want to go so you decide to dissociate from them
You don't deny that they exist for that would just drive them underground
You admit their existence but you realize that you don't have to follow them
You can let them go and they pass away from the mind
Meanwhile you latch onto more skillful thinking  either that or you learn how to let go of thoughts and just keep the mind still where it doesn't have to think
This is where you gain a sense that you're more in control of your mind that you're not subject to everything that comes passing through
Most people's minds are like bus stations
Everyone who wants to go through the bus station has the right to do so
And they can do all kinds of weird things while they're there in the bus station mugging people having sex in the restroom stalls shooting up heroin back in the dark corners
That's what most peoples' minds are like
You've got to make up your mind to turn your mind into a home a place where you have the right to let thoughts in or not let them in as you like  or let them just go passing on
You can close the windows and doors and let in only your friends
You're more in control
And when you have a home like that you can settle down and be at ease and at peace at home at ease and at peace with your own mind
So this is an important skill to take with you wherever you go
It's not a skill that you use only while you're sitting here with your eyes closed
One of the essential techniques you need in this skill is the ability to breathe through your thoughts because when thoughts come heavy  when they come really strong  they don't just affect the mind
They affect the body as well
That's why when anger comes you have a strong sense that you have to get it out of your system because it's gotten into the body into the way you breathe into the patterns of tension in the body
It builds up and gets hard to bear so you feel you've got to get it out
Most people think that the way to get it out is to say something or do something under the power of the anger but that doesn't solve anything at all
When we're with our breathing practice we learn how breathe through that pattern of tension in the chest or the belly and let it disperse throughout the body
Once it's dispersed it loses its power
You feel less oppressed by it
Then you can look at the situation from a calm vantage point and decide what should be done
Do you have to say something
Is this the best time to say it or is it best left unsaid
How will people react if you talk now
Should you wait till a later time
You can gauge these things clearly which you can't do when you've got a sense of weightiness or oppression from the anger inside the body
So you breathe through the patterns of tension in the body
It's an important skill you use not only while you're here but also while you're out working while you're dealing with your family whatever you're doing in the world at large
It's important to realize that the skills of meditation are for use not only while you're on the cushion or sitting with your legs crossed and your eyes closed
They're basic skills for governing your own mind looking after your own mind administering the ways your mind works whether you're sitting with your eyes closed or open whether you're alone or dealing with people because it's the same mind
The defilements that arise in the course of your practice and the defilements that arise in the course of daily life are basically the same defilements
Sometimes in society the defilements appear more unexpectedly with more force and a greater sense of urgency but they come down to the same thing  if an unskillful state arises in the mind and you treat it unskillfully then you just go wherever it leads you
But if you learn how to deal skillfully even with the unskillful things that come  to deal skillfully with feelings of passion feelings of anger your own misunderstandings  you can take the raw material of life and turn it into something fine
As Ajaan Lee once said A person with intelligence takes whatever gets sent his or her way and makes something good out of it This is the attitude you've got to adopt because we live a life full of the power of kamma  old kamma and new
You can't do anything about old kamma
You have to accept it like a good sport
That's why you practice equanimity
But as for the new kamma you're creating right now you can't practice equanimity with that
You have to be very concerned about what you're putting into the system because you realize that this is the only chance you get to make the choice
Once the choice is made and it gets put into the system then whatever the energy  positive or negative  that's the sort of energy you're going to have to experience
So pay attention What are you putting into the system right now
This is the important thing to focus on
Whatever other people do to you whatever arises in your body in terms of pains illnesses aging death or whatever That's old kamma that you simply have to learn to take with good humor with a sense of equanimity
As for what you're putting into the system right now that's serious business
That's where your attention and efforts should be focused
So the skills you pick up from the Buddha's teachings are not just techniques for silent meditation
They're skillful attitudes skillful approaches you develop to what's important in life
You want to approach life as a skill to realize that there is always the possibility of doing things skillfully
You may not have perfected it but you don't beat yourself for not having the perfect response to every situation
You realize that there's always the opportunity to learn
You make mistakes you learn from them
This is a normal part of life and a wise way of living is to learn from your mistakes and resolve not to repeat them
Learn from what you've done
Notice when you do things correctly notice when you make mistakes and take that information to adjust your patterns of behavior
Some people come to the practice and say Well this is the kind of person I am
I've just got to be this way That attitude closes the door on the practice entirely
You start from where you are but you have to be willing to change
If people couldn't change if they had to stay the way they are the Buddha's teaching would be in vain
There would be no reason to have the teachings because they're all about transformation
They're all about learning developing changing the way you approach life
From the Buddhist point of view accepting yourself means not only admitting where you are but also accepting that you have the potential to change
As your approach becomes more and more skillful you're doing less and less harm to yourself less harm to others less harm to both
You find that you live in a way that brings more benefits for yourself more benefits for others more benefits for both
It may take more energy more attention but it's a much more worthwhile way of living
It's like being an expert carpenter
You've got various ways of approaching the problems that arise in the mind
You realize that there are all kinds of problems and there are many ways of dealing with them
If you try just one approach it's like having a tool box full of nothing but saws
You can't build anything with that
You can't be called a decent carpenter at all
But when you realize that there are ways of dealing with different situations that arise and through your own powers of observation you discover which ways work for you which ways get the right results for you That's called having a full tool box with a wide range of tools
And when you have those tools at hand you can stay anywhere
You can stay in a monastery you can stay in a hospital you can stay at work at home in this country in another country this world the next world this life the next
The tools stay with you once you've developed them
So focus on the practice as a way of collecting tools developing skills both in terms of techniques in the meditation and whole attitudes toward your life
That's the most worthwhile use of your time
Those are the best things to take with you when you go
Get your body into position
Sit straight hands on your lap
Close your eyes
Get your mind in position
Think about the breath and be aware of the sensation of the breathing
See
It's not all that hard
Just doing it is not the hard part
The hard part is the maintaining keeping it there
That's because the mind isn't used to staying in position just as the body isn't used to staying in position
But the mind tends to move a lot faster and to be a lot more fickle than the body which is why we have to work extra hard at that really hard aspect of the training keeping the mind in one place maintaining it in concentration
Ajaan Lee once said there are three steps in concentration practice doing maintaining and then using the concentration
The using is fun
Once the mind has settled down you can use it as a basis for understanding things
You suddenly see the motions of the mind as it creates thoughts and it's a fascinating process to watch to take apart
The maintaining though isn't all that fascinating
You learn a lot of good lessons about the mind in the course of maintaining and without those lessons you couldn't do the more refined work of gaining insight
But still it's the most difficult part of the practice
Ajaan Lee once compared it to putting a bridge across a river
The pilings on this bank and that bank aren't hard to place but the pilings in the middle are really hard
You've got to withstand the current of the river
You dig down and put a few stones on the bottom of the river and you come back with your next load of stones only to discover that the first load of stones has washed away
This is why you need techniques for getting that middle set of pilings to stay in place for otherwise the bridge will never get across the river at all
So this is what we work at
In the beginning the work is simply a question of noticing when the mind has slipped off and bringing it back
When it's slipped off again you bring it back again
And again
And again
But if you're observant you become sensitive to the signs that tell you when the mind is about to slip off
It hasn't gone yet but it's getting ready to go
It's tensed up and ready to jump
When you can sense that tension you simply relax it
Meticulously
And that way you can keep the mind more and more consistently with the breath
Be especially careful not to ask where the mind was going to jump
You can't give into that temptation
Sometimes the mind is getting ready to jump off to something and you wonder Where is it going
Anyplace interesting Or when a thought begins to form It's just a vague inchoate sense of a thought and the mind puts a label on it
Then you want to see Does this label really fit And that means you're fully entangled
If you look more carefully at the process of what's happening you begin to realize that whether the label fits or not the mind has a tendency to make it fit
So it's not a question of whether it's a true label or not but whether you want to follow through with that process of making it fit
And you don't have to
You notice a little stirring in the mind and you don't have to label it
Or if you've labeled it you don't have to ask whether the label is true or not
Just let it go
That way the stirring can disband
Now when the mind finally does settle down in the beginning there can be a sense of rapture a sense of accomplishment that you've finally gotten the mind to stay with the breath for long periods of time for longer and longer periods of time
It feels really refreshing to be there
Then you make it a game seeing how quickly you can get there how often you can get there what other activities you can be doing at the same time
However  and I don't want to spoil it for you  there comes a time when this gets boring too
It's boring though only because you lose perspective
Everything seems so calm everything seems so settled and there's a part of the mind that gets bored
Oftentimes that's your first object lesson in insight Look into the boredom
Why is the mind bored with a state of calm and ease
After all the mind is in its most secure place its most comfortable place
Why would part of you want to go looking for trouble to stir things up
Look into that
There's a chance for insight right there
Or you start telling yourself This is really stupid just sitting here still still calm calm
This isn't intelligent at all That's when you have to remind yourself that you're working on a foundation
The stronger the foundation then when the time comes to build a building the taller it can go the more stable it will be
When insights come you want them to be solid insights
You don't want them to knock you askew
How can insights knock you askew
You gain an insight and get so excited about it that you lose perspective forget to take it and look on the other side
When an insight comes Ajaan Lee always recommends turning it inside out
The insight says This must be this Well he says try thinking about what if it were not this
What if it were the opposite
Would there be a lesson there as well
In other words just as you're not supposed to fall for the content of your thoughts you're not supposed to fall for the contents of your insights either
That requires really stable concentration because many times when the insights come they're very striking very interesting
A strong sense of accomplishment comes with them
To keep yourself from getting carried away by that sense of accomplishment you want to have your concentration really solid so that it's not impressed
It's not bowled over
It's ready to look at the other side of the insight
This is one reason why you need solid concentration to work at the steady steady job of just coming back staying staying keeping it still keeping it still
Then that old question of perception begins coming up again
The whole perception of your state of mind starts getting questionable
File that one away for future reference
As the Buddha said all the states of concentration all the states of jhana up through the state of nothingness are perceptionattainments
The perception you apply to them is what keeps them going
And as you stay with a particular level there starts to be a slight sense of the artificiality of the corresponding perception
But wait until the concentration is really solid before you start questioning it for the perception is what keeps the state of concentration going  and it is an artificial state that you're creating in the mind
When the time comes for insight one of the topics that you'll want to focus on is the artificiality of that concept the artificiality of the perception that creates the state of concentration you've been living with
For the time being though just file it away for future reference
If you question things too early everything gets shortcircuited and you're back to where you started
So even though the work of maintaining concentration may seem like drudgery work  just coming back coming back coming back  everything depends on this quality of consistency of maintenance
Get really good at it really familiar with it
The more familiar you are with it the more easily you can use it as the basis for insight when the time comes
There's a passage where the Buddha talks about a meditator whose mind has attained a really solid stage of equanimity
When you're solid in your equanimity you realize that you can apply it to different things
You can apply it to the sense of infinite space
You can apply it to the sense of infinite consciousness or nothingness
Once you recognize precisely where those perceptions are precisely how you can focus on them and stay there for long long times you'll suddenly gain insight into how constructed they are
In the beginning it's very obvious how constructed they are because you're working so hard to put them together
But as you get more and more familiar with them there's a greater sense that you're simply tuningin to something already there
You're more impressed by the alreadythereness of the state
You begin to overlook the act of tuningin because it gets easier and easier more and more natural  but it's still there the element of construction the element of fabrication that keeps you there
When the concentration gets really solid so that you can look into it even in its most refined state that's when the insight really hits you how constructed this is how artificial the whole thing is  this state you've learned to depend on
And only then is the insight meaningful
If you start analyzing states of concentration in terms of the three characteristics before you've really depended on those states before you've really gotten familiar with them it shortcircuits the whole process
Oh yes concentration is unstable Well anyone can sit and meditate for two minutes and learn that and it doesn't mean very much
But if you develop the skill so that you're really solidly with it you test that principle of inconstancy
How constant can you make this state of the mind
Ultimately you get to the point where you realize that you've made it as constant as you could ever make it as reliable as you could ever make it and yet it still falls under the three characteristics
It's still constructed
That's when the mind starts tending toward the unconstructed the unfabricated
If you've brought the mind to still enough a state of equilibrium you can stop fabricating and things open up
It's not just an intention of saying Well I'm going to put a stop to this It's a matter of learning how equilibrium happens without any new intention taking its place
That's where the real skill lies
That's why we spend so much time getting the mind into balance balance balance for only in a real state of balance like that can you totally let go
Some people have the conception that meditation is about getting the mind into a really extreme state where things break through Bring it to the total edge of instability and then suddenly you break through to something deeper
That's what they say
But I've yet to find the Buddha describe it that way
For him it's more a question of bringing the mind to a state of balance so that when the time comes to stop fabricating the mind doesn't tip over in any direction at all
It's right there
So these qualities of consistency persistence sticktoitivedness training the mind so it can really trust itself depend on itself rely on itself in the midst of all the inconstancy in the world These are the qualities that make all the difference in the meditation
Try to be present throughout the whole breath each breath all the way in all the way out
We like to think that if we had it all figured out we wouldn't have to pay so much attention  that if there were some formula we could memorize that in itself would take care of things so we wouldn't have to put so much effort into the meditation put so much effort into being present
We'd like just to plug into the formula and let things go on automatic pilot  but that's missing the point
The point is being attentive paying careful attention being sensitive all the time
This is a quality the Buddha calls citta intentness attentiveness really giving yourself fully to what you're doing right now
When you're intent insight comes not as a formula that allows you to be inattentive but as a sensitivity to what's going on right now so you can read what's happening continually
In other words you're trying to strengthen this quality of being attentive this quality of being present because when you're really present you don't need all the other formulas
You recognize the signs of what's going on when the breath is too long when the breath is too short when the breath energy in the body is too sluggish when it's too active
Being attentive is what enables you to notice these things to be sensitive to them to read what they're telling you
So the insights you gain are not necessarily wise sayings that you can write down in little books of wisdom
Insight is a greater and greater sensitivity to what's going on
Don't think that you'd like to have things explained beforehand or to sit here trying to come up with little rules or memory aids Well when this happens you should do this and then when that happens you should do that You're trying to develop the quality of being able to listen able to read what's happening in the present moment all the time so that you won't need those memory aids
If you're looking for the little formulas or the little nuggets of wisdom that you can wrap up and take home in hopes that they'll allow you to drop the effort that goes into being so attentive it's like the old story of the goose laying the golden egg
You get a golden egg and then you kill the goose
That's the end of the eggs
The goose here is the ability to stay attentive to be present to be fully engaged in what's happening with the breath
The insights will come on their own  you keep producing producing producing the insights  not for the sake of taking home with you but for the sake of using them right here right now
You don't have to be afraid that you're not going to remember them for the next time
If you're really attentive your sensitivity will produce the fresh insights you need next time
It will keep developing becoming an ability to read things more and more carefully more and more precisely so that you won't have to memorize insights from the past
It will keep serving them up hot and fresh
Like sailing a boat When you first get out in the boat and they give you the rudder it doesn't take long before you flip the boat over because you steer too hard to the right steer too hard to the left
You don't have a sense of what's just right
But if you pay attention to what you're doing after a while that sense of just right develops
And the next time you get into the boat it's not that you have to remember any verbal lessons you learned from the last time
The sensitivity is there in you the ability to read how much pressure you should put on the rudder at this point when this happens when that happens
There's a greater and greater familiarity that comes from being fully attentive
The same principle applies here
It's not the case that you're going to be fully attentive for five minutes and learn whatever lessons you're going to need for the hour and then just zone out or go on automatic pilot
You have to be as attentive to the first breath as you are to the last breath as attentive to the last breath as you are to the first and all the breaths in between
As this quality of attentiveness grows stronger your sensitivity grows stronger
There's less and less of a conscious effort but it doesn't mean that you're less present
It's just that you're more skilled at being present more skilled at being sensitive ready to learn whatever lessons there are to learn
Michaelangelo at the age of reportedly said that he was still learning how to sculpt
Well that should be your attitude as you meditate
There are always things to learn
Even arahants have things to learn
They've learned enough already to overcome their defilements but they're still learning other things because they're attentive all the time
They're watching what's going on
Their sensitivity has been heightened
When people talk about the path being identical with the goal there is an element of truth there in the sense that when you reach the goal you don't throw away all the things you did when you were on the path
The texts say that even arahants practice the four foundations of mindfulness not because they have anything more to do in terms of uprooting their defilements but because the practice of mindfulness provides a pleasant abiding in the here and now
It's a good place to be
At the same time if they have to teach other people they use the sensitivities they've developed in their meditation and apply them to the process of teaching
So don't sit here saying Well I'll just stay with the breath until I get the results I want and then I can stop this effort You're working with the qualities that are going to take you there and that are going to stay with you once you arrive the qualities of mindfulness alertness discernment  all the good qualities we're working on here
You want to bring them more and more to bear on what you're doing in every situation
They get stronger and stronger and they give you the sensitivity you need to cut through any defilements you encounter
They give you the sensitivity you need to find more stable states of concentration to figure out the techniques you need in order to get the mind to settle down when it's obstreperous
But again once you've learned those lessons it's not the case that you can turn off the effort to be sensitive the effort to be fully engaged
It's just that you learn how to be more and more comfortable being engaged so that whatever lessons come up whatever things you have to read within yourself whatever things you have to listen to within yourself you're ready to listen
You're alert to the signs that you have to decipher when you read
So do what you can to keep this goose alive and well so it can keep laying the golden eggs you need
You crack open the golden egg and there's a lesson for you to use right there right then
You don't have to worry about making a stockpile of golden eggs because it's a funny kind of gold like the gold in a fairy tale
You turn around and a few minutes later it's turned into feathers or straw
But if you're really attentive the goose is ready to lay another golden egg
So keep nourishing it tending to it so that it can keep producing
Use the eggs for their intended purpose and then just let them go
Do your best to keep this mindstate going so that it's ready to lay another egg to give you more gold all the time
Let the mind settle down comfortably on the breath
Don't push it too hard and don't let it float away
Try to find just the right amount of pressure for staying with the breath
Let there be just that one question in the mind right now how heavily to focus on the breath
Other questions you can put aside because most of the other questions you would be focusing on now would simply foster doubt
The questions dealing with the mind and the breath in the present moment Those are the ones that are relevant because you can answer them by looking right here right now
The point of our practice is to gain discernment that leads to liberation that leads to release
But before we get to that level of discernment we have to train the discernment we have in every level of the practice
This morning we read a passage by Ajaan Lee in which he talks about how generosity virtue and meditation both depend upon discernment and give rise to discernment
In other words you have to use your discernment in each of these levels of the practice
It's not that you have to wait until the very end for discernment to land on you
You take the discernment you have you exercise it it gets stronger
It's just like exercising your body
If you want a strong body what do you do
You take the weak body you've got exercise it and it turns into a stronger body step by step by step because you're using it
But that also means learning how to exercise it properly
You don't exercise it too heavily to the point where you pull a tendon or tear a muscle
So at each level of the practice there are questions you want to ask to foster discernment appropriate to that level of the practice
When you're practicing generosity you have to ask What right now is just right
How much can I afford
How much is giving too much
In what way is my gift going to be most beneficial most effective
If I don't have much to give in terms of material things what else can I give The gift of your time and energy the gift of forgiveness can sometimes be many times more useful than the gift of material things
That's the development of skill insight and discernment on the level of generosity
Then on the level of the precepts you work up to a higher level
How am I going to maintain my precepts in difficult situations Say when people ask questions that you know are going to be harmful if you answer them how are you going to avoid the answer so that you don't lie
Or how are you going to live in your house so that you don't have to kill pests
Once you've laid down the law for yourself  Okay these are the principles I'm going to hold to  you suddenly find yourself with a whole new set of questions
You'll need ingenuity and discernment to answer them
And as you come up with answers using whatever ingenuity you have you find that your ingenuity and discernment get stronger
The same principle holds with meditation
Each step in your meditation requires certain questions
You take the questions bit by bit by bit step by step and you find that the meditation both requires discernment and strengthens discernment as you use it
For instance when you're focusing on the breath you ask a simple question What kind of breathing feels good right now And then you explore
You're free to experiment with the breath to find out if long breathing feels good if short breathing feels good deep breathing shallow
There's an element of investigation already even in the simple practice of concentration
It's not that you make the mind really really still and then all of a sudden discernment's going to go off like a flash bulb
There has to be some discernment involved in the process of getting the mind to settle down
As the Buddha said there's no jhana without discernment no discernment without jhana
The two have to go together to help each other along
Discernment here is learning which things to develop and which to let go
You start out with really simple things
You have to focus on what the breathing is like what kind of breathing the body needs right now
If your energy level feels low what kind of breathing will raise the energy level
If you feel too frenetic what kind of breathing can calm you down
If there are pains in different parts of the body are you breathing in a way that's actually augmenting or causing those pains
These are things you can explore
What you're doing is taking your thinking process the questioning process of the mind and learning how to use it skillfully
Meditation is not a matter of stopping your thought processes right away
Eventually there does come a point where thinking gets more and more attenuated until you can hardly call it thinking at all
But in the mean time before you can get there you have to learn how to use your thinking skillfully so you apply it to the issue of concentration apply it to the issue of settling the mind down
This is a basic principle in a lot of the Buddha's teachings
In order to learn how to let go of something you've got to learn how to do it skillfully
This principle doesn't apply to sex but it does apply to a lot of other things
For instance some texts talk about going beyond precepts and practices in the practice but before you can go beyond them you have to learn how to maintain your precepts with skill
Some Zen texts talk about letting go of the discriminating mind but before you let go of the discriminating mind you have to learn how to use it properly
Before learning how to let go of desire you have to learn how to use your desire properly
Focus it on the causes that will get you where you want to go
The unskillful use of desire means focusing so much on the results you want that you ignore the causes
You want to skip over them
That kind of desire is unskillful
You're not going to get beyond desire by just dropping unskillful desires
You have to learn how to replace unskillful desires with skillful ones focused on the causes that will take you where you want to go
Then when you've arrived the issue of desire falls away
So right now focus your desire on what will take you to concentration
This means being mindful to keep the breath in mind and being alert watching the breath
A good way to do that is to ask yourself questions about the breath and how you can relate to it here in the present moment
If you were to make the next breath a little bit longer what would happen
Try it and find out
How about a little bit shorter deeper stronger more refined
Just ask those questions of the mind
Don't put a lot of physical pressure on the breath
Just ask the question and you'll find that simply asking the question opens up the possibility
This is called appropriate attention  yoniso manasikara learning how to ask skillful questions  and it's essential to the whole practice
In fact the first question you're supposed to ask when you go to meet a new teacher is What is skillful
What is not skillful
What if I do it will be for my longterm happiness
What if I do it will be for my longterm suffering
You take those questions usually starting on the level of the precepts or generosity and work down deeper and deeper into the mind
That's how the deeper levels of concentration are attained
The discernment that gives rise to liberation comes in as well by learning how to ask the question What's the skillful thing to do now
Now in order to ask those questions from the very refined levels of the mind you have to start by asking them from more blatant levels in your daily life
This is why the Buddha's teaching is not about how soon we can get the experience of Awakening how soon we can get the feeling of oneness so we can go on with the rest of our life
That's not it at all
You have to train your whole approach to life
What's the most skillful thing to do right now
What's the most skillful thing to say
What's the most skillful thing to think Learn how to keep asking these questions looking for the answers learning from your mistakes time and again so that you gradually do become more skillful on the outer levels
You find that that habit begins to take root in your mind
Then as you're sitting here meditating it becomes an automatic question What's the most skillful way to relate to the breath
What's the most skillful way to relate to the present moment You experiment
You test
You come up with answers
And then you test the answers
So it's a basic process that starts from the outside and works in
Ultimately it leads to the discernment that liberates the mind totally from suffering
That's the point we all want to get to
But it's not a matter of simply sitting here and waiting until it comes
Liberating discernment comes from the process of questioning and probing and looking and getting the mind to settle down and be really still and asking Why is there still a disturbance in there
What acts of mind what decisions are creating that disturbance Sometimes the disturbance is on a very subtle level
What decisions are still getting in the way You look and you watch and you have to be very patient
Ajaan Khamdee one of the forest ajaans once made a comparison
He said that meditating is like being a hunter
The hunter goes out in the forest and on the one hand has to be very still so he doesn't scare off the rabbits and other animals but at the same time he has to be very alert
His ears and eyes have to be very sharp
And the hunter can't say Well okay I'm just going to sit here for half an hour and I'll bag my rabbit He has no idea how long it's going to take but he maintains that attitude of quiet alertness
The same in your meditation The concentration is what keeps you quiet that little question is what keeps you alert
And the combination of the two when you get them just right That will lead to Awakening
Practicing the Dhamma is primarily an issue of looking at yourself looking at your own thoughts your own words your own deeds seeing what's skillful seeing what's not
It's not so much an issue of selfimprovement as one of actionimprovement wordimprovement and thoughtimprovement
This is an important distinction because people in the modern world  especially in the modern world  seem to be obsessed with selfimage
We've spent our lives bombarded with images and you can't help but compare your image of yourself to the images of people you see outside you
And for the most part there's no comparison You're not as strong as beautiful as wealthy as stylish and so forth
I noticed in Thailand that as soon as television became rampant teenagers became very sullen
I think it's largely this issue of people's looking at themselves in comparison to the images broadcast at them
And the whole question of selfimage becomes very sensitive very painful
So when we say that you're looking at yourself remember you're not looking at your self You're looking at your thoughts words and deeds
Try to look at them as objectively as possible get the whole issue of self out of the way and then it becomes a lot easier to make improvements
The same applies to your dealings with other people
The Buddha said there are two factors that help most in the arising of discernment that help you most along the path
The foremost internal factor is appropriate attention
The foremost external factor is admirable friendship
And it's important that you reflect on what admirable friendship means because even though you're supposed to be looking at your own thoughts words and deeds you're also looking at the thoughts words and deeds of the people around you
After all your eyes are fixed in your body so that they point outside
You can't help but see what other people are doing
So the question is how you can make this knowledge most useful to yourself as you practice
And this is where the principle of admirable friendship comes in
To begin with it means associating with admirable people people who have admirable habits people who have qualities that are worthy of admiration
One list puts these qualities at four Admirable people have conviction in the principle of kamma they're virtuous they're generous and they're discerning
There's a wellknown line from Dogen where he says When you walk through the mist your robe gets wet without your even thinking about it That's his description of living with a teacher
You pick up the teacher's habits without thinking about it but that can be a doubleedged sword because your teacher can have both good and bad habits and you need to be careful about which ones you pick up
So in addition to associating with admirable people the Buddha says there are two further factors in admirable friendship
One is that you ask these people about issues of conviction virtue generosity discernment
And this doesn't necessarily mean just asking the teacher
You can ask other people in the community who have admirable qualities as well
See what special insights they have on how to develop those qualities
After all they've obviously got experience and you'd be wise to pick their brains
The second factor is that if you see anything in other people worth emulating you emulate it you follow it you bring that quality into your own behavior
So this makes you responsible for your end of admirable friendship too
You can't sit around simply hoping to soak up the mist waiting for it to blow your way
You have to be active
Remember that passage in the Dhammapada about the spoon not knowing the taste of the soup while the tongue does know the taste
But again when looking at people around you it's important that you get away from your sense of competitiveness of this person versus that person
You look not at them but at their activities
Otherwise you start comparing yourself to the other person This person's better than I am
That person's worse than I am And that brings in questions of conceit resentment and competition which are not really helpful because we're not here to compete with each other
We're here to work on ourselves
So again look at other people simply in terms of their thoughts their words their actions
And see what's an admirable action what are admirable words what are admirable ideas ones you can emulate ones you can pick up
In this way the fact that we're living together becomes a help to the practice rather than a hindrance
The same is true when you notice people around you doing things that are not so admirable
Instead of judging the other person simply judge the actions by their results that that particular action that particular way of thinking or speaking is not very skillful for it obviously leads to this or that undesirable result
And then turn around and look at yourself at the things you do and say Are those unskillful words and actions to be found in you
Look at the behavior of other people as a mirror for your own behavior
When you do this even the difficulties of living in a community become an aid to the practice
The Buddha designed the monkhood so that monks would have time alone but also have time together
If you spent all of your time alone you'd probably go crazy
If you spent all of your time together life would start getting more and more like dorm life all the time
So you have to learn how to balance the two
Learn how to develop your own good qualities on your own and at the same time use the actions and words of other people as mirrors for yourself to check yourself to see what out there is worth emulating to see what out there is clearly unskillful
And then reflect on yourself Do I have those admirable qualities
Do I have those unskillful qualities in my thoughts words and deeds If you've got those unskillful qualities you've got work to do
If you don't have the admirable ones you've got work to do there as well
What's interesting is that in both of these internal and external factors  both in appropriate attention and in admirable friendship  one of the crucial factors is questioning
In other words in appropriate attention you learn how to ask yourself questions about your own actions
In admirable friendship you ask the other people you admire about the qualities they embody
If you find someone whose conviction is admirable you ask that person about conviction
If you find someone whose effort and persistence are admirable you ask him about persistence
In other words you take an interest in these things
The things that we ask questions about those are the things we're interested in those are the things that direct our practice
And it's the combination of the two the internal questioning and the external questioning that gets us pointed in the right direction
So this is something to think about as you go through the day and you see someone else doing something that gets you upset or something that offends you
Don't focus on the other person focus on the action in and of itself as part of a causal process and then turn around and look at yourself
If in your mind you create other people out there you create a lot of problems
But if you simply see life in the community as an opportunity to watch the principle of cause and effect as it plays itself out the problems vanish
The same with admirable people You don't get jealous of their good qualities you don't get depressed about the fact that you don't have their good qualities
Where do good qualities come from
They come from persistence from effort from training which is something we can all do
So again if you see something admirable in other people ask them about it and then try to apply those lessons in your own life
If we go through life without asking questions we learn nothing
If we ask the wrong questions we go off the path
If with practice we learn how to ask the right questions that's the factor that helps us get our practice right on target
I once read a man's reminiscences about his childhood in which he said that every day when he'd come home from school his mother's first question would be What questions did you ask in school today She didn't ask What did you learn
What did the teacher teach She asked What questions did you ask She was teaching him to think
So at the end of the day when you stop to reflect on the day's activities that's a good question to ask yourself What questions did I ask today
What answers did I get That way you get to see which direction your practice is going
The Buddha concluded one of his most important talks with the phrase adhicitte ca ayogo commitment to the heightened mind
What this means is that we lift the mind above its ordinary concerns as when we come here to practice meditation
Our normal cares of the day  looking after our own bodies feeding them looking after other people being concerned with what other people think about us how we interact with them all the concerns of the day  we put those down lift our mind above them and bring it to the meditation object
When you look at the affairs of the world you see that they spin around just as the world does
There's a classic list of eight gain and loss status and loss of status praise and censure pleasure and pain
These things keep trading places
You can't have the good ones without the bad ones
You can't have the bad ones without the good
They keep changing places like this around and around and if we allow our minds to get caught up in them it's like getting our clothes caught up in the gears of a machine
They keep pulling us in pulling us in
If we don't know how to disentangle ourselves they keep pulling us in until they mangle our arms mangle our legs crush us to bits
In other words if we allow these preoccupations to consume the mind the mind gets mangled and doesn't have a chance to be its own self
We don't even know what the mind is like on its own because all we know is the mind as a slave to these things running around wherever they force it
So when we come to meditate we have to learn to lift our mind above these things
All thoughts of past and future we put aside
We just bring the mind to the breath so the mind doesn't have to spin around anymore
It simply stays with the breath coming in going out and gains at least some measure of freedom
From this heightened perspective we can look at our normal involvement with the world and begin to realize that for the most part it doesn't go anywhere
It just keeps spinning around coming back to the same old places over and over and over again
All that gets accomplished is that the mind gets more and more worn out
If we allow the mind to rise above these things so that it doesn't feed on them doesn't run after them we'll begin to get some sense of the mind's worth in and of itself
As the mind gets still things begin to settle out
Like sediment in a glass of water If you allow the water to stay still for a time whatever sediment is in there finally settles out and the water becomes clear
This is what happens when you let the mind separate from its ordinary concerns and simply stay with its meditation
Even when you go back into your normal activities you'll have a sense of the mind your awareness as something separate
This sense of separate is a very important part of the practice
It's part of the daytoday work of practicing the Dhamma
We all come to the practice hoping that some day some really great experiences are going to hit us while we're meditating
Well they're not going to hit unless you do the daytoday practice
This is why the Buddha insisted that there are four noble truths not just the truth of the cessation of suffering but also the tasks of understanding suffering abandoning its cause and developing the path
These are all very important parts of the teaching
They're all noble truths
The development of the path is largely two things
One developing qualities that enhance the mind's ability to know to be aware
And then two learning how to let go of things that are burdensome to the mind
This is what it means to heighten the mind
Once you let go of the burdens the mind gets lighter and begins to rise above things
Learning how to do this in all activities is very important because when the really Technicolor experiences hit in the meditation if you can't rise above them you're just going to fall for them too
And they eventually lead you back into the world again
Your attachments lead you back
So a large part of the practice is learning how to lift your mind stage by stage
You lift it above your ordinary everyday activities and you get into a good state of concentration
In the beginning the mind and the object seem to become one when you're really absorbed
But as you allow the mind to stay in that state for a while it begins to separate out as well
You begin to see the object as one thing your awareness as something else and although they're right next to each other they are separate things
This is what enables the mind to gain insight both into the workings of the mind and into the workings of its objects
It also develops the habit of learning how to let go stage by stage
You rise from one level of concentration to the next to the next
You pull back
The image in the texts is of a person sitting up looking at a person lying down or a person standing looking at a person sitting
You pull back bit by bit by bit stage by stage
No matter how good the stage you begin to realize you've got to lift above it
This is especially important when really strong experiences come in the meditation
You don't jump to any conclusions
Again you lift the mind above them and watch
Hopefully by that time the habit has become builtin enough so that you realize you can't allow yourself to get attached to anything even the really amazing experiences
Lift yourself up rung by rung by rung along the ladder
You go from one attachment to a higher one to a higher one
Finally though there comes a point where you have to let go and just watch what happens
Only when you've developed this habit of lifting the mind up can you get through some of these experiences that waylay everyone else along the meditation path
We're not just here for the experiences
We're learning the basic skills we need so that no matter what experience comes to the mind we don't fall for it
We don't latch onto it so that we don't become a slave to it  for the whole purpose of the practice is freedom and yet the habits of the mind tend toward selfenslavement
Even when great feelings of oneness or unity or unlimitedness come into the mind you find on a very subtle level that the mind can become enslaved to them as well
And the question is how instead of becoming enslaved or enthralled you can learn even from that kind of experience
Ultimately the mind has to become totally free even from the state of oneness even from the state of unlimitedness because a lot of those experiences are just states of concentration
There's still a subtle level of attachment and conditioning going on
But if you develop the habit of learning how to let go and rise above things even while you live in the midst of them then you've developed the proper habits the skills you need that are going to protect you in all circumstances
There's a fine passage in one of Ajaan Maha Boowa's talks where at the time of Ajaan Mun's death he sits and reflects
At first he feels lost
Here is the teacher he was able to depend on for so long and now that teacher is gone
What is he going to do
After a while he begins to realize Well what were the things he taught when he was alive
Take those as your teachers And one constant theme was Whatever arises in the mind if you don't get caught up with it but just stay with that sense of knowing with the knowing as separate from the event in the mind then no matter what that experience will pose no dangers for you
This skill of learning how to step back step back raise the mind above its experiences This is what's truly distinctive about the Buddha's teachings
This is what's distinctive about his approach to the really spectacular nondual experiences in the mind
If you haven't learned how to develop that approach to ordinary experiences in the mind  looking for the use of the experiences rather than trying to feed on them  then the spectacular ones are going to eat you up whole
This is why the habits developed along the path are so important
This is why the path is one of the four noble truths on a par with the others
So keep this teaching in mind this issue of the heightened mind
Watch out for when you allow the mind to lie beneath its objects under the power of its objects and when you're able to lift it up above them so that even though you live with them you have a sense of rising above them of being able to use them of not being caught up in them
That's the skill we're working on
We just chanted about having respect for concentration
This is an important principle to keep in mind because all too often the stillness of our minds is something we step on
An idea pops into our heads and we go running after it
We leave our home base very quickly and then find it hard to get back
We've got to learn how to make concentration our normal state of mind centered present alert to the body alert to things going on
It's not that you don't sense other things when you're concentrated or that you don't register them with your senses at all
Simply that the mind doesn't move out after them
The mind stays firmly based in the breath its home base and from there it protects that sense of being centered looks after it maintains it
This is the only way that concentration can grow can develop the real stability we need to withstand whatever comes up
Too many times I've heard people say Now that my mind is calm what do I do next They're in a great hurry to jump to the next step to run off into insight
But before the mind can gain any liberating insight it has to overcome its impatience to move
You need to get it very solid very secure because when you start working on the issues of insight  trying to understand why greed anger and delusion take over the mind  you're going to find yourself running up against all kinds of storms
If your concentration isn't really solid and settled you'll just get blown away
So you have to respect this part of the path
After all it's the heart of the path
The Buddha once said that right concentration forms the heart of the noble eightfold path while all the other factors of the path are simply requisites supports for the right concentration to keep it right to keep it on track
So have some respect for this quality of mind
Look after it
Sometimes it seems like we're going against the Buddha's teachings on inconstancy stress and not self when we focus on putting the mind in a state that's constant easeful and ours
We get really absorbed in this sense of oneness and we come to identify with it both with the stillness and with the object of the stillness as well
It all becomes one
So it seems like we're running counter to what insight is supposed to tell us
But what we're actually doing is testing the limits of human effort
We're taking the khandhas  these aggregates of body feeling perception thoughtfabrications and consciousness  and instead of identifying with them we use them as tools
And as part of the process of mastering them as tools there will have to be a sense of identification
You identify with the state of concentration whatever sense of the body is present in the concentration whatever feelings perceptions thoughtfabrications and consciousness are there
That's why you become so devoted to them
They all turn into a oneness
But instead of simply identifying with them you're also treating them as the path
That makes all the difference
You bring things together and once they're brought together you can sort them out for what they are
If everything is scattered all over the place it's hard to see how things interact it's hard to see where the connections are and where the lines are drawn between them
But when you get them all right here gathered into one then once they've been staying together for long while they begin to separate out
Ajaan Lee has a nice image of taking a rock and putting it in a fire
When the various elements in the rock reach their melting point they melt out of the rock one at a time
That's how they separate
The same holds true with all the things you're going to try to understand and gain insight into
Once they've been together a long period of time gathered here in a sense of oneness they begin to separate out
And all you have to do is ask the question What's this
Is this the same as that And then you just watch
You begin to see that there's a natural dividing line between these things
But until you've brought the mind to oneness in concentration you can't really see that
All the dividing lines you see are the ones imposed by words and ideas by preconceived notions
Put those preconceived notions aside and just focus on getting the mind centered
You're sitting here in concentration trying to get the concentration as refined and as solid as possible
When you get up to leave don't drop it
Try to maintain it
An image they use in the Canon is of a person carrying a bowl on his head filled to the brim with oil
Try to develop that same sense of balance care and mindfulness
As you get up from concentration and go to wherever you're spending the night try to maintain that sense of being centered and poised
Don't let it spill
This is one aspect of having respect for concentration trying to maintain it throughout the course of the day not letting yourself get distracted outside
Again you'll be aware of outside things people to talk to work to be done the sounds of the birds the wind in the trees
These things will all be present to your awareness but you won't send your attention out after them
Try to keep your center here inside
As you develop this continuity it becomes your habitual center of awareness your habitual point of reference
The movement of other things in relation to that center becomes very clear
In other words the impulse to go out and see something You'll see it exactly as that  a current or a physical sensation in certain parts of the body that runs or flows out after things
If you can catch sight of it you'll see Oh that's what happens when the mind focuses its attention outside There's both a mental and a physical side to that change of reference
When your sense of clear awareness is still enough you can see these things as they move
The more still your frame of reference the more refined the movements you can notice in the mind
So this element of stillness is very important
Without it insight is just words ideas things you picked up from books
But with it insight is seeing things as they actually happen as they actually move
So this is the basis from which insight comes the insight that leads to release
You begin to observe the movements you used to ride on because now you're not riding on them any more
You see these movements of the mind as they flash out but you don't go flashing with them
That's what makes all the difference
If you ride out with them that's just the way of the normal mind
But if there's a sense of being centered inside you can see the movements of the mind as they go out as thoughts go out as perceptions go out latching onto things
You see them as they actually happen
You begin to wonder Why would I ever want to identify with that
That's when the possibility of release comes
But this can happen only when you're really really still
And to be still you'll need a sense of wellbeing here in the present moment
Otherwise the mind won't stay
For the concentration to stay solid and unforced you want to feel good being right here
You work with the breath in whatever way will help you to settle down to stay clear and centered
As you use the breath to work through pain in the body you'll find that some pains you can deal with and some pains you can't but the only way you'll know is by experimenting
If there are pains you can't disperse by adjusting the breath you learn to live with them
You learn not to identify with them
You're aware of them but there's a sense of separation between the sense of awareness and the pain
That makes it bearable
If you're going to identify with certain parts of the body identify with the good ones
Find the parts of the body where you can maintain a sense of wellbeing through the breathing
Focus on those
Those become your center your point of reference in the midst of this moving world
Allow your awareness to settle in on the breath and get aligned with the body
It takes a little experimenting to find exactly what amount of pressure is needed what amount of force is needed to stay with the breath and the body in a way that's just right
If the pressure is too light the mind goes drifting off
If it's too heavy the body starts feeling constricted the mind starts feeling constricted and it's going to look for a way to get out
So try to see precisely what amount of mindfulness and alertness is needed just to keep the body and mind together right at the breath
The breath will be a good barometer to let you know when the pressure is too much when it's too little  but you've got to know how to read the barometer
This is why we practice meditation day after day after day to get more familiar with our barometer
To begin with you can focus your awareness at any one spot in the body where the sensation of breathing is very clear
It might be the tip of the nose the throat the middle of the chest the abdomen any spot where you know clearly Now the breath is coming in now the breath is going out There's a sense of rightness about the spot it's an easy spot to maintain your focus
This may seem strange this emphasis on ease and comfort in the meditation after everything we've heard about the Buddha's teachings on pain stress and suffering
But you have to look carefully at what he says about pain stress and suffering and also what he has to say about pleasure
Look at the four noble truths
Truth number one of course is stress and suffering
But buried down in number four the path you find the most important factor of the path right concentration which involves getting the mind focused on the breath with a sense of ease and rapture
This rapture comes from seclusion seclusion here meaning that you're not thinking about past not thinking about the future you're right here with the present moment
Things are settling in and there's a snugness to how things feel
It feels good it feels secure being right here
Look at what the Buddha has to say about the tasks with regard to each of the noble truths
The task with regard to stress and suffering is to comprehend it
The task with regard to the path is to develop it which means you want to develop that sense of ease the sense of rapture that comes as the mind begins to settle down in concentration
What you're doing is taking one of the aggregates  the aggregate of feeling  and instead of latching onto it or pushing it away you learn how to use it as a tool
When pain and stress and suffering come you want to comprehend them
Comprehending pain and stress teaches you a lot about the mind
The Buddha never said that life is suffering
He just said there's suffering in life which is a very different teaching
As long as there's going to be pain as long as there's going to be suffering get the most use out of them
You find as you focus on pain  as you get to know it get to comprehend it  that you learn all kinds of things about how the mind is working
In particular you learn to see what it's doing to take a physical pain and turn it into mental pain  or if you're starting with mental pain to make it worse
But to watch that feeling of pain long enough and consistently enough so that you can comprehend it the mind needs strength it needs nourishment
Otherwise it gets drained
That's where the pleasure in the path comes in
That's your nourishment
Try to create a sense of wellbeing in the mind as it's focused in the present moment so that it doesn't feel threatened by the pain doesn't feel drained by the pain so that you always have a place to go when you need that strength
What we're doing is taking one of the aggregates that we usually cling to Clinging here doesn't mean just holding on
It also means trying to push away and pushing away is like pushing away a glob of tar
The more you push it away the more you get stuck
So instead of clinging or pushing away we try to learn how to use these aggregates as tools in the same way you'd use tar to make asphalt for paving a road
This is a common theme running throughout the Buddha's teachings Before you can let go of anything you have to learn how to master it
Otherwise you're just holding on pushing away holding on pushing away
And nothing comes from that except more stress more suffering more pain
This harms not only you but also the people around you
If you're constantly feeling worn down by the pains and the inconveniences of life you'll find it hard to be kind to other people
In fact most of the evil things people do in their lives come from their sense of being totally overwhelmed feeling weak and trapped and then lashing out
But if you give the mind the sense of strength and security that comes with knowing it has a center it can return to and gain nourishment from it's a gift not only to yourself but also to the people around you
It's not a selfish practice
Learn how not to hold onto feelings grabbing hold of the pleasant ones pushing the painful ones away
Instead learn how to use them as tools
When they're used as tools they open things up in the mind
You understand where the mind is unskillful in how it manages its thinking and you realize that you don't have to be unskillful
There are better ways to think better ways to manage the thought processes in the mind
And a funny thing happens
As you master these processes they bring you to a point where everything reaches equilibrium
That's where you can really let go
You can even let go of your tools at that point because they've taken you where you want to go
From that point on everything opens up to the Deathless
But you can't get there by pushing and pulling your way around
If the Deathless were something you could force your way into everybody would have gone to nibbana a long time ago
It requires a lot of finesse a lot of skill in how you deal with the mind learning to recognize the time for analyzing issues of stress and suffering and the time for letting the mind rest so it that it can gain strength and then go back to work
The ultimate skill is learning how to put those two things together
In other words you develop states of concentration to give the mind a really solid center and from that center you can begin to let go of things that are obviously unskillful things you obviously don't want to hang on to
Then when you've let go of everything else you turn on that pleasant center you've been developing and take it apart
But all too often we've read the books that tell us what comes next in the practice and we want to get on to insight as fast as possible
In doing so we tend to destroy the very quality that's going to help us this ability to get the mind aligned with the body in a way that feels just right and then to use the strength use the nourishment the comes from that the stillness and ease the steadiness that comes from that
Only then can you really gain insight
In other words you just can't jump over concentration or go rushing through the various levels
It's something you want to settle down into so that you can stay still calm for long periods of time
And when you can stay that way during your formal sitting you take it out and try to maintain that same calm center no matter where you go no matter what happens
That's when you really gain interesting insights into the mind seeing how it goes flowing out after things rushing to grab hold of this rushing to push that away
The Buddha talks about effluents in the mind things flowing out of the mind and when you can maintain your center you actually get a physical sense of the energy flowing out as the mind loses its alignment with the body and goes out after its objects
The trick is learning how to maintain that still steady observer so that you can see the movement and realize you don't have to go along with it
The movement is something separate
The knower is something separate
And the movement dies away
When you have that separation clearly delineated you can see even more clearly which of the mind's actions are skillful and which are not
You begin to see cause and effect in a way that really opens things up in the mind
So we carry these five khandhas these aggregates around with us and the wisdom of the Buddha is in taking these aggregates that tend to weigh us down like big lumps of metal in a suitcase and opening up the suitcase to look inside
That's when you begin to see that they're not just lumps of metal
They're tools tools that you can apply to dismantling your attachments so you don't have to lug things around any more
Use them to cut away your obvious attachments and then finally when everything else is taken care of you can let go of your attachments to the tools themselves
But until that point you want to take good care of them  not to the point of worshipping them but careful enough that they stay in good shape so you can actually use them
This is why the Buddha didn't teach selftorment but he didn't teach selfindulgence either
The middle path between the two is not half indulgence and half torment
It's learning how to regard these aggregates as tools
You've got aggregates of form feeling perception thoughtfabrications and consciousness
Learn how to treat them as tools showing them the proper care and attention that tools need but also realizing that they're not the beall and endall of life
They're processes not things
They've got their uses but they're not ends in and of themselves
Once you've got that point clear the path opens up
So many people accuse the Buddha of being pessimistic He starts his teachings with pain
And yet when you first sit and meditate what do you find after the first five or ten minutes
Pain
You can't avoid it
Or when people just can't sit by themselves can't spend a whole day by themselves without busying themselves with this that or the other thing what's the problem
It's mental pain mental discomfort
These are things we live with all the time and yet we think somehow that if people point them out they're being pessimistic
Of course the Buddha's purpose in pointing out pain and suffering wasn't just to stop right there pointing them out and saying Isn't that horrible He says Look
There's a solution In fact his approach to pain is extremely optimistic Human beings can put an end to suffering in this lifetime through their own efforts
So when we sit here we have to anticipate that there will be pain in sitting still
The reason we normally move around is because we encounter pain in a particular posture so we change a little bit to get away from it
The Buddha's approach isn't to try to run away from it that way
He says Look into it
As Ajaan Suwat used to say We normally take our cravings as our friends and our pains as our enemies
We should switch that around
Learn to look at pain as your friend and craving as your enemy The craving is what's really causing all the problems
The pain is just there to teach you something
Of course it's a difficult friend
Some people are easy to be friends with you can get along with them with no problem at all
Others are difficult
Pain is definitely a difficult friend but one worth cultivating
Still because it's difficult you have to go about it the right way
This is why when we start meditating the Buddha doesn't have us focus immediately on the pain
He says to focus on the breath instead because whatever pain is associated with the breath  and it tends to be subtle but it is there  is something you can manage something you can deal with
He gives you the breath as your tool for dealing with the pain
So when you're aware of pain don't yet let your primary focus be on the pain
Keep your focus on the breath
In other words get used to being acquainted with the breath first because that's the person who'll introduce you to pain properly
It's like meeting any important person You first have to get to know certain wellconnected friends who can introduce you to that person
And that's the way it is with pain You have to know the breath first for it's your wellconnected friend
So get in touch with the breath
Find a place in the body that's relatively at ease relatively comfortable and focus there first get to know that spot first be very sensitive to the breathing at that spot
When you breathe in there how does it feel
When you breathe out there how does it feel
Is there even the slightest discomfort
Can you make it feel better
Can you experiment with different ways of breathing different ways of conceiving the breath energy in your body
When you find something that feels really good the whole tone of your body will feel really good
Instead of sitting here tensely trying to breathe in one spot think of the whole body relaxing into the breath
The more relaxed you are about the practice the longer you'll be able to stay with it
So think of yourself as just relaxing into the body relaxing into the breath
Find a way of breathing that feels really good  all the way from the beginning to the end as it goes in and all the way from the beginning to the end as it goes out
Make that your foundation
Once that feels good think of spreading that good breath energy to the other parts of the body
Think of it as going right through the pain
Many times a lot of the discomfort we feel around pain comes from tensing up around it and the tensing up just makes things worse
So try to breathe through any tension you feel
Breathe right through the pain all the way on out
Suppose there's a pain in your hip or in your knee Think of the breath going through the hip through the knee all the way out through the toes as you breathe in and out into the air as you breathe out
As you approach the pain try to maintain the same mental tone and feeling tone you had when focusing on the comfortable breath
Your primary frame of reference here should still be the breath
There's no way you're not going to notice the pain but ask yourself How does the breath affect the pain
How does the pain affect the breath Always keep the breath in mind as your frame of reference
That gives you a handle on the pain
Otherwise if you jump right into the pain you find yourself picking up the energy from the pain that puts you on edge
The first thing you'll think will be Make the pain go away And then there's even more impatience as you get involved in the past and the future of the pain
But when you stay with the breath you want to be as much with the present as possible
Don't think about how long the pain has been there or how long it's going to stay
Just What's there right now That takes one huge burden off the mind right there
So as you go through the pain make the thread of your awareness stay with the breath
That's what you want to keep track of that's what you want to hold onto
Learn to relate to the pain through the breath rather than just butting up against the pain headon
Now if you find that the pain just gets worse and worse and worse to the point where you can't stand it sit with it another five minutes and then change your position
In other words push your limits a bit at a time and you'll find that you get better and better at staying with the pain more skillful in maintaining your frame of reference with the breath
As long as you really stay with the breath you'll be okay
Slipping away from the breath is what creates the problems because the mind then immediately creates stories about the pain creates issues around the pain Why is this pain happening to me Or if it's a physical pain that you know you caused Why did I do that All these questions  How much longer is it going to last
Am I going to have this pain the rest of my life  just drop them right now
Stay with the breath
Deal immediately in the present because the past and the future are not actually there
They are things the mind creates and once they're created they turn around and bite the mind
So try to stay with that thread of the breath as it goes through the pain
Then you'll begin to see why the Buddha focused on pain as the primary spiritual issue in our practice for it teaches you so much about the mind
It's like filming a documentary on the animals in the desert If you go out and spend the day wandering around the desert you'll probably miss most of the animals
But if you set up your camera at a safe place near the water hole hours a day all of the animals in the area are going to have to come there
That's where you get to film them all
It's the same with the pain
If you focus steadily on the pain you'll see all the mind's reactions around the pain
All its issues will come to the surface and congregate there
At the same time if you use the breath as your tool for dealing with the pain those issues won't totally overwhelm you
It's like having a safe shelter to run to if the lions object to being filmed
You've got a safe place in the breath
You're not totally at the mercy of the pain
You can pull out any time you want and you've got a handle to deal with it
You've established a feeling tone around the whole body that holds the pain not grasping onto it but surrounding it with an energy surrounding it with a space where you're not threatened by it
Then you can deal with it
When you're not threatened you can really get into the present moment
If you find that you can't yet handle it you've got the breath to go back to
But when things get stable enough in the mind clear enough in the mind so that you can handle it then you really can start looking at the pain as your friend
You can get familiar enough with it so that ultimately you can understand it for what it truly is so that ultimately it's no longer a problem
Until that point it's always going to be a difficult friend but if you start off on the right foot using the breath as the basis of your friendship you'll find that you're in a good position to make the friendship work
Our basic problem in life is that the most important thing in our lives is the thing we know the least about our own minds
As the Buddha said all things come out of the mind  all our experiences all the happiness and all the pain we experience come from the mind
All things have the mind as their forerunner
Things are made of the mind determined by the mind  and yet we don't know our minds so our lives are out of control
We don't understand where things come from or how things happen in our lives
That's why we have to meditate  to get to know our own minds
The difficulty in meditation is that you can't focus directly on the mind
It's like focusing on the wind up in a sky with no clouds  you have no way of knowing which direction it's going because there's nothing against which it's going to make contact
That's why you need a meditation object like the breath or buddho or parts of the body
Whichever object you find easy to settle down with that's the one you take
Having an object gives the mind something to bounce off of  because when you decide you're going to stay with something you begin to see how erratic the mind is
It keeps jumping around
It goes here a little while then it goes there for a little while and then over there
You begin to realize how this most important element in life  the mind  is so totally out of control totally undependable
That's why the mind needs training
We need to strap it down to one object and make it stay there so that we can really get to know it and train it until we sense that we can depend on it
We talk about taking refuge in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha but they can be our refuge only when we bring them into the mind
And the mind can be dependable only when we've got the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha in there qualities like mindfulness concentration persistence and dependability
So if you want to depend on the mind make it something you can depend on
The Buddha's good news is that it's possible to do this
At the time the Buddha was teaching there were other teachers who said that there is nothing that you can do about the way life is it's all written in the stars
Others said that no matter what we do any action leads to more suffering so the only way to stop suffering is to stop acting
And still others said that life is totally chaotic there's no way you can make any sense out of it at all so don't try
Just try to have as much fun as you can while you can because everything falls apart at death
So there were all kinds of teachings but they were all teachings lacking in hope
The Buddha's teaching was the only one that offered any hope
He said yes there is a skill that you can develop in training the mind and yes it does lead to true happiness
So just as with developing any skill you have to be observant stick with it be sensitive to what you're doing be sensitive to the results make necessary changes or adjustments and as a result you keep getting better and better and better at it
Sometimes the improvement is hard to see because it's so incremental
It takes such tiny tiny steps but you can rest assured that whatever positive energy you put into the practice is going to produce positive results
That's also part of the good news of the Buddha's teachings
Nothing good you do is wasted
No effort that you put into Right Effort is wasted
So we have conviction in the Buddha's teaching because he teaches us to have conviction in ourselves  that the practice is something we can do
We don't have to depend on anything from the outside at all
Your own power your own potential That's what's going to get you where you want to go
If you have to depend on others you don't really know if you can depend on them or not
Will they be there when you need them
They might change their minds
After all you have no control over things outside of you
Even though you currently may not have much control over the mind you can still work at it and develop more and more control over time
Tell the mind to sit down and stay in one place often enough and eventually it will stay
It's going to rebel for a while but if you use your ingenuity in teaching it  showing it that in being obedient this way it won't always have to be struggling or suffering  it's going to find that it actually likes settling down
And then you can hardly keep it from settling down  it wants to keep coming back coming back coming back to the state of stillness feeling at home in the present moment
This is why we adjust the breath in the practice to help the mind settle down easily
And we work to get to know the breath
What are the different ways it has of coming in
What are the different ways it has of going out
How does it affect the rest of the body
When the breath comes in and out it's not just the air coming in and out of the lungs
It's the energy that courses through the whole body throughout every nerve
Think about the whole nervous system going down from the brain down the backbone out the arms out the legs encompassing all the parts of the body
Then allow yourself to think that the entire system can be affected by the breath if you let it happen
Let the whole body relax and get into the breathing
Let your mind get into the breathing
Don't think of yourself as being outside someplace looking at the breath
Be immersed in the process of breathing
The whole body breathes in
The whole body breathes out
And you're right in there with it
After you work at this for a while you begin to find that the work pays off
It really feels good feels gratifying just to sit here breathing
The mind has a sense of being at home
If the mind were to go out to think of other things you'd be sending it out into a territory it totally has to create for itself
But you don't have to create much right here in the present moment
When you're really with the breath you're putting much less of a strain on the mind
And when the mind gets used to this it decides that it really likes it
Until it decides that it likes it you have to use both the carrot and the stick
The carrot is the comfortable sensation of breathing the stick is the constant reminder of what's going to happen if the mind doesn't come under control if it isn't willing to settle down  all the suffering and pain that you'll have to endure
The Buddha said that when people suffer when there's pain in life they have two kinds of reactions
One is bewilderment because they don't know where the pain comes from or why it's happening
The second reaction is the desire to get free of the pain one way or another
And these two reactions go hand in hand
You're bewildered at the same time that you're trying to get free and so you tend to do all kinds of unskillful things to get away from the pain things that aren't helpful at all
But through practice you come to realize that the pain in the body isn't the culprit
The pain in the mind  the mental anguish the mental distress That's the real problem
When you really get to know the mind you see that the pain in the body isn't such a big deal at all
It becomes a problem only when the mind takes it on and converts it into mental pain but to understand mental pain you have to work with physical pain
So after the mind has settled down focus it on the pain pain in the legs pain in the back whatever
Just get to know it as it's actually present
What is this pain
Is it what you think it is
Try to see the pain on its own  simply as a sensation and not as a pain  without all the presuppositions you may have about it that it's placed right here that it has this shape that it's taken over the body or whatever crazy notion the mind has about the pain
When you think about it most of the notions you've developed about pain were developed when you were really small because that's when you first met up with pain
The first thing they do when you're born is to spank you so you can breathe
And even before they spank you going through the process of birth is enough to make you pass out
So we've been dealing with pain ever since we were small and for most of us the strategies we've been using are those we picked up when we were so small that we didn't know what was going on
A lot of those strategies are still there in your mind
So just sit down and get to know the pain
Simply regarding the pain as something you want to know changes a lot of your subconscious attitudes toward it right there
Your usual attitude is that once there's pain you want to get rid of it to get away from it
Of course if you keep running away from it you're never going to get to know it you'll never get to understand it and this means that you'll end up dealing with pain more and more out of bewilderment
So once the mind has settled down in the sense of wellbeing fostered by the breath tell yourself that it's time to get to know the pain make friends with the pain  not so you can live with pain forever but so you can really understand how far the pain goes and how far the mind goes and where the two are actually separate
Be sure that your purpose is to get to know the pain not so much to make it go away but to thoroughly understand it
The understanding is what will enable you to get beyond it in ways you didn't expect The mind can be with the pain and yet not be pained by it
This is an important skill to develop because as long as there's a body there's going to be pain
The question is not how to run away from it but how to live with it so as not to be pained by it
Realize that the pain is simply happening not necessarily happening to you
It's just happening
It's an event
It has no intention to harm you at all
You feel pained by it because you put yourself in the way by laying claim to the part of the body where the pain seems to be
It's like getting into the line of fire You're bound to get shot
So don't get into the line of fire
Don't lay any claim to it
See that the pain is just something that's there and that it's going to come and it's going to go in line with its own causes and effects
Your only duty is to watch it to see what it's really like for there to be pain
Simply be there with the pure sensation in the moment
How does it move around
How does it change
Exactly what about it is painful
What's the mind doing to the pain when the mind labels it
What effect does that have
If you can catch that event in the mind  the mind saying This is this and that is that this is the pain and it's doing this and all of the other running commentary that the mind makes on the present moment  then you begin to realize this in itself is a lot of the problem right there
The fear that the pain is going to stay the anticipation that it's going to stay all these thoughts Just let them drop away
See what happens
Where does the pain go when they drop away
By watching this your whole attitude toward the pain changes because you come to see that it isn't at all what you thought it was
And at the same time you learn an awful lot about your mind  all the things that the mind comes in and says about the pain
It's as if you have a whole committee offering their suggestions and opinions
So this is a very good way of getting to know the mind because a lot of things buried in the mind will tend to surface and focus on what's happening when there's pain
Instead of trying to run away from the pain you just sit with it and see what kind of reaction comes up in the mind
Again don't identify with the reactions
The reactions will say Stop stop stop Or they'll say This is this and that's that and you should do this and you should do that Just respond No I'm just going to be here
I'm just going to watch And watch both the pain and the mind's reactions to the pain
This is how you really get to know the mind while training it to become more and more dependable
If the mind isn't shaken by pain there's very little that's going to shake it
If it doesn't fear pain there's very little for it to fear
And when it's not afraid in the face of pain it becomes a mind you can depend on
When you want it to work it will work for you
When you want it to rest it will rest
When you want it to think it can think  and it will think clearly
When the time comes for it to stop thinking it will stop
We've spent so much of our lives developing fear of pain fear of suffering
If you can get past that fear get past the mind's tendency to be pushed around by these things you've got a mind you can rely on
As when they train soldiers They have to put the soldiers through all kinds of hell in order to know which ones they can depend on and which ones they can't
The ones who come through it okay Those are the ones you know you can depend on
It's the same with the mind
If you're afraid to face up to pain the mind will never have any control over itself at all
It will never become something you really can depend on
It will always flinch under the pain unwilling to do this unwilling to do that because it's afraid
And when that's what your mind is like where are you going to find anything to depend on
Where are your true friends at that point
Even your own mind isn't a friend
So when the mind has settled down and really feels at home in the present moment working with pain is an excellent way of training it
Through this you can come to see that the mind will obey you not only when you make it comfortable but also when you test it when you give it work to do
That's when you have a mind you can really take as your refuge
Let your mind settle in
Stay with the breath
There's nowhere else you have to go nothing else you have to do right now
Just be with your breathing
When the breath comes in you know it's coming in
When the breath goes out you know it's going out
Allow it to come in and go out in a way that feels good and refreshing
If you're feeling tired you may want to breathe in a way that's energizing
If you're feeling frenetic breathe in a way that's more calming
Gain a sense of what the breath can do for the body and the mind here in the present moment
Do what you can to put the mind in a good mood
In other words if you approach the process of meditation with a lot of anxiety with a lot of frustration that anxiety and frustration will show up in the breath and simply make things worse
So remind yourself Not too much is demanded of you right now just being with the breath
If you notice you've wandered off just bring the mind right back
If it wanders off again bring it back again and try to make the breath even more comfortable
As you keep at this you find that the mind develops a stronger and stronger foundation a place where it can stay a place where it really feels safe where it feels at home where it can look at the larger issues in life and not mess them up
The Buddha talks about suffering as his number one truth and when we hear about that many of us want to run away
We feel that we have enough suffering in life we don't want to hear about it anymore
But the Buddha's whole reason for teaching about suffering is because he has a cure
To work that cure though you first have to get the mind in good shape because most of us when we deal with suffering simply make the issue worse
We feel threatened by it we feel surrounded by it we start getting desperate and in our desperation we do all kinds of things that are harmful both to ourselves and to people around us
So first get the mind in a good mood
All you need is the breath coming in and out with a sense of wellbeing
If you're really observant and become familiar with the breath over time you find that that sense of wellbeing starts permeating throughout other parts of your life as well
And when you've got a sense of wellbeing you can depend on then you can turn to the issue of suffering to see exactly what suffering is looking at it not so much out of desperation as out of curiosity
As the Buddha said the best way to deal with suffering is to comprehend it as in the passage we chanted just now
He said most people don't discern suffering
We suffer we feel it but we don't discern it we don't understand it
The Buddha said that if you understand it you can manage it you can put an end to it
If you don't understand it you just keep on suffering and never put an end to it at all
In his first sermon he describes suffering the suffering of birth the suffering of aging the suffering of illness the suffering of death of being separated from what you love of being conjoined with things you don't like of not getting what you want
That seems to be a pretty good summation but then he boils it down to even more basic terms
This is where the discussion gets technical
He analyses suffering down to five heaps five clingingaggregates form imbued with clinging feeling imbued with clinging perceptions thoughtfabrications and consciousness all imbued with clinging
The clinging is the important element
It's what turns ordinary form feeling and so forth into suffering
We're often told that these aggregates are the Buddha's description of what we are but that wasn't his purpose in formulating this teaching
His purpose was to give us tools for breaking suffering down into manageable pieces
For most of us suffering is an enormous issue much larger and more pressing than the abstract question of who or what we are
When suffering comes it overwhelms us
We can't stand up under its weight
In fact that's one of the traditional definitions of suffering that which is hard to bear
And it's hard to bear because we feel overwhelmed
When it hits hard it seems like an enormous mountain filling our awareness
We can't get a handle on it
The purpose of dividing it into these five heaps is to break the mountain down into gravel and the gravel down into dust
This helps us realize that no matter what the type of suffering  whether it's the suffering of aging illness death the suffering of separation the suffering of not getting what we want  it can all be analyzed into just five sorts of things
That's all it is
And furthermore we can look at these five sorts of things and see that there's nothing there worth suffering over
We build enormous narratives around our pains but what are those narratives
They're just perceptions combined with the thoughtfabrications built out of them
If we cling to those narratives they're going to make us suffer
But if we take them apart we see that there's nothing much there
So the Buddha has us focus not so much on the story line but on the building blocks we use to put the story line together
If you get down to the building blocks you begin to see how artificial this whole process is  because these aggregates are not things
They're actually activities things we do
We suffer because we cling to certain activities certain movements of the mind
So to cut through this clinging you have to keep breaking your suffering down and analyzing it What's going on here
Suppose there's a pain in your leg and you're suffering from it
What's going on there
There's the form of the body and then there are the actual feelings of pain
And then there are the perceptions the labels you put on the feeling the thoughtfabrications the stories you build around the feeling and then the consciousness the repeated acts of being conscious of all these things
So instead of building up the stories around the feeling  getting angry about the feeling getting upset about it worrying about it  if the mind is calm enough you can start taking the suffering surrounding the feeling apart
What's going on
What's actually there
There's the form of the body which is actually separate from the feeling although we often glom the two together
If there's a pain in our knee it feels like our whole knee is nothing but pain
But if you look at it carefully there's the form of your body and then there are the feelings flickering around the form
They're not a single solid thing
Many times we perceive the feeling to be a solid thing but now we're taking that perception apart
Actually there's not just one perception
There are many repeated perceptions just as there are many moments of feeling
This is why these things are called khandhas or heaps
Like heaps of gravel or heaps of sand they're made out of small individual events small individual motions either physical motions or mental motions
So you break them down break them down
And once they're broken down they're not too big to handle
You can change them
For example those perceptions you applied to the feelings What happens if you change them from perceptions of pain to simply perceptions of sensation
Or you can try to analyze the sensation into its physical aspects the sensation of warmth or heat or maybe a sense of blockage that feels solid
If you actually take those solid feelings apart though you begin to see they're not so solid after all
Then there are the stories you build up around the sensations the fears of what will happen if you don't do something about the pain
If you sit here for the next hour is your leg going to fall off
Will you harm the tissues of the body by cutting off the blood
The mind can build up all sorts of stories about the sensations but instead of looking at the stories and getting caught up in the story line just look at them as words coming through the mind without your having to believe them
Simply watch the stories as individual words
Then you begin to see that if you cling to the story line you make the pain worse
So why cling to it
You don't have to follow the story line
It's not a movie you've paid to see
You're not missing anything important if you don't follow it through to the end
So what you want to do is take the suffering apart into its component parts and locate the clinging that turns those component parts into the suffering
If you take each component part on it's own it's not all that bad
The aggregate itself is not suffering
There can be a pain in the leg but we suffer simply because we identify with it we lay claim to it as ours
That's why we suffer
Without the act of identification without the clinging there would be no suffering
The mental label that says mine or my pain my leg or whatever What happens if you drop it
You don't have to think it
There's nobody forcing you to think it
There's simply the force of habit
And habits can be changed
As you take the suffering apart into little bits and pieces like this it's a lot more manageable
Many times the pain may still be there but there's no suffering
Or sometimes when you're not worked up about it the pain actually goes away
Some physical pains are physical in their causes others are more mental in theirs
Even physical pain has its mental component as the mind chooses which sensations to focus on and which ones to ignore which ones to downplay and which ones to magnify with its stories and running commentary
You can see this mental component clearly when you stop the commentary or when you just step back and watch the commentary as you would something curious and say Well why would I believe that and suddenly the suffering goes away
Whether or not the pain is still there the suffering is gone
That's when you see that the issue was not the pain but the unnecessary suffering you created by clinging to these feelings and perceptions
When you see clearly the things you've been clinging to and that they're not really worth clinging to the suffering breaks down
The mountain is leveled and pulverized into dust
When you've mastered this skill that's the end of suffering
We meditate developing mindfulness developing concentration and after a while we begin to wonder When is the discernment going to come
When are the insights going to come So it's instructive to look at the Buddha's analysis of what gives rise to discernment
Mindfulness and concentration are prerequisites but there's more
And in searching for that more it's especially instructive to look at two sets of qualities that the Buddha said lead to Awakening  the five strengths and the seven factors for Awakening  to learn their lessons on what gives rise to discernment what's needed for insights to arise
Otherwise you can meditate for twenty thirty forty years  as Ajaan Lee says you could die and your body could dry out on the spot  and still not gain any discernment because you're lacking some of the proper qualities
The five strengths  a set of factors that culminate in discernment  are interesting because they start out not with ideas that you've heard from someone else in terms of what Buddhist discernment is about
They start with the quality of conviction
Conviction in what
Conviction in the principle of kamma
That's what it comes down to  conviction in the principle that our actions do matter
Some people have problems with the teaching on kamma but what exactly is the Buddha asking you to believe in when he asks you to have conviction in kamma
First action really is happening  it's not an illusion
Second you really are responsible for your actions
There's no outside force like the stars or some good or evil being acting through you
When you're conscious you're the one who decides what to do
Third your actions have results  you're not just writing on the water  and those results can be good or bad depending on the quality of the intention behind the act
So the teaching on kamma puts you in charge of shaping your life
It's a good teaching to believe in
And how does this relate to discernment
It provides the basis for the questions you're going to ask to give rise to discernment
And because the principle of kamma places a lot of emphasis on the need to act on skillful intentions to get the good results you want the basic question becomes How can you tell whether an intention is skillful or unskillful
Together with conviction you need the quality of heedfulness the realization that if you're not careful about your actions you can create a lot of suffering for yourself and for those around you
Heedfulness is said to underlie the development of the five strengths leading up to discernment
It's the quality that makes sure you're going to pay close attention to what you're doing close attention to your intentions close attention to the results of your actions  as in the passage where the Buddha's instructing Rahula his son
Before you do something he tells Rahula ask yourself What's the intention here
Why am I doing this
Is it going to lead to suffering or not Only if the intention looks good should you act on it
Then while you're acting you check the results of your action
After the action is done you check again because while some results are immediate others are long term
So conviction in kamma focuses your attention at the right spot and gets you asking the right questions
Heedfulness gives urgency to your investigation
And the two of them together lead to discernment
The teachings on the seven factors for Awakening are similar
You start out with mindfulness
The Buddha teaches you to be mindful of the body in and of itself feelings in and of themselves mind states mental qualities in and of themselves
Why
So that you can be really clear on what your actions are and what the results are
If you're concerned with other issues  as the Buddha says things in the world things that other people are doing  you miss what you're doing
So you focus right here get yourself in the present moment not simply because the present moment is a good moment in and of itself but because it's the only place where you're going to see your intentions in action
In this way mindfulness puts you in a position to develop the second factor for Awakening the discernment factor called analysis of qualities The qualities here are qualities in the mind mental states in the present
The food for this factor is appropriate attention to the skillful and unskillful states arising in the mind
You pay attention to the intentions you act on trying to see what's skillful and what's not
And again the test for judging whether your actions are skillful is by their results How much harm do they cause
How much happiness
Discernment focuses on actions in terms of cause and effect and works at developing greater and greater skill in acting greater and greater sensitivity in evaluating and learning from the results of your actions to the point where your actions are so skillful that they lead to the Deathless
This may sound unusual for we're often taught that Buddhist discernment focuses on seeing things in terms of the three characteristics inconstancy stress and notself
We're taught to look for the inconstancy the impermanence of things and then to see that if they're inconstant they must be stressful if they're stressful they must be notself
Well those teachings have to be placed in context and that context is the act of judging the results of our actions
The three characteristics are designed so that we don't content ourselves with only a middling level of skillfulness
In other words you might be skillful enough to have a good job a nice place to live a good family life  in other words ordinary mundane wellbeing  and a lot of people get satisfied right there
Or you might get satisfied with a nice state of concentration
You might be able to get the mind centered pretty much at will things don't disturb you too much
A lot of people stop right there  it's good enough for them
This is where the teachings on the three characteristics kick in in judging the results of your actions Are they really satisfactory
Do they give permanent constantly dependable results Well no
If they don't then you're setting yourself up for stress suffering disappointment
You're setting yourself to latch onto things that aren't totally under your control
In other words they're not yours
You can't say Okay body don't get old
Go back and get younger the way you were say five or ten years ago You can't tell your painful feelings to turn into pleasure
You can't arrange for only good and useful thoughts to come into your mind
The purpose of the three characteristics is to keep you from getting complacent
They help foster heedfulness so that your standards for judging your actions stay high
In judging the results of your actions you're not going to settle for anything that falls under the three characteristics
You'll keeping trying to become more skillful in your actions until you gain results that aren't inconstant or stressful results where self and notself don't apply
In modern culture it's considered psychologically unhealthy to set very high standards for yourself
What does that do
It creates a society of very middling people mediocre people people who experience a mediocre level of happiness
The Buddha though was very demanding first with himself and then with his followers
He said Don't satisfy yourself with just ordinary everyday wellbeing because it's not well all the time
When set your sights set them on something of more permanent value what he called the noble search the search for what doesn't age doesn't grow ill doesn't die for a happiness that doesn't change
So the three characteristics in and of themselves are not the totality of Buddhist wisdom Buddhist discernment
They have to be placed in context the context of the question of skillfulness What are you doing
What are your intentions
What are the results of your actions based on those intentions
Are you content with them or do you want better The three characteristics spur you on to be more demanding of yourself saying I want better than this
I've got this human life what can I do to get the most out of it And the answer should be I'm going to do the best I can to find true happiness something dependable something to show for all the suffering I've been through as I take birth age grow ill and die
So we should think about these issues as we meditate
We're not getting into the present moment just to stop there
That would be like someone who after wading through a dense jungle finally gets to a road  and then lies down on the road forgetting that the road is there to be followed to see where it leads you
When you get into the present moment that's not enough
You have to learn how to ask yourself the right questions about the present moment in particular What are your intentions right now and what results do they have
Where are they going to take you
Intentions just don't float in and out of the mind without leaving a trace
They leave their mark
They do have results
Are you satisfied with the results
If not what can you do to get better results
Learning how to ask these questions the Buddha said is what gives rise to discernment so that your actions go beyond just the ordinary mundane level
As he pointed out there are four kinds of action actions that are skillful on a mundane level actions that are not skillful on the mundane level actions that are mixed and then actions that take you beyond the mundane level that open you up to the Deathless and bring you to the end of action
That fourth kind of action is what he says is really worthwhile
That's what's special about his teaching
That's what's distinctive about his teaching
He discovered that the principles of causality work in such a way that you can bring yourself to the Uncaused by being as skillful as possible in what you do
And the discernment that shows you how to act in those ways that detects what in your intentions is skillful and what's unskillful what in the results of your actions are satisfactory or not That's what guides you in the right direction
You take your desire for happiness and you take it seriously
It's not that the Buddha condemns all craving
There's a passage where he says There is a kind of craving that has good results  the craving that leads you away from repeatedly wandering on the desire to get out of this wandering to discontinue this wandering So you take that desire  which is what the expression of metta is all about the desire for happiness both for yourself and other people  and you add to it the conviction that you can do things that lead to happiness
You take that desire you take that conviction you put them together with a good dash of heedfulness and then you try to watch as skillfully as you can to see what you're doing
Monitor the results of your practice and adjust them as necessary
These factors all taken together are the recipe for the discernment that leads to release
There's no one technique that can guarantee that you'll gain discernment just as there's no one technique that has a monopoly on giving rise to discernment
The techniques are things that you use in your quest for discernment but your quest has to be informed by more than techniques
It has to be informed by the right questions by the right qualities of mind by the rigor you bring to your attention to what you're doing by your willingness to set the highest possible standards for yourself your unwillingness to settle for a happiness that falls under the three characteristics
That's how liberating discernment comes about
A friend of mine once wrote a novel about a storytelling contest between the gods of the Taoist heaven
In the course of the novel you read about the gods conducting their story contest  it's the male gods lined up against the female gods but there are traitors on both sides  and you also read the story they invent alternating from one side to the next
The story's full of all kinds of suffering A young woman gets sold as a slave to get her parents out of debt her new master is a good person but he dies off pretty quickly he's got an evil brother and all kinds of horrible things happen there are floods fires suicides lots of injustice  what makes for a great story but a miserable life
And then at the very end of the novel Kuan Yin appears and tells the Taoist gods Well now that you've told this story you're going to have to go down there and live it The last image in the novel is of the Taoist gods all tumbling out of heaven down to the earth they've despised so much below
Of course Kuan Yin here represents what Buddhism did to China It brought in the teaching on kamma
We're creating our lives
And even when the mind seems to be simply spinning its wheels it's not just idly spinning its wheels
It's creating new states of being new possibilities  some of which are good some of which are not so good
You have to keep that principle always in mind as you're meditating
You're not simply here innocently watching what's going on without any responsibility for what you're experiencing
You're responsible for your experiences  through your actions in the past and in the present moment
On the one hand this sounds a little onerous because nobody likes to take responsibility
On the other hand though it's empowering
If you don't like the present moment you can create a new present moment because the opportunities to do so are endless
We're not just consumers of experiences
We're also producers
We have to keep this principle in mind as we go through the practice
Our training in the precepts reminds us that we shape our life by the choices we make in what we say and do
Our training in concentration teaches us that how we approach the present moment is going to make a big difference in how the moment is experienced
You can develop skill in the way you focus on the breath the way you adjust the breath the way you develop sensitivity to what's going on in the body
These are all things you do as a producer of experiences and you can learn to do them more and more skillfully to create a sense of wellbeing in the present moment
Even when there's pain in the body even when there are other difficult issues in life you can create a still center for yourself
You don't have to be a victim of what comes in from outside
You don't have to be a victim of whatever comes welling up from within the mind
You have a role right here right now in shaping things and  as you develop more mindfulness develop more alertness as your powers of concentration get more and more solid  you have the tools you need to make that present experience a lot more livable
The same principle holds true as we try to develop discernment
We're often told that discernment consists of seeing things as inconstant and because they're inconstant they're stressful and because they're stressful they're notself
Now most of us in the West are used to consuming our experiences
We don't buy a Ford Explorer
We buy the Ford Explorer experience
We go to Yosemite for the Yosemite experience
If we take the Buddha's teachings on discernment out of context and put them in our normal consuming mode what do they seem to say
They seem to say Life is short
Experiences are fleeting
Grab as much pleasure as you can And since you can't hold onto things for too long before they change you have to try to embrace them appreciate them squeeze as much as you can out of your experiences and then be quick to let go before they start falling apart
But that's okay because other experiences will come along so that you never run out of things to embrace
In other words the teaching seems to be telling us how to be expert connoisseurs in consuming our experiences
Taking the teachings out of context leads to other misunderstandings as well
You begin to think If everything's impermanent why spend all this time trying to develop concentration
It's all going to end someday anyhow
Why try to develop good qualities in the mind
They'll all come to nothing eventually
Why don't we just accept what we've got and learn to enjoy that But that's taking the teachings out of context
When the Buddha taught the teachings of discernment he started with questions of What's skillful
What's unskillful
What can I do that will lead to longterm happiness This is the first set of questions you're supposed to ask to develop discernment
If you look at your normal patterns of consumption you begin to realize that a lot of them are very unskillful They lead to only shortterm types of happiness
And you realize it's not just the consumption but it's also what you do to produce these experiences that's unskillful
You find yourself acting on greed anger passion fear just to get the experiences you want
So to get out of that pattern you want to develop the skills that will make your happiness more solid longer lasting less likely to turn on you and eat you up
This is the type of discernment that underlies development in terms of virtue and concentration
You refrain from the activities that would lead to instant gratification but longterm regret longterm remorse
You develop qualities of mind that create a sense of greater wellbeing that doesn't have to depend on outside stimuli that can stand up against any kind of outside situation
Once you've developed these qualities you take the process of discernment a little bit deeper
Use that principle of inconstancy to ask Is there anything that's not inconstant
Do I have to keep on producing producing producing for the rest of eternity
Isn't there a type of happiness that doesn't require that So you turn and look more carefully at the type of happiness you're creating
Then you run into the question of Who's consuming this
What is this consumer
What is this producer You begin to see that the consumer is also made up of khandhas you've produced
And this insight makes the whole process seem even more futile
Why would you want to get involved in this process  creating experiences for experiences to enjoy
From this point of view even longterm happiness isn't good enough
Your powers of sensitivity have been sharpened
Your insight into the process of production and consumption has gotten sharper as well
And when you finally reach the point where you see that it's not necessary you let go
If you were only a consumer it'd be easy enough to continue enjoying things that are inconstant as long as you've learned to mind your manners in how you embrace things  hugging without grabbing  but as a producer there comes a point when you get tired of producing
You've had enough
You see that all the effort going into producing is simply not worth it
That's the insight that allows you to drop things that allows you to let go
And it's in that context that the teachings on the three characteristics have their true meaning play their true role
Like the storytellers in the novel we have to be careful about what we're creating because we're going to have to live in what we create
Keep asking yourself Is this good enough
Am I satisfied with what I'm creating  because it's not an easy task to stop creating
If it were easy we wouldn't have to sit here and meditate so hard
It's difficult and whether we like what we're creating or not we keep on creating
That's the problem
So as long as you're going to create try to create as good a world for yourself as you can as good a world for the people around you as you can until you've developed the qualities where you can look into this worldproduction activity in your mind this factory that keeps churning things out momentbymomentbymoment to see if you can take it apart
It sounds a little scary but then the Buddha promises that once you take these things apart there comes a happiness that nothing that you've created can ever compare to
This promise together with the reality of that uncreated unfabricated level of happiness that's what makes all this work we're doing here more than worthwhile
They tell us that the heart of the Buddha's Awakening was discovering the principle of causality how cause and effect work to shape your experience
It sounds pretty abstract but it's actually directly related to what you're experiencing right now
In other words there's the result of past kamma there's your present kamma and there's the result of present kamma
Those are the three things you're experiencing at any given moment
Of course when we start out it all tends to be mixed together
It's just experience
We don't see these patterns we don't see the component factors as separate and distinct so things seem pretty random
But if you learn how to look at what you're doing right now you come to see that you're not totally passive
The things you're experiencing are not just coming in at you
There's an active side to the mind that goes out and shapes them adds a little here takes away a little bit there
You're getting sensitive to that aspect of the mind to what you're doing right now
That's a large part of the insight you need to gain in the meditation
Most of us are like a man who goes storming into a room acting in an offensive way and then later complains The people in the room seemed awfully defensive awfully unfriendly  as if he didn't have any impact on the atmosphere of the room through his actions through the way he entered the room
So how are you storming into the present moment
One way to find out is by checking on the breath
Exactly what are you doing with the breath right now
Is the breathing a totally passive automatic process or are you doing something to the breath
Is there some level of the mind that's making decisions
One way to find out is to make conscious decisions about the breath nudging it a little bit here a little bit there
We're not talking about making huge differences in the breath just making gradual changes in whichever direction seems most comfortable
As you do this you begin to realize that your present experience of pleasure or pain depends on decisions you're making right now
You begin to get more sensitive to what the mind is doing particularly in terms of its perceptions and thoughtfabrications and how these relate to your feelings
Perceptions are the labels you put on things
For example you may experience the body as something solid breathing in and breathing out
Well you can change that perception
See everything you sense in the body right now as an aspect of the breath property
Look at it that way every sensation as a type of breath sensation
See what that does to your sensation of the body the way you relate to it the way you evaluate it the way you breathe
And then your thoughtfabrications Use them to ask questions
How about breathing this way
How about breathing that way
And so you give it a try
As you do this you get a greater and greater sense of how much you really are shaping your present experience
Then you can take this insight and apply it to issues of pain both physical pain and mental pain
Most of us tend to think of ourselves as passive recipients victims of a particular pain attacking us
There doesn't seem much we can do about it
That's because we have a habitual way of reacting to pain
Unless we can change that habit we're not going to see much improvement in the issue of why we're suffering of how we suffer
But if you really look at a physical pain you realize that while part of it comes from something wrong with the body another part comes from what the mind is doing to manage the experience of pain the way it paints a mental picture of the pain the way it latches onto that mental picture what it's doing to maintain the pain in a particular way or to move it in a particular direction
That's going on all the time yet we're not really aware of how much we're contributing to our own pain
That's the big issue
That's the first noble truth the pain we're creating through our clinging craving and ignorance
To see these things you have to be very very sensitive to the present moment and very sensitive to what your input is
This is why concentration is so important getting the mind really still so that it can see these things very precisely
For instance when pain arises we tend to miss the fact that the mind is constantly labeling it Pain pain pain pain pain And in addition to the label of pain we sometimes paint a picture of it to ourselves
That act of labeling if there's clinging along with it contributes to the pain
And when you get really sensitive to the movements of the mind  and this requires getting the breath really still so that it's not interfering with what you're seeing  you see that there's a constant repetition going on in the mind
Sometimes the labeling the clinging and the repetition are so insistent that the physical cause of the pain has long since gone
The act of clinging is the actual pain you're experiencing now
So when you learn how to see Oh there's that mental label going again there it goes again there it goes again Can you stop it
See what happens when you stop it when you just drop it
You'll find that your experience of the pain changes
That's when you gain insight into the issue of what you're doing in the present moment how you contribute to the shape of your experience
That's a lot of the meditation right there  just sensitizing the mind to what it's doing
Most often that's our big blind spot what we're doing right now
We're so conscious of what other people are doing  They did this to me they did that to me  but we're not looking at what we're doing which is why what they're doing causes us pain
Many times you can't avoid what's coming at you from the outside  it's past kamma  but you can avoid the unskillful ways you're reacting to it
Sometimes you find that the way you're reacting to the situation feeds back into the situation influencing what those other people are doing and making the situation worse
But even when that's not the case you find that your suffering really comes from the way you relate to the outside situation
That's what the first noble truth is all about clinging to the five aggregates clinging to the form of the body clinging to your feelings perceptions thoughtfabrications or consciousness
When you stop clinging to these aggregates then even though they're still impermanent and there still may be some stress in them it doesn't weigh on the mind
The bridge has been cut so that it doesn't connect
You stop lifting things up as in Ajaan Suwat's image The mountain may be heavy in and of itself but if you're not trying to lift it up then it's not heavy for you
So you've got to see where you're doing your heavy lifting and then try to understand why
Only when you understand why you're doing things can you really stop
Sometimes in the course of a meditation you can force yourself to stop but if there's no real understanding then as soon as the mind gets back to its old ways it goes lifting things picking them up carrying them around again
But if you look into why you're lifting these things what misunderstandings lie behind what you're doing why you feel that you have to carry these things around That's a lot of the insight right there
It's an old habit the way the mind contributes to things in the present moment particularly the ways it causes itself unnecessary suffering
We think that an undercurrent of suffering is a necessary part of experience but it's not
When you see it as stress when you see it as a burden and you realize that it's not necessary that's when you really let go
So check on exactly where your clinging is right now where you're contributing to unnecessary suffering
Try to make the mind as still as possible and then stay there to observe Is there still some stress here
Is there still a sense of burdensomeness here
What else is going along with that
Can you see any activity any intention that's going along with that stress And if you catch sight of that activity that intention you drop it
It's almost invariably something you didn't realize you were doing something you were holding onto in the sense of repeating it mindlessly
Sometimes you're aware that you're holding onto the act of intention but you think you've got to hold on This is the core of my being this is who I am this is the way my mind has to work Well it doesn't have to work that way
Learn how to question those assumptions
Learn how to let go a little bit
This loosens things up in the mind
The things you never saw before now you suddenly see
This burden you create for yourself is totally unnecessary
What you thought was necessary the way things had to be They don't have to be that way at all
That's the whole message of the Buddha's Awakening the principle of causality we've been talking about
He applied it to see how the suffering the mind experiences in the present moment is not necessary
That's why the principle of causality was so important
He realized the input he was putting into the present moment that was creating the suffering and he learned to stop
And what happened when there was no input in the present moment
As we meditate we find that our input gets more and more and more subtle
Oftentimes we're not even aware of any input
We tell ourselves that we're sitting here perfectly peaceful perfectly calm nothing's going on but actually there's a lot going on in the mind that we're missing
It's in a blind spot
When you begin to see that blind spot begin to let go of what's in there that's when things open up that's when the meditation can really start making a radical change in the mind
A lot of the relationships in your mind  where you thought This is that way and that's this way  you begin to realize are not necessarily so
And the realization that they're not necessary That's where the liberation lies
So a continuity runs throughout the whole process of meditation from the very beginning
If while you're sitting here the mind slips off just bring it right back
If it slips off again just bring it right back again
Even this much can make you more conscious of what you're doing in the present moment
You get more conscious of how the mind has its blind spots and you learn to make them more and more and more subtle less dominant in the mind
In other words you try to cut through them as much as you can
What happens of course is that they find more subtle ways to hide but at least you gain a measure of control over the mind and a greater sense of what you're doing in the present moment
That's crucial to the meditation
You keep applying that principle to more subtle levels for the same principle holds all the way through
It's just that as you keep working on it it requires more precision
But that's something you can develop
After all this is a skill
That's another one of the Buddha's great discoveries
The ability to learn the path to liberation is a skill you can master in the same way that you master other skills looking at the results of your actions reflecting back on what you did and trying to adjust things so that they keep getting more and more precise more and more subtle less burdensome to the mind
Awakening isn't something that just drops on people without their being aware of what they're doing
It's not an accident or something that comes from outside
It requires that you get really sensitive to this teaching on kamma I am the owner of my actions You're acting right now so be very careful about what you do in the same way that you'd be very careful about building a fire careful about sharpening a knife careful about all the other skills you need in life
It's just that in dealing with the mind you need to be even more careful even more precise
It requires more subtlety
But this simple process of just getting more skillful in how you relate to the present moment That can take you all the way to Awakening
And that right there is revolutionary
In English we have a very limited vocabulary for describing how the body feels from the inside
We feel tingly or we feel heavy We have ants crawling on our skin or butterflies in our stomachs
There are not that many words and nothing really systematic
This is where the Buddha's teaching on the properties is helpful
It provides a systematic way of categorizing the feelings you have in the body  how the body feels from the inside  along with a sense of what you can do with those feelings
This teaching also gives you a very clear sense of how much your present input shapes the way you experience the body and an immediate very visceral way of using that present input to balance things out to make the body an easier place in which to settle down
The texts list the properties as six earth water wind fire space and consciousness
It sounds like medieval chemistry
We'd do better though to look at these properties as ways of categorizing the sensations that make up the way the body feels from the inside
The earth sensations are feelings of heaviness or solidity water would be cool sensations fire is of course warm wind is the motion back and forth space is the feelings of emptiness and consciousness is the property that's aware of all these things
The theory behind these properties is that they get provoked
In other words as they get emphasized as some incident strengthens them or kicks them into action they get stronger
On the external level natural events occur when the external properties get provoked
Floods come from the provocation of the water property huge fires or intense heat from the provocation of the fire property huge winds from the provocation of the wind property
Interestingly the texts also attribute earthquakes to the wind property
This means that wind refers not only to the wind in the air but also to the motion down in the earth
Apparently earth was the only property that wasn't provokable on the external level at least but it would move when the wind property got into the act
Whatever we may think of these concepts as ways of describing external events they're a very useful way of looking at internal events at the experience of the body as sensed from within
Classically the internal properties are used to explain disease
Giddiness or lightheadedness is a sign of too much wind property a sign that the wind property has been provoked
With fever of course the fire property has been provoked
A feeling of lethargy or heaviness in your limbs is a sign of too much earth property
These are things you can play with in your meditation
That's where the teaching really becomes useful because it allows you to see how the way you focus on the body has an impact on how you perceive the body how you actually sense the body
We think of sensations as being primary the raw material the basic building blocks of experience but there are conscious decisions being made that precede the sensations
Look at the teaching on dependent origination
Sankhara or fabrication is way down there prior to the sensations you feel in terms of form feeling and so forth
So how are you going to fabricate the body
If there are feelings of tension in the body sometimes that's a sign of too much earth property so you can think of the breath
This is one of the reasons we start with the breath
It's the property that's most easily manipulated  classically it's called the kayasankhara the factor that fashions the body
It's also the property that most directly works through tension
Wherever there's a sense of tension focus on it and see if you can get a sense of gentle healing motion going through it
The potential for motion is there simply that the perception contributing to the tension has blocked it
So you can consciously decide that you're going to perceive motion there
Give it a chance to happen and the potential for motion the potential for movement through that part of the nervous system will get strengthened will get aroused  which may be a better way of translating the word that I just translated as provoked The breathpotential gets aroused
When your awareness of the breath is aroused or heightened it can move through that sense of blockage
When you're feeling giddy or manic you can think of the earth property to settle things down
If there's just too much frenetic energy in the body you can think of your bones being made of iron of your hands and feet weighing a ton
Wherever you have a sense of solidity in the body focus on that and try to magnify it
You find that your choice of the image you're using your purpose in choosing it will really affect the way you start sensing that part of the body
Then you can take that sensation and spread it out connecting it with other sensations of solidity in the body
The potential for solidity is always there
When you're feeling depressed and weighed down think of lighter sensations of the breath giving a lift to the different parts of the body
When you're hot think of the water property
Focus on whatever sensations in the body are cooler than the others
Really keep your focus right there and think water water or cool cool You'll find that other cool sensations in the body will appear to your awareness
The potential for them was waiting simply that they needed the element of present intention to highlight them
When you're feeling cold focus in on warmth
There will be some part of the body that's warmer than the others so focus in on it
Think of the warmth staying there and spreading to other parts of the body where other warm sensations will get aroused
You can do this at any stage in the concentration although it's most effective when the breath is still
At that point the body feels like a cloud of mist little points of sensation and each little sensation has the potential to be any one of these four properties
When your sense of the body is reduced to what the French would call pointillism it's a lot easier simply with a thought to emphasize either the heaviness or the lightness the movement the warmth or the coolness of those sensations the sensationpotentials you've got there
This way you accomplish two things at once
On the one hand you balance out the body
Whenever one type of sensation feels too oppressive you can think of the opposing sensation to balance it out
On the other you start seeing the role of present intention in your awareness in your experience of the present moment in a very visceral way
When things grow very still and balanced in terms of these four properties with this mist of potential sensations that can go in any direction you can also focus on the space between the points
Realize that the space is boundless
It goes through the body and out in all directions
Just think that infinite space Stay with the sensation of infinite space that comes along with the perception
The potential for it is always there it's simply that the perception arouses it
It's a very pleasant state to get in
Things seem a lot less solid a lot less oppressive
You don't feel so trapped in the body
Ajaan Fuang once had a student an old woman who started practicing meditation with him when he was getting ready to leave Wat Asokaram
After he left she had to practice on her own for quite a while
One evening when she was sitting in meditation with the group in the meditation hall a voice came to her and said You're going to die tonight She was a little taken aback but then she reminded herself Well if I'm going to die the best way is to die meditating So she just sat there and watched to see what would happen as the body dies to see what it would be like
There was an actual sensation of the body beginning to fall apart
All of the various properties were going their separate ways she said like a house on fire
There was no place in the body where you could focus your awareness and have any sense of comfort at all So for a moment she felt lost but then she remembered Well there's the space property So she focused in on the space property and all that sense of the house on fire suddenly disappeared
There was a very strong sense of infinite space
There was always the potential to go back to the body

When she came out of meditation of course she hadn't died
She was still alive
But she had learned an important lesson that when things get really bad in the body you can always go to space
Even though it's not Awakening and it's not the unconditioned still it's a lot better than being immersed in turmoil along with the properties in the body
So the properties provide a useful way of looking at the potentials in the present moment
They also make it easier to get to that sense of awareness itself that you read about so much in the writings of the Thai Ajaans
Once you're with infinite space drop the perception of space and see what's left
There will just be a perception of knowing knowing knowing which takes its place
You don't have to ask Knowing what There's just awareness awareness or knowing knowing
Once you've got everything divided up into properties like this you've got the raw materials for gaining insight
The terms of analysis may initially seem strange but once you get a visceral sense of what they're referring to you'll find them extremely useful
They not only give the mind a good place to settle down in the stillness of concentration but they also help you gain insight into the way perception shapes your experience of the body shapes your perception of what's going on here in the present moment seeing how fabricated it all is
You've got potentials coming in from past kamma but you've also got the element of present choice which becomes extremely clear when you analyze things in this way
When I first went to stay with Ajaan Fuang he had me memorize Ajaan Lee's Divine Mantra six passages dealing with the different properties
For a long time it seemed very foreign to me until one night I was chanting the passage on the property of consciousness and I realized that it was referring to the awareness that's right here
This awareness
Right here
When this realization hit it was as if a huge iceberg in my heart suddenly melted
I wasn't dealing with some outside foreign frame of thinking instead it was something extremely direct immediate right here and now
That was when I began to get a sense of why Ajaan Fuang had asked me to memorize the chant why he wanted all of his students to think about their present experience in terms of the properties
So keep this mode of analysis in mind
Try to get some sense of it as you put it to use and you'll find that it's extremely useful in the practice
As with all of the Buddha's teachings the importance of the teaching is what you do with it and what it does for you in helping to gain insight into how stress and suffering are created in the present moment  and how you don't have to create them if you pay attention if you work at these skills
The mind has a basic habit which is to create things
In fact when the Buddha describes causality how experiences come about he says that the power of creation or sankhara  the mental tendency to put things together  actually comes prior to our sensory experience
It's because the mind is active actively putting things together that it knows things
The problem is that most of its actions most of its creations come out of ignorance so the kind of knowledge that comes from those creations can be misleading
For this reason what you want to do in the process of meditation is to back up to get down as close to this process of creation as you can to see if there's a way to do it skillfully that leads to knowledge that leads you to a point that breaks through ignorance
And that means instead of building up a lot of things you let things fall apart so you can get down to exactly where these basic forces in the mind are putting things together
Now it so happens that when we bring the mind to the breath we have all these basic forces right here in their most elemental forms
The breath is the factor that fashions the body
It's what they call kayasankhara or the physical puttingtogether The breath is what puts life together in the body
If it weren't for the breath here things would start falling apart really fast
Then there's verbal fabrication vacisankhara the act of putting things in words
The two basic verbal sankharas are directed thought and evaluation
And you've got those right here too
You direct your thoughts to the breath and then evaluate the breath How does the breath feel
Does it feel good
If it does stay with it
If it doesn't feel good you can change it
This is about the most basic level of conversation you can have with yourself
Does this feel good or not
Comfortable or not
Yes
No
And then you work with that
What are you working with
You're working with mental fabrication cittasankhara which covers feeling and perception feelings of pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain
And then perceptions are the labels the mind gives to things This is pleasant
This is painful
This is this and that is that
When you've got the mind with the breath you've got all of these things brought together the feelings that come with the breath the perceptions that label the breath Now the breath is coming in
Now the breath is going out
Now the mind is like this
Now it's like that The directed thought and the evaluation are there as well keeping you focused on the breath and on evaluating the breath
So these things are all together
If you stray away from here you're usually straying away into distraction into the realm of further elaboration in which you lose this basic frame of reference and create a whole other one
It's what they call becoming in the texts when you create other worlds in the mind
Once you get into those other worlds you lose touch with the process of creation
You lose touch with how becoming is brought together
So you've got to learn how to take those worlds of distraction  and the processes that form them  apart
The Buddha talks about various ways of dealing with distraction
Once you've realized you've left your original frame of reference you bring yourself back
In other words you remind yourself
In some cases the simple act of reminding is enough to disperse that other little world you've created for yourself and come back to this one
Other times you have to reflect actively on the drawbacks of that other world of the thinking that creates it especially if it's thinking imbued with lust aversion delusion or harmfulness
You've got to remind yourself What would happen if I thought about this for a while Well you'd create certain habits in the mind and once those habits are imbedded in the mind they lead to actions that can create all kinds of problems
When you see the drawbacks of that kind of thinking you say I don't need that
I've had enough of that in my life You drop it and come back to the breath
Other times you can consciously ignore the distraction
A little world appears in your mind and you say I don't want to enter into that but for some reason it just doesn't go away
You realize the reason it's not going away is because you're paying attention to it
Even if you don't like it paying attention to it is enough to keep it going  like a tar trap
You touch the tar with your hand and you get stuck
You try to pull yourself loose from the tar with the other hand and you get both hands stuck
Pull yourself off with your foot your foot gets stuck
Bite the tar your mouth gets stuck
So the only way to deal with it is to not touch it
In other words don't pay attention to it
You know it's there but you just don't give it any mind
After a while from lack of attention it'll die away
A fourth way of pulling yourself back is to notice that when there's this process of creation when there are these little worlds you create in your mind an element of tension goes with them
Things would be a lot easier if you didn't create these worlds if you'd just relax whatever physical and mental tension supports these things
So look for the tension
Once you can locate it just relax it
When you relax the tension the thought goes away
A fifth way when none of these other methods work is to tell yourself Okay I'm going to clench my teeth press my tongue against the palate and I will not think about that other thing In other words just through the force of your will you force it out of your mind
This is the method of last resort the one that's the least precise and works only as long as your will power lasts
But sometimes it's the only thing that will clear the air
If we were to compare these various methods to tools this would be the sledgehammer
It may be crude but you need one in your arsenal for cases when scalpels and Exacto knives can't handle the job
So when one of these other little worlds gets created in your mind you use whichever of these methods work to let go of it and bring yourself back to the most basic levels of the process of creation the breath directed thought evaluation feelings perceptions
Stay right on this level
What do you do with them on this level
Well you can create levels of concentration in the mind
Concentration is a kind of creation but it's a creation that instead of obscuring the process of what's going on in the mind actually makes it clearer
You create but without leaving these basic levels of your frame of reference
In other words you put them to use in a new way
You put feelings to use in a new way
You learn how to create a feeling of pleasure from the breath so that the pleasure gets more and more intense more and more solid
Just the act of sitting here breathing gets really refreshing
And if you stay with the feeling as a feeling in and of itself it doesn't pull you off into other mental worlds
You stay right here
It feels good right here
So instead of feeding on the pleasure in an aimless way you do it in a systematic way
That way you can keep the mind with a sense of pleasure a sense of rapture and it doesn't wander off
That's what the concentration is all about
As it strengthens the mind it gives direction to the mind
It takes the desire for pleasure and puts it to good use
Once the mind feels comfortable in the present moment it's not going to wander off anyplace else
It feels good right here
A lot more satisfaction comes from the sense of ease right here than from the little bits and pieces of satisfaction coming from the other worlds you can create with your mind
Again this is a process of creation but it's a lot more skillful than normal
It keeps things on a basic level where you're in touch with the process
You don't lose sight of it
It's like the difference between sitting out in an audience watching a play and being behind the stage
Behind the stage you see the actual play but you also see what goes on behind it
In that way you're a lot less likely to get carried away by the illusion of the play
Now of course pain is going to come into your meditation as well
Sometimes it's outandout pain
Other times it's more subtle
And again as with the pleasure instead of thinking that you're on the receiving end of the pain a victim of the pain you start putting it to use
The pain is there for you to comprehend
That's what the Buddha said in his teachings on the four noble truths The task with regard to pain is to comprehend it
Once the mind is solid enough and stable enough so as not to feel threatened by the pain it can analyze the pain on whatever level it may be searing pain or more subtle stress
As you comprehend the pain you start finding that you understand the mind a lot better too
All the little animals in the mind that tend to gather around pain You begin to notice who they are what they are and you realize That's not me
It's just these thoughts that tend to cluster around pain If you want to identify with them you can but they're going to turn your mind into a menagerie
They're going to create a lot of turmoil
And so you learn how to let them go
Even when you're focused on the pleasant levels of concentration you'll find that as you get more and more sensitive toward these various levels a subtle element of stress accompanies each one of them
Once you identify where that stress is you let it go
That takes you to a more subtle level of concentration
You stay there for a while
In the beginning you don't notice the stress in the new level
It's like going into a bright room where your eyes haven't yet adjusted to the light
At first you see nothing but the dazzle
But if you stay there for long enough your eyes begin to adjust and you begin to notice Oh there are shapes there are forms there are things in this room that you can see
It's the same as you go from one level of concentration to the next
Take the stress of directed thought and evaluation for instance
Once the breath really feels full really feels satisfying you don't need to keep evaluating it
You don't have to keep reminding yourself to stay with it
You're just there there there there there with a basic perception
You let go of the directed thought and evaluation and Bong  you come down to a much deeper level
You go through this step by step
You realize what an important role perceptions play in this the labels you put on things
You're constantly labeling the breath
When the breath is still so that you can drop that label you begin to label the sense of space that's left then the sense of knowing that's left as you drop the label for space then all the way up to the sphere of nothingness
That's still called a perception attainment
It's based on the label that the mind puts on the experience that keeps you there
So again you're with these very basic basic levels of creation in the mind
When you start taking them apart that's when things really get interesting
Instead of building building building up you're letting go letting go letting go bit by bit by bit
And then of course you're getting attached to the new level you reach but it's a good attachment
Otherwise you'd go floating off to other worlds
This attachment here at least keeps you in the present moment where things can begin to open up
And instead of elaborating on it you keep applying the teachings of the four noble truths and keep the questions basic Where is the stress here
This is especially important when you get to the level of infinitude of consciousness or the infinitude of space
On those levels it's easy to develop a sense that you've reached the ground of being from which all things come and to which all things return
If you're not careful you can really start philosophizing on this theme elaborating on it getting into all kinds of abstractions about the relationship between the absolute and the relative emanation  all sorts of big buzzword issues
But they're totally irrelevant to the real problem in the mind  that there's still stress here
If you're still stuck here you haven't gone beyond you haven't reached the Deathless
You've got to keep asking that same old basic question Where is there stress here Look for it
See what you're doing that keeps the stress going see that it's unnecessary and then let go
Ultimately you open up to something totally unfabricated
So instead of building things up that pull you away from the present you start by building up states of concentration in the mind
These are types of fabrication of course but they're the type of fabrication that keeps you within this frame of reference the very absolute present
They don't distract you into other levels where you lose touch with the basic building blocks in the process of fabrication
This is a basic pattern throughout the Buddha's teachings Before you let go of things you first have to learn to do them skillfully mindfully with awareness
The doing the mastering of the skill is what enables you to know them
This brings us back to that basic principle we talked about earlier We wouldn't know anything there would be no awareness at all if there weren't any doing in the mind
You have to learn how to do things more and more skillfully until finally you can get to a level where the mind becomes too sensitive to do anything
And at that point it opens up to a totally different kind of awareness
So you make use of what you've got
The Buddha noticed that all things fabricated have an element of stress
But what are you going to do
How are you going to get to the unfabricated
You can't use the unfabricated as a tool because that would be fabricating it and that's not its nature
You learn how to use the process of fabrication in a more skillful way
You divide things up into the four noble truths
There's stress the origination of stress the cessation of stress and the path
The path is a process of taking things that are stressful  these perceptions these feelings these processes of creation  and using them in a skillful way
So you use fabrication to undo fabrication and then finally reach a point where everything opens up to the unfabricated
It's an extremely skillful path a skillful approach
It takes the raw materials that we've got around us all the time  the activities that we ordinarily use to create experience  and teaches us how to use them in a more skillful way
Getting down to basics
Keeping away from abstractions
Once there's an abstraction in the mind there's a new level of being in there a new frame of reference it pulls you away from the present
A lot of selfdelusion comes through abstraction
A lot of opportunity for lying to yourself comes through abstraction
So we keep things basic
We keep our nose to the ground
Just look at the basic things we have physical verbal and mental fabrication
Learn how to put them to the proper use
Use them more and more skillfully
Get more and more in touch with the actual process of fabrication right here in the present moment
That's where things open up
Our practice requires a lot of letting go
We prefer to think that it involves letting go of things that we don't like while allowing us to hold onto the things we do like but actually it requires a lot more lettinggo than that
Several years back I was leading a daylong discussion on the four noble truths
When we got to the third noble truth the cessation of suffering the passages we were discussing contained descriptions of nibbana and the general consensus in the group was that they didn't like the sound of it
It seemed too alien too foreign to be really appealing
Then we got to the fourth noble truth and we started talking about right concentration
That sounded very appealing rapture and pleasure permeating the entire body
Those were things you really could get your mind around
They sounded compelling
And that's the way it is with the practice You have to develop the fourth noble truth the path of practice before you can appreciate the third
You have to hold onto right concentration before you can let go into the Deathless
The Buddha's strategy in teaching us to let go is to give us better and better things to hold onto
For example he gets you to hold onto states of good concentration
Then when you turn around and look at things that would normally incite your lust your anger your desire or passion you realize that they're not worth it
You'd much rather hold onto the stillness the state of satisfaction the state of wellbeing that comes with your concentration
So you burn your bridges behind you and hold onto concentration as your only true happiness in life
Only then when the Buddha has you cornered like that does he have you think of the drawbacks not only of the things you've already left behind but also of the concentration you're holding to
Only when you see the drawbacks of concentration can you realize that the only alternative is the Deathless
The only thing that would really appeal to you at that point is the Deathless
That's when the door opens
As the texts say the first stage in insight is to focus on the drawbacks of anything that's fabricated
The next stage is for the mind to incline to the Deathless
Normally the mind will not incline to the Deathless unless it feels that that's the only way out
Otherwise it's always going to find some other place to go some other corner to hide in
So you need to remember that the teachings on say the three characteristics  inconstancy stress and notself  are part of a course of training and that the different teachings make sense only in particular stages of the training
Only when you're in the right stage for a particular teaching will it do its intended work
Ordinarily we'd like to leapfrog over the concentration to get to the discernment because we're very busy people after all
We've got a lot to do in our lives so we want to get to the main point of this Buddhism thing and then go on to something else
But that's not how the practice works
You have to put your mind in particular states you have to get attached to particular states before the teachings can function in the way they're supposed to
If you think about the inconstancy stress and notselfness of things you're not attached to it doesn't really make an impact
Or if you tell yourself that everything is inconstant stressful and notself before the mind has a safe place to settle down those thoughts can be really unsettling and disorienting
Only when you're in a relatively stable place mentally and ready to look for a way out from even the subtle instability there will those thoughts provide the way out
Years back I was flying on an airplane where they showed the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind
I didn't have the soundtrack to go by but even without paying much attention I found the story pretty easy to figure out
The hero had a miserable family life and so when the opportunity came to step onto that humongous flying saucer and go off whoknowswhere he was willing to go
Now if he had had a happy family life a satisfactory family life he wouldn't have gone
He would have been happy to stay home and the prospect of going off with these weird creatures from outer space would have been too daunting
But the fact that his life was so miserable made him willing to take the leap
In that case the leap was pretty strange
And fortunately the Buddha doesn't ask us to be miserable before we leap to nibbana but he does recommend that we develop a sense of disenchantment  nibbida  and that we do it skillfully
He teaches us to get attached to more and more refined states of wellbeing in the mind and to become disenchanted with everything else
It's like climbing a ladder
To climb up the rungs of the ladder you already have to be holding onto a higher rung before you can let go of a lower one
Finally when you get to the top of the ladder when there's nothing higher to hold onto nowhere else to go That's when you get off onto the roof or wherever you're headed
That's when you can totally let go
In the meantime you've got to hold on
The same principle holds true in the practice You let go of lower attachments only when you've got something higher to hold onto
So when you're practicing concentration don't be afraid of being attached to it
In fact you should get attached here
That's part of the whole dynamic of the practice
Allow yourself to be attached to the breath get to play with the breath make the breath a really comfortable good place to stay
As the breath gets more refined you find that the mind goes through more refined stages
The two help each other along
The greater the refinement of the mind the more refined the breath and vice versa back and forth
And you find that your concentration does go through clearly discernable levels
But again don't be afraid of getting attached to them
The whole point is to want to be there to want to develop the mastery that allows you to bring the mind to those levels whenever you need them and to stay centered in them as long as you like
This is why the Buddha  unlike a lot of modern teachers  never warned his students against getting attached to jhana
In fact his instructions when he sent them off to meditate were always very clear Go do jhana And he wanted them to master it
Ajaan Fuang once said you have to be crazy about the meditation in order to be really good at it
In the course of the day whatever spare minute you can find to keep your mind on the breath you want your mind to head there again and again
It's almost as if you were addicted to it
They say that when alcoholics go into a house one of the first things they pick up on is where the alcohol is kept
They're very conscious of that
Their minds incline in that direction so that without even thinking they can detect the signs
Well you want to be a breathaholic
Wherever there's breath you want your mind to head there
Of course you find that it's everywhere if you're really interested if you really want to pursue it
Again it doesn't matter that you're attached to it
There are ways of ultimately prying you loose from that attachment
In the meantime it's a good place to be attached states of concentration states of wellbeing in the mind that don't have to depend on circumstances outside
That's a lot better than being attached to the sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas we're normally attached to
So allow yourself to cling here
It's like the cages where they put birds
If you happen to open the door while the bird is clinging to the door the bird can get out
That's what these states of concentration are They're doors to the Deathless
When we say that the Buddha has you cornered he's got you cornered right here at the door
If you hang on here you'll eventually be able to open the latch and you'll be free
But if you're not here if you're over hanging on the walls then it's very easy for the person opening the cage to keep you in
Clinging to the walls doesn't get you free
In other words you might think that you'd like to put an end to all your suffering but if you're not really in the right place it's not a door
You keep banging your head against the walls of the cage
But if you learn to hold onto these states of concentration the time will come when they turn into doors
You'll develop a sense of dispassion not only for ordinary pleasures but also for the peace you gain from states of concentration
You'll begin to see that no matter how good you are at the concentration there will always be change inconstancy in that concentration
And the time will come when the mind is simply fed up with that
It's had enough
That's nibbida disenchantment
You're no longer enchanted with the concentration
You use it but it doesn't have the same pull it had before
You want something better
That's when the mind can really incline to the Deathless
As I told the people in that discussion group the third noble truth may not sound attractive now but as you get into the fourth noble truth and develop these states of concentration you realize that the third noble truth really is better
It may not sound better in words but when you're disenchanted with the fourth noble truth you see that the third truth is the only direction where true happiness lies
Ultimately the mind will lean there will incline itself there because it's in a position to appreciate it for what it is
So if you want to know what the Buddha was talking about and see if it really is something better than what we're experiencing now this is what you work at these stages of concentration
Direct the mind to the breath evaluating the breath really coming to appreciate what it is to be settled down really coming to appreciate the state of stillness and not chasing after things that keep running away from you through your senses
Come to appreciate the sense of stillness you can gain with the breath
When you appreciate this you'll be in a position to appreciate things that are even better  so that when you incline to something better you find that you're actually right at the door of the cage
You can fly
The daily schedule at Metta Forest Monastery includes a group interview in the late afternoon and a chanting session followed by a group meditation period later in the evening
The Dhamma talks included in this volume were given during the evening meditation sessions and in many cases covered issues raised at the interviews  either in the questions asked or lurking behind the questions
Often these issues touched on a variety of topics on a variety of different levels in the practice
This explains the range of topics covered in individual talks
I have edited the talks with an eye to making them readable while at the same time trying to preserve some of the flavor of the spoken word
In a few instances I have added passages or rearranged the talks to make the treatment of specific topics more coherent and complete but for the most part I have kept the editing to a minimum
Don't expect polished essays
The people listening to these talks were familiar with the meditation instructions included in Method  in Keeping the Breath in Mind by Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo and my own essay A Guided Meditation If you are not familiar with these instructions you might want to read through them before reading the talks in this book
Also further Dhamma talks are available at dhammatalksorg

If our education system were really designed for people the core curriculum would teach how to live how to die  how to deal with the big issues in life pain aging illness death separation  because those are the things that plague people
The skills for dealing with them are the most important skills people can develop in life
But one of the problems with our society is that everything is geared toward the economy
Laws are struck down because they're not good for the economy  at least for this quarter's profit margin
Educational systems are designed to fit us each into our slot in the economy
The skills we learn center on how to function economically
Then when we get too old to function they put us out to pasture and we're pretty much left to our own devices
And many of the skills we learned in order to be good members of the economy  good producers good consumers  are actually bad for us as we get older
This producing and consuming self we have is an especially big problem
So as we come here to meditate  which is practice in learning how to live and how to die  this producing and consuming self is one of the big issues we have to face down
What does it consume
Feelings of pleasure and feelings of pain
It tries to produce more and more pleasure but often ends up producing more and more pain
When you look at your sense of who you are it comes down to these two things the producer and the consumer
These are the habits you have to observe
When you meditate the first thing you learn is how to produce pleasure in the present moment  not for the sake of the pleasure in and of itself but to use it as a strategy
Often we regard pleasure as an end in and of itself but the Buddha says No
You use pleasure and pain  both of them  as means to a higher end
How do you use pleasure
Focus on the breath right now and see how it feels
Then experiment with the breath to see how the way you breathe can produce either pleasure or pain
It may be subtle  the difference between the two  but it's there
We've learned to desensitize ourselves to this aspect of our awareness so it's going to take a while to resensitize ourselves to begin seeing the patterns
This is why we practice
Keep coming back to the breath coming back to the breath
Try to get more sensitive to this area of your awareness more skilled at learning how to maximize the potential for pleasure right here and now simply by the way you breathe  not only producing pleasure but also maintaining it
After all feelings of pleasure and rapture are part of the path
They're tucked in the noble eightfold path under Right Concentration
And as part of the path they have to be developed and maintained
As the Buddha said this pleasure is blameless
It's also useful because you can use it to examine any pain that may be in other parts of the body
When you sit here it's sometimes difficult to get the whole body saturated in pleasure
There may be parts that you can't make pleasurable so as Ajaan Lee says don't lie down there
It's like knowing that there are rotten floorboards in your house
If you try to lie down on the rotten part of the floor you're going to fall through to the basement
So lie down where the boards are sound
As the pleasure you're relying on gets more and more solid you've got a good vantage point for looking at pain
And hopefully by now the meditation has taught you to be inquisitive You've been learning about the breath about the parts of the body that you can adjust to your liking so how about these other parts that you can't adjust as you like
What's going on there
Is the problem related to the breath energy
That's one way you can deal with it
Think of breathing through the pain
See what that does
Or you can notice how you label the pain
There may be a mental image to go along with it
Try dropping the image or changing the image and see what's left
In other words develop an inquisitive attitude toward pain
Put yourself in a position where you don't feel threatened by pain so that you can probe the pain and ask questions watch and observe and learn about it
Get so that pain holds no mysteries for you holds no fear because you understand not only the sensation of pain but also how the mind can latch onto it and create problems around it
Then you learn to abstain from those ways of latching on
It's like knowing that when you stick your finger into a flame it's going to burn so you stop sticking your fingers into flames
As you learn to abstain from unskillful ways of thinking about pain you learn more and more about the mind more and more about ways of not getting yourself involved in suffering
You start out with little tiny pains little tiny disturbances but once you've figured them out you get more interested How about the bigger ones
This is one of the most important parts of the practice this willingness to rise to a challenge this courage that's not overwhelmed by things
You've seen people who suffer in their lives and all they can think about is This isn't going right that isn't going right people don't sympathize with me They do nothing but pile more suffering onto the original suffering
When they see a difficult challenge they just faint
They whine and complain
But that's not the Buddha's way
His way is to give you the skills the tools you need and then to encourage you to fire your imagination to rise to these challenges
Your tools are the meditation instructions
Your encouragement comes from the examples set by the Buddha's life the stories of the noble disciples
They show how when you find yourself in a difficult situation you can rise above it using your wits your grit the resources you've got
So here we are with our breath
Sometimes we've also got pain and at other times distractions  sometimes both together  and we tend to regard them as mosquitoes swarming around as we meditate
We'd like to swat them and get rid of them so we can actually get down to the real business of meditating
But dealing with the distractions dealing with the pain That is the real business of the meditation
When you die the big problems are going to be distraction and pain
Even before you die
You've probably noticed this with old people They can't look ahead into the future because all they see in the future is death
So they start looking only to the past
They cut off large swaths of their awareness
Their minds can't accept what's actually happening  and if they haven't been trained then the pain and depression of having to face death overwhelm them
When the actual pain of illness and death comes they're even more overwhelmed because they have no tools
They don't have the right attitude for dealing with these things
But if you're practicing meditation you're dealing precisely with the big issues that are going to cause suffering as you die
The more skilled you get at the meditation the more you'll be ready for whatever comes and the more you'll have the right attitude toward it
You see it as just one more challenge and you're up for it
You've got your tools
When illness comes you can deal with it lucidly
When death comes you can deal with it lucidly with a sense of confidence
You've dealt with pain and distraction in the past so the basic principles are the same
For this reason when things like pain and distraction come up in the meditation don't get discouraged
These are the riddles of the meditation these are the things you want to figure out  how to spar and parry how to sidestep when necessary how to take them straight on when you have to
Don't get discouraged by how big the task is
Just keep chipping away chipping away
This is another thing we don't learn from our education system how to deal with something we're not good at from the very beginning
Often they channel you into areas where you show a talent and neglect to teach you how to gain skill in areas that don't come to you easily
As a result when you come to meditation you need to develop the basic skills needed to deal with a longterm project Keep chipping away chipping away step by step
Learn to look for the least little signs of progress so you can give yourself encouragement
And take things as they come
The world doesn't always throw things at you step by step
Sometimes big pains come and then little pains and then big pains again
But you do what you can
And don't forget that every step you take in the right direction big or small is an important step
It's not wasted
So don't go for the easy way out saying I'm just here to hang out in the present moment and enjoy the present moment and who cares about striving for something large Many modern meditation teachers claim that the secret to good meditation is to stop trying to stop striving  that by striving you only pile more suffering on yourself and place obstacles in your way so the best thing is just to let go and appreciate the way things are
People who denigrate striving saying that it did nothing for them forget to think that maybe they were striving in the wrong way
As in the sutta where the Buddha compares the right path and the wrong path If you practice with Wrong View Wrong Resolve and Wrong Effort he says it's like trying to squeeze gravel to get sesame oil
Many meditators are squeezing gravel to get sesame oil
Then they realize that this doesn't work and so they stop squeezing the gravel  and that's where they stop
They celebrate how great it is to stop squeezing gravel thinking that that's the secret to good practice
Well it's an important step but the path actually consists of finding sesame seeds and squeezing them
It may take some effort but at least it produces real results
So if you find yourself pushing pushing pushing and nothing's coming from it ask yourself Am I squeezing gravel to get sesame oil In which case you'd better back up a little bit take stock of your practice and do what you can to get back on the right path
Don't think that just giving up on the effort is going to be a solution
The solution lies in learning how to apply the effort skillfully and learning how to read the results of your actions until you get what you're looking for
This requires not only seeing the connection between your actions and their results but also having the imagination to realize that to stop squeezing gravel is not the only alternative
There is the alternative of finding sesame seeds and squeezing sesame seeds
That way you get the oil
And the oil is really priceless
After all it's the Deathless
Once you touch that in your meditation you have your safe place you have your secure place
It doesn't have to be fabricated
It doesn't have to be protected
It's there and it will always be there for you to tap into when you really need it
So finding that oil is the most important skill you can develop
This gives the most satisfying narrative to your life
The narrative of most people's lives is  what
They were born they struggled they went through all sorts of difficulties and then got sick and died
If they were lucky maybe they got to do some good things for their fellow human beings but then they still just grew sick and died
But if you touch the Deathless that's a very different narrative the narrative of a life that genuinely accomplished something a life well lived
If you don't touch the Deathless the question at the end of your life is What was that all about
What was accomplished by all that producing and consuming all that struggle Whatever you do in time and space is going to get changed someday like a picture you draw with a stick in flowing water
But if you touch something outside of time and space then life hasn't been wasted
The narrative arc is really satisfying  because once you've found the Deathless it's always there to depend on
You always have something to show for your efforts
And that's the most important thing you'll ever need to know
Ajaan Fuang once said that a lot of the practice is found in the grass at the gate to the cattle pen  the image being that when you open the gate to the cattle pen the cattle go rushing out looking for grass someplace else
Usually there's a little bit of grass right next to the posts of the gate but most of the cattle miss it
It's the same with us
When we look for happiness we tend to look far away
Even when we're meditating we tend to look far away from where things actually are
Everything we need to know the Buddha says lies in this fathomlong body with awareness
We sometimes think that Buddhism has a negative take on the body especially early Buddhism but it has more of what you'd call a balanced take
Like the chant just now It isn't lying when it says that the body is filled with all sorts of unclean things  your liver kidneys spleen your intestines the contents of your intestines
If you took them out and put them on the floor we'd have to clean up the mess right away
If you put them in nice platters on the table people would run away in disgust
The only reason we don't go running away from these things is because they're tucked inside right now so they seem presentable
The purpose of the chant is to give you a sense of detachment from your desire from your lust from your attachment to the body as something that constantly has to be pandered to
Once you have that element of detachment then you can look at the body and see What does it have of a positive nature Buddhism talks about that too
There's a potential for rapture right here a potential for ease  all associated with the breath
Many times when we read the descriptions of Right Concentration it seems far away but everything we need is right here
When Ajaan Lee talks about comfortable breath sensations and uncomfortable ones we already have comfortable breath sensations in at least some parts of the body
There's already the potential for a sense of fullness a sense of ease in different parts of the body
It's simply a matter of applying our directed thought and evaluation
What that means is that we locate these potentials and then work with them for a while
The working here many times is simply a matter of protecting them
The word Ajaan Fuang used is prakhawng which means you hover around something to make sure that it's okay that nothing happens to it
It's like trying to start a fire on a windy day
You have to cup your hands around the little tiny flame you begin with to make sure that the wind doesn't blow it out until finally it catches and starts to spread and finally reaches a point when it's strong enough that you don't have to cup it any more
So you might want to try a little exercise in how to locate that sense of ease in the body and let it develop
Pay attention to your feet and your hands
Where are they right now
How do they feel
Tense
If they feel tense relax them
Go through them finger by finger toe by toe through the palms of the hands the backs of the hands the soles of the feet the tops of the feet relaxing all the little spots of tension you find
You might begin to notice that sometimes as you breathe in there's a slight tensing  either in your hands or in your feet maybe the back of your hands or in your fingers
See if you can breathe in and out without the tensing
Just keep both hands both feet as relaxed as possible  all the way through the inbreath all the way through the out
Notice where in the breath cycle there's a little bit of tensing
Allow it to relax
Get so that you can maintain that sense of relaxation all the way through the inbreath through the space between the inbreath and the outbreath all the way through the outbreath and then through the space between the outbreath and the next inbreath
Keep that sense of relaxation as constant as you can
No matter how the breath is cycling through the rest of the body keep the sense of relaxation in your feet and your hands as steady as possible
It doesn't have to be an enormous relaxation just enough for you to know that it's more relaxed than before
One way of checking it is to compare one hand to the other one foot to the other
See which one is more tense and then allow it to relax as much as the other one
Sometimes you find that as you relax the feet and the hands you set off patterns of relaxation through the rest of the body too  up the arms to the neck up the legs to the small of the back
Allow that to happen but don't lose your focus on the feet and the hands
Just let that sense of relaxation spread and keep watch over its source
The focusing on the sensation here is directed thought
Watching over it protecting it is evaluation
Staying consistently with the relaxed sensation is singleness of preoccupation
And in that relaxed sensation there's the potential both for ease and for rapture to develop
So you've got the potential for all five factors of the first jhana
They tend to grow stronger if they're allowed to be continuous
There's a cumulative effect
And that's all you have to do
It's right there
It's very simple but we tend to make things too difficult for ourselves
We complicate things when we don't really have to
So keep your directed thought and evaluation uncomplicated
Just work on being steadily vigilant right here
And that's it the grass at the gate to the cattle pen
Meditation is like running a series of experiments in the mind trying to see what happens when you focus it on one thing for long periods of time trying to see what happens when you really take seriously the idea that the way you use your mind may be causing unnecessary suffering
So you want to see clearly what you're doing where the suffering is and what you can change
This is why it's important that you get accurate results from the experiment
And as with any experiment one of the most basic things  in fact it's so basic that we hardly even think about it  is that you don't want the scientists to be starving
If they're starving they'll eat up the endowment before it even gets to the experiment
Or they'll fudge the findings to get quick results so that they can print them and make a name for themselves
Or if they're really starving  say the experiment involves feeding bananas to apes  the scientists will eat up the bananas first
They'll never get to the apes
What this means is that as a meditator you have to come to the meditation with a sense of wellbeing
This is why the path doesn't begin with meditation
It begins with generosity and virtue because generosity and virtue help you gain a sense of self esteem
When you're generous you see the good that comes from being able to give things away
That in and of itself gives the mind a sense of wealth
Generosity is one of the forms of noble wealth
It gives the mind a sense of contentment
You're not constantly gobbling up your profits
You take part of the profits and share the rest
That provides a different kind of wealth inside
The same with virtue You see the things you could do that might give you an immediate advantage over somebody else but you realize that you'd rather not do them because they're harmful  not only to the other person but also to yourself
As you learn to say No to yourself more and more consistently in situations like that you can begin to trust yourself
As your precepts get tested in more and more difficult situations you gain a greater and greater sense of their worth
If someone were to offer you a thousand dollars to lie you realize you have a precept that's worth more than a thousand dollars
If they offer a million dollars you still can say No
You've got a precept worth more than a million
And you learn a lot of other skills as well in the course of practicing generosity and virtue
For one thing you learn deferred gratification realizing that there are solid pleasures to be gained from putting aside or forgoing quick and easy pleasures that end quickly and easily as well
As you find yourself able to forgo the easy pleasures you gain a sense of responsibility a sense of selfworth a sense that you can trust yourself
This translates into a sense of inner wealth inner wellbeing
This is what you want to bring to the meditation so that you can watch what's happening in the mind with a sense of dispassion
Bad things come up in the meditation and you don't get worked up over them good things come up and you don't grab at them
You can watch them instead of saying Wow this must be something really great and trying to grab them only to find that they're already gone
It's like a woman I once knew in Thailand
She lived down the road from the monastery but was new to meditation
I'd gotten to know her over time and had noticed that she was pretty mercenary
And sure enough one day as she was sitting and meditating she reached out in front of her grabbed the air and fell over
Later she admitted very sheepishly that she had seen a vision of a golden tray floating right in front of her and she wanted it
This is what happens when you meditate with a sense of hunger
You grab at everything that comes by and it just slips through your fingers
You destroy whatever it was
So
Try to come with a sense of wealth that you're not hungry for things so that when something good comes up you can just watch it for a while and say What is this
Is this really good or not If you can develop the patience to watch things then you begin to get a better sense of what's worthwhile
When something really good does come along you can just watch it for a while and not try to gobble it up right away
Even when you can maintain a particular state of ease or rapture you don't want to start jumping to conclusions about it
That's like the scientists who get a few results from their experiments and then are in a great hurry to publish them so that they can make a name for themselves
If you're wise when something comes up in the meditation you're not too quick to interpret it
You just watch it for a while to see what happens to see what it does
What good does it do for the mind
This is what makes all the good things in the meditation good They do good things for you
We're not here to hoard up the jhanas the way you'd hoard up houses on Baltic or Ventnor
When something comes just watch it for a while see what it does
How is it useful in the practice
Ajaan Fuang once pointed out that even states of Wrong Concentration can be useful if you know how to use them
For instance you can get yourself in states of concentration where you totally lose any sense of the body  and here I mean strong states of concentration not that kind of floating deluded concentration where you just lose your bearings
I'm talking about the state of nonperception where you really focus on a very minute spot and refuse to deal with anything that comes in through any of the senses
As a result you can totally blank yourself out
You lose the sense of the body you can't even hear anything and you can stay there for long periods of time
If you make up your mind beforehand that you're going to stay for two hours you'll stay for two hours and then come out right on target
Two hours will seem like two minutes
It's Wrong Concentration because there's no way you're going to be able to develop any insight while you're in that state
But it has its uses
As Ajaan Fuang told me he once had to go into surgery
They were going to remove a kidney but he didn't trust the anesthesiologist so he put himself in this state so that no matter what happened he wouldn't have to suffer pain
So even Wrong Concentration can have its uses
All the more so with Right Concentration
But even Right Concentration as I said is not an end in and of itself
It's part of the path
And the path is worthwhile because it takes you to where you want to go
So whatever comes up in the mind just put a postit note on it saying This seems to be x Then watch it for a while to see what x does
Maybe after a while as you get more and more familiar with the territory of the mind you have to shift the postit notes around
But you haven't lost anything because you've learned what these states are useful for
This is why you want to come to the meditation with a sense of wellbeing
Try to keep the mind on an even keel so that no matter what happens good or bad the mind doesn't have to zoom up with the good things or crash down with the bad
You simply watch
If the mind is centered you can ask yourself This seems good
Where did it come from
Where is it going to go If the mind is scattered ask yourself Where did this come from Try to trace it out
Try to understand what's happening in terms of cause and effect
This requires that the mood not take total possession of your mind
Try to maintain a sense of the observer that's just watching the mood come and go
Of course that observer itself will have its own mood which is a mood of patience a mood of wellbeing but also a sense of urgency This is important work that we're doing here  we don't want to suffer
So it's important that you strike the right balance
You want accurate results
Sometimes that takes time so you're willing to take time  the idea being that when you finally publish your results they really are worthwhile they really are dependable rather than being just a flash in the pan
This requires that you bring a sense of contentment a sense of wellbeing to the meditation
Develop attitudes of generosity virtue and selfrestraint
Practice them in your daily life
And try to get a keen sense for the rewards that come the sense of wellbeing and inner wealth that comes when you know that you can give things away that you can abstain from what you know to be harmful actions
No matter how much you'd like to do something harmful you just don't do it and in that way you build up a sense of inner worth and inner wealth
This puts you in a position where as you watch your mind in the course of the meditation you're really going to see what's happening
You're not going to eat up the endowment you're not going to eat up the bananas before they can get to the apes
You're going to wait until your results are solid and sure before you try to publish anything
That's when the experiment really will be a gift of knowledge both to yourself and to everybody else
I don't know how many times I've started a Dhamma talk by saying Don't listen to the Dhamma talk
Focus your attention on the breath
The talk is here to be a fence to direct you back to the present moment direct you back to the breath in case you wander off The reason I say that is because that's how the Dhamma functions as a whole
It's meant to point you back to your mind in the present moment to what you're doing in the present moment where you can relate things to the present moment  that's when you're using the Dhamma the correct way
When you find that the talk carries you off into speculation you're using it in the wrong way
The Dhamma is meant to function as a set of tools to apply to the present moment
You're not here simply to be here
You want to understand why you're here what you're doing here what's the best thing to be doing here
When the Dhamma talks about the past or the future it's meant to catch you if you've wandered off into the past or the future and to bring you back  not only to bring you back to the present but also to give you a perspective on what you're doing here
For instance the teachings on karma Every time the Buddha talked about cycles of past lives or the general direction of the universe in the future he ended up by saying that it all comes down to what people do that karma is what has fashioned the past will fashion the future
And where is karma being made
Right here right now
What is karma
Intention
That's the action being performed in the present moment
So you want to look at your intentions
The best way to do that is to meditate
As for the future we're shaping think about the past you've shaped with all your past actions
What are the things you've regretted most
Sometimes you might think that you regret something that somebody else did but the things that really burn inside are the harmful things you did
And they burn especially when you did them even though you knew they'd be harmful
Why did you do them
Because you weren't very alert weren't very mindful
You let defilement take over the mind
How are you going to prevent yourself from doing that in the future
By developing mindfulness developing alertness
Where do you do that
Right here right now
So if you're concerned about the future remember that if you take care of the powers of the mind here in the present moment those powers will enable you to handle the future well when it comes
So the teachings related to past and future  particularly the teachings on karma  are designed to bring you back into the present moment and to give you an understanding of why you're here
You're not just hanging out in the present moment because it's a wonderful place to stay
You're not here passively you're actually doing something here all the time
And what you're doing is important
So you want to do something skillful
The Buddha talks about Right Effort the things you should abandon the things you should prevent the things you should give rise to the things you should maintain and develop
He also talks about the four noble truths and each of them has a duty
With stress and suffering your duty is to comprehend it
If you happen to run into some suffering here in the present moment try to comprehend it
If you run into any craving recognize that that's the cause for suffering
Do what you can to abandon it to undercut the ignorance that makes it unskillful
As for the factors of the path  concentration mindfulness alertness  develop those
If you see any moments where craving disbands try to be very clear about how that happens  whether it's simply one craving taking over another one or if there's actually a moment when craving stops and nothing takes its place
Look into that
Make it clear
As for the right efforts or the right exertions I mentioned just now their purpose is to give rise to skillful qualities  like the qualities of the path  and then to maintain them
The preventing and the abandoning apply to the cause of suffering
So the Buddha's instructions are very clear
They tell you what to do
But they don't simply say Do this and don't think about why They give you the reasons so that you understand why you're here in the present moment why you're doing what you're doing
When you understand that much you understand the purpose of the Dhamma
When you use the Dhamma for that purpose you're using it properly to come into the present moment and to sort out what's going on right here and particularly to understand what your intentions are doing
So don't be worried if you don't know a lot about the Dhamma or don't understand it all
Understand enough to bring the mind to stillness
Understand enough to bring the mind to the present moment to watch what it's doing to do it skillfully to be mindful alert right here
If you find yourself wandering off try to keep it as short a wander as possible
If the mind is persistent and constantly going back to the past or worrying about the future keep reminding yourself of the lessons that the Dhamma has to teach about how to relate to the past and the future
The only really beneficial use for the past is to remember your mistakes and to resolve not to repeat them to remember what you did well and see if it applies right now
As for the future its main use is to remind yourself that you don't know how much future time you have left in this particular lifetime
Notice how the Buddha teaches recollection of death It's not just keeping Death death death death death in mind
The proper reflection is If I had just one more breath I could make good use of it So where does that reflection focus you
On the present moment
You do have this one more breath so make good use of it
Have a sense of the value of each breath as it comes in each breath as it goes out
Have a sense of the importance of the present moment
The opportunities are here in the present moment for performing the duties appropriate to the four noble truths for mastering Right Exertion or mastering Right Effort
That's all you really need to know
If you want your understanding of those teachings to get more refined the present moment is the place to look more carefully
Think about the Buddha on the night of his Awakening
His first knowledge was recollection of past lives but that wasn't Awakening
Still it did inspire the question Did this pattern apply just to him or to everybody
And what's the factor that determines whether a life is going to be happy or sad comfortable or not
In the second knowledge he applied his powers of concentration to that question and discovered that the principle of rebirth applies to everybody
He also found that actions performed with Right View  skillful intentions influenced by Right View the view that your actions are important  are the things that led to happy lifetimes
Unskillful intentions performed from Wrong Views lead to suffering
But then the Buddha did something very unusual
He applied that insight to the present moment What do all these lessons have to do with the present moment
That's where the third knowledge came in
He focused on the immediate present on the questions of stress and suffering right here and now the causes for those things as they appear right here and now
In other words he focused on his actions his intentions in the present moment along with the stress and suffering occurring right there in the present moment
And the mental activities that led him beyond the suffering to transcend suffering Those were all right there in that moment too
It was because he looked at the present moment in that way that he was able to break through to something else something that can be touched right here in your awareness of the present but lies beyond it
So learn to use the Dhamma in a way that keeps bringing you back bringing you back to what you're doing right here right now with the determination to do it skillfully with alertness with mindfulness
If you have any doubts about why you're here reflect on what the Dhamma teaches that what you're doing right here is useful
Very useful both for you and for the people around you
A lot of people accuse meditators of simply running away from things but we're not running away
We're running to the source of all things right here
We're accused of doing something totally useless to other people
Well no it's not We're getting rid of greed anger and delusion right here
This benefits not only ourselves but also everyone around us
That's our purpose for being here
And it's an important purpose
It's the most important thing we can do with our lives the sort of thing that if it demands great sacrifices we should be willing to make them
As the Buddha once said even if your practice of the holy life brings tears bathing your cheeks in sorrow frustration and despair you should stick with it
That's much better than giving up
This is the best use of your life
The Dhamma is there to remind you of that
So we're not just hanging out here in the present moment grooving on or blissing out in the present moment  although there may be bliss
That's not all that we're here for
We're here for something more important than that
The teachings on the past or the future  all the teachings of the Dhamma  are here to remind us of that to give us the incentive to stick with the present moment to watch the present moment to work with the present moment to parse it out and see which part of our experience is the result of past karma which is the actual karma we're doing right now which is the result of the karma we're doing right now
And our experimental laboratory is the breath right here
So here you are right at the breath
You're where you should be
You're at the best place you can be right now the most useful place you can be right now
So make the most of this opportunity
When you come to practice meditation tell yourself that you've left all your baggage at the door
You don't have to carry it in here
All of your thoughts about what you've done today what you're going to do tomorrow anything past or future Tell yourself that those things aren't relevant right now
What's relevant is what you're immediately sensing right now
And what is there
There's the sensation of the body and the sensation of the breath coming in and going out
As for the other sense doors you can close them down
Your eyes are closed you can even close your ears
You don't have to listen to the Dhamma talk
As I've said many times before the Dhamma talk is here as a fence
If you leave the breath you run into the fence
Go back to the breath
Don't let the talk interfere with your breathing
Allow the body to relax
Ajaan Suwat once noted that there's a paradox in what we're trying to develop as we get the mind to settle down
On the one hand the texts talk about making the mind soft and malleable
On the other hand they talk about making it strong  strong in the sense that you're not going to get waylaid by other thoughts
You're going to stay focused right here on the breath focused right here on the immediate sensation of the body no matter what else happens
Try to elaborate that as little as possible
Stay just with the direct sensation the breath coming in the breath going out
You feel it right here and you feel the different sensations in the body that let you know where your legs are where your arms are where your head is
Don't try to fill in anything more than what you actually sense
That's a good exercise in selfhonesty right there
Ordinarily we bring a lot of ideas into the present moment perceptions about the shape of the body about how we should breathe about where we should be feeling the sensation of the breathing
If you really look though you see how fabricated those ideas are
If you let them go what have you got left
Explore
When you do you find things softening up a bit
A lot of the tension with which you hold the body to make it fit in with your preconceived notions of what you should be feeling right now gets put aside
As you allow yourself to become more and more sensitive to what you're feeling the tension in the body can begin to relax
You're not here trying to prove anything or to force anything
You're here to explore What have you got right here right now
If there's a sensation of tension or tightness in any part of the body allow it to disperse
You can think of the breath as a means of clearing out that tension
In other words you breathe through it as you breathe in and you allow it to go out with the breath or simply to dissolve as you breathe out
As you let go of the tension in the body your sense of the body here in the present moment your sense of awareness here in the present moment begins to open up
That's the softness the malleability that we're aiming for in the state of concentration
As for the strength that lies in not allowing yourself to get waylaid
Other thoughts are going to come in
That's something you can expect to happen so don't get worked up about it
The trick lies in letting them go right through you
Think of your awareness of the body as a big window screen with lots of little holes
They're porous
When a sound comes in when a thought comes in whatever comes in just let it go right through
You don't have to catch it just as a screen doesn't catch the wind
This way you can combine that sense of being tender softened up more malleable with the strength
The strength lies in the wires in the screen in that they don't get blown away by what's coming through
The softness lies in the holes in the porous nature of your awareness that allows things through
When the breath comes in and goes out it can come in and go out anywhere in the body at all
So experiment and explore to see how that feels
What breathing feels best right now
Look into it
There's long breathing slow breathing fast breathing short breathing hot cool and warm breathing  like the porridge in the story of Goldilocks
You have all kinds of choices but what you want is the one that's just right
You're not trying to program yourself or force yourself into a particular mold
The recommendations of the technique are there to give you guidance in your exploration to give you a sense of direction in what you're doing
But the things you're going to see depend on your own powers of observation as you adjust the breath as you adjust your focus
That act of adjusting is the beginning of discernment
You begin to see connections cause and effect
When you choose to breathe in a certain way certain sensations are going to result either pleasurable or painful
That's the law of karma right there seeing how things arise and pass away seeing the connections between what you do and the feelings that arise and pass away as a result
When the texts describe the insight that leads to the first stage of Awakening they express it as seeing this All that's subject to origination is subject to cessation
That's an insight both into change and into causal connections underlying change
The Pali word for origination samudaya refers to the way things arise together with their causes
As you go deeper into the meditation this insight grows deeper and becomes more allencompassing but it starts with precisely this act of adjusting changing your perceptions and intentions a little bit here a little bit there seeing what feelings result and trying to be as observant as possible as sensitive as possible to what's really happening to what's connected with what
This is why you're told not to force the breath but to allow it to come in and go out comfortably and then to monitor it to see what feels best
Learn to listen to things as they come into being
This was characteristic of the Buddha as he sought Awakening to see things as they come into being
He didn't try blindly to force things in line with a lot of preconceived notions
He was more of an explorer trying different approaches and seeing what results came about
Ultimately he found what worked best in the sense of putting an end to all suffering and then recommended that method for us to follow
He set out all the basic principles but left the details for us to observe for ourselves in our laboratory right here the body sitting here breathing in and out
In other words we're sitting here trying to follow his method not just trying to clone the results
We follow the method he proposed for learning the truths that lie within us
But to get the best results requires developing your own sensitivity your own awareness and seeing what precisely really is there
Recently I've been looking through a field guide on nature observation
The author when he was a child was trained by an old Native American
One day the child asked the old man Why is it that you're not afraid of heat and cold
The old man looked at him for a while and finally said Because they're real
And this is our job as meditators to try to learn not to be afraid of things that are real
Ultimately we discover that things that are real pose no danger to the mind
The real dangers in the mind are our delusions the things we make up the things we use to cover up reality the stories the preconceived notions we impose on things
When we're trying to live in those stories and notions reality is threatening
It's always exposing the cracks in our ideas the cracks in our ignorance the cracks in our desires
As long as we identify with those makebelieve desires we find that threatening
But if we learn to become real people ourselves then reality poses no dangers
This is what the meditation is for teaching yourself how to be real to get in touch with what's really going on to look at your sense of who you are and take it apart in terms of what it really is to look at the things that you find threatening in your life and see what they really are
When you really look you see the truth
If you're true in your looking the truth appears
This is an important principle in the practice
This is why the Dhamma is so precious
Only people who are true can see the truth
Truth is a quality of the mind that doesn't depend on figuring things out or being clever
It depends on having integrity in your actions and in your powers of observation accepting the truth as it is
It means accepting the fact that you play a role in shaping that truth so you have to be responsible
You have to be sensitive both to what you're doing and to the results you get so that you can learn to be more and more skillful
Many people think that selfacceptance means celebrating what's there already that you're good enough that you don't have to make any changes
That's not the case at all
Acceptance means accepting the fact that you're responsible for a lot of your experience right now
You can't blame anybody else
And ultimately that's a good thing
If other people were ultimately responsible for shaping your experience what could you do
You'd have to go around pleasing them all the time
But the key fact is that you're shaping your pleasures and pains here in the present moment
Some of your experience comes from past actions but a lot comes from the way you shape things with each present intention
So learn to be open and honest about the role you're playing in this moment
That way the meditation leads to greater and greater sensitivity into precisely this  what you're doing right now  and into the fact that if you were really observant you'd be a lot more sensitive in shaping your experience
There'd be a lot less suffering
In fact you could ultimately get to the point where you put no suffering into your experience at all
That's how far the skill can go
It requires that you be true in your observation both admitting what you're doing to yourself and admitting the results that come at the same time using your ingenuity to figure out how to do things better
So this is where those qualities of sensitivity or tenderness on the one hand and strength on the other hand come together
The sensitivity lies in allowing yourself to see really refined things the strength in admitting the truth for what it is
It's in this area that the ignorance leading to suffering lies in our inability to be true to ourselves
But as the old man's statement implied if you're true the truth isn't threatening
If you learn to be a real person then reality doesn't hold any dangers doesn't hold any fears
If you're still living in worlds that are false and made up though then reality poses a threat
Only when you strip away all the unreality in your mind will you find in what's left that there's nothing to fear
There are no dangers
There's just reality meeting with reality truth meeting with truth
So the clearer and more honest you are about what you're doing right here right now the closer you get to that position where there's nothing to threaten you where there are no dangers in life no suffering
That's where this simple exercise of watching your breath adjusting your breath and watching it again can take you if you really follow it all the way through
It can be very chastening to see how changeable your mind is
You make up your mind to do something and then find yourself just a few minutes later heading off in another direction
Sometimes it's because you saw that your original intention was not as wise as you thought it was but often it has nothing to do with that at all
The original intention was perfectly fine but you're off headed at right angles to that intention
And you wonder why
One of the purposes of meditation is to see exactly what's happening why you can suddenly veer off at right angles exactly what the mind does to itself in order to drop a perfectly good intention and go someplace totally different
In this way the meditation is like an experiment
You set up some conditions and then watch how they play out
In other words you start by focusing on something you know is good the breath
After all the breath is the force of life and it's very immediate
It's not far off or dubious
It's right here right now
You can see that sticking with the breath and allowing it to be comfortable is bound to have a good effect on the body and the mind
So there's no doubt there
After setting up the breath as the object of your intention the next step is to be aware of any other vagrant intentions that will pull you off in other directions
For the time being the rule in your mind is If a thought doesn't have anything to do with the breath you don't want to get involved
So as soon as you find yourself veering off you don't have to ask a lot of questions
If you're getting pulled away from the breath just drop that thoughtformation and come back to the breath no matter how interesting intriguing or important that thought may be
Just let it go
Leave it in midsentence
You don't have to tie up any loose ends
You don't have to make a little note to come back there and check it out later
Just totally drop it and come back
Now the afterecho of that thoughtformation may continue for a while
That's okay you don't have to listen to it
Your job right now is to train the mind to be more and more consistent in sticking with an intention
And  sure enough  a second thought will come up or a third or a fourth a tenth or a hundredth but no matter how many you're not going to follow them
That's the promise you make yourself when you sit down
And the important thing is not to get discouraged when you find yourself breaking that promise
Just pick yourself up dust yourself off and get back to the breath
Remember This is a deeply ingrained habit we're fighting here so it's going to take effort and time
If you think training a dog is difficult the human mind is even more devious even more resistant to new tricks
It's difficult to train the human mind in this way but it can be done
And the time spent in training yourself in new habits like this is time well spent
After all the force of intention is what shapes your life
We don't often think of the teachings on karma as having much relevance to the meditation
Sometimes we're even taught that karma was one of those weird pieces of cultural baggage that somehow got smuggled into Buddhism from its cultural background
But that's not the case at all
The Buddha had some very specific teachings on karma that had nothing to do with what anybody else was teaching at the time and they're immediately relevant to why and how we're meditating
The why has to do with the point I just raised
Given that karma is intention and intention is the huge shaping force in your life you want some control over it
If you make up your mind to do something that you know is good you want to be able to stick with that intention
And where does intention happen
Right in the present moment
Where does it get changed
In the present moment
This is why we focus on the present moment so that we can see the process of intention in action as it happens and can have a say in where that intention is going to go
The more solidly you can stay in the present moment  the more steadily you can maintain your balance here  the more you'll be able to see and the more conscious say you'll have in the direction those intentions are going to take you
That's the why
As for the how you'll notice as things come up in the meditation that the vagrant intentions have very little to do with anything you were consciously thinking about as you sat down to meditate when you made your intention to stay with the breath
And yet suddenly they appear
This relates to the Buddha's teachings on how your present experience is made up of three things the results of past intentions the actual process of intention in the present moment and immediate results of that present intention
Certain thoughts are going to come up as a result of past intentions and they don't necessarily have much meaning
They just happen to pop up and they can be pretty random
Sometimes we look for inspiration or signs of some special knowledge as we meditate
That can happen but it's also mixed up with a lot of really random stuff
It's like looking for meaning in your dreams Some dreams are portentous some are pretentious and most are totally random
You can't take them as a dependable guide
In the same way you can't necessarily take what pops into your mind in the present moment as a guide either no matter how still or luminous your mind may be for a lot of what pops up is simply the result of random past intentions
But what you can do  by staying solidly in the present moment and solidly with your intention to stay with the breath  is over time to put yourself in a better position to evaluate what comes into the mind
If a thought of greed anger or delusion comes in you'll be able to sense it and to see what it does because you're more sensitive to what's going on here
Insights may come up but you don't have to memorize them
Ajaan Fuang once said that if an insight is really valuable you don't have to take note of it for future reference
Instead see if you can apply it to what's actually happening to your mind in the present moment
If it gives good results stick with it
If it doesn't drop it
If it's a really valuable insight it'll stay with you because you got good results from it
You won't have to tag it put it on a leash and lead it back home with you
The insights are not nearly as important as the ability to put the mind in a position where it can produce insights and evaluate them in terms of what they do in the present
That's why we're trying to get the mind in concentration
Try to be very very alert to cause and effect here in the present moment
When you can see the connection between cause and effect that's when you're in a position to evaluate your thoughts because the worth of a thought lies in its effect
It's like having a goose that lays golden eggs You focus on taking good care of the goose rather than the eggs because these golden eggs are like the gold in fairy tales
If you don't use them or give them away right away they turn into feathers they turn into charcoal
Remember fairy tales
The more you try to hold onto things the more they turn into straw
If you get something good you put it to use
You give it away
That's when you gain something more valuable in return
It's the same with insights
If the insight is appropriate for the time and place fine use it
If not just put it aside
It probably wasn't an insight anyhow because as I said all kinds of things from your past karma can come popping up into a still mind
But the value of a still mind doesn't lie so much in what pops up as in your ability to evaluate what pops up
You can see cause and effect in action
When the mind is really still and very refined it can sense the presence of greed anger and delusion even in minute quantities
It can sense what they do
Your powers of sensitivity are raised your ability to see cause and effect is sharpened
You can tell genuine gold from fools' gold a lot better when the mind is still
So you don't have to trust whatever comes up in the still mind
In fact you're not supposed to trust anything
You're supposed to put everything to the test
The value of a still mind is not that it sees things but that it sees things in action
You can gauge your intentions a lot better when the basic underlying intention in the mind is reliable solid and sure
Here the basic underlying intention is this Always to do what's most skillful
Always choose what's going to be the least harmful the most beneficial course of action
And one of the most beneficial things you can do for yourself is to learn how to stick with a very simple good intention like this like staying with the breath
As you get more and more reliable in staying here you provide the foundation for all the other insights and all the other good things that come from training the mind
So make sure the foundation is strong make sure the foundation is solid and the good things you develop to build on top of that are less likely to topple over
This practice we're doing here is called the karma that puts an end to karma
And because karma is intention this means that the practice is the intention to put an end to intention
That's why it's tricky
If you intend to put a stop to intention that's an intention right there but that doesn't mean it's impossible
It simply means there are going to be some unexpected twists and turns along the path
As the Buddha said the central part of his path is Right Concentration
Concentration basically means a firm intention sticking with one object
You focus your intention on staying with the breath staying with goodwill whatever the object of your meditation and then you try to maintain that intention
Then you see what you can learn about intention in the course of trying to maintain it what other things you can learn about the mind as you try to maintain that intention
The usual culprits to begin with are distractions either internal or external
The internal ones are other thoughts other intentions
At first you hardly realize that they're intentions
You're focusing on the breath everything seems fine and then suddenly you're someplace else half a world away
It's as if someone snuck up behind you threw a sack over your head dragged you off and then dumped you on another continent
You don't know what happened in the meantime
You don't catch sight of the fact that an intention triggered the slipping away
There was one brief moment when you decided I'm out of here Something else popped up in the mind and you went for it
There was a choice
This is why meditation requires so much mindfulness and alertness
As we practice mindfulness means the ability to keep your original intention in mind
Alertness means the ability to keep watch over things around that intention
On the one hand you focus on what's going on with the object of your concentration
On the other you keep track of how the mind is relating to it
Learn how to catch any warning signals that the mind is about to go
It may take a while for you to catch them because they're subtle and quick
The only way to see them is to stick with your original intention and keep yourself warned Okay the mind is going to leave so keep watch for how it does it
At the same time work on ways to make the original intention a good one to stay with
Otherwise the mind is going to resist
Staying with the breath if it's not comfortable is going to be like trying to keep a balloon under water
It'll stay there only as long as your grip is really secure
As soon as there's the slightest slip there it goes popping up out of the water
This is where you have to get your defilements on your side
They want comfort so give them comfort
Try to make the breath as comfortable as possible
The breath here is not just the air coming in and out of the lungs it's your whole sense of energy flow in the body
As the image for the first jhana says it's like working moisture through a ball of bath powder
Or you can think of making bread
You put water in with the flour and then knead it through the flour until every part of that ball of flour is moistened
You take whatever ease and sense of refreshment that comes from the breath and try to knead it through the body all the way out to the tips of the toes all the way out to the tips of the fingers all over the front and back of the body
That makes the body a good place to stay
Or you can think of systematically going through the body
Relax the fingers relax the palms of your hands the backs of your hands your wrists your arms anywhere you can detect tension that pulls you out of a nice comfortable straightupanddown posture
Start with the tips of your fingers and go up your palms the backs of your hands up your arms to the shoulders
Then start with your toes go up your feet your legs pelvis up the back to the neck and then all the muscles around the head
Then try to develop an allaround awareness that can keep the whole body relaxed all the time
This makes the body a much nicer place to stay
As you work on this it engages several parts of the mind such as the desire for pleasure and the desire to explore as you begin to see connections throughout the body
This means you've got allies inside
As Ajaan Lee said it's like taking Mara and putting him on your side
So that's one strategy for staying with your original intention
Another strategy is to learn to be very quick in dealing with your distractions
It's so easy to get entangled in the story line wherever your thoughts lead you
If the distractions come from within a little thought bubble comes up in the mind and says Let's explore this and see where it goes And you end up finding yourself in the Andromeda galaxy
In other words these things can take you far far away into whole other worlds whole other stories
Sometimes it's hard to pull yourself out of those stories because you want to see how they end
It's almost as if you're committed to it
This happens all the time
You walk past a TV and suddenly find yourself in some stupid story
You know the stories on TV are stupid but you still get sucked in
That's because you're already a sucker for getting sucked in to these stupid stories in your mind
So you have to learn to develop a certain amount of skepticism for these stories
Do you really need to know the end
Learn how to cut things off in the middle of a story
The characters won't mind
In other cases the story lines don't start out with internal distractions
They start out with external irritants that pull you away
Other people say or do things that irritate you and all of a sudden you're focused on how much you don't like what they said or did
Then you get upset because they've destroyed your concentration
You can build up huge narratives about how they shouldn't have done that shouldn't have destroyed your concentration
Actually they weren't the ones who destroyed your concentration
You dropped it ran after them and then found some satisfaction in blaming them
Again you've got to learn how to pull yourself out of that mindset as well
No matter what anybody else says or does the breath is still there
You made the choice to leave
That's what you've got to watch out for
So the whole purpose of concentration practice is to get to know the process of intention
The best way of doing that is to stick with this one intention as much as you can because it gives you something to measure your other intentions against so you can notice how they move
Then after the distractions get less and less compelling you can begin to look into this intention you're trying to maintain
What is it made out of
Mostly verbal fabrication and mental fabrication
The verbal fabrication is directed thought and evaluation two of the factors of jhana
Directed thought is when you focus your intention on an object evaluation is when you examine the object seeing whether you like it don't like it what comments you have to make on it
These two processes lie at the basis of every sentence in the mind every sentence you speak
That's why they're called verbal fabrication
Then there's mental fabrication feeling and perception
These things have their intentional element too
Even when you drop directed thought and evaluation to go from the first jhana to the second there's still feeling and perception
In fact the perception  the perception of breath  is what keeps you there all the way up through the fourth jhana
Try to hold onto that perception until the breath energy in the body grows still
Then you stay with still breath as your perception
After a while the border between your body and what's outside your body begins to dissolve
You begin to realize that the border was a perception reinforced by the movement of the breath
When the breath gets still there's nothing to reinforce it
So you can adjust your perception to space or consciousness and there's no border to these things
In other words after dealing with distractions you're able to focus on the one intention that forms your concentration and you begin to understand it
What's the process of fabrication going on in here
If it weren't consistent enough you wouldn't understand it for you'd get nothing but fleeting glimpses
A lot of your insights are just that  little fleeting glimpses  and then you try to connect them
It's like playing connectthedots
And the problem with connectthedots is that the dots can be anything like the constellations in the sky
We look up at Orion in the winter and we see his belt and his knife hanging from his belt
People in Thailand though look up at the same stars and see a plow
The belt is the actual plow and the knife is the part that pulls the plough
And who's to say that we're right and they're wrong
The same holds true for our connectthedot insights
If awareness isn't continuous enough all we see are the lines we've drawn
We don't see the actual dots
But when you can stick consistently with your original intention you begin to see the actual dots and the actual lines what actually connects to what what causes what and what actually makes up this intention we've been working so hard to maintain
The other insight that comes is that as you're maintaining an intention it's like maintaining a yoga posture
Just as you relax into the yoga posture over time in the same way you're relaxing into the concentration
You begin to realize that certain activities in your original intention are not necessary to keep it going
After the mind begins to settle down you have less and less need for directed thought and evaluation
The breath gets more comfortable you get more settled in and there comes a point where you can drop the directed thought and evaluation
You can just be one with the breath  in the same way that when you're in a yoga posture you begin to realize that you've been tensing certain muscles that you don't have to tense
In fact you'd be more comfortable in the posture if you relaxed those muscles
But those insights into which parts are going to have to be relaxed  you can't will those beforehand but you can pose the question in your mind What would be more comfortable here
That's how you can develop insight
When the Buddha talks about developing insight he focuses on posing certain questions in your mind How should fabrications be regarded
How should they be investigated You can't put the mind through a vipassana mill and guarantee that it is going to come out with insight
But if you learn to pose the right questions  and these are basically questions that come from the four noble truths  Where is the stress
What are you doing that's causing the stress Insight starts with simple things like this
What's tense in the breath
What's tense in the body
Where is there any blockage in the body that's really unnecessary
When you see you learn to relax it
Then you focus on the mental factors maintaining your state of concentration Which ones are an unnecessary burden that makes it hard to maintain the concentration
Once you've settled in you learn how to relax those mental activities
That's the pattern for insight and you follow that pattern all the way through as it takes you from one level of concentration to another
It takes concentration as far as it can go
Try to maintain your concentration as much as you can because the more consistently you can maintain it the more you're likely to catch sight of those unnecessary actions
They're activities they're inconstant
If they were totally constant you'd never catch sight of their existence
It's because they come and go that you realize Now it's here now it's not
There's something going on here
The stress comes the stress goes
The cause comes the cause goes
And insight is a matter of learning how to catch sight of these things as they happen
You pare down the intention to stay still until there's nothing left to pare down without totally dropping intention
Again that's something unexpected
You can't intend to see it at a particular moment but you can pose the question
The posing of the question is what's called appropriate attention
That's what opens things up makes it possible to see things that you didn't intend to see or to see them where you didn't intend to see them
This is how things finally open to the Deathless
The Deathless is unintended
It's something that when you hit it you realize was always there and that nothing you can do will change it
The reason you didn't notice it before was because you were entangled in your intentions and the results of your intentions
But you can't get there simply by saying Okay I'm not going to intend anything anymore That doesn't do it
You have to intend Right Concentration That's the doing
That allows you to understand what it means to do well enough so that you can actually stop doing
That's the karma that puts an end to karma the intention that allows you to understand intention until you finally get to the point where you can stop intending
And it really is a stopping of intention
It's not a hall of mirrors where you say Okay I'm going to stop intending to stop intending tending tending which is an intention to stop the intention which is an intention and just goes on and on and on like that
You can't reason yourself into this but it's something that can be induced
You can bring yourself to the brink where it can happen
So work at this intention the intention to stay focused on one preoccupation
Get to know it
Get to be on good terms with it
Get as much of the mind on your side as you can through making the breath comfortable through making the process interesting
And then learn to be resolute at cutting away things that aren't really helpful things that pull you off in other directions
This is going to require all your ingenuity all your attention but it's one of the few skills in life that's really worth all the effort it requires that more than repays all the effort put into it
It'll see you all the way through every possible type of suffering because its rewards are more than you can intend
You can think about the goal you can have a picture of what it's like but the picture in your preconceived notion has an intentional element
It's part of the path because it helps you along gives you encouragement but the actual rewards when they come are much greater
So keep reminding yourself of the Buddha's instructions on tranquility and insight
For the tranquility it's a question of how to settle in how to really steady the mind in its intention how to indulge in it which means to learn how to enjoy it
The insight then comes in learning how to question the intention  not in the sense of doubting it but in the sense of learning how to investigate what's going on here
When you learn how to bring the activities for tranquility and insight together in the right balance then you really come to know what the Buddha was talking about
When the Buddha teaches mindfulness immersed in the body the first thing he discusses is being mindful of the breath
It's good to stop and think for a few moments about why he starts there
One of the reasons is that the breath is your most immediate experience of the body
We have a tendency to identify ourselves with the solid parts of the body and think of the breath as something secondary something that comes in and out of the part we inhabit
But actually you wouldn't know about the solid parts of the body the solid sensations in the body if it weren't for the breath
For one thing you'd be dead
And even if there were some way of being alive and not having the breath the only way you'd know that there's something solid is because something is moving against it moving over it
So think about this as you're focusing on the breath
One way of approaching the body is thinking of it as primarily breath sensations
Ajaan Lee lists a whole series of them the breath that moves up the body the breath that moves down the body the breath that goes out through all the blood vessels tensing and relaxing the muscles in the blood vessels the breath that goes out the nerves the breath sensations that spin around in place the breath energy constantly radiating from the diaphragm the breath constantly coming up the spine
There are all kinds of breath sensations in the body
One way of making the body more comfortable is to think of it as all breath
Every sensation has a breath aspect to it so focus on that breath aspect
If anything seems tight or tense don't write it simply off as being a solid part of the body
Think of it as a breath sensation that somehow got tightened
Loosen it up
Approach it as you would a breath that should be moving through the body
See how that changes the way you relate to it
This is one way of making the body interesting
An important principle in concentration practice is that if you try to rely solely on willpower to stay with an object you won't have much staying power
But if you find the object absorbing it's a lot easier to stay
So look at the body in a new light from a new perspective and see if it becomes more interesting to be sitting right here not doing much of anything else just staying with the body exploring how it feels to be right here and not traveling around outside
If you try to lock the mind into the body it's like locking a child into his room He's going to try to figure out some way to get out the window or start doing something in the room he knows his parents don't like just to spite them
The mind is like that If you lock it in with an object it'll start doing things to spite you
So the trick is to leave the windows and doors open but give the mind lots of things to play with to get absorbed inside
That way the child will stay in its room without your having to force it without your having to lock it in
The breezes come in the window and they won't blow you away because you've got something interesting right here in the present moment
When the breath energy flows more smoothly through the body aches and pains will calm down
You'll be healthier in general
As you really get to know the breath you find that it can induce a sense of refreshment which as you allow it to stay gets more intense and shades into rapture  all simply from being with the breath
So if you find that the breath is boring it's because one you're not paying attention and two you're not asking the right questions
You're assuming lots of things you don't really know about the body in the present moment
Learn how to question those assumptions
Is the body as solid as it seems
Certain sensations of tension or tightness Do they have to be there
Maybe the way you're breathing is what's maintaining them
As you allow yourself to get absorbed in the breath exploring these things you require less and less willpower to stay here
This is the kind of concentration that has discernment as one of its integral factors
In terms of the bases of success it's the fourth one concentration based on the powers of analysis
So give it a try
Explore what's actually happening as you just sit here
The breath comes in the breath goes out the breath spins around in place gets blocked here flows there dissipates here gets strong and constant there
Explore these things
It's part of learning how to take care of the body
And you find that in taking care of the body this way you're taking care of the mind as well
Some people think that when the Buddha describes the five aggregates he's describing what we are but that's precisely what he's not saying
He's saying that we're not that
But the mind does identify with these things  sometimes with the body sometimes with feelings perceptions thoughtformations sometimes with sensory consciousness sometimes different combinations sometimes all of the above
If you could take a movie of the mind's sense of itself it would be erratic and mercurial like a reflection on water  slithering here and there identifying with this identifying with that shapeshifting all the time
In changing position all the time like this the mind expends a lot of energy
One of the things that we want to try to do as we meditate is to get it to stay in one place to save some energy
As long as you're going to have a sense of self keep it solid  rock solid  immersed in the body
Breath meditation is one way of staying immersed in the body
The term in Pali is kayagatasati mindfulness immersed in the body
And the quality of immersion is important
You want to fill the whole body occupy the body inhabit the whole body as much as you can
Where is your observer right now
For many of us it's like a weird bird perched on our shoulders and peering through our eyes
It watches the body as if the body were something separate
But as we meditate we're trying to get away from identifying with that particular observer we want to be an observer filling the whole body
Your feet fill your feet your hands fill your hands
Your entire sense of who you are fills the entire body
This puts you in a position of strength because if you're leaving big gaps of unoccupied territory in your body other things will occupy it  different thoughts different defilements
But if your awareness occupies your whole body other things can't get in so easily
The image in the Canon is of a solid wooden door a ball of string thrown at the door won't leave a dent at all
Even if things do come in and make a dent on the mind you're going to know it you're going to see it because you're right there
You're not off in some other corner of the body looking at something else
So as you focus on the breath try to get past the idea that you're in one part of the head watching the breath in other parts of the body
You want to occupy the whole body bathed in the whole breath
The breath and the body should be surrounding your sense of where you are
And then you want to maintain that sense of being centered in the body like this filling the whole body with your awareness as you breathe in as you breathe out
Why
For one thing this sense of filling the body helps you stay in the present moment
When the mind goes off thinking thoughts about past and future it has to shrink its sense of awareness shrink its sense of itself down to a small enough dot so that it can slip into the past or slip into the future
In other words you latch onto the part of the body that you use as a basis for thinking about the past or the future while other parts of the body get blotted out
But if you're filling the body with your awareness and can maintain that full awareness you can't slip off into the past and future unless you want to
So this is one way of nailing yourself down to the present moment
Your inner hands are nailed to your physical hands your feet to your feet
You can't move
Think of the breath coming into the whole body
Every cell of the body is participating in the breathing process and you're sitting here in the midst of it
This gives your sense of observing self a greater solidity so that when thoughts come into the mind you're not knocked off balance by them
You've got a solid foundation
The word they use for the object of meditation in Pali arammana literally means support the idea being that your mind is standing firm on something
You're standing here in the body
This is your location
This is where you take your stance
And when your stance is solid nobody can kick you over or knock you down
It's like riding on the subway in New York City
The subway sways back and forth and up and down and all around
If your stance is planted just right  so that you don't get knocked over either by the acceleration or deceleration of the train or the swaying to the left or the right  you can maintain your balance no matter what
But life is a lot more erratic even than a subway train
The things that happen around you  sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations things that people do things that people say They can hit the mind with a lot more violence with a lot more force than the wobbling or sudden braking of a subway train
So the mind needs a really solid stance
This is why we work on providing this support for the mind not only while we're sitting here meditating but also throughout the day
Some people complain that it's asking too much of them to pay attention to the events of the day and to the breath at the same time
Well if you're sitting in the back of your head watching the breath in the body and watching things outside it does add an extra burden You've got two things to watch at any one time instead of just one
But if you think of yourself as immersed in your body inhabiting your whole body this puts you in a different position
You're standing in the breath in a position of solidity a position of strength
From that position you watch things outside so that instead of having extra things to do you've simply got a better place to maintain your stance
If your sense of self is inhabiting one little part of the body and things come in from the outside with great force  somebody does something or says something that hits you the wrong way  you can get knocked off kilter really easily because your stance isn't solid
The mind is so used to flitting around from one position to another that it's very easily knocked off balance
But if you're standing filling your whole body with your awareness  this is your stance this is your support  then no matter what comes you can keep your balance
So try to maintain this sense of inhabiting your body being bathed in the breath being surrounded by the breath on all sides not only while you're sitting here but also as you go through the day
Try to maintain this quality of being fully immersed in the body fully aware fully mindful fully alert
Once you can maintain this stance in different situations then you can start observing the sense of self you've created here
If your sense of self is flitting all around  first with a feeling then with a perception then back to a feeling again then to perception and feeling like those weird amoebalike shapes that flit across the surface of water  it's hard to observe to get a sense of What is this self
Why does the mind need a sense of self But as you maintain this one sense of self inhabiting the body immersed in the body surrounded on all sides by the breath it's there long enough for you to observe it What's it made of
What's the form here
Where's the feeling
Where's the perception
Where are the thoughtformations
Where's the consciousness
It's all right here relatively still enough that you can really observe it
There are lots of advantages to having a sense of mindfulness immersed in the body your sense of self immersed in the body
Eventually you take that sense of self apart but in the meantime you learn how to use it so that you don't get knocked over by all the winds and currents of the world
You don't get knocked over by all the currents flowing out of the mind either
When they talk about taking the body inandofitself as your island as your refuge this is what they mean The current of the river flows past but the island stays solid because it's deeply rooted
It's made of rock like Manhattan it's not a sandbar
You've got your awareness deeply rooted in your hands in your feet in the different parts of your body not just in your head not flitting around from here to there
You've got a large sense of awareness filling the present
This puts you in a position of strength which you want to maintain for as long as you can
It helps ward off the currents that come flowing from outside or inside and it also allows you to see your sense of self a lot more clearly to understand what it is  where there's still suffering even in this position of strength where there's still stress and uncertainty and inconstancy
But first you do your best to make it constant
How are you going to believe the Buddha's teachings on inconstancy until you've found some constancy in your awareness
You push the limits
It's only when you really push the limits that you can gain a true sense of where things start pushing back
When the Buddha gave his teachings he didn't simply ask for people to believe what he said
He said to push back inside yourself to test them
So
Inconstancy stress notself How do you test those
By creating a constant sense of ease in the body because this awareness has to be relaxed in order to last
And you can identify with it inhabit it fully
It's only in this way that you can push against the limits and see where the principles of inconstancy stress and notself will push back even in this state of mind
But work on it first
Remember this is a skill taking this stance maintaining this stance being concentrated in the body but concentrated with an expansive sense of ease so that it doesn't become oppressive
Work at filling the body with your awareness so that if they were going to take a picture of your sense of self of the mind's sense of self it would be like the image in the Canon a person totally surrounded by a white cloth from head to toe
Or like Ajaan Lee's image of the mantle of a Coleman lantern  all its threads bathed in a bright white unmoving flame
Try to saturate your body with this sense of relaxed but steady awareness and see what happens as a result
Meditation has to engage not only the thinking part of your mind but also the emotional part
Otherwise it gets dry and doesn't totally train you
So it's good to think about the emotions that need to be involved in meditation for the training to be more complete
The first emotion you're supposed to bring to the training is samvega
That's the emotion Prince Siddhartha felt on seeing the old person the sick person and the dead person
Samvega is a word that doesn't quite have an equivalent in English
It means a sense of shock dismay or urgency and it's related to the adjective 'samvigga' or terrified
It's a chastened realization of what life is like that the pleasures you've been pursuing are fleeting and never really provide satisfaction
Look at you yourself You're fleeting as well
And the amount of suffering in life Not only is life fleeting but there's a lot of suffering before you fleet totally away
There's that famous passage where the Buddha says that the waters of the ocean are less than the tears you've shed in all your many lifetimes
You've drunk more milk from your mother's breast whether your mother was human or a dog or whatever than there is water in the ocean
As the Buddha concludes just thinking about these things should be enough to give you a sense of terror dismay and dispassion enough to make you want to gain release
Taken on its own samvega can be a very depressing realization which is why it has to be paired with pasada or confidence confidence that there is a way out
In the famous story about young Prince Siddhartha seeing the old person the sick person and the dead person he also saw a forest mendicant
That was his fourth vision
His realization after seeing the forest mendicant was This must be the way out
If there's any way out this is it And so he pursued that conviction with a strong sense of clarity and confidence
Ajaan Suwat when he led the meditation here at Metta would often say Start with a sense of pasada that this is your way out
Stick with the practice with that sense of conviction confidence desire
If you approach the meditation in a desultory way you're going to get desultory results
You really have to be devoted to what you're doing here Or as Ajaan Fuang would say You have to be crazy about the meditation if you want to meditate well You have to get fully into the meditation so that it really engages your imagination
What can be done with the mind as you focus it on the breath
What can be done with the breath
How can you learn to relate to the breath in a way that allows you to settle down and see what's going on in the mind
Be curious
Find out
When you meet up with obstacles you need the sort of inquisitive mind that doesn't give up that tries to find a way around the obstacles with the conviction that there is a way around
That's what the confidence is for
If you're lost in the woods convinced that there's no way out there's going to be no way out
If you think there's a way out at least you have a chance of finding it
So when you come up against issues in the meditation be confident in using your ingenuity as much as you can
If you find yourself controlling the breath it's natural that you're going to be controlling the breath
In fact it's important to realize that that's happening
Many times they say Let the breath come in and out on its own
Don't control it What happens then though is that you don't notice how you're controlling it
The controlling all goes underground
What we're doing here is bringing the issue of control out into the open
As long as you're controlling the breath anyway try to do it consciously skillfully
And what is it that controls the breath
There's an intention and there's a perception
Can you be clear about your intentions and perceptions
Can you change your intention to be more sensitive to what the breath really needs
Can you change your perception of the breath so that the way you control it actually causes less stress does less harm
What ways of thinking of the breath coming in and out of the body help to overcome the unhealthy or unskillful ways that you control the breath
What different kinds of breathing energy are there in the body
Look into that as well
You'll find that different kinds of breath energy are helpful at different times
When you've got lower back problems it's good to think of the breath energy coming up continually from the soles of your feet giving more strength to the back as it goes up and then out the top of the head
If there's a tightness in the chest think of the tightness dissipating out through the shoulders the arms and the fingers
In other words use your ingenuity so that you become more and more interested in staying in the present moment
All too often we approach concentration practice as an exercise in forcing the mind to stay still not to think not to move not to do anything
And of course as soon as you tell it not to move it's going to start fidgeting around like a little kid told to sit still in a chair
But if you give the kid something to play with something to explore he can get still and very enthralled
He can sit in the chair for hours without complaining
So try to engage your ingenuity as you practice
And always have the confident conviction that no matter what the problem in your meditation there's a way around it
That confidence is going to help see you through
Of course simply the confidence is not going to be enough
You have to use your ingenuity until you start seeing results as well
And when you start seeing results there will be a sense of ease and finally a sense of rapture  a sense of fullness or refreshment
When you've finally figured out how to be with the breath consciously and intentionally and yet can allow the breath energy to feel full in every little cell in the body rapture arises
You can maintain that rapture by learning how to maintain the right amount of pressure so that you're not squeezing the breath pushing it or pulling it  and some people experience this as a sensation of drowning
They're so used to breathing in a particular way or having the mind's cartoon idea of what the breathing has to do as it comes in and out the body that when they finally give up on that cartoon idea there's a sense of drowning
Some people find this really scary but it's nothing to be scared of at all
Simply sit with it
If the breath is going to come in it's going to come in
If it's not going to come in don't worry about it
You're not going to die
The breath will have to come in at some point if it really has to
And maybe it won't have to
Maybe you're getting enough oxygen through your pores
So allow the breath not to disturb anything that feels still
If you don't disturb the stillness it grows a sense of fullness and with it a sense of ease
You become a connoisseur of your breathing
You learn to really enjoy it
This amount of enjoyment is a necessary part of the path as well
It's the food of your meditation
As you learn to feed off that you start looking at the other things the mind has been feeding on and realize that they're pretty miserable food
This is where the sense of nibbida comes in
It's sometimes translated as disenchantment sometimes even as disgust or revulsion
What it means is a sense of having had enough of something and no longer being attracted to it because you've got better food to feed on
Once you're used to good wholesome food you feel repelled by junk food
You don't crave it any more
A lot of the preliminary work in discernment consists of learning how to maintain a sense of stillness of being centered with a sense of fullness and learning to adjust it as you need it learning to gladden the mind when it needs to be gladdened to release the mind when it needs to be released to steady it when it needs to be steadied
And every time you catch it slipping off to feed on something else ask yourself Why are you going there
What good do you get out of that kind of feeding
A lot of the discernment comes in seeing that the other things you've been feeding on all through your life really are not worth the effort
You've really got something much better here
Only when you've been able to use the concentration as a basis for overcoming passion especially sensual passion do you have to transcend the concentration itself
That's when your sense of nibbida or disenchantment can turn to the concentration because you've discovered something in the mind that doesn't need to feed on anything anymore even on the pleasure and the rapture the equanimity of concentration
That's when nibbida and viraga or dispassion become total
That's when they can liberate the mind
As you can see the meditation involves a long series of different emotions
The Buddha sometimes talks about the grief and the joy of being on the path
Those get involved as well
The grief is simply the realization that there are a lot of dangers in life and you haven't reached the goal yet
But you learn how to use even the grief as a spur to your practice
At the same time it should be combined with a sense of confidence conviction desire leading to the joy that comes when you can actually see yourself making progress
The mind can settle down more than it used to has a greater sense of wellbeing wholeness and fullness than it had before
You can take joy in that
So even though the path involves figuring things out intellectually that's not all it is
It's also a matter of learning how to marshal these different emotions some of which are normally regarded as negative samvega grief disenchantment disgust
But they have their uses so learn how to cultivate them all along the way
Without these emotions the practice doesn't go anywhere
With them it can take you to release
Ajaan Suwat would often begin his evening Dhamma talks by saying to put yourself in a good mood to approach the meditation with a sense of confidence reminding yourself that you're doing something that's very good
It may be difficult but it's good
And it requires that you keep yourself in a good mood no matter what happens no matter how poorly it goes
Grace under pressure is an important skill in the meditation the ability to smile to yourself no matter what happens  what the Thais call smiling in defiance of the tigers
That ability has saved a lot of meditators from going off course getting discouraged and letting their meditation crash
So whatever comes up in the meditation treat it with good humor
The ability to laugh at yourself is probably one of the most important abilities you have as a meditator
It's a matter of perspective and also of balance
After all you have to keep a certain amount of pressure on yourself as you meditate
This is an earnest endeavor we're involved in but you can't let it get grim
Find out for yourself what exactly is the right amount of pressure to put on yourself and how to apply the pressure skillfully
You've probably heard the story about the monk who was so delicately brought up that he even had hair on the soles of his feet
When he spent hours doing walking meditation of course his feet started wearing through getting all bloody and this got him discouraged
Well he said to himself maybe I'd better return to the lay life That was back in the days when the Buddha was still alive so the Buddha levitated there  don't you wish you had the Buddha levitating to you when your meditation got bad
The Buddha came and said to the monk When you were a lay person you used to play the lute right The monk said Yes Well what happened when the strings were too tight They would snap And when they were too loose You couldn't get a good sound out of them
The Buddha then said It's the same with the meditation
First tune your level of energy the amount of effort you can put into the meditation
And then tune everything else all the other faculties  conviction mindfulness concentration discernment  to the level of energy you can manage It's like tuning a guitar
First you tune one string and then you tune the other strings to the first one
In meditating your first string is the amount of energy at your disposal
You want to put enough pressure on yourself to actually get results but not so much that you snap
And one good way of putting a lot of pressure on yourself without snapping is to keep a good sense of humor about the whole thing to keep yourself in a good mood
This involves the way you talk to yourself as the meditation goes on
When things don't go well just drop whatever it is that's not going well
Move back to a level where you're pretty sure you can do things properly
And don't engage in a lot of recriminations because they don't help anything at all
Just remind yourself that that's not what we're here for drop it and go on
When you develop this sense of good mood you can ratchet up the level of pressure  the amount of time you spend with the meditation the persistence with which you pursue it  without snapping
So whatever comes up in the meditation whether it's good or bad or whatever always try to keep a good sense of humor
Even when things seem to be going well maintain a good sense of humor
Don't get swollen up with your importance or your accomplishment because then you get complacent and it's easy to crash
When I went to study with Ajaan Fuang one of the first things that really drew me to him was his sense of humor
A good sense of humor usually goes with wisdom
The ability to step back and keep things in perspective That's what makes you wise
It's precisely what you need as a meditator
So when things start getting grim when nothing seems to work just step back for a bit and try to regain your good humor
You'll find that that more than anything else will carry you through
Researchers have done studies showing that people who regularly suppress their emotions tend to be stupider than people who don't
They're less observant and have trouble thinking through things clearly
And so the question is when you're meditating are you making yourself stupid
It depends on how you meditate
But first you have to understand what it means to suppress an emotion You deny that it's there
In other words suppressing it doesn't just mean that you're simply not expressing it it means that you're also trying to hide it from yourself
The walls of denial go up in the mind
They make it difficult to think clearly to connect things to see relationships
And it takes a lot of energy to keep those walls up which means you have less energy to observe things
This is why suppressing emotions makes you stupid
So as you meditate it's important to understand that you're not here to suppress an emotion to deny that it exists
You want to be very clear about what's going on in the mind but at the same time you want to learn how to use the mind wisely to approach your emotions wisely
When fear greed anger or delusion come up in the mind it's not necessarily helpful to express them outside because sometimes that makes it difficult to observe what's going on too
There has to be a middle way between the expression and the suppression
This is important
Often as you meditate you try to tell yourself Don't react
Just be equanimous
Don't get excited
Don't get worked up about things And then you try to convince yourself that that's what's actually happening
You see ideals of what an enlightened person is like  very calm peaceful equanimous  and you try to clone the calm to clone the equanimity
Remember though that Right Cloning is not one of the factors of the Path
The relevant factor is Right Mindfulness having the right frame of reference for dealing with pain and pleasure as they come
If you view the pleasure simply as something to run toward or the pain as something to fear or run away from you're creating a situation in which the emotions that arise  the liking and the disliking  are going to get in the way of really seeing anything
So you want to create a different frame
Instead of seeing yourself as a person partaking of the pain or the pleasure you want to dismantle that perception
You want to have another way of approaching pain and pleasure so that you don't feel threatened by the pain and don't simply indulge in the pleasure
This is why you need a technique as the foundation of your meditation
We've talked many times about meditation as not just a technique but you can't meditate without a technique either
You need to view the technique in the context of certain values certain understandings but you can't denigrate technique  because it provides part of your frame of reference
For example you're dealing here with the breath and you may notice that some ways of breathing are more comfortable than others
Then you begin to realize the connection between the discomfort and the breath the comfort and the breath
And because the breath is something you can control to a certain extent you've got your handle
You can try breathing in different ways
You can change the rhythm
You can change the texture the depth
You can try heavy breathing light breathing broad or narrow shallow or deep
That's changing the mechanics of the breathing
You can also change your perception of the breath
When you breathe in exactly what's happening
What's moving
And what's moving what
Often we have cartoon ideas about the process and those ideas determine which muscles we're going to expand which ones we're going to contract which sensations we believe have to be part of the inbreath which sensations have to be part of the outbreath
But if you can learn to question those presuppositions you find that the breathing opens up
There are lots more possibilities
You can conceive of the body as a sponge When you breathe there's energy coming in and out through every pore
If you apply that perception to the breathing the actual physical sensation of the breathing is going to change as well
The rhythm is going to change
Or you can think of having an energy core that runs down the center of the body
The inbreath comes in to that central core when it goes out it leaves that central core
Or you can think of breathing in and out through parts of the body that normally aren't associated with the breath
You can breathe in and out through your legs for example or through your brain or your hands
As you experiment with notions of the breathing you discover lots of varieties
And they have different results in terms of feelings of ease or discomfort pleasure or pain
You find that patterns of tension in the body that you assumed were a necessary part of having the body sit upright or having the body breathe are actually not necessary at all
You can breathe through them and they begin to loosen up
This leads you to explore other feelings of blockage or pain in the body as well
Say there's a pain in your knee
How much of that pain is actually the result of physical causes and how much of it is a result of the way you're breathing
You can experiment and in this way the technique gives you a different framework for looking at sensations of pleasure sensations of pain
In other words where there's pleasure you realize that to maintain that pleasure you can't just wallow in it or create a sense of yourself as gulping it down because that usually puts an end to it
But if you stay with the breath and maintain your perception of the breathing in the right way you can maintain that sense of pleasure too
It's a positive thing
After all the pleasure that comes from concentration is one of the factors of the path Right Concentration
It's something to be developed
As for the pain that also becomes something you can approach with the tools you've learned from your technique
Try breathing through the tension around the pain
If the pain is in your knee you can think of the breath coming in and out right at the knee
Or you can think of it going down the leg and through the pain in the knee and then out through the toes
Or if it's already coming into the knee you can think of it coming in from the kneecap or coming in from behind the knee
There are all kinds of ways you can play with your perceptions of the breath
As you experiment with them you find that they have an important impact on the actual feeling of pain and your attitude toward the pain
You feel less threatened by it
You begin to develop an inquisitive attitude which as the Buddha said is how you approach the First Noble Truth
You want to comprehend it and that requires you to be inquisitive about pain trying to understand it
So the breathing technique gives you several important approaches for dealing with the pain
Instead of just sitting here and spinning out over the pain  thinking Here I am sitting and hurting myself by letting my knee get all bent up like this  you can focus instead on Okay what are the mechanics of the pain
How do they relate to the energy flow in the body Having a comfortable breath sensation as your basis in some other part of the body gives you a place you can go when the pain gets too much to handle
You've got a place you can turn around and run to and when you have that sense of safety and security then you feel less threatened by the pain
You're more inquisitive and at the same time you actually have tools that can lessen the pain
And because your approach is one of being inquisitive rather than trying to push the pain away or squeeze it away your attitude is going to have a huge effect on how you experience the pain
There are cases where the change in attitude will make the pain go away
At other times the pain won't go away but it doesn't matter because you're not involved in trying to feed off the pain
You don't find yourself forced to consume the pain
You're not a consumer anymore
You're an experimenter inquiring into What's the nature of this pain
How much does the way you breathe affect the pain
How much does your attitude affect the pain
What are you doing that makes the pain hurt the mind After all the pain is something in the body
It doesn't have to hurt the mind
We're doing unskillful things we have unskillful attitudes unskillful ways of relating to the pain that drag it into the mind
We've got to turn around and look Okay what are we doing that turns the pain into suffering for the mind
So by creating this new frame of reference through the technique you're not suppressing your fear of pain
Your new frame of reference changes your attitude toward the pain so that you can see it more clearly
We often believe that our emotions are a given that they're purely visceral that they come prior to our thoughts but that's not necessarily so
A lot of unspoken or poorly articulated attitudes have gotten buried in our minds  a lot of unskillful habits of dealing with pain say that come from way back when
Those are the things that fuel our emotions around pain
They also fuel our emotions around pleasure
As we create this new framework though we'll start stirring up some of those attitudes and calling them into question Who is this 'me' that's been devouring the pleasure and then suddenly finds itself devouring pain
Who is this consumer
And is it just consuming or is it also producing the pain producing the pleasure Start questioning these attitudes to get a clearer sense of what's actually going on
In this way you're not trying to clone enlightenment and you're not trying to suppress your emotions
You're just learning how to deal with your emotions in a more intelligent way
And that way the meditation instead of making you dumber actually makes you more perceptive more intelligent better able to see relationships
It's not a matter of suppression
It's not a matter of pretending that you're awakened when you're not
You're just learning to be very frank about what's actually going on by learning to question your assumptions of what seems to be obvious about what's going on
So the meditation is not a process of programming you to have a certain sort of personality or certain sort of demeanor
It's not teaching you to clone anything
It's a series of instructions for how to explore
Instead of piling more denial on top of the denial already there in the mind you're learning how to peel it away and not to be afraid of it not to be afraid of what you're going to find as you peel it away because you've got your tools to deal with whatever comes up
The chants we do in the evening before the meditation are meant to put you in the right frame of mind to do the meditation pointing out skillful ways of thinking
Whether we're contemplating the body issues of aging illness death and karma thoughts of goodwill reflection on the nature of the world All of these thoughts are designed to remind you of how important it is to meditate
They also remind you of your motivation for meditation
Whether you're here to find something solid in the midst of the world or as an expression of goodwill it's useful to remember  each time you sit down to meditate or do walking meditation  why you're doing it the importance of what you're doing so that you do it with an attitude of proper respect and attention
In other words you don't just go through the motions
You don't treat it casually
This is important work we're doing here  a point that's easy to forget
So we keep reminding ourselves because thinking like this is an integral part of the meditation
People often believe that we're trying to learn how not to think or trying to get the mind away from its conditioning simply by stopping any language from going through the mind
But the Buddha's instructions on meditation involve a lot of thinking training the mind to think in skillful ways
But unlike psychotherapy  which tries to trace your thoughts back to their origins where they're coming from in time  he focuses on where they're going where they lead
Do they lead you where you want to go
And he gives some recommendations on ways of thinking that really help you go in the right direction
As you carry through with his ways of thinking part of your mind is going to rebel
For example when you develop thoughts of goodwill there may be a little voice in the back of the mind saying Well I don't really feel goodwill for these people Or I don't give a damn about where my thoughts are leading I want to think about this Don't assume that the purpose of these exercises in directed thinking is to smother up those other thoughts or to pretend they don't exist
Actually the purpose of the exercises is to dig the problems up bring them out into the open
If the question of how you think about the beings in the world isn't brought up you can sail merrily along with all sorts of mixed motives all sorts of mixed attitudes not really being aware of what you're doing or of how your attitudes are coming out in your actions
Or if you have that apathetic feeling It doesn't really matter what I do so I might as well just do what I like  it's good to know that it's there
Then you can deal with it
So if you find these argumentative thoughts coming up in your mind take note of the fact
Ask yourself Are you ready to dig into them
Are you strong enough
If you aren't you can continue with the meditation leaving them for the time being but at least you know they're there
This is important
As Ajaan Lee once said to practice is to learn about your defilements the things that hide under the surface and exert a lot of pressure and influence on your life often without your knowing it
You're a lot better off knowing they're there even if you can't quite deal with them yet
You're in a better position knowing they're there and that they'll have to be dealt with
Sometimes just bringing them to the surface is enough to make you realize that you don't want to identify with them
If apathy comes up you look at it
Do you really want to side with it
Look at the lives of other people who are apathetic
Where do they go
Or if a voice in your mind has ill will for this or that group of people Is that a voice that you really want to identify with
Remember you have the choice
We're not here to hammer out our genuine opinions about things to reach a final judgment on them
We're here to see where thinking goes and how to use our thinking in skillful ways
This is part of the training
It's like training for a marathon
Once you've made up your mind to run the marathon you've got to deal with the thoughts in the mind that resist
Some of them you can simply push out of the way as being ludicrous or totally out of line with your real aspirations
Others you have to sit down with and work through
But the fact that you've made an aspiration is important
If you've decided that this is an aspiration you really want to hold to you owe it to yourself to work through all of your resistance because so many of us go through our lives aimlessly without any kind of aspiration at all
Here as we're meditating we've got a big one putting an end to suffering
As the Buddha points out in the course of training the mind you've got to learn to deal with skillful and unskillful thoughts  skillful meaning those that lead in the direction of putting an end to suffering unskillful ones those leading in the other direction
At least you've made it clear to yourself where you want to go
That in and of itself is an important accomplishment
Even if you haven't devoted yourself  in that direction it's important at least that the issue is raised
So many of us go through life without even thinking about where we're headed
We think about it a little bit here and there but not in any concerted way not in a way that makes us sit down and really look at our lives
For a lot of people thinking about the general trajectory of their lives is pretty depressing so they push the issue away
Big issues like aging illness and death get pushed off to the corner until they can no longer be pushed off
Then they come out at you with their eyes red and their fangs gleaming
You're not prepared to deal with them
Often they hit precisely when you're at your weakest point flat on your back
If you haven't prepared for them they come at you while you're down
Here while you're meditating at least the issues are raised
You've got to ask yourself while you're healthy while you're young enough while you're still alive What are you going to do to prepare for the time when aging illness and death and separation move in
And you're actually given a course of practice something to train in to help you out when those things happen
So when you're given a practice  whether it's the precepts or the contemplations that the Buddha recommends  it's not that you're going into denial pretending that you don't want to break a precept or pretending that you don't harbor feelings of ill will
These contemplations are meant more to raise the issue Do you really believe that your actions are important
Do you really believe that it's important to act skillfully
Do you believe that your thoughts are important that it's important to think skillfully
Take some time to probe into those questions because they're central to your life
And don't let yourself get sucked in by the media out there
They'd rather that you not ask those questions that you lead a very shortsighted life so you'll be content just to buy their things
So this is an act of resistance here
It's also an act of wisdom
When a particular reflection or contemplation brings up uncomfortable issues in the mind realize that that's part of its purpose to bring up those uncomfortable reactions if they're there
If they're not there you're fine
If they are there you want to know
As I said sometimes when they come up they just wither away in the light of your awareness
Other times you realize that they're like boulders that have been hidden under the water
The water has lowered a little bit and now you see that there are boulders down there
You may not be in a position to dig them up but at least you can avoid them for the time being knowing that someday you're going to have to clear the channels
In the meantime you're alerted that you have to work on your tools  mindfulness concentration discernment  so that eventually you can dig out those boulders
Then they'll no longer be in the way
Gladdening the mind
This is an important skill in the meditation
The Buddha lists it as one of the basic steps in mindfulness of breathing
If your meditation gets dry it starts to seize up like an engine without any lubricant
So you need to keep your mind lubricated keep it refreshed as you're practicing
There are lots of different ways of doing this
Ajaan Lee gives the analogy of a parent who hears her child crying and knows when to take it out for some air when to give it something to play with when to feed it
In other words you learn to read the cry and to look at what the child is doing so that you can get an idea of what needs to be done to put the child back in a good mood
The mind is very much like a child  you have to look after its moods every now and then
One way is to drop the breath for a while and focus on some of the other recollections that the Buddha recommends recollection of the Buddha recollection of the Dhamma recollection of the Sangha
With recollection of the Buddha you remind yourself that you're following a path set out by someone who was totally free of defilement  who had no agendas no ideas he was pushing just for the sake of satisfying or pleasing himself
He had found what worked and he taught it straightforwardly
Now where are you going to find something like that anywhere else in the world
One of the reasons why deconstructionism is so prevalent in universities is because people often advance an idea because they want power over other people they want to influence other people to act in ways that are pleasing to them
The purpose of deconstructionism is to see through those agendas
But in the Buddha's case all he asked was that people practice the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma
On the night of his death when the devas were singing songs throwing down flowers and incense in honor of him he said This is not the way to pay homage to the Buddha
The way to pay homage is to practice the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma  which means practicing for the sake of dispassion practicing for the sake of disenchantment with things practicing for release
In other words you show homage to the Buddha by gaining release from suffering for yourself
That's all he asked for
His was the most compassionate of motives
So when you're getting discouraged about the path think about the other paths you might be following in life and realize there's nothing quite like this one
Even when you haven't yet reached the end of the path it's still a good path to be on
And the same holds true for recollection of the Dhamma
Think of all the good things the Dhamma has you develop inside
Of course being on the path means that they're not fully developed yet but at least you're headed in the right direction your trajectory is headed to the right place
The Buddha talks about the grief that comes from not having attained your goal on the path but he said Look it's a lot better than the grief that comes from not having sights or sounds or smells or tastes or tactile sensations that you like  he calls that householder grief And where does that grief lead
It leads people to struggling and fighting and grabbing after things that are just going to slip through their fingers
Whereas the grief that comes from being on the path doesn't cause strife and it leads in the right direction
Just that thought should inspire you to practice further on the path
The only problem is when the grief gets too heavy the discouragement gets too heavy  that's when you need to gladden the mind by reflecting on all the good things you've done as part of the path
And the path is asking you to do only good things things you can be proud of things that feel noble honourable
You're not being asked to compromise your ideals when you practice the Dhamma
In fact you're being asked to raise your ideals to a higher standard
Then there's recollection of the Sangha
When your mind feels full of defilement remind yourself that members of the Noble Sangha have all been in the same place you are
And people of all kinds  men women children rich people poor people educated uneducated healthy sick  they've all been able to find within themselves the strengths needed to overcome the weaknesses within them
If you're having a long dry stretch in your path read some of the Theri and Theragathas where the monks and nuns tell of long dry stretches in their own practice thirty years or more
And yet eventually they still gained Awakening
So you can take encouragement from that
Then there's recollection of your generosity of your virtue  all the good things you've done as you've been following the path
This is a valid recollection a good one for gladdening the mind as well
As for recollection of the devas This doesn't mean you sit thinking about devas
You think about qualities that make a person into a deva
The first is the sense of shame you feel when you think of doing things that are beneath you realizing that you're a better person than that
The second is fear of the consequences of unskillful actions  which means that you have a wellintegrated sense of self able to deny yourself immediate pleasure that's going to have longterm bad consequences for the sake of actions that may not be so pleasant right now but are going to lead to good results on into the future
These are qualities that make people devas and you have them within yourself
So that helps to gladden the mind
There's the story in the Canon of a monk sitting in the forest on a holiday night
Off in the distance he can hear people playing music and having a good time and he feels very discouraged
Here he is miserable sitting out alone in the forest and everybody else is having a good time
And a deva comes and says Look there are lots of people who really envy you because they see where you're headed as for the people out there having a good time their lives aren't headed anywhere
So when the path starts getting discouraging and the mind starts feeling dry these are things you can think about to remind yourself that you're on a good path
It may be a long path but it's a lot better than not being on a path at all or on a path that requires compromises in terms of your ideals in terms of your sense of what's right and honourable and then yields a happiness that laughs in your face and runs away
Another good way to gladden the mind is with the breath finding ways to breathe that give a sense of ease wellbeing and refreshment both to the body and the mind here in the present moment
Don't be afraid of those feelings thinking that they're an attachment
Of course you're going to be attached to them  but it's better to be attached to good things than to things that stir up the mind in harmful ways
In the beginning these feelings of refreshment and rapture come and go seemingly without any pattern
But over time you begin to realize that they do have a pattern
When you get more and more familiar with them you can tap into them more and more regularly
Another way of gladdening the mind with the breath is to explore different ways of breathing
Try to think of a way of breathing you never thought of before and see what it does for the sense of the body
Think of the breath energy coming in not from the outside but welling up from within
Or breathing with different parts of the body breathing with your legs breathing with your arms breathing with your fingers
Notice which part of the body has been the neglected stepsister  starved of breathenergy  and focus on giving it as much breath energy and attention as you can
In other words use your imagination
If you feel patterns of tension in the body think of a big knife coming through to cut cut cut cut cut all the patterns of tension
In other words use your imagination here  not to wander away in fantasy worlds but to explore some of the possibilities in the present moment
Try to think of some impossible ways of breathing and then try them  because you can learn a lot about your body that way what's really possible and what's not
It's like reading about quantum physics
Some of the things they've noticed in their experiments as far as they can tell can be explained only by allowing for the idea that certain particles go backwards in time
That explanation required a real leap of the imagination
There's so much out there in the world that's counterintuitive
Your sense of the body here in the present moment has a lot of counterintuitive potentials as well
If you only go with your normal intuition that's all you see what you expect to see
See if you can surprise yourself with new ways of thinking about the breath
So there are lots of different ways of gladdening the mind
As Ajaan Lee said it's like being a good parent
You need lots of different tricks up your sleeve
If the child cries and all you do is feed it every time it cries you're going to end up with a fat grumpy child
Sometimes the child has to go to the bathroom sometimes it's just bored sometimes it needs some fresh air it needs a change of scenery
If all else fails and nothing in the meditation seems to cheer you up go out and walk around for a while
Find a little job to do
Notice some place in the monastery where it's not clean where things are disorganized and straighten them out
In other words learn how to find pleasure in doing skillful things of every sort
Ajaan Fuang once said that when he was a young monk he used to avoid construction projects around the monastery
He'd help a little bit and then sneak off to meditate
Ajaan Lee never said anything about this until they were preparing for the Buddhist year and Ajaan Lee was going to hold a big celebration at Wat Asokaram
One day he said to Ajaan Fuang If you don't help me I'm going to die you know So Ajaan Fuang thought about it for a while and finally said to himself Well construction work in the monastery is a form of skillful activity
If I die with a hammer and saw in my hands  well at least I was using the hammer and saw for good things
So be the sort of person who's always hunting for something skillful to do because this lifetime is so short
If you spend your time just being depressed or discouraged you waste so many opportunities for doing good
There's so much good that needs to be done in the world
Starting from little things like keeping your surroundings clean and neat and working on up It's all worthwhile
There are so many ways you can gladden the mind
There's a story in one of Ajaan Lee's talks about an old woman who went to the monastery and noticed that the walking meditation paths weren't well swept
So she swept them and set out some water for washing feet
Just that much made her feel cheerful
It so happened that on her way home she had a heart attack and died
The next thing she knew she was a deva just from the cheerfulness that came from keeping the place around her clean
This story illustrates an important principle Whatever you can do to gladden the mind in a wholesome and skillful way is part of your repertoire as a good meditator
Try to make the mind quiet
Try to make the body quiet
There are lots of levels to that quietness
One means sitting quietly  but of course the body isn't the only thing making noise and chattering away
The mind is too
And just as when you want to hear something very subtle you have to sit very quietly if you want to hear the subtle things going on in your mind you have to make the mind quiet too
Focus it on the breath
Try to cut down on all the chatter
If you want to talk to yourself talk about one thing
Talk about the breath
Ask yourself Is the breath coming in
Is it going out
When it comes in how does it feel
Where do you notice it
When it goes out how does it feel
Where do you notice it
Does it feel good
Does it not
If it doesn't feel good you can recommend different ways of changing it
Try a little longer try a little shorter deeper more shallow faster slower
Find the rhythm and texture of breathing that feels good for the body right now
If you're feeling tired try to breathe in a way that gives you more energy
If you're feeling tense try to breathe in a way that's more relaxing
You can talk about these things to yourself
That kind of chatter is not out of place in the meditation
It's called directed thought and evaluation which are two of the basic factors for Right Concentration
But otherwise try to keep the mind as quiet as possible  because you want to notice what's going on
And of course what you're going to notice is that there are a lot of other ideas floating through the mind
Sometimes they don't just float
They yell at you
They taunt you
They whisper to you
But you have the power of choice
You can choose which voices to listen to and which ones to put aside
You don't have to believe everything you think
You don't have to obey everything you think
So listen carefully to those voices
You'll begin to realize how much they push your life around
Some of them are wellmeaning voices some of them aren't
You don't know where you've picked up a lot of these ideas that you carry around inside
One of the functions of meditation is to give you a place to stand inside and listen very carefully so that you can figure out where these things came from
More importantly you can see where they lead
If you listen to certain thoughts where are they going to take you
All too often when a thought comes up in the mind it's like someone driving up in a car
You're standing on the side of the road someone drives up and says Hop in And so you hop in without asking Where are you going
Who are you If we lived our lives that way we'd be dead by now
Someone would have driven us to a dark place robbed us shot us and dumped our body out the back door of the car
But that's the normal way things are in the mind
Thoughts come in and you just go with them
So you've got to step back
Ask yourself Which thoughts really are my friends
Which ones aren't In other words which ones will to lead to your true happiness
Which ones won't
The chant we recited on friends just now applies both to friends outside and to friends inside
There are true friends there are false friends
You've got to figure out which is which and to encourage the true friends
Notice that the Buddha said Attend to the true friends earnestly In other words when you figure out that someone really is a true friend you want to encourage that person cherish that person because true friends are hard to come by
Years back when I was in Thailand Ajaan Fuang gave me the job of teaching new monks after I had been a monk five or six years
Every year we'd get a batch of temporary monks coming in because that's the tradition there for young men to ordain for about three or four months
There's a textbook for them to study during their period as monks
Toward the end of the book as they're beginning to think about disrobing there's a section on lay life
One of the teachings covers who's a true friend and who's a false friend because this is a big issue in life
The book goes down the list just as we chanted just now People who befriend you to cheat you those who flatter and cajole those who are your companions in ruinous fun
Those are false friends
As for true friends the book says those are the ones who are willing to die in your place
And every year the comment would come up There are no true friends in the world
That's not really the case of course
There are some
But you have to look really really hard asking Where is friendship with this person leading me
As the Buddha said if you find someone like that cherish that person
We hear often that the Buddha teaches us nonattachment
Actually he teaches nonclinging which is a different sort of thing
Clinging is when you hold onto something and create suffering
That he said is something you should try to understand
Look for the cause and let go
But in the meantime you've also got the path and that's something you try to develop
It's something you hold onto as long as you need it
You develop virtue concentration discernment
These are your friends inside
And the same principle applies outside
If you have helpful friends hold onto them cherish them
And you try to be a good friend a true friend to that person too
So with regard to the question of holding on and letting go the Buddha said you've got to be selective
There are four noble truths to life
It's not that you let go of them all
The first truth  the suffering that comes with clinging  is something you want to try to comprehend
The cause of suffering the craving that causes you to cling is something you want to let go
Then there's the path which you develop
To develop it you've got to tend to it you've got to cherish it you've got to hold onto it
It's like holding onto the rungs of a ladder
If you try to climb up a ladder without holding onto the rungs you fall off
And even when you reach the roof  or as Ajaan Suwat said even when you're finished with the path as far as you are concerned you don't need the path anymore but you think of the people who will come behind you and of how easy it is for weeds to grow on the path how easy it is for the path to get obliterated so you still tend to it for their sake
The same way with true friends If they've helped you it's not that you leave them behind
You show them gratitude because that's one of the most important lessons you can give to other people
It reminds them that there's something good in life something that really should be valued because it's so rare
That's friendship on the outside
As for friendship on the inside you want to be friends with your wise qualities inside the thoughts that help you that point you in the right direction
You want to learn how to encourage them
After all meditation is not simply a matter of driving thoughts out of the mind
You first have to learn how to think skillfully
Just listen to all the conversations going on in the mind Should I meditate
Should I not meditate
Notice all the voices that say No I'm too tired I need my rest I want to do something else
Ask yourself Are those your true friends
Where are they going to take you
Learn how to encourage the voices that take you where you really want to go
This is one of the most basic skills in meditation
If you can't master this one you can't do anything else basic like sticking with the breath
For some of us this is easy
We've had parents who encouraged us and we've learned how to listen to those voices of encouragement
If your parents didn't encourage you you have to learn how to train yourself to encourage yourself
This is part of what they call emotional intelligence
Years back there was an Olympic swimmer  Matt Biondi I think was his name
He was expected to sweep all the medals in the swimming events but he blew the first event
All the commentators said That's it
He's probably all shaken up
He's going to go down into a tailspin But his coach said Don't write him off
He's not that kind of person And sure enough he won all the remaining events  because even though he could have easily gotten discouraged after the first event he knew how to talk to himself to encourage himself so that he didn't give up
He kept his spirits up and kept performing at his best
That's what we've got to do as meditators
Learn how to talk to yourself so you can stay on the path
When things are going well how do you talk to yourself so that you don't get careless
When things are not going well how do you talk to yourself to give yourself encouragement to get yourself over those dry patches
That's a basic skill in the meditation learning who your true friends are inside your mind and learning how to encourage them
The Buddha once said that friendship with good people is the whole of the practice
On the external level that means staying with people who can teach you the practice  because without them how would you know what to do
On your own could you think up the path that the Buddha found
Would you have the stamina to stick with it
The example of other people who have trod the path is what keeps you going
On the internal level friendship with good people means your ability to figure out who inside your head is your friend and to cherish that friend encourage it listen to it
That ability more than anything else is what keeps you on course
The mind is like a town meeting lots of people lots of different opinions
Sometimes the town meeting is well run  people are reasonable courteous  but often it goes out of control
People start shouting and a kind of mob psychology takes over
If you're standing outside the mob it's easy enough to see that the people are crazy but if you get down in a mob with enough people who believe say that somebody's a witch you can end up setting her on fire
And then after it's all over you say Gee how did that happen
It's the same with the mind
Every now and then some crazy idea comes and takes hold of every voice in the mind and the only way you can not get swept up in the craziness is to step outside
Unfortunately there's no little compartment in your head outside of your brain where you can go to escape the voices
You're in there with them
But there is an aspect of your awareness that's separate from these voices and finding it is a really important skill in the meditation
There are states of mind that the Buddha called hindrances which can come sweeping through the mind
The problem with each of them  sensual desire ill will torpor and lethargy restlessness and anxiety or uncertainty  is that it blinds you
You start seeing things in line with the hindrance and you lose sight of what's genuinely for your own true benefit
In other words when sensual desire comes along the object really is attractive and you can't stand not pursuing it
When ill will comes along the person that you don't like is really a bad person
That's how it seems
When sleepiness comes you can talk yourself into falling asleep taking an extra nap waking up and turning over and falling back to sleep again because the body really needs sleep at a time like that
And so on down the list
And yet after the hindrance has passed you look back on it and realize that you didn't really have to follow through with it
You could have done perfectly well not following the object of your lust or desire
You could have done perfectly well without doing anything nasty to the person that you don't like
It's just that at the time your perceptions were skewed
The Buddha compares each of the hindrances to a different kind of water
Sensual desire is water with dye in it
Say there's red dye in the water The things in the water look red but when you take them out they're not
It was just the dye in the water
Ill will is like boiling water
If you try to look down into boiling water you can't see anything clearly because of the turbulence
Torpor and lethargy are like water filled with algae
Restlessness and anxiety are water ruffled by the wind
Uncertainty is like water in the dark
Even though the water may be clear by its nature it's not in a situation where you can see anything in it
When the mind is seized by these hindrances you can't really see things for what they are
So you've got to learn how to recognize the hindrances when they come and realize that you don't want to get involved with them
If you can catch them in time in their very early stages you can realize This is a hindrance
This is nothing to get involved with You can separate yourself out
This is one of the basic skills that you need not only as a meditator but also to survive in life
When I visited Ajaan Suwat that last time  he'd had some brain damage in his automobile accident  he mentioned that he had the mindfulness to know when his brain wasn't functioning right
He said that his brain was giving him all sorts of weird perceptions
But because he'd been a good meditator he had developed the mindfulness not to fall in with them
This was very different from my father who developed Parkinson's dementia as he got older
He'd see big animals in the house and people committing suicide out in the yard  all kinds of disturbing things
You'd try to talk him into realizing that they were all illusions but he wouldn't believe you
If there was a black dog in the living room there was a black dog in the living room no matter what evidence you could show that there wasn't
This is the difference between a mind that's trained and a mind that's not
So you have to nip these things in the bud
Otherwise a mob psychology takes over in the mind and it's not just voices screaming in your head but also changes in your body
The blood starts racing faster the heart's racing faster different feelings of tension and pressure arise in different parts of the body
When you're angry there's a weird feeling in your gut
And because there are the physical symptoms you say Gee this must be what I really feel But that's not the case
It's just your hormones running amok
A hormone gets into your blood and it keeps circulating around in your body even after the particular mind state is gone
You've gotten used to the idea that if you've been angry and the physical symptoms of anger are still in the body then you must still be angry
That makes room for the thought of anger to come back in and take over again
So one thing to remind yourself of is It's just the hormones in the blood and the actual thought of anger comes and goes It's the same with all the other hindrances
Just because there's a physical symptom doesn't mean that the emotion is especially real
It's like people presenting arguments
I've been reading through a critique of the monks' rules book right now and the person writing the critique has some strong arguments as well as some weak ones
The strong arguments are the ones where he simply points out This is a mistranslation and that's it
When the arguments are weak that's when he starts getting belligerent throwing in a lot of emotion
This is the way the mind works
When a particular defilement knows that it has a weak case it shouts and it screams and it uses every trick it can think of in order to push you into following it
So when things come on that strong learn to recognize them just as the hype of the defilements in the same way that you learn to see through the hype in an advertisement
If all else fails just hunker down for sometimes when these things come on really strong they've got to run their course
All you can do is make up your mind that you're not going to fall in line with them you're not going to act under their power and you just hunker down with the breath
Don't get involved in the conversations
Don't get pulled into a shouting match
It's like that storm we had several years back with hundredmileperhour winds There was nothing you could do except stay in your tent or your hut and wait for the storm to pass
In the morning when the winds had died down you could come out survey the damage and figure out what needed to be done but while the wind was blowing it was hard to figure out anything at all
So when these strong emotions come blowing through the mind just try to keep yourself separate
Hunker down
Ajaan Lee has a good way of viewing these things
He says You don't know who's actually speaking in your mind
You've got all those little germs in your blood
Maybe the thoughts in your mind are the thoughts of the little germs passing through your brain
Or you may have seen cases of people actually possessed by a spirit
Maybe this is a spirit coming and trying to possess your mind In other words learn how not to identify with these crazy voices
Ask yourself If you actually followed through with that particular voice where would it take you
And if you start getting crazy answers to that question you realize It's impossible to have a conversation here Just hunker down
Wait for the storm to pass
Wait for the craziness of the mob psychology to run its course but the important thing is that you don't become part of the mob
If you can gain this kind of perspective on your thoughts you can save yourself a lot of grief
As that bumper sticker says Don't believe everything you think Don't identify with everything that's coming through your mind
Don't fall for the hype of the defilements pressing their case
When these things get really strong just hold onto the breath for dear life
When the storm is past you'll be glad that you didn't allow yourself to get swept away
There's a part of the mind that's just aware
No matter what else comes into the mind  greed anger delusion despair depression regret or fear  it's just part of the mind
There's also another part that's just aware of these things but it tends to get blocked out when strong emotions come in
Still it's always there like the hum of the refrigerator always there in the background
Or maybe a better analogy would be the hum of the Big Bang the deep Bflat that's still detectable from all directions all the time
One of the tricks of the meditation is learning to get in touch with that part of the mind not to regard it as something exotic but to have it as the background state of mind the basis of your conscious awareness
This requires a shift of your center of gravity because for the most part we tend to live in our emotions in our creations in the little worlds we create for ourselves
But as the Buddha pointed out there's a lot of suffering in those worlds
They all require effort to keep them going
They have to feed off of something
When the Buddha says that becoming is conditioned by clinging the word clinging can also mean feeding or the act of taking sustenance
And the sustenance is the passion of desire  the desire that makes us create these worlds that pulls us into these worlds and impels us to take them as far as they can go
There's always an act of feeding going on  and it's stressful
So you've got to learn how to get out of those little worlds you've created for yourself
Otherwise you can create huge emotional storms that can blow you away
People talk about sitting and meditating and being blown away to the point where they can't even sit anymore but if you actually look at the wind from the outside there's no physical wind blowing them off the seat
It's just that they let these emotional storms get blown up in the mind and they put themselves in the storms so of course they're going to get blown around
What's important to remember is that there's always an awareness surrounding the storms
If you can place your center of gravity in that awareness you don't get blown away
It's not that difficult to get out of the storms if you can observe them as they arise as they're just beginning but they're hard to extract yourself from if they're already fullblown
So you need to learn how to change your center of gravity in advance and keep it changed
Otherwise the secondary storms  the ones that blow in on the tail of the first storm  can catch you off guard
One of the problems is the impatience that blows up as a separate storm
You get impatient When are these storms going to go away
And then you place yourself in that second storm the impatient storm and that can blow you away as well
Or you can get swept up in a storm of boredom
A lot of these secondary storms are the ones that throw meditators off balance so you have to watch out for them
Remember that there's a space around those storms as well
You have to learn how to watch those from the outside too
A great deal of the commentary going on in the mind is just this sort of thing
You pull yourself out of the storms whirling around events from the past or future but then you let yourself get caught up in storms of the present
When these things come up  regret or impatience or whatever  just watch them
They may seem awfully powerful and awfully real but you can learn to question their reality
Remember that although there may be a reality to these things it's a created reality  false artificial
It's something you're creating right now and you may not even be aware of what you're doing
Back when I was younger I used to like to write fiction
Basically what a fiction writer does is to inhabit a little mental world exploring what it feels like from inside
The more real you can make that world to yourself the better the story when you write it down
What's uncanny about these worlds is that sometimes a character you create can surprise you
The more real the character becomes in your mind the more it can start doing unexpected things
When that happens you start thinking Maybe this character has its own reality but it's actually a figment of your own imagination
The reason these characters can surprise you is the same reason that you get surprised by things coming into the mind in normal worldcreating thoughts
You're so oblivious to what you're doing that it can actually surprise you
That's when these thoughts begin to seem very real to have an independent existence
What's happened though is that the part of your mind creating them is behind a wall separated from the part that's watching them
That's why they can take unexpected turns
This is why we have to get the mind really really quiet  both so that we can get closer and closer to the part of the mind that simply observes and to get clearer about where these fabrications are coming from
When you can see that second part in operation it offers no surprises
And when you get to the point where fabrications offer no surprises you start getting disenchanted with them
You see them for all their artificiality
You can begin to pull yourself out of their worlds more and more consistently
So whatever storms come brewing up in the mind remember It's just an event in your awareness and there's an awareness surrounding it outside of the storm
Learn how to give more weight to that awareness than to the storms
If you're going to identify with anything  and it's natural that we do identify with things all along the path  learn how to identify with that very still awareness
It may not seem very intelligent very creative but it's your salvation
It's what you can hold onto that'll keep you from getting blown away
How many times have you seen people who are very clever very imaginative very creative and then something takes on an independent life in their minds and they can actually end up killing themselves simply because of their thoughtcreations
They find themselves pushed into all sorts of weird and selfdestructive behavior simply because they can't let go of particular thoughtworlds in their minds
So for the survival of all that's good and worthwhile in your own mind you've got to learn how to step out of these things realizing that although that simple awareness may not seem interesting or clever it's your real friend
And there's a wisdom in learning how to stay there and watch watch watch not to be impatient to get results not to be impatient to see how things turn out
Learn how to be more stable in that watching because the stability is what will allow you to see very subtle things to see the tricks the mind plays on itself the places where it pulls the curtain down or throws up walls to maintain its illusions
Your steady gaze is what's going to enable you to see through those illusions
In the early stages of the meditation that basic watcher  the observer  may seem as unstable and as fragile as any of the other worlds you might create
But as you get more and more used to placing your center of gravity here you find that it's a lot easier to stay here than to keep creating those other worlds
This awareness too is a kind of world and there will come a point where you have to take it apart but in the mean time this is the most stable world at your disposal
Over time your center of gravity can begin to shift more and more in this direction
Once it's here the qualities of stability and patience and endurance come a lot easier and you come to value them more
Although they themselves may not seem all that surprising or entertaining they do allow you to find out some very surprising things about the mind
In particular you learn how to see through this process of creation
Where do these worlds come from
This is how the Buddha discovered dependent coarising by just watching very patiently putting himself in a position where he didn't get blown away
It's like really good scholarship
Everyone wants to get in on the dialogue of common scholarly assumptions and show that yes they can engage in that dialogue as well
But the people who say Well stop
Wait a minute
These questions don't make sense
Something's wrong here Those are the ones who bring a real advance in knowledge
When you step back to get out of a particular dialogue you begin to see its underlying assumptions for what they are
The same thing goes on in the mind
There are little signals and signs that the mind sends to itself and you feel clever in catching their meaning Yes I understand that signal I understand that sign I'll play along with that And then you get sucked into the world of those signals and signs
But it takes real understanding not to get sucked in by the signals to step out of the worlds that those signals create
Ajaan Suwat once said that one of his greatest insights in meditation was seeing how the mind liked to play makebelieve with itself
You have these little internal signals and agreements  Well this is this and that's that  and suddenly there's a whole world of becoming just because you thought you were clever in interpreting and catching on to the signs
So sometimes it's good to play dumb to say I don't understand this this doesn't make sense And step back
That right there is a lot of the practice
Back when I was in college I majored in history
One of the big frustrations about majoring in history was that you felt you could never really get to see what it was really like back in the days you were studying about
Studying about the th century  what was it really like
Think about all the generalizations they make about th century culture in Europe and yet having lived through the th and into the st centuries what kind of generalizations would you say really do justice to the reality of that kind of experience
How can you sum up a century in a sentence or two
The more you read the stories that make up history the more you realize they can never take you back there
It's good to reflect on this because look at how we live our lives We tend to live in the narratives that we make about things  what happened in the past what we would like to see happen in the future what's the basic story line looking for development looking for closure
How much does that story line really have to do with reality
How much does it actually stand in the way of our seeing reality
Think about that especially as you meditate
There are ways of telling the story of your life that help get you into the meditation
For example you can look at your past suffering recognizing that a lot of it was caused by your own unskillful habits and come to the conclusion that your skillful habits need some work
That kind of story helps bring you into the meditation
But there are a lot of other stories that pull you away
You've got to watch out for those because they make you impatient
They make you less observant about what's actually going on
You sit here working with your breath
Maybe in the back of the mind there's the thought Let's just get this over and done with so we can move onto the next stages which are a lot more interesting So you're not really looking at your breath
You're looking at your plans for the next stage or thinking about what's going to happen tomorrow or what's going to happen the day after that
You're looking at your thoughts about how much longer you're going to have to be stuck with this until you get results
That's the kind of story that gets in the way of actually seeing what's happening right here and now
So when you see those thoughts arising learn how to put them away
This can be hard because a lot of our sense of who we are is in the story
This is an area where the teaching on notself is useful to see how artificial and madeup our sense of who we are is and how it gets in the way of the work we need to do in the present moment
People sometimes believe that the whole purpose of the meditation is to get into the present moment and just stay there
The Buddha never talked like that
He always said There's work to be done in the present moment That's why you get here
You want to settle down here with the purpose of understanding the intentions acting here in the present moment because that's the only place where you can really observe your intentions in action
If there's any greed anger or delusion in the intention you're going to see it only in the present moment
After it's passed that intention is just a memory  and you know how memory tends to color things depending on what you want to see how it fits into a good or bad narrative about yourself
But it's just a narrative
There's no guarantee that it's going to get you to the reality of the intention
The only way you can really see is by looking in the present moment
And when the present moment is full of distractions don't think of the process of dealing with your distractions as getting in the way of where you want to go
If you see it simply as getting in the way you're going to overlook it and try to push through it blindly
Instead see it as This is the spot where the Awakening is going to happen where the understanding is going to happen and through the process of watching the breath catching the mind as it wanders off and bringing it back that's where all the insights are going to arise In other words the problems in the present are not something you simply want to push your way through or get out of the way they're something you want to look into  because the Buddha had an amazing insight about the present
You may have heard the story that after the night of his Awakening he spent days experiencing the bliss of release
Not only bliss He learned an awful lot in the course of those days
You may also know the story of when he was in the forest of simsapa trees
Simsapa trees have tiny tiny leaves about the size of a dime
And he scooped up a handful of them from the forest floor and asked the monks Which is more the leaves in my hand or the leaves in the forest The monks replied Of course the leaves in the forest are many more than the leaves in your hand And the Buddha said In the same way what I learned in the course of my Awakening is like the leaves in the forest
What I have brought out to teach is like the leaves in my hand And he focused on the four noble truths as being the leaves in his hand
There are other passages where he boiled down the basic insight he gained in his Awakening even further It's a simple principle of causality
When you think of all the amazing things he could have talked about it's interesting that this is the one he found most worthwhile to teach
His insight was basically that our experience is based on two kinds of causal patterns
One is that when x exists y exists with it when x ceases y does too
In other words these things come and go together
This is causality happening right in the present moment
The other principle is that from the arising of x comes the arising of y from the passing away of x comes the passing away of y
This connection doesn't have to happen immediately in the present moment
It can occur over time
When you put these two principles together they mean that any moment of experience is the combination of three things the cause arising in the present plus the effects of that cause and effects coming in from the past
And what is that cause
Your present intention
And where are the effects from the past coming from
Past intentions
This means we have free will
Our intentions shape our life
At any moment we can choose what to focus on what to do what to say what to think
We're not compelled by the past
There are influences coming in from the past but we can choose which influences we're going to let pass which one's we're going to work on which ones we're going to pick up and what we're going to do with them
That's what the whole fabric of our experience of time and space comes from the constant input coming from intention
And the Buddha's insight was that if you look at where the new input is coming from you'll see the way out
And where are you going to see that new input
Right here right at the intentions in the present moment
You really want to get to know these well
The best way to get to know your intentions is to set up one intention to see how long you can keep it going and to see what other intentions are going to come in and try to change it
Then you learn the skills needed to maintain that original intention  as long as it was a good one
Here the intention is to stay with the breath and to think about the breath to evaluate the breath to make it more comfortable so that you can stay here longer to give more support to your original intention
As you get more and more sensitive to the breath you find that you also get more and more sensitive to those intentions
Those are the real causal factors in your life
What's dismaying about them especially in the beginning of the practice is to see how random they are
This little intention fires off and goes in one direction and then another one comes and goes in the exact opposite direction or other ones come from all over the place
But don't let yourself get discouraged when you see this
Learn the skills you need to focus on a skillful intention and stay there in the midst of all this randomness
The randomness helps remind you how artificial your storyline is
Storylines if they're going to maintain your interest have to have a clean trajectory
There may be a few setbacks here and there to make the story interesting but eventually there's one overall trajectory
It's like the basic shape of a melody
It may be an arc
It may be a valley between two peaks
And the individual notes may play around with that go outside of the basic arc a bit but there's a basic shape to what we hear
That's what makes the melody satisfying
When we're creating a narrative out of our lives we're trying to string together only the intentions that make sense that seem to fit into a basic shape but when you meditate look at what you've got here intentions running all over the place
That's an important insight right there
Even though it's the dismaying insight that comes from seeing how unconcentrated your mind is it's a valuable insight
If you take it to heart and use it skillfully it'll help deconstruct any narratives that are getting in the way of your practice
This way you'll find it easier to settle down with less and less distraction
When you can let go of the narratives there's really a lot here to discover
Whether the meditation goes well or not whether it goes in line with your expectations or not that's just another narrative
The important thing is that you really look at what's right here right now particularly with regard to your intentions
You have your intention to stay with the breath and whoops there's another intention going off someplace else
Bring your focus back to the breath
You've learned something about the mind right there
The act of bringing it back strengthens your original intention strengthens your resolve and the fact that you're able to catch the mind as it's wandering off strengthens your mindfulness and alertness
So whether things are progressing at the rate you'd like to see in your ideal narrative that's not the point
The point is that you're looking and you're learning
Sometimes you may have more lessons to learn than you originally thought but if you don't start from where you are where are you going to start from
If the picture of what your mind is doing in the present moment doesn't fit into your ideal narrative maybe it's time to question the narrative and not get impatient with the present moment
Because what is impatience
Impatience is the part of the narrative that makes us judgmental in an unskillful way
We need our powers of judgment but what turns powers of judgment of being judicious into being judgmental is that we get impatient
We want to come to a decision really quickly before all the evidence is in and as a result the judgment is useless  one more obstacle in the way of seeing things as they actually are
So give the present moment some space
Don't push it too hard thinking you've got to get this or that result in this or that amount of time
Really look at what's going on here without impatience without the narrative that gives the push to impatience
That's when you'll get to see what's interesting and unplanned  because the spot where intention enters into the causal pattern the route by which it enters in is also the route by which you're going to get out
And it's right here
It's not in the past it's not in the future it's right here
Allow yourself to settle down right here and that way you'll get to see it to know it and to follow it to release
Patience is an important quality in the practice
The Pali word for patience khanti also means endurance the willingness to stick with things over the long haul
And although the practice is a long haul this willingness to stick with things over the long haul translates into the present moment as meticulousness
You're very careful in the steps you're following right now step by step by step not jumping over any steps not trying to leap from the first floor to the fifth
You're willing to go up the stairway one step at a time paying careful attention to what you're doing
You're willing to put your trust in the little things you can do in the present moment confident that they'll build into the bigger results you want
We all want the big results
We want major happiness major peace major clarity in our minds
When we look at the stepbystepbystep increments we have to follow we sometimes get impatient and don't trust them
How could little things like this build up to such big things as release liberation nibbana
That's what we think
And yet it's precisely the little unskillful things that get in the way of the big results we want so we have to pay careful attention to them each time the mind pulls away from the desire for peace or the desire for true happiness
It's a little pull but over time it adds up to a major habit
The best way to fight this habit is with a path that's made out of little steps that add up over time as well
At the same time the willingness to look at the details means that your powers of perception your powers of insight get very sharp
There are times when your practice seems to hit a plateau and it's not going anywhere
At times like that if you turn around to look at what you've been doing you'll realize that you haven't been looking very carefully
In other words your meditation has been put on automatic pilot and you're not paying much attention
You're just going through the motions so the results just go through the motions as well
The cure for this lies in being very sensitive and precise about what you're doing
For example focusing on the breath Be really precise about any tiny little bit of tension or discomfort or disease in the breath
Don't slough over it because paying attention to the little details is what brings you more and more into the present moment
If you're sloughing over the details you're sloughing from the past into the future and skipping over the present
So pay close attention to each breath to how the process of each breath feels in different parts of the body
As you develop your sensitivity working through whatever tension you detect you move from where it's really tense to where it's less and less tense until things are so calm that you can detect even the slightest bit of tension
Work through it work through it even though it may seem like a little thing
If you leave it it may turn out to be a seed
It may grow into something larger
There's a story in the Canon of a creeper seed that lands next to a sala tree
The devas in the other trees come around to comfort the deva in the sala tree saying Have no fear
Have no fear
Don't worry about that seed
Maybe a fire will burn it or a woodsman will chop it or step on it or a peacock will eat it or maybe it's not even a seed Well it turns out to be a seed
It sprouts and grows into a creeper and the creeper grows up around the tree
At first the deva in the sala tree doesn't understand why her friends were so concerned
After all the creeper's tendrils seem soft downy and tender
But then as the creeper grows bigger and bigger it finally forms a canopy over the whole tree pulls down the major limbs and destroys the tree
That's when the deva realized why her friends were so concerned
This is one of the reasons why you have to be careful about little things because sometimes they're seeds that can grow
At the same time when you're attentive to little things you're beginning to plant your own seeds in the mind as well different kinds of seeds seeds of stronger mindfulness stronger alertness stronger willpower determination
All the perfections needed for Awakening start with the little things and they keep growing in little steps little steps through your being very very attentive very very precise in what you're doing
At the same time though you can't be tense in what you're doing
You just watch things very carefully
This is why there's so much emphasis on keeping a broad sense of awareness in the meditation
If your awareness gets very narrow and tense it's hard to maintain
But if your range of awareness is broad and yet your attention to the details of your focus is precise and sharp that state of awareness is not just easy to sustain
It sustains itself and becomes a source of strength for the mind
In that way it sustains you
You want to apply this same attention to detail to all aspects of your life  not only while you're sitting here with your eyes closed but also when you're dealing with other people doing work out in the orchard or at the guesthouse whatever your activity
You want to be as precisely with the present moment as possible so that skillful or unskillful states when they arise in the mind don't pass by unnoticed
This is what it means to be uncomplacent in your practice of concentration
As we chanted just now One who sees danger and respects being heedful Well the danger comes from little things because little things can turn into big things and sneak up on you from behind
There's another passage in the Canon where the Buddha describes four things you shouldn't overlook simply because they're small
One is a small fire another is a small snake another is a small prince  the prince may be small right now but in a couple of years he can grow up and he can carry a grudge from age three to who knows how far
The fourth one is a young contemplative because sometimes young contemplatives have gotten further in their meditation than you might assume
If you treat them with disrespect that disrespect can backfire on you
Those are outside small things that you shouldn't be careless or complacent about
The inside ones though are even smaller and yet they can do even more damage on the unskillful side
On the other side small skillful things can do you a lot of good if you look after them
So don't despise the little victories you achieve in your meditation don't be careless about the little defeats because it's step by step by step that you get more and more precisely into the present moment which is where things are going to open up
If you're not paying careful attention here you're not going to see the opening
So focusing on the little things is not a distraction from the larger issues of the practice
It's actually in the little things that the larger ones appear
So always keep this point in mind especially when your meditation has hit a plateau or seems to be sliding downhill
Often it's a problem of not paying careful attention of simply going through the motions
Ajaan Suwat would often describe this as not having enough respect for the little things that you're doing each moment
So try to meditate with an attitude of lightness but at the same time a sense of respect of real dedication
That's how the principles of endurance and patience which sound like longterm principles translate into the present moment being meticulous in what you're doing right here right now
Thoughts come and go but we keep trying to make them stay
In fact we've gotten pretty good at making them stay
Without that habit we wouldn't be able to speak to hold conversations to think anything through
So this habit has its uses but also its drawbacks
It can weigh us down with all kinds of suffering all kinds of stress when the mind goes overboard in its thinking
The skill in meditation is learning how to think when you want to how not to think when you don't
It's not a process of putting yourself into a totally blank state where no thinking is ever possible
At the same time it's not a process of ceaseless thinking
It means learning the right time and the place for your thoughts
The problem is that the mind keeps churning out thoughts at the wrong time and the wrong place  thoughts you don't want but they still come in
Sometimes it seems that the less you want them the more insistent they are in coming
This shows that you've left an opening for them
But before you can see this opening to find exactly what you're doing that admits those thoughts that's fascinated by them you have to get the mind as quiet as you can
This is why in the process of meditation there's a rhythm between periods when you want to keep the mind as quiet as possible and others when you want to investigate and explore
There's a rhythm to the practice
And the mind has its own rhythms too
Sometimes it seems like nothing is going on in the mind at other times there seems to be nothing but disturbance
The skill in the practice lies in learning how to make use of whatever level of concentration you've got to deal with wherever you are in the rhythm of the mind
In periods when the thoughts seem to be few and far between you can't let yourself be complacent
Build up your concentration as solidly as you can so that when the next wave of really obsessive thinking washes over the mind you'll have stronger tools for dealing with it stronger tools for not getting swept away
When thoughts come in remind yourself that there's always a part of the mind that's not involved in the thinking
This is easier to realize when you've been working on developing a large frame of reference for your concentration
Once the breath gets comfortable immediately expand it and let that comfortable sensation spread to other parts of the body
Get used to having this enlarged frame for otherwise if your mind is totally onepointed focused on being aware of only one little point of the body it gets easily knocked over
One thought can come in and totally overwhelm that one little point without much effort at all
You suddenly find yourself with your concentration destroyed and your mind splashing all over the place
But if your area of awareness has a broader base  all the way from the feet up to the head all around the body  and if you think of your awareness as a porous space then when the thoughts come and go there's space for them to go through without running into anything
They just go out the other side
That way your concentration doesn't get knocked over by the thoughts both because it's large and because it doesn't put up a surface of resistance
You could put up that surface if you want and sometimes it's wise to but sometimes it seems to make the thoughts more obstreperous
So if you have to let them in okay let them in but then just let them go
Think of the body as a large field of energy
There's nothing solid there
A thought comes in and has nothing to run against so it runs out the other side
This way you begin to realize that there's nothing you necessarily have to fear about thinking
You have the choice of focusing on your thoughts or not whichever you want
When you realize that you always have another place to focus you can have control over your thinking
You just switch back to that mode of that enlarged awareness and stay leaving the thoughts to pass away on their own
Now don't think that that enlarged awareness is the Buddha's unconditioned
It's more like his reference to the word dhatu which means property
Back in the Buddha's time they talked about the different properties that make up the body different properties found in the mind
The basic idea behind the concept of dhatu or property is closer to our word potential There's a potential that gives rise to things when it gets aggravated disturbed or provoked
When there's no provocation everything stays very still
This is how they explained fire
They said that the fire potential lies latent in everything
If you stir it up with a little friction from a fire stick  or nowadays with a match  that aggravates the fire potential and it bursts into flame
But even when it's not aggravated the potential is still there
The mind is like that
There's a potential for thinking in every little cell of the body it seems
In every little speck of your awareness there's the potential for a thought to arise if it gets provoked
When things are still and empty in the mind it's simply because nothing's been provoked
It doesn't mean that there's no possibility of new things coming out
It's just that they haven't been aggravated
Sometimes there's a strong sense of light that goes along with the stillness and again that's not the light of the unconditioned
It's the light of these potentials their energy just waiting to be provoked
So even when nothing seems to be going on in the mind don't get complacent
Keep trying to develop your concentration even further
Develop this sense of space so that you're really proficient at it so that you can maintain it all the time
Develop a degree sense of awareness so that when something does get provoked you're quick to see it
Part of you will say Oh I thought there was nothing there but the potential for disturbance has been there all along
It's like children in a classroom  at least back in the old days when teachers had some authority
As long as the teacher was in the classroom the kids were quiet
They'd wait until the teacher left the room before they'd start running around
If the teacher came back in they'd sit down and get quiet again
My older brother tells a story from when he was in grade school
He had a really sharp teacher Mrs
Lane
One day she left the classroom and went downstairs to the restroom to have a smoke
The kids of course started running around the classroom until they heard her coming back up the stairs
Everybody then sat down very quietly  except for my brother who was so excited that he continued running around
So of course he got caught
Later after the class Mrs
Lane took him aside and said Look Galen
You've got to learn how to be sneaky
Listen for when I come up the stairs and then stop running around She was a sharp teacher
Even though she was downstairs in the restroom she knew what was going on upstairs
But she was also wise
The way she spoke to him gave my brother the feeling that she was on his side
She knew he wanted to have some fun and she was showing him how to do it in a harmless way
Mindfulness and alertness are like teachers of the mind and you've got to train them to be sharp and wise
When alert mindfulness fills the body fills your awareness then your random thoughts get very quiet
But your thoughts are sneaky
As soon as mindfulness slips a little bit a new thought forms in the corner
Then it spreads out to fill up all the areas abandoned by your mindful awareness
But if you can reestablish that larger frame that larger field of awareness the thought can go through the field and not do any damage
It can do its thing but it won't knock over the frame
But this means that you've got to be very alert very noncomplacent
And that requires work
Then again that's what concentration is It's work
But at least it's pleasant work work in the right direction giving us a frame of reference from which we can look at our thoughts with more detachment with less involvement less identification
This doesn't mean that there's no sense of identification at all though
Actually you've just switched your identification
Instead of identifying with the thoughts you identify with that larger frame that larger field of brightened awareness
No matter how much you contemplate the teachings on notself the process of identification doesn't end all at once
It moves from things that are blatant and obvious to things more subtle and refined
Only when you've pared it down consistently to the refined level can you let it go entirely
The important point at the beginning is that you learn how to use it so that you don't latch on to things that are blatantly harmful thoughts that pull you off into greed anger and delusion thoughts that stir up any of the unskillful potentials in your mind
So this particular step in the meditation  once the breath gets comfortable start spreading your awareness to fill the whole body and then allow that comfortable breath to fill the whole body as well  is an extremely important part of the meditation
In the Buddha's steps for breath meditation step number three is just this step You train yourself to breathe in and out sensitive to the entire body
The Buddha puts this step right up there toward the beginning because it's so fundamental
When he talks about a mind in concentration he calls it mahagattam cittam  enlarged awareness
The images he gives for the states of right concentration are all images of enlargement
When you're first allowing that sense of ease and pleasure to permeate the body he says it's like a bathman or a bathman's apprentice who would knead water through a ball of bath powder
Back in those days they didn't have soap they had a powder like flour to bathe with
They'd make a dough out of the powder by kneading water into it until no part of the ball of dough was dry and yet the water wouldn't ooze or drip out
This is the stage of working the initial sense of ease and pleasure throughout your whole body
In the second and third levels of jhana there's a similar process but with less effort
You let the pleasure or rapture corresponding to that state permeate pervade your whole awareness suffuse your whole body
The image given by the Buddha is of a spring of cool water welling up from the bottom of a lake permeating the entire lake
As for the third jhana which is more quiet and less of an intensely rapturous state he said that it's like lotuses submerged in a still lake permeated entirely by the water of the lake from their roots to the tips of their buds
With the fourth jhana the image is of a person with a bright cloth covering the whole body the same way your bright awareness fills the whole body
So it's obvious from these images that jhana is a state of broadened awareness
And this broadened awareness is really important
For one thing it gives you a firm basis so that you don't get knocked over by distracting thoughts
At the same time it allows your vision to become more allaround degrees allaround so that you're aware of all the little potentials in the body all the little potentials in the mind that can get provoked in one way or another
That way you can be quicker and quicker to see the very early stages of provocation
When the slightest stirring comes you'll notice it
It's not quite a physical stirring at first nor is it really mental
It's on the borderline between the two
When you latch onto it there will be a little bit of tension that you create in the body to provide a place for the mind to stay latched on
This is how the stirring turns into a swelling
In this way thinking is both a mental and physical process
If you have this broadened state of awareness you can dissolve the little swelling before it turns into a thought and can take over your whole awareness
As you stay with the breath energy in the whole body you're operating right on the borderline between body and mind between physical and mental phenomena  right where those thoughtpotentials begin to swell
You can deal more quickly with the beginning of anything any potential that would come either in the body or the mind
This is why concentration is such an important state for gaining insight  because it improves your vision
Your vision becomes more allaround more precise focused on the area where things get provoked this interface between body and mind
Then if you want to think you can think
If you don't you don't have to
When the time comes to think the mind will have been properly rested
Your thinking will be a lot clearer more to the point
When the time comes to stop you keep your thinking under control
It doesn't keep riding out in all directions
Most people's thinking is like an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction
One little neutron shoots out runs into another nucleus which sends out more neutrons which keep on multiplying until suddenly the whole thing explodes
Concentration is like exerting control over the reaction building a reactor and inserting graphite rods to make sure the reactions don't go out of control
If you want to shut everything down you can insert all the rods all the way in and everything will be still
That doesn't mean that the potential for a reaction isn't there just that it's been stilled
If you need to think pull the rods out a little bit to get just the reaction you want
When the thinking has done its work you push the rods back in
This way when thoughts come and go you get whatever use you want out of them
They don't take over your mind
You stay in charge
When you meditate it's easy to get frustrated
Here you are looking at the breath and as Ajaan Lee says Just four concentrations and you can't master them The mind keeps slipping off and no matter how determined you are to stay with the breath you find yourself someplace else
Often it doesn't seem like the meditation's heading in any particular direction  just kind of mucking around  and you wonder What does this have to do with the Deathless
What does this have to do with true happiness That's when it's time to step back and look at the larger perspective
The big issue of course is your mind
No matter where you live no matter where you go you've got the mind right there
If you can't keep it under any kind of control at all you're living with something very dangerous because all kinds of things can happen to it
A slight chemical imbalance in the body and the mind gets really depressed
It can't seem to pull itself out of the depression
Or it starts hallucinating
There are all sorts of things the mind can do all kinds of things the brain can do
It's important to keep a distinction between the mind and the brain
The brain is the physical organ while the part of the mind we're interested in is just basic awareness
We use the organ to think but if the organ is damaged in any way out of balance in any way then our thoughts become our enemies
And what are you going to do then
If you have enough mindfulness to pull yourself out of your thought worlds you're safe
If you have enough mindfulness to pull yourself out of anything the mind does you're safe
We talk about the mind clinging the mind hanging on to things but it doesn't have hands to cling
When it clings to something it just keeps thinking about it over and over and over again it keeps wanting it over and over and over again
To let go of the clinging means that you just let it stop
And the only way you can let it stop is to get out of it and see it simply as an event in the mind
The last time I went to visit with Ajaan Suwat before he passed away he commented that his brain was sending him all sorts of weird messages and he'd learned that he had to put a question mark after everything that came into his mind
But he said that thing I gained from the practice That hasn't gone away That thing was what enabled him to pull out of those messages in order to see that they were strange weird messages and that he didn't have to believe them
He had a foundation so even as the brain was churning out weird perceptions he had access to a dimension where he didn't have to get involved
As we meditate we're working in the direction of that dimension
The first step is to establish a safe place through concentration to keep our awareness based a place where it's protected
And that's worth all kinds of effort all kinds of discouragement all the things we have to go through in order to get there because the real sense of solidity and safety that comes with that is more than you can imagine
You realize how long you've been wandering around misled by your thoughts and how totally deluded you were and how much suffering it caused
Then when you can step out  really step out even out of that base of concentration  an enormous burden is lifted
In its place you gain both a sense of the solidity of that new dimension and the confidence that nothing can touch it because it's outside of space and time
As for what's going to happen inside of space and time that's a matter of karma
Even awakened people have to age grow ill and die but they've found the dimension that doesn't age doesn't grow ill doesn't die
And how did they find it
By doing what we're doing right now
Every time a thought comes up here's your chance Are you going to fall for the thought or are you going to step back from it
The thoughts may be crazy they may be things you don't want to think about but as long as you're able to step back from them you're in a good position
This place where you're stepping back may not be as totally solid as you'd like it but it's heading you in the right direction
If you don't have this you have no safety at all
There's no protection no perspective at all
Without the perspective there's no wisdom no insight
And without insight you're totally immersed in delusion
What is it like to be totally deluded
You're totally unsure of things
Deep down inside things don't seem quite right and there's always an element of fear
As the Buddha said As long as you're uncertain about the true Dhamma there's always the fear of death What's going to happen when you die
The only way you can know is by looking at the processes of the mind because it's already going through death and birth on a small level all the time
It just keeps coming back coming back coming back
Whatever habitual patterns you've been encouraging in the mind they just keep coming back again and again and again
But the fortunate thing is that you can step out of them
This is what the Buddha's teachings on karma are all about
Not everything is predetermined in the mind
With every present moment there's always the opportunity to make a new decision to make a new choice but most of us abandon that freedom and just keep flowing along with the same old patterns over and over and over again
We need to learn to appreciate our ability to step back and get some perspective to pull ourselves out of our thought worlds
No matter how fleeting your stepping out may seem as you're practicing each time you do it you're strengthening the skillful habit in the mind the habit that's actually your path
Ajaan Maha Boowa tells of how when Ajaan Mun passed away he was really hit with a sense of despair What was he going to do with his life now
When issues came up in his meditation to whom would he go for help
He said he felt like someone who'd been depending on a doctor for long years and now the doctor was gone
It was like being a wild animal in the forest with no doctor at all
But then he remembered all the teachings he'd gotten from Ajaan Mun in the past
Those would have to be his teachers now
And what was the point that Ajaan Mun emphasized more than anything else
Whenever anything comes up in your mind that you're not sure about just step back and stay with that sense of the knower that sense of just basic awareness and no matter what whatever it is in the mind will pass and you'll be safe It seems like such a little thing just the sense of the watcher the observer but it can keep you safe because it's the faculty of the mind that can pull you out
Even when storms are blowing through the mind you're in a safe spot
You've got your haven right here
Just don't let yourself get pulled into the storms because they can blow you all over the place
The Buddha once said Look at the animal world
See how variegated it is  all those many many many kinds of animals all the different shapes they take all the different ways they live Then he added The mind is more variegated than that It can get itself into all kinds of fixes
But you've also got your protection right here
It's right close to hand
It's closer than your eyes
The point in meditation is to learn how to appreciate it how to value it
Even though it may seem unstable right now keep coming back coming back coming back
If you don't what lies in store
You get blown around in the whirlwind like the shades in Dante's Inferno
If you do step back though you find that you're strengthening a very important habit
Each time you remember to come back builds a pathway in the mind
When you come to meditate in a place like this it's as if you've got your nose above water you've pulled yourself out a little bit from the flood
That's what they call it  the flood all these things that come pouring out of the mind
If you're not careful they can totally immerse you
You can drown
But here you've got your nose above water
You can breathe
It may not yet be the most stable position but the Buddha says that it can become your island
You've got your island in the midst of the flood here
It may not be a big island but it's big enough
As you develop it it opens up to even better things in the mind
Without this sense of awareness what would you have
Nothing
Nothing to hold onto at all
You'd be swept around in the storms that the mind cooks up
With this though you have hope  and it's not a faroff hope
It's something right here
If you learn how to value it it'll open up and show you all it has to offer  more than you can imagine
It's like one of those fairy tales where there's the ugly little troll under the bridge who as it turns out has gold stashed away
The valuable things in life are often in the places where you'd least expect to find them and they're closer to home than you might think
So keep this in mind
You've got gold right here but it's covered up by dust and dirt and the dust and the dirt can be cleared away
Aside from this gold you have nothing
With the gold you have no more needs
Try to gather your awareness around the breath
Make the breath your center a center from which you can act speak and have a sense of a good foundation
In Pali the word for the object of the mind arammana literally means a support for the mind
When you meditate you want to find a good solid support because when your support is solid you can deal with whatever's coming at you from whatever direction whether thoughts inside the mind or things people do or say from outside
Your response  if it comes from a solid foundation  is coming from a position of strength
When you come from a position of strength the things you do say and think are well thought out
They aren't desperate aren't grasping
If your center is based on things outside  if you're really concerned about what this or that person thinks about you  you're putting yourself in a very weak uncertain position
Your foundation isn't solid
When it isn't solid the things you do aren't well based
When I first went to Thailand I taught at Chiang Mai University
One of the things I learned in my spare time there was Thai boxing
When you're first taught Thai boxing all the emphasis is on your stance  the stance from which you're going to hit or kick your opponent
If the stance is solid you're coming from a position of strength
This may sound a little aggressive but it's an important point to remember as you go throughout life
When you're dealing with other people when you're dealing with all the issues in your mind you want to come from a good solid position so you can deal with these things effectively
The breath is always here
When you're at ease with your breath when you feel comfortable with your breath you've got a good foundation
That's where you can take your stance
Then when you respond to things you're coming from a solid position
Your response is more precise more on target
So try to practice coming back to the breath back to the breath because this is a foundation you've got to build
It may seem artificial at first but as you get more and more used to it you find that it really does provide a sense of being at home
One of the Pali terms for a concentrated mind vihara dhamma means just that a home for the mind a place where you feel safe where you feel solidly protected not only from things outside but also from all the issues that come bubbling up from inside as well
Because the biggest problems in life are not the events from outside but in how you react to them
Even before events come at you from outside things come bubbling up from within the mind
Sometimes anger comes up in the mind and then you go looking for something to be angry about
It's not in response to anything outside it's simply an urge coming up in the mind
Then you go out to focus on something outside that you decide you don't like and the anger builds on that
The same with lust with fear and anxiety Sometimes the feeling comes bubbling up and then you look for an object for it to focus on
So it's not the case that all problems come from outside
Actually most of them come from within but the fortunate thing is that not everything inside is problematic
You've got good qualities in here as well so you want to give them a place to gather so they can pool their strength
That's why you need this foundation
When you're staying with the breath you've got mindfulness the ability to keep something in mind
You keep reminding yourself Stay right here with the breath And then there's alertness You watch the breath as it comes in goes out you know what's happening
It's right there
Whether it's comfortable or not you know
If it's not comfortable you can change it
This is called evaluation
The basic indicator is Does the breath feel good or not For the Buddha the big issue in life is suffering so we start with a minor version of it  a minor sense of discomfort coming from the breath
Why breathe in a way that's uncomfortable
Nobody's forcing you
It's your own lack of attention that allows the breath to get uncomfortable
So pay attention and then learn to work with the breath
See what kind of rhythm feels good because when the breath goes well it gives you strength a sense of wellbeing a sense of being nourished around which all your other good qualities of mind can gather
When they can gather together they strengthen one another
So even though staying focused on the breath may require time and effort it's an important skill for once you have this center it's here not only when you sit with your eyes closed
Wherever you go there's the breath
When you learn to relate to the breath in a good way you have a good relation going on inside
In other words you learn to treat the breath with goodwill You want the breath to be comfortable
When you find that it's not comfortable you work to help it That's compassion
When it is going well you help to maintain it That's appreciation
And when it gets to the point where it's as good as you can get it you can't get it any better than that you say For the time being this is as good as it's going to get let's sit down and just be right here That's equanimity
If you learn to relate to your own breath in these ways it becomes a lot easier to relate to events and people outside with the same qualities
If there's a turmoil inside then the turmoil tends to affect your relationships with other people
The way you relate to yourself inside forms the pattern the template for how you relate to people outside
So you want to establish a good relation in here a good family relationship with all these good qualities mindfulness alertness your discernment in telling what's comfortable and what's not your ingenuity in figuring out ways to make things more comfortable
And the qualities of goodwill compassion appreciation and equanimity  they play a role here as well
When you learn to relate to the breath with these qualities of mind then every time you get in touch with the breath the qualities can be there as well
They nurture and inform the way you're going to react to whatever comes up wherever you are
Whether it's at work or at home or between work and home whether you're alone whether you're with other people  when you've got this good relationship going on inside when you feel at home with all these good qualities in the mind then you can tap into them whenever you want
So this ability to find a center to establish a foundation in the mind is one of the basic skills we need to be happy to be friends with ourselves
The chant just now on true friends and false friends doesn't refer just to people outside
It also refers to qualities of mind
Some qualities in the mind  like greed anger and delusion  are false friends
They come promising all kinds of things and then they don't deliver
They run off to desert you leaving you worse off than before
Those are your false friends inside
The true friends are the ones who are really helpful like the good qualities we're trying to gather around the breath here
So you attend to them earnestly as the chant says
Try to keep these qualities informing the way you relate to the breath and that becomes the foundation from which you relate to things in all your activities
We have a whole hour to work at this skill a skill that you don't leave here when the hour is up but that you take with you
It becomes the basic pattern for how you relate to the body how the mind relates to itself
It cuts through a lot of the unnecessary stress and frustration unnecessary turmoil in the mind
So look at this hour as an opportunity to provide yourself with a center
And then after the hour is over take the center with you wherever you go because it's always here
The breath is the point where the mind and the body meet and as long as you're alive you'll have this breath right here
If you can learn to be at home right here you're going to have a home wherever you go
As a result wherever you go will be your own space
A large part of our life is spent in feeling that somehow other people have taken possession of our space and we need to depend on their approval so that we can occupy their space
But that's not the case here
This is your space
When you're happy and comfortable inhabiting your space you're coming from a position of strength and wellbeing at all times
In one of Ajaan Lee's last Dhamma talks he compared life to taking a boat across an ocean
The problem out on the ocean is that there's no fresh water
For most of us meditation is like stopping in a port picking up some fresh water and putting it in the boat
Then we go out to sea and discover that we've run out of water so we have to go back to port
As a result we don't get very far
If we're not careful the winds will blow us away from the coast and we'll find ourselves without any water at all
In other words when we meditate we pick up a good sense of ease a sense of inner refreshment
It's like stocking up on water
But then we take it out and we pour the water out our eyes and ears all over the place
So we have to come back meditate some more get some more water  back and forth like this
We never really stock up on enough water to take us across the ocean
So an important lesson we have to learn is how not to pour the water out
What this means is learning how to maintain your center with the breath inside the body even when you go outside and deal with other people
This is one of the big issues in any meditator's life
Ajaan Lee has another passage where he compares the meditation to making the mind one and then turning it into zero
Now when you have zeros there are two things you can do with them
You can put them in front of numbers  in which case they have no meaning at all you don't read them they don't count  or else you put them after other numbers in which case turns into and then then and then
If the zeros get put after you've got lots of issues but if the zeros get put first no matter how many zeros you have they don't add anything don't burden the mind at all
It's the same way with the mind You make it zero and then you put the zeros first
Then when you deal with other people what they say doesn't count
It's interesting that Ajaan Lee focuses on what other people say as one of the tests for a mind that's really at peace
The Buddha makes a similar point in one of the Dhammapada verses
If when other people say harsh things to you and you don't reverberate  like a cracked gong  that's a sign that you've attained true peace of mind This might seem strange
Why does the test lie in how you react to what other people say
The mind is very sensitive to this issue
We learn very early in our lives that our happiness is going to depend on how other people treat us
As children we're surrounded by people a lot more powerful than we are so there's always a sense of fear built into our relationships to the people around us
We become sensitive to other people's moods sensitive to what they might do what they might say
As a result our center of gravity is placed outside because we're afraid of them and we try to put up a wall outside ourselves to protect ourselves from them
What this means is that our psychic center of gravity gets moved outside the body
If you've ever taken any martial arts classes you know that if your center of gravity is outside your body you're in bad shape
You're in a weak position
Now the Buddha doesn't say to ignore other people and just be very selfish
He says there's a different way to approach the whole issue of happiness
In other words you find a source for happiness that doesn't take anything away from anyone else so you don't have to be afraid of other people
When you're not afraid of them you find that you can actually be more compassionate to them
So developing and maintaining this center inside is not a selfish thing
The Buddha's not teaching you to be insensitive
He's just saying to put yourself in a stronger position and to trust that you're stronger by not trying to go outside and fix up people's moods and all the other things that we think we can do with other people when we're dealing with them
Just stay inside and have a sense of confidence that you're strong inside
After all your source of happiness lies inside
Because it's not taking anything away from anybody else you don't have to be afraid of them
Especially when you can get your awareness to fill the whole body when you get the breath flowing smoothly throughout the whole body This smooth flow of energy builds up a kind of force field
An image in the Canon is that the meditator who's able to fill the body with awareness is like a door made out of solid wood
If you were to take a ball of string and throw it at the door it wouldn't make any dent in the door at all
The mind filled with awareness with the breath energy flowing smoothly is the same sort of thing
It's solid
It resists outside influences
But when your awareness doesn't fill the body like this the Buddha says it's like a ball of wet clay into which somebody throws a stone
The stone makes a big dent in the clay
In other words you're in a weak position and you intuitively know you're in a weak position
Other people can invade your inner space
So you scramble around and try to build up all sorts of defenses
Because so much energy gets spent in the defenses and the energy is outside the body it knocks you off balance
You use up the water of your meditation the refreshment of your meditation very quickly this way
The trick as Ajaan Lee says is to have a little distillery in the boat so that you can take the salt water and put it into the distillery to turn it into fresh water
Then everywhere you go you've got fresh water
In other words no matter where you go you're right here centered in the body with your awareness filling the body
You're not leaving the body unprotected and you're not using up all your energy in those false outside defenses
You're creating a sense of energy here in the body a sense of refreshment and it's protecting you as well
This way you can travel around the world because there's salt water everywhere
If you've got the skill you can turn it into fresh water  as much fresh water as you want
So as you leave meditation it's important that you watch to see How does the mind move
How does it go flowing out your eyes and ears into the space outside your body
If you catch it and bring it back in how is it going to complain
There's going to be a sense of fear or a sense of uncertainty about trying to stay inside
In the beginning you may feel unprotected
Don't listen to those voices
Those are voices that took over your mind when you were a little child and didn't know anything
That was the best you could do at that time but now you've got more skills better skills more understanding
Learn how to reason with those voices Here's a good solid place a good safe place a secure place to be  right here inside the body  and you're operating from a position of strength And just that much is not only a gift to yourself but also the people around you
They'll sense the difference as well and it makes your interaction with them a lot easier
So learn to have some trust for this sense of being inside the body
The awareness that fills the body the breath energy that fills the body can protect you in a lot of ways
It can provide the nourishment and the refreshment you need at all times
At the same time it develops a momentum in the practice
If you keep on creating all the water you need when you have more than enough you can share it with the people around you
Your sense of what it means to interact with people will change  will be a lot less fearful  and your sense of what it means to be refreshed will grow deeper and stronger
Ajaan Lee used to say that there are two steps to getting started in the meditation
One is to get your body into position right leg on top of the left leg or left on top of the right depending on what you find more comfortable your back straight facing forward your eyes closed your hands in your lap
The next step is to get your mind in position
And that's more difficult because the mind doesn't usually want to stay in any one particular position
It's always running around always quick like a highstrung cat to jump at anything that comes along
Ajaan Mun once talked about the mind's song There are rhythms that go through the body rhythms that seem to go through our awareness
And we start singing along with them without really realizing it and then we're off wherever the melody will take us
When we put the mind in position we stop singing along
We just watch what's going on
So you bring it to the breath
It's a good way to get out of your head and down into the body
Give yourself a good comfortable place to stay and be aware of the breath coming in aware of the breath going out
Notice how the breathing feels in different parts of the body because the breathing is a wholebody process
If it's not a wholebody process that's a sign that there's a blockage someplace you've got to work with
But first get a good breath rhythm going in any one spot where it's easy to watch
It might be at the nose the chest the abdomen the neck the middle of the head  any place where all the different pressures of the breath coming in and going out and the pressures of your blood circulation feel right together
Focus right there and allow the breath to find whatever rhythm feels good feels gratifying
If the mind wanders off bring it right back
If it wanders off again bring it back again
You're trying to put it in position  which means finding a good comfortable posture for the mind  and then trying to get it to stay in position
It's the staying that makes all the difference
If you just get into position and then quickly jump away you don't get the benefits of being in position
And there are lots of benefits
One you're giving the mind a place to rest so that it can recover its strength from all that running around
And two when it's in position it can watch because if you ever want to watch something carefully you have to be very still
If you're running around all the time everything is a blur
You snatch a little sight of something here snatch a sight of something there but you don't see anything continuously  which means you don't really understand it
So we're trying to put the mind in a position where it can stay and watch continuously
This position of the observer is a very important part of the meditation  the observer that doesn't go singing along with the different rhythms or thoughts coming through the mind but watches them as events
When you're watching things as events you can decide which things are worth following through with and which ones are not
Of course you sometimes find yourself slipping off into your old habits of singing along but you can catch yourself stop and come back to the breath come back to this position of the observer
Get more and more used to being here
This is where the mind can have a sense of being at home where it can rest where it can accurately watch the movements of the mind
Where are they running to
Are they going to a place you want to go
If not you just drop them and whatever reality they seemed to have will dissolve away
It's because you give them a reality that they become solid and imposing and gain power over you
But if you learn simply to watch them as events you can gain the upper hand
So what you're doing here is developing a place for the mind to rest  a place where in resting it heals itself
At the same time it can watch
And in the watching it learns not to build up new diseases
As any doctor can tell you there are two parts to maintaining good health
One is taking the medicine when you need it and the other is having a healthy lifestyle
If you want to be healthy it's not good to eat unhealthy food go around smoking eating junk food and then coming to the doctor to ask for medicine
The medicine will help but not nearly as much as when you have a healthy lifestyle where you're not putting the junk into your system to begin with
And the same holds true for the mind
We come here to meditate to help heal the mind from all the damage it does to itself
We tend to think more of the stress coming in from outside but actually we're playing along with the outside stress we're singing along with the outside stress which is why it gets into the mind
So we come here close our eyes sit in a still position and give the mind a chance to wash out all the unhealthy energies it's picked up
This is a good thing to be doing but it would be even better if we could maintain this position of the observer all the time
That's a healthy lifestyle for the mind
This is what you want to try to do as the mind gets accustomed to settling down with the breath
Not only when you're sitting here but also when you get up and start moving around Try to maintain this same inner position this same inner posture of being the observer
And try to notice when you lose it
That's a sign you've run across something important one of those tricks the mind plays on itself to go someplace it knows it shouldn't
That's one of the reasons for these lapses
The other is that it simply forgets itself and just starts singing along with whatever thought comes along whatever mood comes along
These things seem to have so much reality simply because we sing along with them
But if you can maintain the position of the observer you watch these things as they come and you begin to see the damage they can do if you take them in
You realize that you have the choice
You don't have to play along with them you don't have to sing along with them you don't have to take them in
You're now in a position of strength a position where you can watch where you can see these things simply as events rather than as the worlds to enter into
In this way you find that the medicine of sitting meditation can seep deeper and deeper and show more effects than you might have imagined before
Up to now it's simply been a holding action
When things are bad you sit down you wash things out of your system you feel better and then you go back to your old habits
As a result the meditation doesn't get a chance to penetrate deeply to show itself as anything more than simple stress reduction or momentary relief from all the suffering you're carrying around
But when you can maintain the position of the observer it becomes a lifestyle a way of living in which you're not bringing in all those other things to burden the mind to begin with
No matter how the body moves no matter how thoughts move you maintain this position
If you can keep this up then when you come to sit and meditate you find the meditation goes deeper deeper and deeper
You see that it can do more than you might have imagined
It can address the more subtle diseases in the mind the more subtle harm the mind is doing to itself
It's like maintaining a yoga position or a stretch
The first couple of seconds are hard because you feel stiff but then you relax into the stretch
As you relax you can go further into the stretch because you give it more time more continuous time to work its effects
Meditation is not here simply for coping with the stresses and strains of life
It's for showing how we can ultimately go beyond causing any suffering or stress for ourselves at all  not only for ourselves but also for the people around us
Ultimately we learn to drop even the position of the observer to open up to a different dimension in the mind that lies outside of time outside of space outside of all the worlds we can create for ourselves
But to see that you first have to make the observer strong
And to do that you have to give the meditation time and you have to make it part of a lifestyle a way of living  an inner posture an inner position that you maintain  this observer who watches the moods come and go watches the thoughts come and go doesn't sing along with them doesn't cause itself the damage it used to
Over time you find that the posture of the observer goes deeper and deeper
The observer can see more and more because you give it the time to develop to become strong to become your real home where you settle down
So ideally ultimately when you meditate it won't be a matter of getting in position
You'll get the body in position but the mind will already be in position the habitual position of the observer
Instead of running out after things singing along with this tune singing along with that you're stepping back a bit
You have a place to step back and simply watch these things
If there's any use to them you follow through with them
If not you let them go
This becomes the basic stance of the mind
As I said when you reach that point the meditation shows that it can do a lot more than you might have imagined
It can solve problems you didn't even know you had eliminate levels of suffering and stress you didn't even know you were causing because they were always there in the background
Now that the mind is even more subtle and still it can see these things
And it's only when you see things that you can let them go
Every evening before we meditate we chant the four sublime attitudes goodwill  May all living beings be happy compassion  May they all be free from stress and pain appreciation  May they not lose the happiness they've found
And then there's equanimity
Instead of saying All living beings can just go to hell I don't care the chant says All living beings are the owners of their actions heirs to their actions
Exactly how is that thought related to equanimity
Notice that it comes last in the list
In other words you first cultivate goodwill compassion and appreciation
But then there comes a point where you realize that you can have goodwill for people but they're not happy
You can have compassion for them and they still don't get released from their suffering
You can have appreciation for their happiness but they abuse it
They abuse their power they abuse their wealth
You begin to realize that there's only so much you can do not only for other people but also for yourself
That's where the reflection on karma comes in
You realize that certain things are caused by past karma and there's no way you can change them
Other people's karma places limitations on them your own karma places limitations on you
You have to live realistically within those limitations
You can push them a bit you can push the envelope to see how much you can work for your own happiness and for that of others but there comes a point where the envelope pushes back
You realize that you can only do so much at any given time
You can do only so much with the energy the talents you have
So the appropriate response is to put aside the areas where you can't help or can't make a difference so that you can focus on the areas where you can
That's what the chant on karma is all about to give you a sense of priorities to remind yourself of what's important
You've got a limited amount of energy a limited amount of time in this life
You help where you can but if you can't help there's no point in getting upset no point in suffering over it
There's no point in expending your energies in areas where you just can't make a difference for you only have so much
Equanimity means making peace with the principle of karma so that you can work within it and use your energy wisely
That's part of what it means to say Whatever you do for good or for evil to that will you fall heir You have to accept the principle of karma if you're going to be skillful in using what you've got
The teaching on equanimity is not counseling cold indifference
It's simply reminding you of where your priorities are where your limitations are and that you've got to work within those limitations
In other words if an issue comes from your past karma you realize you can't change that
What you can change what you can shape is what you're doing right now
So focus there
There's a passage where the Buddha talks about the skillful and unskillful ways of teaching karma and of thinking about karma
An unskillful way is to say that everybody who does evil is going to go to hell everybody who does something bad is going to suffer
You look back and you realize that you like everyone else have done some bad things in your life the times when you acted on less than noble or less than your best intentions
If you simply brood over your big mistakes you put yourself into a spiral that goes down down down
It doesn't help you at all
What you should do is to remind yourself that even though there's past karma there's also new karma a fresh slate
You can choose freely right now to act as skillfully as possible
Whatever you've done in the past that was unskillful just put it aside
Make up your mind that you're not going to make that same mistake again
And then move on
It's not that you deny your mistakes
You freely admit them
It's not that you're blas about them
You realize that a mistake's a mistake and you don't want to repeat it
But if you simply brood on the mistakes you made in the past you don't leave yourself the energy needed to act skillfully in the present moment
It's a matter of priorities Where are you going to focus your energies to get the best results
The reflection connecting the principle of karma with equanimity is meant to clear the decks so that you can focus right there on your present actions
That's where the true issue is
That's what underlies the basic structure of reality
When you can focus here you don't get all caught up in all the what ifs about the past What if I had done this
What if I hadn't done that All those what ifs about the past are a massive waste of time
The important what if is What if I act skillfully now Try that out
Buddhism doesn't teach heartlessness
It starts out with goodwill
Look at the path It's a way of working for your own wellbeing and the wellbeing of those around you a way of putting an end to suffering
That's goodwill put into action in spades
The teaching on equanimity is meant to make sure that your goodwill doesn't run off the road doesn't burn out doesn't waste time getting lost in unskillful byways
In other words the Buddha doesn't tell you to be indifferent about your choices in the present moment or to say Who cares what I do in the present moment You can't think that way
You have to let goodwill compassion and appreciation dominate your choice of how you're going to act right now  and right now and right now as the present keeps moving through time
You can't be indifferent to that
There has to be a strong sense of desire purpose and resolve about doing the most skillful thing you can each moment you're aware of your choices
You have to make yourself more and more aware of exactly what choices you're making
That requires effort and energy
The development of equanimity husbands your resources so that you can focus them on the spot where they're most useful where they really will make a difference
You develop equanimity about the path only when you've obtained the goal
Even the equanimity you feel when you've obtained the goal There's a transcending of that as well in what the texts call nonfashioning In other words you realize that equanimity is a choice you make These are the things you're going to put aside these are the things you're going to focus on
The things you put aside you really do have to let yourself not get worked up about them
When the path is finally completed that's the point when it too comes into the realm of equanimity
You can let go of it
Don't fashion anything at all not even the choices of equanimity
That's when the mind gains release
So you develop universal equanimity in accepting the principle of karma but in applying it to your past and present choices you need a selective equanimity up until the endpoint of the path
That way instead of being a blanket indifference to everything  which would be like being a dead person  equanimity becomes an important tool in keeping you alive and active making sure all the energy and activity you've got to devote to the present moment is used in the best possible way
Otherwise you drag yourself down by taking on too many responsibilities too many cares
When that happens nothing much gets accomplished at all
Only when you focus your energies properly can they really pay off
As you develop your meditation try to bring the mind to concentration so that it can maintain this state of equanimity from which you continue your work
In other words you have equanimity for everything else at that point aside from the development of insight
Then the equanimity serves to protect you as well
Ajaan Fuang once said If you don't have the equanimity of jhana goodwill will cause you suffering because you see how limited your ability to help other people is
You keep running up against the limitations created by your own past karma in exactly how much you can accomplish for them at any one time
You also run up against the limitations of their past and present karma
If you develop the proper equanimity to those limitations you don't have to suffer because of them
You simply recognize them and work around them on the areas that are open to you
Equanimity is an important way of nourishing you on the path giving you strength making sure that your basic goodwill for yourself and other people gets properly directed and not squandered
Don't think of equanimity as a heartless or cold state of mind
It's simply a very realistic way of looking at things
Notice that in the Four Sublime Attitudes the other three are May all living beings be this way May all living beings be that way But when you get to the fourth one the thought is All living beings are the owners of their actions There's no may in there it's just a statement of fact
You recognize reality you recognize the limitations in this causal realm in which we operate and you make up your mind to work within those limitations in as creative and effective way as is possible
Someone once wrote a book on Buddhism called The Intelligent Heart
This is precisely what these four attitudes try to develop an intelligent heart an intelligence in the way your heart your will and your motivation function in your life so as to get the most out of them
And equanimity is what makes the intelligence possible
One of the major ironies of how Buddhism has come to the West is how the teaching on dependent coarising has been turned into a teaching on interdependence or interconnectedness
With the original teaching the emphasis was on how things work together to cause suffering whereas the new teaching is something to celebrate
It's good that everything works together everything fits together
We're all interdependent we're all interconnected and it's a lovely comforting thing
But when you look carefully at the way things are actually interconnected it's hard to see much to celebrate
The fit is always a little loose a little awkward and this causes a lot of pain and suffering
Extra water vapor coming off the Atlantic has now killed people in New Orleans and driven up oil prices all over the United States
It's a weird string of connections
Or you don't have to look that far afield
Just look at your own body at how things are connected in the body
See how the human body is constructed
The back As you grow older you begin to realize how poorly designed the human back is
If there is a designer it's not a very intelligent design or if there is an intelligence behind it it's a malicious intelligence
It's designed for pain it's designed to fall apart
Or look at how human beings are born
You start with sex which requires a lot of lust but then lust  whoever designed lust if there was a designer was pretty malicious because lust isn't something you can control
You start lusting after the wrong people which is what most people seem to do most of the time
And lust doesn't only create babies
It also leads to deception to murder to disease to all kinds of problems and yet it's an essential part of the mix to keep the human race going
And then there's pregnancy all the pains a woman goes through in bearing a child
In Thailand before each ordination they traditionally have an afternoonlong chant
A layperson is hired to chant to remind the young monk candidate of all the suffering his mother went through in raising him
If the chant lasts for about four hours three of those hours are focused on the nine months of pregnancy  the months of morning sickness the months of something kicking in her stomach
And then there's birth
They say that the most extreme pain that a human being can endure is the pain of giving birth
And it's no fun for the child either
If there is a design behind all this if there is an intelligent design it's a malicious intelligence
So this is the world that we're born into
This is how we're born
And it required a Buddha to approach the world with some compassionate intelligence seeing all this interconnectedness and saying there is a way we can use these interconnected things these dependent things to find a way out of the suffering
That's what he gave his life to both the finding and the teaching
And it's a very fragile teaching
If you look at Buddhist history you see that wherever the Dhamma goes people find all kinds of ways of trying to divert the teaching to other purposes forgetting that its original purpose was the most compassionate showing the way out of suffering
Our imagination is so tied up with the normal way of using connectedness or interdependence that it really has trouble negotiating that compassionate use
This is why the path is so hard It goes against the grain
If anything calls into question the idea of an intelligent designer or a compassionate designer it's the fact that the quest for the end to suffering the quest for a true and lasting happiness goes so much against the grain of the human mind
Keep that in mind as you practice
It's to be expected that the practice is going to go against the grain
And because the path requires working with tools that normally fit into another purpose  the survival of the body  it's very easy for us to get off track
You have to keep in mind the fact that deep down inside your deepest desire is a desire for happiness a happiness that's not going to change on you a happiness that's not going to leave you in the lurch a happiness that doesn't have to involve other suffering
That was the desire the Buddha respected within himself and he respected it within other people as well
That's why he searched for this path
When he found it that's why he taught it  to speak to that specific desire
And yet there's so much in the world that tells us that it's unrealistic it's too much trouble
All those voices are ready to pounce on any problems that come up in the practice
But keep that little fire burning inside that if there's any sense to this life at all it lies in finding a true happiness
Always try to protect that
Do what you can to maintain it use your intelligence to sidestep any discouragements that might put it out
After all this path is made out of conditioned things so there are times when it seems like everything comes crashing down and you have to put it together all over again
But it can always be put together again
Whether it's going to snuff out that little flame is really up to you
The trick to surviving the bad periods in the path is to keep that long vision in mind and to remember the nature of this path It's a constructed path a fabricated path
It leads to something unfabricated but the path itself is a fabrication which means that it's dependent on conditions
Sometimes the conditions aren't all they could be but we do have this intelligence within us that can learn how to make the best of difficult things makeshift things to hammer things together in a new way
So do what you can to strengthen your intelligence on the path
This is a strength composed of five things
First there's the conviction that there's got to be a way out of suffering
Second there's persistence sticking with that conviction acting on it all the time
Third there's mindfulness You remember to keep that conviction in mind all the time and to apply it to all of your actions
Fourth and fifth are concentration and discernment
The discernment there is to help find ways over the obstacles that we all inevitably find on the path and the concentration is to give your mind the food it needs to keep its energy up
The texts talk about persistence as a requisite for concentration but the relationship goes the other way as well
Do your best just to stick with one object
When everything else seems to be crazy in life just say Okay I'm going to stay right here
If I don't know anything else for sure what I do know for sure is that the breath is now coming in the breath is now going out
Let's just hang out here for the time being In that way you can weather whatever crisis comes up and it gives you the strength to deal with things to recover
I was reading recently about studies they've done of major disasters and catastrophes  huge hurricanes earthquakes fires
They've noticed how people immediately after a catastrophe feel a bizarre sense of euphoria
They develop a sense of common purpose as they drop their normal concerns and band together to rebuild to recover
Then after a while once things get back to normal again everybody goes back to their old ways
As one researcher pointed out right after a catastrophe there's a suspension of time people's normal narratives stop functioning and there's a sense of liberation from those narratives as you've now got an obvious immediate common purpose
In fact one of the researchers said it sounded a lot like Buddhist meditation to him the idea of dropping the narrative of the past and the future and just staying with the present moment finding a purpose in the present moment
That gave a buoyancy to the rebuilding efforts
Well try to use that same attitude when your meditation comes crashing down
You've got some rebuilding work to do
It gives you a purpose and it's something you can focus on totally in the present moment
The best way of doing that is to drop the whole narrative that's driving you crazy the fact that things seemed to be going well and now all of a sudden they've crashed
Whether it's a sudden crash or a gradual one doesn't really matter
What matters is that you realize Okay just forget about the narrative and focus on the needs of the present moment That's all you're responsible for
That's all you have to worry about
You'll find that that will give you the buoyancy the energy you need in order to start the rebuilding work
So again what you're using here is the process of dependent coarising the interconnectedness of conditioned phenomena but you're pointing it in a new direction
In one of the suttas the Buddha describes what one modern teacher has called transcendent dependent coarising
It's the typical pattern starting with ignorance and going through craving and ending up in suffering
And the normal reaction to suffering as the Buddha once said is a combination of bewilderment and search
We're bewildered about why this particular type of suffering is happening and we search hoping that somebody else will know a way out
What usually happens is that the bewilderment simply adds more ignorance
The search turns into more craving and that leads to more suffering
But there are times when the search turns into a solid conviction There must be a way out
And you're going to do whatever is needed to find that way out
You've reflected on life and seen that the design if there is a design is not compassionate at all
All you have to see is someone go through the process of aging illness and death and you realize  if there is a design  how harsh it is
But more likely this is just the way things happen to be without any overarching point or purpose
As you realize that you've got to reflect on the fact that there must be a way out
And you've got the Buddha and his Noble Disciples to say Yes there is We're fortunate that we have their testimony
Their testimony is like a challenge
Are you up for the challenge
If you're not you're going to have to suffer like everybody else
If you are up for the challenge though you're still going to suffer for a while but it will be in a different way
It's a suffering that leads to the end of suffering
So make the most of this opportunity because it's the only intelligent way to find happiness  and it doesn't come along all that often
One of the most difficult but important principles in the practice is what the Buddha called Learning to see renunciation as freedom
For most of us renunciation seems to be a restriction  as when you're getting the mind to focus on the breath
Before you make up your mind to do that the mind doesn't seem to be restricted doesn't seem to have any violent wishes or disorderliness or unruliness
But then all of a sudden as soon as you tell it to stay with the breath it finds all sorts of other places where it wants to go
It complains that it's being constricted that it's being tied down
You have to learn not to listen to those complaints because as the Buddha explains when the mind really does settle down with one object it's freed from a lot of restrictions and burdens
He describes progress through stages of concentration as stagebystage release
Simply getting the mind to stay consistently with the breath you're released from unskillful mental states released from sensual desires
That's a state of freedom but there's a part of the mind that doesn't see it that way
And that part of the mind gets a lot of encouragement from the world outside partly because it's in other people's interest to have us chained to our sensual desires
Once we're chained to our sensual desires they have a hook to sell us things to make us buy and our desires play along with that
We mistrust the impulse toward celibacy toward renunciation
I was talking a while back to a Zen practitioner  admittedly someone who wasn't all that advanced  about conflict resolution in the community and I pointed out that having the Vinaya as our standard was very liberating
To him that was an unusual idea  that rules could be liberating
Part of his quest he said was to learn how to see beyond rules so that you weren't confined by them
So how could rules be liberating I pointed out For one thing we don't have to sit around discussing what the standards of behavior in the community are going to be week after week after week
It's all settled
The standards are livable they're humane
So having the standards established frees us to have a lot more time to practice
And that's just a very basic example
There are other ways in which rules are liberating as well
Popular culture likes to hear about monks and nuns who are having trouble with their vows who end up either disrobing or acting out their desires in weird and convoluted ways
This shows that they're being confined and restricted by their rules that they really miss the things that they gave up
That's what popular culture likes to hear  that it's offering us all the really good things in life and that the alternatives are bogus
But when you really get a taste of what it's like to get the mind to settle down without having to hanker after other things you find how liberating it is
When you see the rewards you're more and more willing to let go of the things that you're normally attached to in favor of the freedom of not being attached
This impulse to mistrust the principle of renunciation isn't just an American or a Western issue
It goes way back in Buddhist history
For example there's the Mahayana ideal that the arahants are stuck in a limited nirvana
The Mahayanists feel that bodhisattvas have more freedom because they have a foot in both worlds they say
Well nirvana is the opposite of being stuck
For one thing it's not a place
When there's no place there's no being stuck anywhere
Second the person who attains nirvana is totally undefined with no restrictions whatsoever
From the outside it looks uninviting but from the actual experience of the practice  of learning to let go let go let go and be less and less defined by this that or the other attachment  it brings a huge sense of freedom
So as we stick with our efforts to stay with the breath to stay with one thing remember We're sticking but we're not stuck
We're not being confined
We're learning to give up restrictions learning to get out of the chains that have become so familiar that we've learned to mistrust the idea that anybody could be happy outside of those chains
But the freedom beyond those chains is just what the Buddha's talking about
All his teachings aim in that direction
He said that his teachings all have a single taste
Just as the ocean has the taste of salt  anywhere you go in the ocean the water tastes salty  everywhere you look in his teachings there's the taste of freedom the taste of release
Even when he teaches restraint of the senses again it's for the purpose of liberating the mind from all the unskillful states that would arise if you weren't careful
He says that if you're not careful about how you look at things how you listen to things how you smell things taste things touch things then the mind is assailed
It's injured by sense objects
To many people that amount of restraint sounds confining but when you take the mind to a state of concentration where it's not injured in that way you realize the sense of freedom the sense of relief that results
So a lot of the practice comes down to a willingness to take the Buddha at his word in spite of all of our fear of what it might be like to renounce things to give things up to show restraint
Our preconception is that it's very confining and as the song goes The saints are so miserable they're crying and grieving
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than grieve with the saints
Well the sinners don't laugh all that long  and the saints don't grieve They're totally free
So allow space in your imagination for that possibility that renunciation really is freedom when you do it wisely when you do it to learn and understand
Open up your imagination to the possibility that the Buddha was right  that all these practices and rules really do have the taste of freedom
The Buddha once compared sensory input to being like a flayed cow with no skin
Everywhere the cow goes insects bore into its flesh all the time
Our senses are constantly picking up information through the eyes ears nose tongue body
And on top of that the mind is its own sense
It picks up all kinds of ideas
The question is how are you going to find any peace in the midst of all that
And the answer is You have to be selective
The Buddha talks about restraint of the senses as an essential part of meditation
We often think of meditation as what starts as soon as you sit down and close your eyes but actually it's going on all the time
The word for meditation bhavana means to develop
You should stop and look What are you developing in your mind
When you follow certain trains of thought you develop the habits that go along with them
You create ruts in the mind
When you give free rein to anger you create an angerrut
When you develop mindfulness you create a mindfulnessrut
The next time you get anywhere near those patterns of thinking the mind falls into the rut and goes along with it
We're doing this all the time
They've done study after study to show how selective our process of perception is
It happens on many levels
Some of it's conscious some of it's not but the upshot is that even before you sit down to close your eyes you're already in a process of developing
The question is is it developing the same thing the meditation is meant to develop
Are you developing calm or are you developing turmoil
Are you developing mental stability or are you developing restlessness
Look into this all the time
Everything you do everything you say is a process of developing something
It's laying down ruts in the mind so what kind of ruts do you want
We're trying to work on good ones as we sit here with our eyes closed but if the rest of the day you're working on other kinds of ruts it's a struggle
When you look at things what are you looking for
Who's doing the looking
Is lust doing the looking
Is anger doing the looking
If these things are doing the looking they create the ruts for more anger or more lust to keep on doing the looking
So throughout the course of the day be careful of what you look at
This doesn't mean you can't look at goodlooking things
It's just that when you see something goodlooking you have to remind yourself that there's another side to it as well
When you see something you really hate remind yourself that there's another side to it as well
As Ajaan Lee used to say Be a person with two eyes The same applies to your listening what you smell what you taste what you touch and especially what you think about
It's a common pattern that when you're sitting here meditating you try to keep the mind under control but then as soon as you get up it's back to its old ways  just wandering around anyplace it wants to
And that way you're being inconsistent
If the mind is going to go someplace you have to ask yourself Why are you going there It's like that old slogan from World War II Is this trip really necessary Where are you planning to go
What are you planning to bring back
Be deliberate in your thinking
The Buddha's not saying not to think
He's just saying to have a sense of why you're thinking what it's going to accomplish
The same holds true with the looking and the listening Have a sense of why you're looking at something what you're going to accomplish by looking at it
Why are you listening to certain things
All of this is part of the meditation part of the developing because you're creating the environment in your mind and you want to make sure you're creating the right environment
Get your priorities in order
This way the meditation is less an attempt at a little island of calm in the midst of whirlpools
It's more a part of an ongoing process  realizing that the mind needs to be trained and that the training is a full time process
Even when you're out in the world  not just here at the monastery  you've got to look at where your mind is going what it's picking up
In particular notice what it's picking up because there are all kinds of bizarre messages out there
As soon as you turn on the TV pick up a newspaper pick up a magazine the question should always be Why do these people want me to believe this  so that you don't fall for the messages for the unstated values
If this makes you a stranger in your surroundings well fine
Sometimes it's good to be a stranger not to pick up everything
One of the advantages of going to Thailand was just that No matter how much I was absorbed in the culture in the language there was still part of me that was an outsider and that outside perspective was always important
Sometimes it helps you keep your sanity because that outsider perspective can be your guide inside your inner teacher
The Buddha talks about the traditions of the noble ones or the customs of the noble ones
To practice in line with these traditions is to make you a person with one foot in two different cultures
The noble ones look at material things and say Remember all the suffering that goes into just providing food clothing and shelter so don't get all wrapped up in having lots of food lots of clothing a big house
Remember that those things have their drawbacks The world out there is saying Buy buy buy but the noble ones are saying No Listening to the noble ones helps keep you bicultural
When the media push all kinds of materialistic values on you there's a part of you that can say No You're not sucked into those things and as a result the mind is more independent has a lot more peace
It can keep its values straight even in crazy societies like ours
There's a phrase in the Dhammapada the people who see shame in what's not shameful or see no shame in what is shameful
A part of the world looks at the values of being moral having principles not fighting tooth and claw to get lots of belongings and see that as shameful as something to be embarrassed about
That's why you've got to get out of that culture
This is why we need the culture of the noble ones
That voice of restraint inside is going to be your protection
Learn how to listen to it to strengthen it so that restraint in daytoday life augments the restraint of your meditation
You're trying to focus on one thing and you can stay there because you're used to exercising restraint in a healthy way knowing how much you can rein the mind in when you have to give it a little extra leash so it doesn't feel too confined too cooped up but at the same time knowing how much is too much  this is something you have to learn over time
So think about the environment you're creating in your mind the environment that allows the mind to settle down the values that allow it to settle down so that when disturbing thoughts arise you don't immediately go with them
You can look at them and say That's not a thought I want to follow When you're used to saying No to things already it's easier to say No to them when you're sitting here with your eyes closed focusing on the breath
And vice versa When you've got your eyes open you can remind yourself I've been able to overcome this thought before
I've been able to say No to it and I haven't died
This way you can maintain your mental health and the meditation really does become an ongoing process of developing  developing the skillful qualities you want mindfulness alertness a sense of calm a sense of wholeness and wellbeing in body and mind
As the Buddha said The mind well trained brings happiness It needs to be well trained because it's always doing things so make sure that what it's doing is in line with where you want to go
Life doesn't teach lessons
It's up to us to learn lessons which means that we have to take the initiative
We can't wait for the things we need to know to be automatically presented to us as our birthright
Ajaan Fuang stressed this point when I first went back to stay with him
He told me You have to think like a thief if you want to learn the Dhamma In other words don't expect everything to be handed to you on a platter
It's up to you to be observant
When you're listening to somebody talk whether they're aiming at teaching you a lesson or not what can you learn from what they have to say
When events happen in your life when events happen to people around you what can you learn
When you make the willingness to learn the basis for your self esteem that cuts through a lot of other issues as well
And it's one of the few forms of self esteem that actually keeps you open to change
For many of us self esteem means thinking that basically we're good people  which means that we have to keep trying to look back on our past actions to see evidence of that
And then of course we run across things that don't support that idea and so we block them out of our minds
We don't like to think about them
In many cases those are precisely the things we need to learn from
So when you detect a tendency not to want to reflect on your past mistakes try to look into the fear around that Why are you afraid of looking at these things
Fear in and of itself is not a bad thing
The problem is when fear is conjoined with greed anger and delusion
The greed anger and delusion are what create the problem
Fear in and of itself can often be skillful
After all a lot of the Buddha's teachings are based on the very rational fear of the suffering that comes with aging illness and death
There's the word ottappa which means the fear of the consequences of unskillful actions
That's something the Buddha encouraged
He says it's a treasure
There's also the word samvega which is sometimes translated as dismay or shock
It's related to an adjective samvigga which means terrified
You look at the way life goes aimlessly on and on and on and the appropriate reaction is a sense of terror
One thing leads to another and often nothing seems to lead anywhere worthwhile at all
As the Buddha emphasized the only way out of this sense of terror or dismay is to develop strong confidence and conviction in the principle of karma the principle of action
And that requires that you be willing to learn what's skillful what's not
So when you see the mind refusing to look at mistakes you've made in the past you have to ask yourself What's being threatened by the idea of looking at those mistakes Often you find that it's your sense of self esteem your sense of I'm basically a good person I wouldn't want to hurt people You don't want to admit the things you did to hurt yourself to hurt others
You don't want to look at feelings and emotions that you feel guilty or ashamed of
But if you're really serious about putting an end to suffering you need to develop the strength of mind to look into those things for otherwise the consequences of not looking into them are even more fearsome
So it's not an issue of learning not to have fear it's learning where fear should properly be focused
And where it should be focused is on the idea that if you don't learn from your past mistakes you're never going to learn
At the very least you're not learning anything right now and in not learning anything right now you're leaving yourself open to all kinds of mistakes in the future
So look at the sense of self esteem that wants to say I'm already good that wants a nice pat on the head and  if nobody else gives one  gives itself a pat on the head
Look at the price of trying to keep that sense of self esteem shored up of trying to protect it when it's so obviously fragile
If you try to maintain that kind of self esteem you're setting yourself up for a fall because you can't continue to stay in denial forever
Even while you're in denial the suffering that comes from your actions just keeps coming back coming back coming back
We see this pattern in other people and as the Buddha says The wise person is someone who learns lessons from other people's actions as well There's that famous sutta about the four types of horses
The quick welltrained horse only has to see the shadow of the whip and he does what he knows should be done
Next down there's the horse has to feel the whip on his coat
Then there's the horse who has to feel the whip cutting into his hide and finally the horse who has to feel the whip cutting into his bone
In other words if we're wise we learn to look at the dangers around us and not wait for them to hit us full force before we say I've had enough of this dangerous samsara I'm ready to get out Or I've had enough of this particular way of acting I'll have to learn how to stop
They say in AA that someone really has to hit rock bottom before he's willing to learn anything from the program
That's the way human nature normally is
Even then there are people who hit rock bottom and still don't learn
So it's more a question of your discernment in seeing when it's time to give up a sense of self esteem that's based on a rickety foundation one that constantly has to be shored up to the point where people suffer
Most people never learn
They suffer horribly just because they want to retain a little scrap of self respect here or there
So take that lesson and apply it to yourself looking back at your past mistakes
Don't be afraid to look there for if you're afraid to look there you're maintaining a delusion
And that delusion is going to hurt you further down the line
So it's eitheror
Which sense of wellbeing are you going to choose the wellbeing built on the shaky ground of already being a good person or the wellbeing of having the attitude that you're always willing to learn
The first attitude is the one to drop
The second attitude is the one that offers hope that's based on a much more solid foundation for there's always the possibility to keep learning and learning and learning
When you're dealing with difficult things from the past have the attitude that At least I'm going to learn from this That shifts the foundation onto something much more solid so that you're not making your happiness depend on something you know is going to be washed away by the waves of time
It's a foundation based on a much more cleareyed sense of fear focused on what should appropriately be feared  the unwillingness to learn  for that's what keeps people blind
That's what keeps people suffering
This unwillingness to learn is something we all suffer from and we all need to learn how to overcome it
Only when we can overcome it do we actually start learning lessons
Otherwise we go through life refusing to learn the lessons that are potentially there
So try to be the sort of person who picks up lessons quickly because the more quickly you pick them up the less you suffer
It's as simple as that
And the suffering that comes from being slow to pick up lessons or from being unwilling to pick up lessons That's something really worth being afraid of
The Buddha encouraged his son Rahula to make the willingness to learn at all times the basis for his practice
And he explained to Rahula how to learn You look at your actions and you look at the results
When the results turn out to be harmful you're not ashamed to talk them over with someone else
Talk them over with someone who has experience on the path
Get that person's perspective and then resolve not to make that mistake again
When you do things properly  your intention is skillful and no unhappy results come  then you can take joy in the practice
This is where that sense of self esteem is properly placed Take joy that you're continuing to grow in the practice
And just that shift in attitude makes all the difference in the world
This path we're following There's a way in which you could call it sensitivity training  getting more and more sensitive to the way the mind creates suffering for itself
As you deal with a layer of blatant suffering you peel it away and find another more subtle one
This is a lot of what the training in discernment is about working from the blatant layers to the more subtle ones by trying to stay on the path
The Buddha called it a middle way and getting that sense of middleness or balance is a lot of our training in discernment
If you've ever looked at a balance you see that the two sides don't stay balanced all the time
They swing back and forth before they can come to a point of equilibrium
And we have to learn to anticipate that in the practice
Sometimes you lean too far to the left and then too far to the right back and forth like this before you come to any kind of balance
A lot of the wisdom and discernment that come in the path lie in learning how to negotiate all the back and forth when you follow a particular tack in your practice and then find that it goes too far
You've got to turn around and go back the other way and often you'll find you've gone too far the other way too so you have to turn around and come back back and forth like this
The wisdom lies in learning how to deal with the back and forth and not get frustrated with it realizing that when you make mistakes you're learning lessons
When you learn from your mistakes you'll ultimately be able to reach balance and learn how to regain it quickly whenever it gets knocked to either side
The other aspect of the middleness of the path is that it's appropriate for whatever comes up
In other words it doesn't just call for middling effort all the time
Sometimes your effort has to be strong sometimes it has to be very very subtle
And again mastering this point requires sensitivity
The Buddha once talked about two kinds of Right Effort
Some kinds of suffering he said require a really concerted effort to deal with them others simply require that you watch
This is a lesson we can learn with the breath
Sometimes there are levels of discomfort in the breath you can actually deal with patterns of tension in the body you can work through by experimenting by trying this trying that making the breath longer shorter deeper more shallow changing your conception of the breath
But sometimes you run up against a brick wall
Nothing you do seems to help
The more you meddle with the breath the more muddled it gets
Either you're too heavyhanded or too picky about what kind of breathing is good enough for you
So you've got to back off and just watch for a while to see whether the problem is in the breath or in the mind
And don't be too quick to come to conclusions
When you see an opening that seems to make sense  maybe this could be changed a little bit maybe that could be changed a little bit  then you can get back to meddling with the breath again
Try things out
If they don't work go back to just watching
The practice goes back and forth like this
A lot of the discernment in the path comes with learning where the extremes are how far you can push things and when you have to stop and just watch for a while trying to do as little as possible
If the breath seems too entangled  the more you work with it the worst it gets  just tell yourself I'm not going to breathe
If the body wants to breathe then it can do it on its own but I'm not going to participate See what happens
Of course the body will have to breathe
Give it a chance to be unmeddled with for a while
Then you watch what an unmeddled breath is like until you get a sense for it
Sometimes the issue centers on how far you can get the mind to settle down
Given the level of concentration given the level of mindfulness you have maybe you can only settle it down a little bit for the time being and yet you want more
It's not good enough especially if you've had better meditations in the past
The current meditation isn't measuring up so you try to push push push it back to where it was
Sometimes you can sometimes you can't because the pushing may be part of the problem
Or if you've been away from the practice for a while the level of sensitivity in the mind is not what it was particularly your sensitivity to what you're doing
When this happens get the mind to settle down at least a little bit and then just stay there for a while  it may not be perfect but it's good enough
Then watch
If you can see yourself causing any form of stress or suffering you can drop it
That will move you to another level of sensitivity and so you stay at that level for a while and then just watch again
So the middleness of the middle way actually means the appropriateness of what you're doing visavis the circumstances you've got
There are no hard and fast rules that you're not allowed to meddle with the breath at all or that you have to be meddling all the time or that you always have to push for greater and greater and greater levels of concentration
Sometimes you have to learn to be satisfied with what you've got
You know the story about the foolish inexperienced cow
She's got a nice meadow with nice water but she looks over to the other mountain and says to herself Gee the grass over there looks pretty good too
I wonder what the water tastes like over there But to get there she has to go down into a ravine
So the foolish inexperienced cow heads down into the ravine but because she's foolish and inexperienced she gets stuck in the ravine
She can't even get back to her original meadow much less to the other side
What this means is that when you find a level of concentration a level of comfort in the breath that seems okay stick with it for a while
See if you can maintain it
Watch it
Don't push too hard to make it any better until you see clearly that there's a level of stress a level of discomfort a level of disturbance that really doesn't have to be there
That's when you can let that disturbance go because the stillness allows you to see
One of the things it allows you to see is precisely what needs adjusting
So the two go together  the doing and the watching  and there has to be a balance between the two
It's like walking
The easy way to walk is first with one foot and then with the other
That's a lot easier than trying to hop along just on your right foot or just on your left
This is what keeps the path on the middle finding the balance between the two  balance not so much in the sense of a little bit of effort and a little bit of watching but knowing when which one is appropriate because you've got to have both
Sometimes you need more of one than the other like the balance that swings back and forth before it comes to a perfect balance
As Ajaan Chaa once said we're groping our way in the practice
We like to think that we have the whole thing mapped out ahead of us but if we knew the map entirely and if our map were entirely perfect we'd already be at the end of the path
The map we have is just a sketch and we have to feel our way
Your willingness to feel your way to learn from your mistakes is what develops your wisdom develops your discernment
Sometimes it's a little chastening to see how little wisdom and discernment you have but what are you going to do
You make use of what you've got
There's no way you can get more without using what you've got
It's like going down to the gym
You want to go to the gym to get exercise but you feel embarrassed because your body is so weak and everybody else is so fit and strong
But if you're embarrassed you never get down there to work out
So you take the body you've got and you exercise that
Only then will it turn into the body you want
In the same way if you only have a little bit of discernment and a little bit of concentration make use of what you've got
Only when you make use of these things will they grow
Be content with what you've got  content not in the sense that you're going to stay here forever but content with the fact that these are your raw materials these are the tools you have
You want big muscles but you've only got little muscles
You can't wait until your muscles are big and then exercise
You exercise the little muscles you've got
That's where big muscles come from
You've got to start where you are
And being very clear about what you've got is a lot of what you learn as you practice
There are times when the practice is intended to throw you up against situations where you come to the end of your rope where you have to use your ingenuity to figure out what you should do next
As Ajaan Fuang said if everything were handed to you on a platter you'd never develop discernment at all
It's by testing it and admitting mistakes learning from your mistakes getting clearer and clearer about exactly you've got here That's how the path opens up
The Buddha described nibbana as being immediately present sanditthiko  right here in the here and now  but remember that time right after he gained Awakening where he reflected on whether he could teach or not
He was discouraged because nibbana was so subtle
He wondered how he could ever teach anybody how anyone could learn what he had to teach
But he realized that people could be led to it step by step
This is why our path is a gradual one a stepbystep path as we become more and more sensitive to what we're doing more sensitive to the results so that gradually we become more and more sensitive to what's actually right here
And it's in working with this issue  the middleness of the path what's appropriate right now in terms of our concentration in terms of staying with something in terms of pushing a little bit more That's how we get more and more sensitive to what's going on right here
In pursuing the middleness of the path we develop our discernment
And remember a lot of discernment is seeing how foolish you've been because that's the only way you're going to get wise
So the image of the path is of the continental shelf off the coast of India a long gradual slope followed by a sudden dropoff
We all like the idea of the sudden dropoff  the momentary insight that reveals everything in a flash  but you can't get to the dropoff without following the gradual slope of getting more and more subtle in your sensitivity
And a lot of the subtlety lies in seeing just where the middleness of the middle path lies
The Buddha had a very active sense of the truth
True things on the conditioned level he said don't exist in isolation they're part of a causal chain
They come from previous and coexisting conditions and they affect conditions that come after them or together with them
And as for the truths we talk about the truths that can be taught those are active too
They have an impact on the person who talks about them and on the person who listens they lead to certain kinds of actions
Because of this the Buddha said that something that was false could not be useful in the genuine sense of the term
There's a passage where he talks about different kinds of speech speech that's true but not useful speech that's true and useful
And then there's the question of whether people like to hear it or not
But there's no category for things that are useful and false
What this means is that if you want to find a truth one way of testing it is to see the impact it has
If it's genuinely useful then it's a truth
And this is why the Buddha said that his teachings should be put to the test because this is how you can know if they're true by seeing what impact they have on your behavior
If you take a teaching and put it into practice what does it do
What do you do
And what are the results of what you do
If you find the results really do have a good impact on the mind  that's a truth
For instance the teachings on karma They ask you to accept four things There really is such a thing as an action that's done this is not an illusion it's not unreal
We are responsible for our actions
In particular there's a mental event an intention informed by views that causes those actions
The action has an effect
And the quality of the effect is determined by the quality of the mind state causing the action
The Buddha's proof for these principles is What happens when you put them into action
What difference will they make
Well think of what would happen if you didn't believe these things if you felt that your acts didn't really matter that they really weren't true that the idea of a good or a bad action was somehow a fiction Imagine the way you'd act
Or if you felt that you could do something but then hope for some higher being to come along and forgive you and erase the results of that action How would you act then
If you believe in the principle of action then you're going to be very careful about what you do
You're going to check the results
Any mistake you make you can take as a lesson  a mistake here being that you've harmed either yourself or the people around you
That's the way the teaching is tested and put into effect
And you can see the effect
It does have a good impact on the way you act
You become more and more skillful create less and less suffering for yourself and others
That's how the Buddha proves the principle of action proves the principle of karma
He doesn't cite his own memories of previous lifetimes or proof that someone can have a consciousness that goes from one life to the next and then remember what had happened in previous lifetimes
That's not the proof
When people say that all the Buddha's teachings have to be proved in an empirical way they usually use this as an argument against the principle of karma against the principle of rebirth
Most people can't remember their past lifetimes therefore they can't prove the teaching therefore it's not a relevant teaching maybe not even Buddhist
That's the line of reasoning
But that kind of empirical proof is not what the Buddha had in mind
His proof is more pragmatic Take a teaching put it into effect and see what results you get
If you get good results that's a true teaching
But he also has room for what he calls individual truths versus noble truths
Sometimes you hear that the Buddha taught two levels of truth but the only time he makes a distinction between two types of truth is this one things that are true for you individually and things that are true for everybody across the board
That's one of the meanings of noble standard universal all across the board
As we're meditating we're trying to sort through the things that are true for us individually so that ultimately we can get to noble truths things that are true across the board
You find that when you meditate  you focus on your breath like this or that  it works it gets good results
In the beginning you're dealing for the most part with individual truths because sometimes a particular focus or a particular way of conceiving the breath is going to work for one session  in other words it works for a particular problem  and the next time you sit down and meditate it doesn't
That's because you've got a different problem
The old approach may have been true for that particular problem but new problems pop up time and again
You have to take note of what you learn from each session of sitting or walking meditation and then test it the next time around
If it doesn't work the second time around you can chalk it up either to the fact that you weren't observing carefully the first time  there were things that you missed  or that it was a solution to a different problem not the problem you're facing now
In this way you begin to build up your body of knowledge your body of individual truths
But if you work with them skillfully you find that they head more and more toward the noble truths
You learn to sort things out in terms of stress and its cause the path leading to the end of stress and the actual ending of stress
It's when you hit that last one which is formally the third noble truth That's when you know you've hit the noble truths as a whole
You've understood them properly you've performed the right tasks appropriate to each
Even these truths are active truths
Stress is something the Buddha says to comprehend
Normally we want to run away from it or push it away but the Buddha says that you've got to comprehend it
If you don't comprehend it you can't get past it
It's like that riddle of the Sphinx The Sphinx stands across the road with a riddle anyone who comes up and can't answer the Sphinx's riddle gets eaten up
If you can answer the riddle you get past
It's the same with stress You've got to be able to answer the riddle of stress so that you can get past it
As the Buddha said our normal reaction to stress and pain is one bewilderment and two a search for a way out
The only way to get beyond your bewilderment is to sit and watch the stress
And the only way you can do that is to put the mind in a position where it doesn't feel threatened by the stress
That's what the path is for  and particularly the heart of the path Right Concentration putting the mind in a state of ease even rapture focused on one thing
This gives the mind a sense of power a sense of safe haven a safe place to go
When you have this sense of safe haven you can begin to probe into things that you'd normally be afraid of
To make another comparison it's like fighting a dragon
If you know you have good strong armor and the dragon's breath can't burn you then you can get in close to the dragon and find its weak point
This is why concentration is such an important part of the path
It puts you in a position of strength where you can get intimate with the pain and yet not be anxious
It gives you a sense of confidence that when things get difficult you don't have to worry
This is one of the reasons why the forest ajaans recommend going out into the wilderness for when you get out there all kinds of things can happen
If you sit there worrying about them you can't stay
You end up running back
But if you have your wits about you then you can get the mind into a state of concentration so that it doesn't fixate on all the dangers and problems of being in the wilderness
So that's one level of problem that concentration can help you overcome your fears
Second when difficult things actually happen you find that you can withstand them with your concentration
There's a great passage in the Theragatha where the monk is reflecting on the fact that he's in some pretty bad pain he's really sick
What are you going to do he asks himself
There's no medicine no doctor and nobody around to help
As you stay here in the grove what are you going to do  are you going to run away No he answers I'm going stay here and I'm going to focus on the four frames of reference and the seven factors for Awakening
That'll be the mind's protection
In other words he realizes that his safety lies in looking after the mind
You look after the body to the extent that you can but then you have to realize that this is a dying body
It's like those cars made with planned obsolescence  it's designed to fall apart at some point
There comes a time when no matter how much you worry about it how much you try to fight off death the body's still going to go on its own
Your only safety lies in developing these qualities of mind
Sometimes the power of mind can actually heal the body
But there will come times when it can't
Still at that point it doesn't matter when the powers of the mind are really strong
So this is why concentration is something you want to develop
Again sometimes you hear that when you're meditating being mindful and a good strong state of concentration comes along you have to be wary of getting attached to the concentration so just let it come let it go
And somehow in that way you transcend the attachment
Well that's not what the Buddha taught
Concentration is to be developed
You take time you work at it
Even if it involves a certain amount of attachment it's attachment to a good thing
It's like holding on to the rungs of a ladder You don't want to let go of one rung unless you've got your hand on another rung or you've finally reached the roof
That's when you can get off the ladder totally and you're safe on the roof
As Ajaan Fuang once said don't be afraid of getting attached to a state of concentration be afraid that you won't get to the concentration or that you won't be able to maintain it
Once you're there once you're attached to it then you can work on the attachment
So the path is nothing to be feared  after all the Buddha said the pleasure of concentration is nothing to be feared
It's something to be developed
This is how you prove the truth of his teachings
You work with them and you find that they really do lead to the end of suffering
That's when you've got your proof
Up to that point things haven't yet been proven
They haven't gone beyond the level of linguistic convention
Certain things will give you a sense of confidence  you see results here and there  but only when things open up to the Deathless will you have your proof
You've seen suffering stop and nobody can say that you haven't
That's when you know for sure that what the Buddha taught was true There is a Deathless and it can be attained through human effort
But the teachings require that you too be true
You have to be honest in your effort
When your effort doesn't measure up to what the Buddha taught you can't say that you've proven his teachings false
You've simply chipped away at them a little bit but you haven't done enough yet to prove them one way or the other
Be honest with yourself  that's how you can really test the path
In other words as Ajaan Lee once said to know the truth of the Buddha's teaching you have to be true too  true in the active sense not just knowing true things but true in your actions
And the proof of your truth comes when you hit the Deathless
That's when you know that you can rely on yourself
As the Buddha said those who have reached the stream in this way will never intentionally do anything wrong because they've seen the principle of action the truth of action and the action of truth
And they'll never intentionally be false again
The Canon tells us that the Buddha's contemporaries fell into two main camps what you might call absolutists and relativists
The absolutists were the ones who had a theory about the nature of reality saying that their theory was true and everything else was false
The world is made out of atoms That's one of their theories
Or The world is infinite The world is not infinite The world is eternal The world is not eternal a long list of views about the world outside
And what those views usually come down to is that it's impossible for human action to have any real impact on things because the nature of the world is fixed
At the other extreme are the relativists those who hold that what you say about reality all depends on how you look at things or who refuse to take any stance at all
Their stance if you follow it to its logical conclusion makes it impossible to do anything either because if the world is totally chaotic totally random  nothing is really set nothing is really for certain  what are you going to do
Just muddle around
Some of them advised grabbing whatever pleasure you can because there's no telling what's going to happen the next moment the next day down the line
Just now we chanted the Buddha's first sermon and you notice that he doesn't start out with either an absolutist or a relativist stance
He's talking about courses of action
He says that if you do this these are the results
If you indulge in sensuality these are the results
If you indulge in selfmortification those are the results and neither gets any really good results
However he said there is a middle path and it's not a path worked out by reasoning through or applying logic
It was arrived at simply by trying different paths and seeing what worked
He said this middle path is the path that leads to really desirable results the end of suffering
It gives rise to vision gives rise to knowledge brings about peace knowledge nibbana
So that's what makes the Buddha's teaching special He had found a path of action
That's what's worth talking about looking at which paths of action lead to suffering which ones lead to the end of suffering and then following the one that leads to the end of suffering whether you like the path or not
There's a poem in China attributed to the third patriarch which starts out saying that the great way is not hard for those with no preferences
I don't know what the third patriarch had in mind when he said that but if you apply it to the Buddha's approach the only way to make sense of it is this You do what has to be done whether you like it or not
There's a sutta where the Buddha defines wisdom and discernment in terms of how you handle four courses of action
The first two are the things you like to do that give good results and the things you don't like to do that give bad results
Those two are not hard
They're nobrainers
You avoid the things that you don't like and give bad results and you do the things you like to do and give good results
It's all very easy
The difficult issues and the ones that really test your discernment are the next two courses of action the things you like to do that give bad results and things you don't like to do that give good results
That's where your preferences get in the way
That's where your preferences make it hard
So you have to learn how to look past your preferences because there are times when the path really does require a lot of effort
You may say to yourself I don't want to do this I don't like this and you wriggle around and find all kinds of excuses but in the end what happens
You don't get the results you want because you've made it hard for yourself
Sometimes you have the other attitude  the macho attitude  and yet there are aspects of the path that require just watching being very patient very still
Your macho side may not like that
As for the things you like to do you say I don't see what's wrong with this You make all kinds of excuses and again in the end you don't get the results you want
This is one of those areas where each person has to develop his or her own discernment How are you going to get past your preferences
The only way is to look at the situation and to try out various things to see what works
When you find what works then whether you like it or not you follow it
If your preferences complain figure out ways of dealing with them to put them aside
Discernment doesn't mean just seeing the right course of action it also involves mastering the right way to put your preferences aside
Remind yourself that your preferences have gotten in the way have gummed up the works for a long long time
How much longer are you going to side with them
And how do you put them aside
Learn to observe them and see how they arise and pass away
See how they're notself that you don't have to identify with them
When you see something and a sense of liking or a disliking arises you don't have to get involved
When the liking and disliking have nobody to play with they go away
It's like that other Zen conundrum the sound of one hand
When the liking comes up and you don't respond That's the sound of one hand
Once you get down to doing what simply has to be done the path gets a lot easier
In other words you're not adding difficulties on top of it
If you don't make it unnecessarily difficult it's pretty manageable
Look at the elements of the path It doesn't contain anything superhuman anything that requires you to exhaust yourself
In fact a lot of the path lies in learning how to husband your energy so that you don't waste it on unskillful things
When you don't waste it on unskillful things you've got extra energy for the skillful ones
So on the days when the situation really does require that you sit for a long period of time to work through a difficult issue you've got the energy to draw on because you didn't fritter it away with trivial pursuits
In particular you haven't frittered it away trying to justify your preferences
This is the way life is It's going to present you with difficult situations many many times whether you want them or not
If you can put yourself in the mood where you're up for whatever arises things are lot easier
The day is going to come when your death is going to stare you right in your face and of course most people don't want that
They run away and they try to wiggle out of it in all kinds of ways yet the more they wiggle the worse things get
But if you've been following the path with no regard for your preferences then when death comes you can tell yourself This is what I've been practicing for all this time so let's do it right this time Memories of your life will start arising at that point and you'll see things you're going to miss things you regret having done
You can't let yourself get involved with those things for they make things harder
This is why we sit here pulling the mind away from its distractions
When you die there are going to be monstrous distractions and they're going to pull you strongly in their direction right when you're at your weakest
If you simply give in to them it's going to have a major impact on how your rebirth is going to go
If you can maintain your calm center in the midst of whatever comes up things will be a lot easier
Bad things will come up good things will come up so you'll want to maintain your center
Don't get excited by the good things
Don't get upset by the bad
It sounds like meditation instructions but it's also death instructions how to die properly
Death is easy for those with no preferences  and one aspect of this great way we're practicing here is getting ready for that fact
Life of course is a lot easier if you have no preferences too
This doesn't mean that you don't have any goals or desires at all simply that you do what has to be done
If when you sit down your mind is a mess you don't say Well today is a bad day to meditate I'm going to wait until some other time You learn how to sit with a mind that's a mess and begin to see the little threads of the possibility of finding some peace in the midst of the mess
When you can do that you've learned a really important lesson a much more important lesson than if you say Well things are bad so I'm just not going to tackle them That doesn't teach you any lessons at all
The mind may not settle down as much as you'd like but at least you've learned some important skills in how to deal with difficult situations
You may think I don't want a difficult situation right now but there it is
What are you going to do
You do your best
And you figure out what is the best you can do given the situation
Then there are the times when things are easy
The mind settles down quickly and is very still and the mind says Okay what's next
Let's move on to insight Well maybe you have to get your concentration solidified before you're really ready to develop insight
There are many many examples of people who've gotten a little bit of stillness and wanted to jump straight for insight and end up jumping right off the cliff
So wherever you are on the path you do what has to be done
Don't let your preferences get in the way
When you can manage that then it's not a question of being easy or difficult You just do what has to be done
When you develop that attitude  that you're willing to do what has to be done  you get the results you want
And sometimes the results are better than what you could have ever thought of wanting
The Buddha once said that one of the prerequisites for concentration is a sense of comfort ease and wellbeing  both physical and mental
One of the reasons we recite those chants on goodwill compassion appreciation and equanimity is to create a sense of wellbeing in the mind
Thoughts of goodwill are good thoughts to think
They feel good
They put the mind at ease
You don't have to struggle with anybody
You don't have to settle any old scores
It feels good to be thinking good thoughts
It helps put you in the right mood to meditate
Physically you work first with your posture
You want to sit straight
You don't want to lean over or sit hunched over
Keep your back straight  comfortably straight
Then you work with the breath
Does the breath feel good
Notice where exactly you feel the breath  which parts of the body have sensations that let you know that now the breath is coming in now the breath is going out
How do those sensations feel
Are they tight restricted
If they are think of their loosening up a little bit
Or do they get tight at a particular spot in the breath cycle
You may want to shorten the breath or lengthen it
Approach this as you would any skill
You learn from your mistakes
One of the first things you learn as you work with the breath is that you're clumsy
You tend to put too much pressure on it
You approach it with an attitude that's too controlling or too tight
But that doesn't mean you should stop working with the breath
It's like the first time you sit down to play the piano
You sit down and realize you can't play Beethoven
There are three ways of reacting to that
One is to get up and never touch the piano again
Another is to keep playing '  the John Cage piece where you just sit at the piano and don't do anything at all
And the other is to keep practicing starting with simple pieces
Learn to listen to your playing see what you can improve and gradually get better and better until you can play Beethoven
This is how piano playing becomes a skill
This is how any skill gets developed
You explore that boundary line between what you can control and what you can't
The way to explore it is by poking here adjusting there knowing that you probably will make some mistakes but not getting too worried about it because you learn from your mistakes
Over time you get more and more sensitive to exactly how much control is too much how much is too little and you develop a wide range of techniques
When there's pain in the body what's the best way to breathe
When you're tired what's the best way to breathe
When you're tense what's the best way to breathe
These are things you can explore
The whole point of this is that in the course of doing these things you develop your own sensitivity as to what works and what doesn't
Your standards for what works and what doesn't get more refined
This is how discernment gets developed in the practice
It's not a matter of reading a few books getting a few ideas and then cloning your mind to those ideas so that you see things as they're described in the books
That's not discernment
It's just adding one more layer of perceptions on top of the layers you already have
Discernment comes from your ability to see the mind in action and to be sensitive as to when the mind's actions are giving good results and when they aren't
You have to be your own judge
In other words instead of throwing all the responsibility onto the texts or onto the teachers you take on the job of learning to be a good judge of your actions
Ajaan Fuang once said that meditators tend to be like little puppies
They go out and defecate and then come running to their mothers to have their mothers lick them off
They haven't learned how to lick themselves off yet
So as a meditator you need to learn how to lick yourself off
If things don't go well learn how to pick yourself up dust yourself off and then figure out what went wrong
Take responsibility for your meditation
Take responsibility for your insights
This is what the Buddha did
This is what every meditator has to do
If you go to a teacher saying you've had a certain experience and the teacher identifies it as a level of jhana or a level of insight can you be sure
Do you really want to hand those judgments over to somebody else
Or do you want to learn how to judge things on your own so that you can trust yourself
If you let the other people do the judging there's always going to be an element of doubt Do they know what they're saying
At the same time you're absolving yourself of any responsibility
Discernment becomes their duty and not yours
That's not a good attitude for a meditator to take
You've got to learn to look to try a few things
For instance what is it like just to let the breath come in and out on its own
What is it going to do
Figure out how to watch it
Then figure out how to nudge it what to think in order to make it more comfortable
Then figure out how to judge the results
This is how discernment is developed how meditation becomes a skill
As it becomes more and more of a skill you become more sensitive to even the slightest bit of discomfort both in the body and in the mind
That's how you see the four noble truths
You see stress you see how it's caused you connect it to your own actions
You see what you do or don't do that lets the stress be shed away
So think of the meditation as an experiment something you try
You're trying to prove a hypothesis that you can put an end to suffering
Now scientists like to see their hypothesis proved but good scientists are willing to admit when it isn't when the experiment actually proves something else
You chalk it up to experience and you try again
The instructions for breath meditation involve discernment and they also involve training yourself
To train in any skill you need desire  the desire to actually do the practice  and you have to be open and aboveboard about that
Don't try to deny the fact that there's desire
Just learn how to use it skillfully
Then there has to be persistence
You stick with the practice
Try it again and again and again
But persistence is not just a matter of the hours you put in
You also have to be intent to pay very careful attention to what you're doing what the results are
Finally you need to use your intelligence which means using ingenuity and being discerning in what works what doesn't and how you might try to improve on both
These four qualities are called the bases for success
They're essential to any skill
So approach the meditation as a skill
Remember how you learned skills in the past
If it was music or art a sport carpentry whatever How did you go about mastering that skill
A lot of times you made mistakes
You noticed that they were mistakes but you didn't give up
You went back and tried it over again trying to observe what you did wrong what you did right what worked and what didn't
Over time your hands  which originally seemed to be all thumbs  gradually became human hands a carpenter's hands a violinist's hands
And your mind became a craftsman's mind
You reached a point where you didn't have to go running to somebody else to pass judgment on whether you did it right or not
You began to know yourself whether it was right or not
That's when you really mastered the skill
The same principle applies to the breath
We spend so much of our lives being desensitized to the breath energy in the body  how we actually feel the body from within
We've been so intent on learning other things outside that to make room for them we've blocked out this part of our awareness
Now's the time to back up and get more sensitive to this area of your awareness again to see how it feels to see how your perceptions of what the breath does are going to affect how the breath actually flows through the body
Experiment to see how you can work both with the breath and with the perceptions of the breath to make it more comfortable so that you've got that prerequisite for the mind to settle down and get concentrated a sense of ease a sense of wellbeing
The body sitting here seems to have a nice flow of energy throughout
It's not blocked
The blood seems to be flowing through all parts of the body
Your focus isn't interfering with it
You feel good just sitting here
The amount of pressure you put on the present moment is just right not too light not too heavy
That's something that comes with practice
So pay careful attention to what you're doing because that's how you learn
That's how the meditation becomes your own
Very few things in life are certain
Even the thoughts we know to be true To what extent are they really true
If you think of truth as the correspondence between your thought and the thing it represents no thought can be totally true
Each thought is just a sketch
There's no one thought that can comprehend all the many levels of truth out there
Each thought is just an approximation
So the question turns from representation to one of pragmatism To what extent is the approximation useful
It may leave a lot out it may not really encompass the thing but if it serves a purpose the thought is useful
The question then is what's the best purpose for thoughts to serve
That's where you have to look for a truth that's not just a thought something you really can be certain about in and of itself
And there's really only one truth that can pass that test only one truth you really can be certain about and that's when there's suffering and when there's not
You don't have to ask
If you experience it you know
And right there is where the Buddha staked all of his teachings suffering arising suffering passing away
Everything else he taught is arranged around that even Right View It's right to the extent that it helps put an end to suffering
Your thoughts are skillful or unskillful your words and your deeds are skillful and unskillful depending on the extent to which they put an end to suffering
So always keep this principle in mind as thoughts come in and out of your mind
You may have heard that the Buddha taught say that there is no self
To what extent is the nonself teaching skillful
Where is it not skillful
Those are the questions he would have you look at not the question of whether there is or is not a self
There are a lot of things that could be true but this may not be the right time to think about those things
The Buddha has a teaching on Right Speech where he says that speech can be true or not true beneficial or not beneficial welcome or unwelcome
He said to speak only those things that are true and beneficial
And as for the question of whether they're welcome or not welcome he said look for the right time and place to speak
The same principle applies to our thoughts
There's a time and a place for different types of thinking
There are times when having a strong sense of self is very useful very beneficial and other times when it's precisely the thing that gets in the way
The question is How do you know And the answer is Through trial and error  something we don't like to hear
We'd like to have a nice formula set out
Sometimes the Buddha does set out a formula for us but in many areas he doesn't precisely because it's more important for us to gain our own sensitivity to our thoughts and their results
When you think something what happens as a result
And particularly to what extent does it cause stress
That's what you've got to look into and that's why we're meditating here to get a greater sense of sensitivity as to what's causing stress in our minds to see how it's not necessary to see how we can let go of the cause
Then when there seems to be relief keep watching it for a while because there may still be some stress in there
The Buddha maps things out in terms of levels of stress
Even in the practice of Right Concentration there are levels of stress
Just because the mind seems still doesn't mean that the job is done
Even when there's a great sense of luminosity or of allencompassing awareness the job may not be over
You've got to learn how to keep looking
I've known some people who've been through the sort of education that aims at fostering self esteem and the problem with that is that it fosters complacency
It teaches them not to learn how to judge the results of their actions
Everything they do is supposed to be good a cause for self esteem and yet they may be doing a lot of harm
So the important thing is for them to learn how to be sensitive to the harm that comes from their thoughts words and deeds
This applies not only outwardly but also inwardly in the practice of meditation
When you do something look for the results
When you say something look for the results
When you think something look for the results
When you work with the breath look for the results
Breath training is an especially good way to learn how to be sensitive to the results of your thinking
There are different ways of focusing on the breath different ways of conceiving the breath different ways of dealing with the hindrances
And your job is to learn how to be sensitive to the results of those ways to figure out which way of focusing is right for right now which way of thinking is right for right now which way of being still is right for right now
There are some guidelines but the most important thing is to learn how to judge for yourself for without that sensitivity there's no way you're going to see the really subtle levels of stress in the mind
This is where and why we have to be observant
When the Buddha talks about developing mindfulness and concentration he places a lot of emphasis on alertness
In the few places where he actually defines alertness he points to being alert to what you're doing
In the body when you move your hand be alert to the fact that you're moving your hand
When you look left look right be alert to the fact that you're looking left looking right
Then moving into the mind When there are feelings be alert to what you're doing in the feeling in the perception in the thought fabrication in the consciousness
Each of these things contains an element of fabrication an element of present intention
Do you ever notice that
Do you see it happening
If you can't yet see it happening look at what you can see that you're adding to the present moment
And be sensitive at the same time to any sense of stress there
See what you can do to minimize the stress for only when you learn how to minimize the stress that you can see do you start becoming sensitive to the subtler levels
In this way you learn how to be a connoisseur of your actions and particularly a connoisseur of actions and events in the mind
A connoisseur of food has to develop a very refined palate a connoisseur of music a very refined ear
What you're trying to do is to develop a refined sensitivity to what's going on in the mind
This requires a whole cluster of mature attitudes concerning how you respond when you do things right when you do things wrong so that you can learn from when you've done things right and done things wrong
If you get depressed over a mistake that's unskillful
Notice that
If you get careless after doing something right notice that as well
The Buddha doesn't tell you not to take pride in being skillful
Actually a sense of pride a sense of satisfaction when you've done something right is an important inducement in the path
It gives you the juice you need to keep going
But you've got to be sensitive to when and where that sense of pride turns into carelessness
The same when you do things wrong You have to recognize when you've made a mistake but you can't let that recognition become debilitating
Again learn to be sensitive to the spot where the recognition of a mistake leads to unskillful reactions and learn to cut it off at the pass
As you get more sensitive to the results of your actions and to the alternatives open to you you don't have to follow through on unskillful patterns of thought
As the Buddha said if you had to stick with the patterns or habits you already have there would be no sense in teaching you
It wouldn't do any good
He says it's because people can learn to be more skillful That's why he taught
So learn to be alert to what you're doing alert to the results of what you're doing
Even a simple thing like focusing on the breath is an important way to develop your powers of alertness your powers of evaluation and judgment
Learn to be a connoisseur of your breathing and then a connoisseur of the thinking that goes around the breath
That's when you find yourself arriving at something really certain even more certain than the arising and passing away of suffering
It's the total ending of suffering
That's when you know for sure that you've done things right
There's nothing more certain than that
What have you got here in the present moment
You've got the body you've got the breath you've got thoughts and you've got your awareness
But you're also carrying a lot of habits
In fact this is the main issue in the meditation
If you didn't have certain habits of perception you wouldn't be creating suffering for yourself right now
You may not seem to be suffering much but there's always some stress that you're creating through a lack of skill
And this is precisely what we're trying to uncover as we meditate
Some of the baggage you're bringing into the present moment consists of issues you've picked up in the course of the day things this person said that person did things you yourself said or did
In some cases it's as if you've been a garbage collector gathering up the day's trash
If you're going to get any peace in the next hour you've got to throw it out
But the issues also go deeper than that
If that were the only issue you could go off and live alone where you wouldn't have to interact with people and that would be the end of the problem
But it's not the end of the problem
When you go off to live by yourself the habits of the mind start looming even larger
The less contact you have with people the more likely your habits are to go out of bounds
You can get into some really weird feedback loops when you're living alone
So the Buddha sets out maps he sets out instructions for how to cut through those feedback loops and to understand how your perceptions shape things in a way that brings suffering
He also shows you how to perceive things in a new way that will end those habits and cut through that suffering so that ultimately when there's a perception of the breath or any of the sensory input you have in the present moment there's no suffering added on
The input is the only disturbance you have
There's no greed anger or delusion to muck up the works
As the Buddha said the problem all comes down to ignorance
Ignorance of what
Ignorance of the four noble truths  and he's not talking about not having read about the four noble truths
All of us here have read about them and thought about them
Ignorance means not seeing things in terms of the four noble truths
We see things in other terms the big ones being our sense of self our sense of the things that belong to us and our sense of the reality of the world out there  what exists what doesn't exist out there
Once we place our faith in these perceptions we become a slave to them
Our idea of objective reality places a lot of imperatives on us
Our idea of who we are places a lot of imperatives on us and these are the imperatives that make us suffer
So the Buddha teaches us to learn how to question those perceptions
There's a passage where he talks about how people are a slave to a duality or a polarity between existence and nonexistence Does the world out there really exist
Does it not really exist
He advises learning how to avoid that polarity by simply watching things arising and passing away in the present moment
Stay just at that level and don't get involved in the question of whether there's anything lying behind the mere experience of arising and passing away
And the best way to do that is to give yourself a framework
This is what the four establishings of mindfulness or four frames of reference are all about giving yourself a framework so that you're not blown away by the events of the world
See things within the frame of body feelings mind states or mental qualities in and of themselves
Make those your frames of reference  as when you're dealing with the breath right now just the breath coming in going out
In this context thoughts have meaning only to the extent that they pull you away from the breath or don't pull you away from the breath
While you're sitting here ideally that's the only question how the thoughts impinge on the breath
Thoughts that are useful in keeping you with the breath are the ones you want to encourage
Thoughts that pull you away you want to let go
In the Buddha's words you abandon greed and distress with reference to the world  the world here being the world of the senses
Only when you abandon greed and distress with reference to these things can you look at how they're directly experienced
See how sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations are experienced right here in the present moment in and of themselves
If you can watch these things arising and passing away simply in and of themselves the whole issue of what exists out there or what doesn't exist out there gets put aside
As you watch things arise the idea that there's nothing out there doesn't occur to you
As you watch them pass away the idea that there's something out there permanent lasting existing independently of you doesn't occur to you either
You see that the issues of existence and nonexistence matter only if you make them an issue
The Buddha's not saying that things do or don't exist out there it's just that in this mental state the issue doesn't occur to you
This is the mental state you want to develop because all that's left is simply the issue of the arising and passing away of stress and suffering
That gets you right in line with the four noble truths and their imperatives the imperative to comprehend suffering abandon its cause realize its cessation and develop the path leading to its cessation
These imperatives unlike those of the world are liberating which is why you want to take them on
The first one is to comprehend suffering so that you can begin to see what you're doing to give rise to the suffering
This is what focuses you on the real job at hand
You start seeing the fabrication of worlds in the mind realizing that the world as you perceive it out there is really your own mental construct
You have lots of different mental constructs about the world out there
Sometimes you think about the world in geological terms sometimes in cosmic astronomical terms sometimes simply in terms of your own personal narrative day to day
There are many different levels that are useful for different purposes
You want to put yourself in the state of mind where you can choose which view of the world is useful right here right now so you're not a slave to the imperatives that these different views put on you
The same with your notion of self Is there a self
Is there no self
The Buddha says Don't ask So much of our life depends on the idea of who we are
If you really look at the arising and passing away of your sense of self seeing how it's a construct just the way your sense of the world is a construct then you're in a much better position
You can use different ideas of the self to function in different ways and then drop them when they're no longer useful
But all this is possible only if you keep in mind as your basic framework the question of what gives rise to suffering what kind of action doesn't give rise to suffering or what kind of action leads you to the end of suffering  the basic framework of the four noble truths seeing your experience in those terms rather than in terms of the world or the self
Then you can see the activities that you do  the fabrications you make bodily verbal and mental  simply as strategies useful or not skillful or not in line with the imperatives of those four truths
And that's liberating
On the one hand you find that you can function a lot more skillfully as you open up to the idea that there might be more courses of action open to you than you had imagined
If you have a very definite idea of who you are or the type of person you are you place limits on what you can do
If you have very fixed ideas about the world out there that too limits what you can do in terms of putting an end to suffering and stress
So what we're trying to do as we meditate here is give ourselves the frame of reference from which we can call into question our habitual ideas of the world our habitual ideas of the self to see how both of them are fabrications made out of the way we look at things the way we attend to things the way we perceive things
Similarly with the intentions that are based on those ways of looking at the world looking at the self We can start calling them into question looking for alternatives testing alternatives with the overriding concern of seeing what we can do to put an end to all the stress and suffering we're causing through our unskillful intentions
As you look at your experience in these terms  the constant questioning of what you're doing and what results you're getting out of what you do  you can open yourself to whole new dimensions inside
You can use your ingenuity to figure out new ways of acting new ways of interacting with your perceptions of the world new ways of interacting with your perceptions of self that free you from the stress and suffering that deep down inside you think are a necessary part of being a human being
This is so much of what the Buddha's teaching is about freeing you from your own selfimposed limitations
Think of all those people who told young Prince Siddhartha that there was no way he could put an end to suffering
The best people in the history of the world have all suffered in this way they said so who are you to say that it's not necessary Still the prince said there must be some other way
He had the ability to imagine that there would be another way and the guts to devote his life to finding if it were true
And finally he found that yes what he conceived as a possibility wasn't just a leap of the imagination
It was an actuality
This opened a vast new range of possibilities  for the whole human race  of what a human being can do
Take for instance his analysis of the four types of action
Most people would only think of the first three things that give rise to good results within the normal course of the world things that give rise to bad things that give rise to mixed results
But the Buddha found that there was another kind of action that leads to the end of action to the end of suffering
That was his great discovery
Notice it was a kind of action he discovered based on certain views based on certain perceptions based on certain ways of looking at experience and then following through in line with them
So as we're practicing meditation remember that perception and attention  the way we perceive things the questions we ask about the things we perceive  are the two main issues we have to focus on
This is one of the reasons we put so much emphasis on concentration for the levels of concentration are perception attainments
Can you hold onto a particular perception so that the mind can really settle there
See what it does to your experience
When you stick with the perception of the breath as filling the body what does that do to the physical sense of the breath
When you perceive the breath as being able to come in and out of the body anywhere at all what does that do
What effect does it have on the mind
When you get to the formless perceptions such as infinite space What in the realm of your experience right here corresponds to infinite space infinite consciousness nothingness neither perception nor nonperception
We investigate these things to see the power of perception so that ultimately we can let it go
So this is a very important thing to focus on as you meditate and as you go through the course of the day how you perceive things
You can begin with simply how you perceive your interactions with other people
Notice how much of your perception of the situation is just that your perception
We talk about the garbage we collect in the course of the day How much of that garbage is selfproduced
To put it really crudely how much of it is just your own shit that you're carrying around
This is not to say that other people aren't behaving in evil outrageous or horrible ways
There are people like that in the world but if your peace of mind were totally dependent on everybody else's behaving themselves you'd be their slave
You'd never get free
But as the Buddha said the whole issue of suffering is something we can overcome through our own efforts
This means that we have to look at the suffering we create for ourselves
As for what other people are doing that's their responsibility
It doesn't have to impinge on us
And as for the baggage we carry around If we had to go back and straighten out all the horrible things we did in the past before we could gain Awakening we'd never be done
But it turns out that when you simply learn to drop old habits Awakening is possible
After all the suffering you're experiencing right now is a combination of things coming from the past and things you're doing right now including the way you're perceiving things right now
A frequent image in meditation instructions is that all you have to do is turn on a light and the darkness goes away
No matter how many eons the darkness has reigned all you have to do is turn on the light once and that's the end of the darkness
All you have to do is work on how you're perceiving things in the present moment and when things finally click you don't have to worry about what other people tell you you don't have to worry about the world you don't have to worry about the self you don't have to worry about what you've done in the past for you've learned a new habit you've developed a new skill
And the development of that new skill changes everything
One of the things you notice in meditation as you start looking at your thoughts looking at your feelings looking at sensory input is that the solidity of your world starts dissolving away  both your sense of the world outside and your sense of yourself inside
And in some cases just that much feels liberating  free from the heavy burdens you normally carry around
You begin to see that the heaviness is something you yourself have invested these things with
But that lack of solidity is not total liberation
The reason we want to let things seem less solid in this way is so that we can see patterns we'd otherwise miss
You notice that when the Buddha summarizes the essence of his Awakening  at least the part that's worth teaching worth passing on  he focuses on the principle of causality the connection between things
In particular he focuses on the connections between what he calls name and form on one hand and consciousness on the other
Starting with this connection he points out how suffering is built on top of it
The important elements of name and form are contact and intention
The way you regard the contact is another element of name and form called attention
But here contact means not only contact at the senses but also contact among different things going on the in mind
From that kind of contact you make choices you make up your mind you want to do this you want to do that
You have an intention that leads to actions
The Buddha wants you to see this
This is the process of fabrication
This is how we create our worlds how we create our sense of self
And he wants you to look at it directly as it's happening
The reason we don't see it is because we divide things up into things that exist things that don't exist our self and what lies outside of our self
This set of distinctions tends to point our attention away from what we're directly experiencing
The things we experience Do they really exist
Do they not exist
In other words is there something lying behind them
Is there nothing lying behind them
This kind of questioning pulls our attention away from what we're experiencing to focus on what we assume is either out there behind it or not out there behind it
We find ourselves placing our trust in things we don't even see can't even experience
The same with the distinction between self and things outside ourselves When something is inside of our self we don't observe it very well
We identify with it
It's like putting your foot into a shoe Your foot starts getting shaped by the shoe without your really noticing it
As for things outside of yourself you're not really responsible for them
They don't matter so much
That's your attitude
So both of these ways of looking at things pull your attention away from what the Buddha said is the real issue how your intentions give rise to suffering how the process of fabrication gives rise to suffering
He wants you to look at these things as a process so that you can understand the patterns
The first step is to see what kinds of fabrication are blatantly unskillful so that you can learn how to drop them
And then as your sensitivity to the idea of skillful and unskillful gets more and more refined you find yourself dropping more and more refined things
Ultimately you can drop the whole process of fabrication altogether
But first we have to start with blatant things
This is why we start with the breath
What kind of breathing is skillful breathing
What kind of breathing is unskillful breathing
What kinds of perceptions are skillful what kinds are unskillful
The breath and the questions about the breath are all elements in the process of fabrication
When you're talking to yourself as you meditate what kind of talking is skillful what kind of talking is not
The meditation points you right to this level and asks you to drop your other levels of analyzing other levels of looking at experience because looking at the process of fabrication as it's happening is where you're going to see what you really need to see
What is the cause what is the effect
Which causes are better than other causes
Which effects are better than other effects
This is why the Buddha's most important teachings are the four noble truths because they point to cause and effect skillful cause and unskillful cause desirable effect and undesirable effect
Simple very basic basic terms pleasure pain ease and stress happiness and suffering
These are things we've known since even before we could verbalize anything but we haven't understood them
So the Buddha is trying to get you to pull the mind down to that preverbal level as much as you can
That becomes your basis for looking at things for mastering the processes of breathing thinking and perceiving so that you can put these processes to the ideal purpose which is finally to go beyond all of them
So try to get to this basic level where you're just looking at the building blocks the very basic basic actions that then get constructed into larger and larger patterns as you're looking at your breath as you're going out and functioning in the world
When you don't have any other duties you can simply watch the process of how the eye and forms meet and then the way you comment on them the way you direct your eyes to look at certain things in certain ways
That's a process too
You want to be able to shift in and out of that mode because if you work in this mode all day long you wouldn't be able to function at work wouldn't be able to get along with people
But if you're good at shifting in and out of these modes dealing on the level of people when you need to dealing on the level of the building blocks when you have the opportunity you learn a lot of interesting lessons about how the mind works where the elements that lead to unskillfulness  lack of mindfulness lack of discernment lack of concentration  come in
You begin to catch them
It's like learning another language
You don't forget your original language it's just that you learn how to function on another level in a new context
And people who become bilingual begin to notice that they have a separate personality in the other language a separate sense of how the world works in the other language
The process of becoming skilled in the other language is a very good lesson in learning how to take things apart in a new way seeing processes as they happen
Then you turn around and you have a new perspective on your original language as well
So we're training the mind here to be multilingual able to function in many different contexts and in particular getting good at this context of simply looking at the processes without worrying about what entities do or don't lie behind them or about which part of the process is you and which part is not
The question here is which activities are skillful and which ones are unskillful
Learn to look at things as activities as events in a causal chain
And this is not just a game of perception because it has a really good purpose release total freedom
That's what you can gain as you learn to look at things simply from the perspective of what leads to what which actions lead to which results
That way you learn to see things that you never before really thought of as actions simply as actions as part of a causal chain
That's one of the things that the Buddha means by the word emptiness You don't load this causal chain down with your preconceived notions or the constructs you tend to build around it
Instead you learn how to see events simply as that as events empty of any other questions that would pull you off in other directions
Everything in life is fabricated
It's all put together
And it doesn't just fall together on its own
A lot of effort goes into putting things together
And because we have to put so much effort into life we want to make sure that our effort is well directed our energy is well spent
Otherwise you can waste whole lifetimes of a lot of effort a lot of hard hard work and have nothing really to show for it
As the Buddha pointed out the best use of our efforts is to find those spots where the whole fabricated system opens out to something unfabricated
Everything else that's fabricated he said to look at as means
Even our intermediate goals along the path are means to a further end so we have to learn to look at them just as that as means
Even our relations with other people should be regarded as means to this higher end
Now this would sound selfish and calculating if it weren't for the fact that our goal is one that gives no harm to anyone at all
Look at those reflections on the four requisites
Just the fact that you're born with a body means that you're a big consumer of food clothing shelter and medicine
So one of the kindest things you can do for anyone is to get yourself out of the system
Think of all the suffering that goes into keeping you fed and clothed and sheltered and making sure your health stays good  all the work from the plants on up the people who have to grow the plants the people who have to buy the plants transport the plants that so you have food to eat
Someone once traced a sweatshirt from Uzbeki cotton through Iranian mills and South Korean factories and finally showing up in a Gap warehouse in Kentucky
And that's just clothing
It goes all over the world a couple of times before it gets to you just to meet your need for protection against the elements
The fact that you have this body means that you're constantly consuming and that a lot of work goes into meeting the body's needs
So the issue is how to get the best use out of the body because someday you're going to have to throw it away
If you don't let go of it nicely it's going to push you out and before you go you'll probably have to put up with disease and all the other problems that come as you begin to lose your grip This part of the body stops functioning that part stops functioning you grow incontinent So you want to learn how to look at the body not as an end in and of itself but as a means as a tool in the practice leading to a happiness beyond the body
If you expect too much happiness simply from having a body you're making unrealistic demands on it
It's the same with relationships
If you're expecting a relationship to provide you with all the happiness you want in the world it's going to be a difficult relationship
Often subconsciously that's the kind of relationship we have with our own bodies
So learn how to look at the body in its true nature so that you're not surprised when it grows ill and does funny things as it grows ill
Once when I was in Thailand I was one of a group of monks visiting a man in the hospital
He had developed liver cancer and didn't know how much longer he was going to live so he wanted to make some merit
That's why we went
Unusually for his generation in Thailand he'd been a fitness freak and had been very proud all the way up through his fifties that he'd stayed slim and trim while all of his friends had gotten paunchy
We talked about how he should meditate but he kept complaining about how ashamed he was that his stomach had bloated up from the liver cancer and that he was no longer in good shape
He couldn't focus his mind on the breath all because he had developed unrealistic expectations about the body's potential for health
But if you learn to expect that the body's going to grow diseased no matter how well you care for it disease is not such a shock or a problem when it actually comes
This is one of the reasons for that contemplation on the parts of the body  to realize there's the potential for all kinds of stuff to happen in the body to realize that that's the body's nature
As long as you latch onto it as yours and develop pride around it if you look at its health as a goal in and of itself  whether through exercise or natural foods or whatever else  you're setting yourself up for a problem
But if you see it simply as a means to a higher end you're in a lot better shape
So when you find the mind growing concerned about the body  and many times it's amazing as your life gets more and more simplified as a meditator how you can get more and more obsessed with the body making sure that it's healthy making sure it's getting the right food and medicines  you have to develop a sense of proportion around those issues so that you can focus on using the body for other things
After all it's one of the foundations of mindfulness one of the frames of reference
You have to learn how to be on friendly terms with it
It's funny We contemplate Filled with all sorts of unclean things and at the same time Be friends with the body But that's an important part of being friends with people being very clear about their shortcomings so you don't demand too much out of them and at the same time gaining a clear sense of where their strengths actually lie
And the body does have a lot of strengths
It's a good place to stay
As long as you're alive you can take it as a frame of reference
As the Buddha said it's one of the ways of creating an island for yourself
As he was about to die he told his monks You can't depend on the Buddha
You can't depend on the person of the Tathagata because like every other person his body is going to have to go So he reminded all of his followers to make themselves an island
He said How do you do that
Take the body in and of itself as your frame of reference ardent alert and mindful putting aside greed and distress with regard to the world That's one of the four ways of creating your island
In other words you take the body just as it is as you're immediately experiencing it
And one way of doing that is to stay with the breath coming in going out being with the sensation of the breath
Or you can analyze the parts of the body
Or the elements of the body the warmth which is the fire element the motion in the body which is the wind element the cool and liquid sensations the water element and the solid and heavy ones the earth element
Try to bring them into a balance as a way of keeping yourself anchored in the present moment
One of the reasons we do this is because there are not that many narratives around these things
The breath has one narrative It's in and it's out it's comfortable and it's not
That's it
Not much of a narrative
And it's a great dissolver for the narratives the mind spins for itself
Once the mind spins its narratives it snares itself like a spider caught in its own web
Someone once said that the universe isn't made out of atoms it's made out of stories
That may not be true of the physical universe but the universe of our lives is certainly made out of stories and often they're oppressive stories stories that create a lot of suffering for ourselves and for the people around us
And yet we allow ourselves to get caught up in them
A good way to cut through those narratives is just to stay with the sensation of the body in and of itself here in the present moment
This helps get you out of the narratives so that you can realize how unreal they are
At the same time you see all the effort that goes into those narratives
And what do you get out of them
A lot of times it's suffering
Some narratives are useful but the important point of this practice is that you put yourself in a position where you can choose which narratives you're going to get involved with and which ones you're not
Otherwise you're subject to everything the mind spins out
So whatever way you have of making yourself comfortable with the sensation of the body in the present  working with the breath working with other parts of the body working with the elements  regard that as your island as your safe haven outside of the narratives
That way the mind has a foundation
Once it has a foundation it's not knocked over by things
Events in the world can go past you they can go through you as long as you're not latching onto things
The sense of the body can provide a larger context for all your experiences of the world
Once you have this sense of being here in your foundation then the experiences of the world are just sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations all contained within this context of the body
This is not to deny that they have reality but look for instance at your experience of color How do you know that the sky is actually blue out there the way you see it
What's blue about the frequency of the light waves scattered by the molecules in the air
The blue is all in your brain's reactions to the impulses sent in by the eyes that's all
It's something experienced in the context of the body
All the objects of the senses are experienced here in the context of the body
When you realize that it helps make this context a lot stronger the foundation gets more deeply set
It's more allencompassing less likely to get knocked over by things
So the body is good grounding for concentration practice
It's also a good object for insight practice developing insight into the whole issue of which actions are skillful which ones are not which mental qualities lead to suffering which mental qualities lead to the end of suffering which assumptions pile on suffering which assumptions are part of the path
The word sañña has as one of its meanings assumptions the way you label things
For example there's the way you label pain
Some of the ways you label it cause it to build up make it more and more of an issue
Or you can label it in other ways that cut through the issues
One way of dealing with pain  once the mind settles down and can actually look at pain and not feel threatened by it  is to ferret out when you have a feeling of pain exactly which sensations are the pain sensations and which sensations are the body sensations  again the four elements solidity warmth coolness movement
We tend to glom the whole thing together but when you start taking it apart and seeing it as specific separate sensations you begin to see how fleeting pain is just like pleasure
The actual sensations of the body are more lasting and the pain sensations come and go come and go come and go sometimes in very quick succession
Even in a part of the body that seems to be nothing but a mass of pain you can start ferreting out the different sensations to see which sensation precisely is the pain there and which are other sensations  heat solidity  that have somehow gotten glued to the pain by your labeling
If you label them in a different way they get unglued
Instead of your hip or your back or your leg being a whole mass of pain you realize there are just these fleeting sensations of pain together with other fleeting sensations
This makes pain a lot less threatening
It also shows you the power of your perceptions that what you thought was a given was actually something you had glued together yourself
This makes you want to turn around and look at the whole process of labeling things in the mind in other areas as well
So in all these cases you're using the body as an aid in the practice which is aimed at pursuit of true happiness
If you're looking at the body as a goal in and of itself it's going to disappoint you  big time  but if you learn to use it as a tool the happiness that results as you use it wisely gets more and more solid more and more secure
As you get more selfreliant in this way you lean less on other people
Your efforts produce more happiness both for yourself and for the people around you because you spend less time weighing everyone down with your unnecessary burdens
So developing a balanced attitude toward the body is a very important part of the practice
And to develop that balance we have different tools Some tend to emphasize the shortcomings of the body others the importance of the body
Instead of saying that you like some tools and don't like other tools remember that all the tools have their function they all have their time and their place
The more tools you master the better off you are because you have tools for any situation  whatever comes up
Pleasure and pain are big issues in our lives  so big that you'd think we would understand them better
It's because we let ourselves get pushed around by these things without really looking into them That's why we suffer so much
And one of the reasons we don't look into them is because it's hard
Pain especially is hard to look at
We've been dealing with pleasure and pain ever since we were born and a lot of our habits for dealing with pleasure and pain are things we learned before we could even talk before we could understand anything at all
So there's a lot of ignorance here that we haven't explored
Meditating is basically making up our minds to try and understand these two issues  which are basically one issue the issue of feeling
We start out by establishing a beachhead for ourselves
In the midst of all the chaos of the world we have our little corner here
That's what Ajaan Suwat liked to call the monastery here our quiet corner You have to make a quiet corner in the mind as well
If you wait for the world to settle down and be a good place to live in where everybody's fair and just you'll never have your chance to straighten out your own mind
You'll die first
This is why you have to start here creating this little corner and giving all your attention to this one spot where you're focusing on the breath or whatever your meditation object is
The purpose is to create a little space at least where you can put aside the madness of the world  where you feel solid secure where there's a sense of wellbeing
So you find a spot that's relatively comfortable and you work to make it more comfortable
You learn how to recognize when the breath is too long or too short  because it doesn't feel right
Nobody out there can tell you that this kind of breathing is too long or that this kind of breathing is too short too shallow too deep or whatever
You've got to notice these things on your own
Learn how to be sensitive just to this process of breathing and figure out for yourself What is the sign of a breath that's too long or too short
You've got to develop your own sensitivities
This is what insight is all about developing your inner sensitivity to pleasure and pain so that you can detect them on their subtlest levels
If you wait until they're really strong you get overwhelmed
So start on this subtle level here just the breathing
Then when you've got a spot here that feels good  the breath comes in it feels good the breath goes out it feels good  you can let the sense of boundary around your little spot dissolve away
Think of the sense of ease spreading out from that spot flowing along whatever channels there are in the body that pleasure can flow permeating in all directions
Again this is up to you to decide what works in your sense of the body
Teachers can give pointers but you've got to take the pointers and put them into practice and see what works and what doesn't work for you
It's a matter of developing the right sensitivity
You can't take someone else's insights and just slap them onto your experience and claim to have wisdom
Discernment comes in three forms the discernment you learn from other people  the things you hear the things you read  that's one level the things you think through  that's another level and then finally the things you learn by trying to develop mindfulness alertness and other good qualities of the mind
The third level is where the insight really becomes your own  it's your own sensitivity showing you these things
Once you've developed your beachhead your quiet corner work out from there
See how it relates to other things going on in the body  particularly other feelings of pleasure other feelings of pain
Some kinds of pain you can work through
As you expand the sense of the comfortable breath it begins to dissolve the pain away
Or if there's a sense of tension around the pain you can dissolve the tension away
Even though the pain may stay there dissolving the tension around it can help a lot
It makes it a lot easier to live with these things
So get as much of the body as comfortable as you can
That's when you can really look into the pains still remaining because you've got your foundation and you've been developing sensitivity
You can begin to see which part of the pain is physical and which is mental  in other words which part of the pain comes from actions of the mind the way the mind reacts to the raw data of physical pain the way it puts a label on it the way it constructs dialogues around it
All the wild beasts in your savannah here are going to come gathering around the waterhole of the pain
That little child who is always feeling wronged the little child who feels  whatever You find that when you get in touch with your inner child it whines a lot
And especially here right at the pain
If you can learn not to identify with it you learn a lot of interesting things
You sense how when this particular thought comes and surrounds the pain it makes the pain worse
This particular thought makes it better
You see these things through your own sensitivity by having a place to stand and watch where you're not totally threatened by the pain
At the same time you learn how to deal with pleasure
It's so easy when there's a sense of pleasure in the body just to drop the breath and forget about your meditation and to indulge in the pleasure
That's something you also have to work to overcome
It's not that you want to destroy the pleasure it's just that you learn how to be with it how to use it and not get sucked in by it
In other words you learn how to change your relationship both to pleasure and to pain
If you approach pleasure the right way you can use it as a foundation for stronger and stronger powers of concentration and more and more stillness
The greater the stillness the more sensitivity you can bring to discerning pleasure and the pain
So in both cases you're trying to learn how to deal with pleasure and pain and not be overwhelmed by them to watch how your mind reacts in unskillful ways to them so you can begin to unlearn a lot of the bad habits you developed way back when
As you learn how to approach both pleasure and pain in more skillful ways  as tools on the path rather than ends in themselves  you find that your new understanding has an impact on the entirety of your life because so much of your life is driven by pleasure and pain
When you can see them both more clearly  and your reactions to them more clearly  you're not driven
You have a wider range of choice
More freedom
And it all starts right here at the basic building blocks
The physical world may be made out of atoms but the world of your experience is made out of little things like this  pleasures and pains
So use the techniques of the meditation to become more skillful in how you deal with the basic building blocks
Once the basic building blocks are well in hand then the whole rest of your life gets rebuilt
One of the purposes of meditation is to sensitize yourself to the fact that you're not simply a passive observer of what's going on
Life isn't a television show that you simply sit and watch
It's an interactive video game
You're actively creating the characters designing the plot in addition to watching it
The Buddha's teachings on sankhara fabrication point to this fact
He defines fabrication as intentional acts
There is an element of intention in all your experience
Everything you sense whether in the physical world or the mental world has an element of intention
That's what makes it an experience
Without that intention you wouldn't experience anything
Because our intentions aim at happiness what we're living with right now is the result of our attempts at happiness pleasure wellbeing
That's a sobering thought
You look at what you're experiencing and some of it's happy and some of it's not
And to think that this is the result of every act you've done to achieve happiness It gives you pause
When you think in this way you begin to see the areas where you've fallen short
But at the same time you can focus on the areas where you've had some success
After all if you hadn't had some success you wouldn't be here meditating
You wouldn't be a human being
You'd be prowling around as a common animal a hungry ghost a prisoner of hell
So when you practice concentration the Buddha has you focus on the sense of wellbeing you've already got here
What you need to do is to learn how to maximize that wellbeing  because one of the reasons we're so careless in the way we approach happiness is that we get serious about it only when there's a lot of pain
We focus on the pain
We've got to fix it
And there's a sense of desperation about trying to fix our pain fix our sufferings
Yet when things get easy we get lazy
Complacent
All we want to do is just wallow in that sense of wellbeing
And of course wallowing in it is not a cause for more happiness
It just eats up what we already have
So the trick is to learn how to develop a sense of wellbeing and then not to be heedless  to see what further good we can get out of that wellbeing
Ajaan Lee gives an example
He says it's like having a tree that gives coconuts
If you want you can eat up all the coconuts but that's all you get  a stomach full of coconuts and soon you're hungry again
But if you take some of the coconuts and plant them you get more trees and then more trees because you're willing to take what you've got and invest some of it
In the same way when you meditate you take what sense of wellbeing you have and invest some of it in creating more wellbeing
So you start by focusing on where the breath feels good coming in feels good going out
If you can't get a good sense of ease with the breath start with thoughts of goodwill
Wish goodwill for yourself goodwill for other beings
That's a comfortable thought because it's not fighting with the wishes of any being anywhere
Everybody wants to be happy
So you wish them happiness
And then from that sense of harmonious wellbeing you focus on the breath
There should be at least some spot in the body where the breath feels good
Look for it and then keep watch over it in such a way that you don't spoil it
Sometimes when you focus on the body you tense up around the part where you're focusing
That makes it tight uncomfortable
Part of this comes from envisioning the body as something very solid
Remember that what you're experiencing here is an energy field the energy flowing through the body
Some parts of the energy field may seem to feel more solid than others but if you think about the whole thing as the flowing of an energy field then if there are areas where it seems blocked or squeezed you can think of opening up a new channel so that the energy easily flows in flows out without your having to pull it or push it or exert any pressure on it at all
It comes in comes out on its own
All you have to do is keep tabs on it
Allow it to be comfortable
Think of it that way Instead of making it comfortable you're going to allow it to be comfortable
And then allow it to stay that way
Don't interfere with it
Don't mess with it
In other words as long as you're going to be shaping the present moment try to be sensitive to how you're doing it
If things are going well don't mess them up
Be alert to what you're doing because every action as the Buddha said aims at happiness
Be alert to that
What you're experiencing has an element of your intention for happiness built into it
Be sensitive to that and also to whether it's working or not
If it's not working you can change
Change the way you breathe change the way you focus change the way you conceive of your experience of the present the experience of the body sitting here right now
Allow for some more possibilities
This is what a lot of the meditation opens up seeing the possibilities of what can be done with the present moment
For example a thought comes into the mind
Our tendency is then to just jump with the thought and go into the thoughtworld and ride with it wherever it goes
Or in other words we get taken wherever it's going to take us
But if you're really observant you begin to notice that it's possible for a thought to arise without your going with it
It doesn't have to pull you away from the breath
After all the breath is still here going in going out
If thoughts destroyed our breathing we would have died a long time ago
Thoughts come in thoughts go out and the breath is still there
And there's a part of your awareness in touch with that
We tend to block that awareness out so we can get into the thought but the trick here is to allow it to stay open so that when a thought comes it doesn't pull you away the way it used to
That possibility you may not have noticed before
And as you meditate you find other possibilities as well
We're experimenting with the potential for finding happiness so always keep that experimental attitude in mind
What is experiment except for the belief that maybe not everything is already known
Maybe some of the knowledge that has been passed on from other people or that we've cooked up ourselves isn't right
Someone once defined science as the belief that the experts can be wrong
Meditation serves the same function allowing you to question the things you thought you knew for sure
They may be wrong
Check that out
You've got the breath and the mind here in the present moment as your laboratory so work on these things to create a more stable more satisfying sense of pleasure right here and now
Even though this pleasure is fabricated it's part of the path
It's the pleasure part of the path
People often complain about how the four noble truths focus on suffering but if you look at them carefully you see that the most important of them is the fourth truth the path to the end of suffering
It's the first one the Buddha taught
It's the one truth that contains all four noble truths right there in Right View
At its heart though is Right Concentration
If you look at the definition of Right Concentration that's where you find the pleasure
The first jhana starts out with a sense of rapture and ease or rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
In other words you pull the mind away from its outside objects outside distractions and just stay right here
Then as you create a greater sense of pleasure a greater sense of ease in the present moment that's the heart of the path
It's something you develop
So we're here trying to maximize the pleasure we've got not simply to bliss out  although it's nice to be able to bliss out  but also to be alert to be mindful to still have a sense of heedfulness
What's the use of this bliss
That's the next step
When you have this sense of pleasure born from seclusion you can see things more clearly  if you handle the pleasure right if your attitude toward the pleasure is right
When the mind has a sense of ease and wellbeing you can look at your attachments you can look at all of the other mistakes you've been making with a much greater sense of fairness a much greater sense of objectivity with less sense of being desperate
It's like the difference between people who have to worry about where tomorrow's meal is coming from as opposed to those who don't have to worry about that at all
When you don't have to worry about your next meal you have a lot more time to think about things to look at things to ponder them objectively
So when we meditate we're developing a skill that gives us a sense of ease right now that we can begin to trust that we can tap into again and again and again
We don't have to worry about where our next hit of happiness is going to come from
That changes the way the mind approaches its experiences its pleasures and pains
It becomes a lot less desperate
Of course there's always the danger of complacency when you figure you can tap into the breath at any time but if you can overcome that complacency you begin to realize that this is an extremely useful state of mind  a very skillful way of approaching happiness and a very skillful way of providing a foundation for yourself so that you can find greater happiness
As the Buddha said the noble path is fabricated
It's the highest fabrication of all
So when we know it's fabricated we should do it mindfully with a sense of alertness to what we're doing and to the results we're getting
This is what makes it a skill
And we see the results not only in the immediate present but also over time
As I said earlier what we're living with is the results of our attempts at happiness
And as we practice we find that the results get better and better because we're clearer and clearer about what we're doing
All of the Buddha's teachings are meant to help us in this quest for a true happiness the ultimate happiness nibbana
That's where they're all aimed
It's a happiness that isn't fabricated but the only way you can get there the only way you can get beyond fabrication is to learn how to fabricate well
Sometimes at the end of suttas when the Buddha has been teaching the monks he concludes by telling them to go meditate
Actually what he says is to go do jhana because that's the kind of meditation he taught
Some people think that jhana is only one of two types of meditation he taught that he also taught vipassana but there's never any passage where he tells anybody to go do vipassana
It's always Go do jhana This is because he saw jhana as a practice where you develop both tranquility and insight together
In other words you need to develop tranquility and insight just to get into jhana to begin with to get into good states of concentration
Then when you've developed that concentration you can use it to develop qualities of tranquility and insight even further
So try not to see the two qualities as separate
When you're steadying the mind you've got to have some understanding of what you're doing
After all the first jhana involves directed thought and evaluation which are called sankharas  verbal sankharas  and sankharas are the topics of insight
When you direct your thoughts to the breath and then evaluate the breath this is how you settle down
The more precisely you evaluate the breath the more sensitive you are to the breath sensations in the body then the more you can make them a comfortable place to be
And in the course of doing that you learn things both about the breath and about the mind what kinds of sensations the mind likes what kinds it doesn't like how the mind affects the breath how the breath affects the mind
Right there is a lot of raw material for insight
But in the beginning your purpose is more to settle the mind
This is the tranquility side of meditation practice finding the sensations that are easiest to stay with and learning how to maximize those sensations so that you can develop a oneness of mind around them
Oneness here means not only being steadily with one object but also allowing the object to fill your awareness so that it's the one thing you're aware of
When you focus on breathing it's not just the air coming in and out of the lungs
It's a sensation of energy that flows through the whole body and you're sitting in the middle of this vast breathing process that affects every nerve every muscle
The whole experience of your body is related to the breath
The more you can perceive the breath in that way the easier it is to settle down
And the easier it is to stay settled down working on what the Buddha calls the enlarged mind  mahaggatam cittam  an awareness that's all around
That kind of awareness is what allows you to see things for what they are
It's the foundation for the vipassana side of jhana practice
In other words the Buddha doesn't say to stop doing jhana in order to start doing vipassana
He just says to learn how to look at the jhana in a different way as a process of fabrication how it's put together
We often think that vipassana means seeing things as they are the idea being that there's something already out there  things as they are  and they're all covered over by our preconceived notions our mental fabrications
What we've got to do is clear those fabrications away and that will leave just the pristine things as they are
But that's not really how insight works
That understanding actually gets in the way of insight's arising because the Buddha didn't say things as they are He said things as they've come to be how they've come into being
That's a process of fabrication
It's not the case that fabrications lie on top of pristine things as they are
Fabrication is how those things have come into being in the first place
So once the mind is settled down you want to look at the fabricating that goes on in the mind to see how the things you experience contain a very large element of fabrication
The fabrication is your intentional input That's what the Buddha wants you to see
You might think that if only you could get rid of your fabrication you would see the pristine things as they are but if you take away the fabrication the things are no longer there
Your experience of the world is a process of fabrication to gain insight you have to see that fabrication in action
And the best place to see it in action is when the mind is really still when you're fabricating a state of stillness in the mind
To get really familiar with the fabrication process you have to keep doing it with as much skill as you can
It's like learning about eggs
You could sit and look at an egg for days but what would you know about it
Not very much for all you can see is the shell
But what if you can crack it open
You see what's inside
And then you can take what's inside and make it into different things
You can make it into scrambled eggs fried eggs omelets souffls
And the more skilled you are at making different egg dishes the more you understand eggs how they react to different kinds of heat what they do when you put them over low heat what they do when you put them over high heat what they do when you mix them with different ingredients
The more you work with the eggs in this way the more you understand them
It's the same with the mind
If you really want to understand the fabrication of the mind make it into a nice souffl
In other words very purposefully fabricate something really good with your mind like a nice state of concentration with a nice comfortable breath
And in doing so you learn a lot more about the mind than you would simply looking at it without any knowledge of cause and effect
You've got to manipulate it to see how cause and effect are operating
That's when you understand the process of fabrication
You get the mind really still and try to develop an allaround awareness
Then you protect that awareness
That's when you start seeing fabrication in action
As you try to maintain your concentration what destroys it
At first we think that it's destroyed by things coming in from the outside but that's not the case
A lot of the inside fabrication comes bubbling up to destroy it as well
Sounds don't destroy your concentration it's your reaction to sounds
What other people do doesn't destroy your concentration it's what you do
As Ajaan Chaa says sounds don't disturb you you disturb the sounds
If you want to really see this clearly the best place to see it is in the mind with this allaround awareness
Don't leave this awareness
If you leave jhana in order to gain insight you've lost your foundation and you just thrash around
And the mind can get very anxious very alienated very threatened by the insights you try to push on it because it realizes it doesn't have a foundation
So stay in your foundation and look to see what's going to arise there
Like a spider on a web You want to be sensitive to the whole body in the same way that the spider is sensitive to the whole web
The best way to do that is to have all the different strands connected
That's why we work on connecting all the comfortable sensations in the body so that they form a network a network of heightened sensitivity inside
Then all you have to do is stay in touch with the network
As soon as anything comes up  maybe a little stirring here and there on the boundary line between the body and mind  you sense it through the network
As soon as you sense it you can zap it
A little stirring forms and you can tease it out unform it zap it
If you're not quick to zap it the mind will identify it as a thought about this or that and then you create a whole thoughtworld based on the way you labeled the stirring
The best way to see the stages in how that happens is to try to stop them as soon as you notice them and dissolve the thought away
You may find that a part of the mind gets frustrated when you zap things in this way
It wants to continue weaving those thoughts exploring those thoughtworlds
If you want to understand that compulsion to keep creating these thoughtworlds one of the best ways is to thwart it
Keep saying Nope nope nope As soon as there's the slightest little bit of recognition that this is a thought about that that's a thought about this dissolve it  no matter what the thought may seem to be  and see which part of the mind starts screaming
That's how you start understanding the will the intentional element behind the fabrication
Once you understand it you can dismantle it bit by bit by bit
This way you get more and more sensitive to the parts of the mind that you used to keep hidden from yourself
As you bring them out into the open that's where insight can do its work
These things don't come out of their lair unless you stand in the entrance to keep their food from coming in
Or it's like people who live in underground strongholds who like to pull the strings They won't come out unless they feel frustrated because they can't pull the strings anymore so you have to step on their strings
This is how you ultimately come to understand the whole process of fabrication
And where do you look for it
Wherever there's stress
Ajaan Suwat used to mention this often Look at where there's stress and that's where you'll see fabrication where you see fabrication is where you see the ignorance that's been causing you to suffer
As you bring more and more of that ignorance out into the open there comes a point where it just stops  because you see even the slightest little things that would cause stress
In seeing these things you replace the ignorance with knowledge
All of the background commentating that goes on in the mind and is trying to direct everything starts coming more and more to the fore
When you see it clearly you can allow it to stop
And that's when you come to see something unfabricated where the stress really ends
You don't have to go out of concentration in order to see it
You take the concentration apart from within
So this is why when you're trying to gain insight and you're feeling strung out and anxious it's a sign you've lost your foundation
You're looking in the wrong place
Get the mind into a good state of concentration have it allaround aware and then start looking at the process of fabrication as it appears from this viewpoint
You don't have to go anywhere else
Someone once asked me how I dealt with people who found the experience of Awakening to be disorienting
That's about as wrongheaded a question as you can get
Awakening is very orienting  the most orienting thing in life
It shows you that there's something a lot more solid and reliable than you'd ever imagined before
It shows you something deathless and totally free from suffering
And where do you look for it
You look right here right where the mind is settled and still
Then you learn to see that settled stillness as a process of fabrication and you start taking it apart right where it's happening
You don't have to go anywhere else
Bring the mind to the breath for this is where everything important is happening
You want to be as still as possible so that you can catch sight of all these important things happening because most often we don't see that there's anything important here
The breath goes in goes out
That's all we see we've got other business to do so we let it go on automatic pilot
As a result we miss a lot of the things that are going on
But when we meditate we stop to take time to look at this process
Ajaan Lee once made the comment that when you have the mind with the breath you've got all four of the foundations of mindfulness right here all four of the potential frames of reference that you can use in your practice
There's body feelings mindstates and the mental qualities that are either helping or hindering you in seeing what's going on
It's all here
If you want to see the relationships among these things you watch right here
You don't watch anywhere else
What are you watching for
Well you want to see how the mind shapes things
Ajaan Suwat once made the comment that if you're looking for ignorance you don't have to look very far
Just look at the fabrications of the mind
The principle of dependent coarising says that fabrications are conditioned by ignorance
So if you're wondering where this ignorance is that we're trying to track down it's right here where the mind is fashioning things  fashioning bodily sensations and mental events
From fabrication comes consciousness and consciousness leads to name and form physical and mental phenomena
It's worth thinking about Fabrication this process of making comes before phenomena themselves
We hear so often how people shape their reality how our perceptions tend to filter the ways we see reality and yet we don't see it as it's actually happening even though it happens very directly right here
Even in your own sense of the body there are lots of different sensations coming in through the various nerve ends
The mind has its habits for selecting among these sensations to present itself with a picture of what's going on
Sometimes the physical sensations get mixed up with the mental sensations for lots of mental information is coming in at the same time
And so we select things block some things out highlight others to create the story of our mind our sense of what's going on in here
And there's ignorance underlying it all
What we're trying to do here is to replace that ignorance with clear knowing
This is why we bring the mind to the present moment so we can watch this process as it happens
Bring it right to that frontier where the body and the mind meet where mental and physical phenomena meet the mind watching the breath
It's right here that you can see the process of fabrication really clearly if you look
But first you've got to create the conditions for it to be clear
This is why we practice concentration
We've got to get the mind still and engaged in mastering a skill the skill of being still
That's when it's easiest to see the mind when the mind is clearest when it's aware of what it's doing and of what the results are
Even if it's not doing anything at all you want to be aware of the fact that it's not doing anything and aware of the results of not doing anything
People often talk about how when they're practicing a skill if they get really good at it there come times when they get into what they call the zone where everything seems automatic and even the slightest things become apparent  where they're one with the baseball or one with the bat or one with the basketball
In the same way when you meditate you want to get one with the breath
Try to get fluent in the breath
Try to get on good terms be comfortable be familiar with the breath so that there comes a point where it seems like your awareness and the breath become one
Only when we allow them to be one and to stay that way will they actually begin to separate out naturally through the process of fabrication
You can see it clearly as it happens
This is why we work so much with the breath One the mind working with the breath puts itself in a good position to observe itself
Two by working with the breath things get calmed down
It's a lot easier to see events in the mind when the breath is very still than when the breath is moving all over the place
That's why step number four in breath meditation after you're aware of the whole body is to allow what they call bodily fabrication to calm down
Bodily fabrication means the inandout breath
You allow the breath to calm down
Try to be sensitive to whatever mechanical ways you have of breathing or to any unthoughtout ideas of what the breath should be
Often those ideas will keep you pumping and pumping and pumping even when the body's full of breath energy and doesn't need much more
It can get by with very little inandout breathing
Ajaan Fuang's analogy is of a big water jar  you see these all over Thailand enormous jars for catching rainwater running off house roofs
As he says there comes a point when the jar is full and no matter how much more it rains you can't put any more water in the jar
The same with the breath energy in the body There comes a point where it's full
You're sitting here and the breath energy seems perfectly capable of just being there without pumping much in pumping much out  just an energyexchange around the edges
Try to be aware of that the sensation of energy at your skin
If you feel any tightness in your skin anywhere think of its opening up all around you
That allows all those little muscles in the pores to open up a bit and that in turn allows the breath energy to come in
As the mind settles down and is still in the midst of all this you need less and less and less oxygen
It's not that you're stifling the breath or forcing it to stop
You're just getting more and more sensitive to how heavy or long the breathing has to be
After a while you find that it naturally gets lighter and shorter if you're paying attention
There may be longer and longer gaps between an inbreath and an outbreath  that's perfectly fine  until everything gets still
There may be a little bit of breathing in and out right at the surface
Ajaan Lee's analogy is of the vapor coming off of an ice cube
But otherwise what you've got here seems to be a big energy field
And it's hard to say whether it's a physical energy field or a mental energy field
It's just an energy field  energetic but still
Learn to stay there for a good long while because this is where the interesting things happen
This is also where you get the energy you need
When you've got the energy flowing around everything is connected
This gives you strength gives your meditation strength
It gives you the range in which you can watch the process of fabrication
Little things seem to stir here stir there
Sometimes they don't amount to anything
Sometimes they catch hold and turn into thoughts
Or else they turn into major physical sensations
It depends on which way you interpret them how you read them
Just this in itself allows you to see how much the mind shapes things
But for the time being you don't want to follow these things
You want to get good at zapping them
In other words where there's a slight complication in the energy field just comb it out
Open it up so that it doesn't tighten up into something
Get good at that again and again and again
Like those cartoon frogs with very long tongues They sit there and a fly comes by and no matter which direction the fly comes from zap they get the fly and then the tongue goes back into the mouth
In other words your center is right here wherever you have a sense of being centered in the body
And then your awareness goes out to zap any of those little fabrications as they come
Then you return to your center
Why do you do this
So that you can get clearer and clearer about how the process of fabrication begins
Where are those points when the mind begins to label things
Ah  this is a thought of the future this is a thought of the past
This is your arm
This is your leg
This is warmth
This is coolness
This is energy
This is solidity The mind can choose these things  choose what to focus on how to label it
And once it chooses to give a particular interpretation it will find all sorts of evidence elsewhere in that range of your awareness to support it to provide the context for whatever that perception was
If you get hoodwinked into those little worlds you can't see what they're doing because all of a sudden you've got a different context
So instead you want to maintain this context of a broad awareness at the borderline between what's physical and mental
As you get more and more used to being here you start seeing a lot of interesting things about the processes of the mind
Those are the processes we want to understand the fabrication the sankharas the Buddha talks about
Unless you see very clearly how they happen there's no way you're going to find what's unfabricated because you keep falling into their little worlds the little contexts they create for you
And you miss the processing itself
It's like the difference between getting involved in the story of a TV show and watching it to see how the director manipulates things
So much of our lives is spent in these stories
It's a good idea to step back and ask  Who's directing this and How are they directing it and What skill do they have How do they draw you in
What's the hook To make another analogy it's like learning how to write magazine articles
The editors will tell you that the first sentence the first paragraph needs a hook something to draw the reader in
Otherwise the reader won't get into your context
This is how the mind works It hooks you into a little world and takes you wherever it wants you to go
And the raw materials are pretty meager  just this energy that begins to collect here and to clot there and turn into something
Like those little seed crystals they use to make rain
The water vapor gathers around the seed crystals and turns into raindrops
As the raindrops add up they become a rainstorm
Without the seed crystals the vapor wouldn't coalesce
These little seed crystals of fabrication form in the mind then thoughts and other things form around them and all of a sudden you've got a thought storm
You don't see this until you learn how to hang around this place where you're just with the field of energy awareness energy breath energy
It has the potential to turn into any kind of energy depending on how you interpret it
If you hang out here you start seeing lots of interesting things learn a lot about the mind  which is why we use the breath to bring us here
And why we continue using the breath to help us maintain this stance
When Ajaan Fuang's students would get to this point in their meditation he'd have them play with the elements fire water earth space and consciousness
You begin to see that the way you sense your body depends on exactly what you focus on
The potential for all six elements is all here throughout this range of energy
It depends on which sensations you're going to focus on which ones you emphasize
Seeing this serves three purposes One it gets you really focused on the present moment
Two it helps make you more comfortable being here
And three you see the process of fabrication at work
You see how you've got raw materials here in the present moment and how the element of fabrication shapes them into experiences
As a meditator you want to see this clearly again and again and again so that ultimately you can detect even the most subtle of fabrications and zap those as well
So this is why we're here to get rid of our ignorance as to why there are fabrications going on why our intentions are constantly shaping things
We want to see if we can find that spot where we stop fabrication  not by stomping it out or holding it in suspension but finding the point where there's no intention
The mind gets cornered
It knows that no matter which direction it goes it's going to head toward fabrication
It's going to reap the results of fabrication which are stressful
It sees an opening and it goes for it
That's how this strange practice of just focusing on your breath can lead you to the end of suffering
You reach the point where you can confirm for yourself that what the Buddha taught about there being a deathless element is really true
And that the Buddha said is even better than sole dominion over the entire Earth
So check and see if that's true too
In all the passages where the Buddha describes his Awakening he talks about first going through the different levels of jhana
Once he had stabilized his mind in good solid strong states of concentration he directed it to insight  which means that the insights he got were the way experience looks from the point of view of someone in good strong concentration
That's where all the terms all the ideas and concepts come from
So if you want to understand the ideas and concepts you have to put yourself in the same place
This is why we spend so much time working on concentration to get the mind in the right spot  centered in the fourth jhana with bright awareness filling the whole body
The inandout breathing at that point is still
The mind is still
Breath energy still exists in the body but the inandout breathing has calmed down and stopped
And you learn to stay there
The issues that come up in the mind while you're learning to stay there Those are the issues that shaped the Buddha's terminology
The concepts he used say about fabrication What does fabrication look like to someone in good solid concentration
The Buddha talks about three levels of fabrication bodily fabrication which is the breath verbal fabrication which is directed thought and evaluation and then mental fabrication feelings and perceptions
As you move the mind through the levels of jhana directed thought and evaluation get abandoned on the second level
That's where they grow still
Then bodily fabrication the inandout breath grows still in the fourth
What you've got left at that point are feelings and perceptions
These are the big issues because as the Buddha pointed out feelings are the basis for craving
When the mind is there in the fourth jhana you can see this very clearly
The perceptions are what shape your awareness of what you're experiencing
You can see this fact clearly as well
There are other passages where the Buddha talks about the formless levels and each of them is based on the fourth jhana
You take the same equanimity the same mindfulness you developed in the fourth jhana and simply change the perception
So when you want to understand feeling or perception this is the place to do it
Get the mind really well centered and then you can watch these things as they affect the mind
You can see where they come from where they go
You can see their allure you can see their drawbacks
All the things you're supposed to see are best seen right here
When you divide things up in the mind before you hit this spot it's like taking a knife and cutting across the grain or cutting things up in whatever shapes you may want
You're not cutting them up from the right perspective
And so you often misapply the terms you misunderstand what the Buddha is getting at because you're not in the same place where he was
It's like taking a guidebook to Paris and then landing in Rome
You look around Rome and you try to identify all of the landmarks in Paris  this is a guidebook without pictures
You see a tall tower and tell yourself Well that must be the Eiffel Tower You see Saint Peter's and tell yourself That must be the Cathedral of Notre Dame But you're looking from the wrong spot
This is why the practice of good strong concentration lies at the heart of the path
You're putting yourself in the Buddha's place
You're standing where the Buddha stood
That way you can learn in the same way that the Buddha learned
There's passage in Richard Feynman where he says that the duty of every generation of scientists is to try to prove or disprove what has been handed down in the tradition
The same holds true in the practice of the Dhamma
We're here to prove or disprove what the Buddha taught
The way to do it is to follow his method
And this is his method Get the mind centered
In the course of centering the mind you develop good qualities mindfulness alertness the ability to keep the mind with one frame of reference without slipping off to other frames of reference
That's why mindfulness practice is such an important buildup to concentration practice
The Buddha also says that you have to develop tranquility and powers of insight
Tranquility is developed by steadying the mind insight by investigating this process of fabrication
Concentration practice is a good place to see this because you see different levels of fabrication falling away as the mind gets more and more still  and these are the important fabrications
The fact that trees and mountains are fabricated That's their business their issue
Our issue is the fabrications coming up in the mind what they do to us and what we do to them
So you get the mind centered and start asking questions
Actually as you've been centering it you're already asking questions Why is it that some days you follow a particular set of steps and they lead to one set of results while the next day they lead to a different set of results
What did you do differently
Where will you look
Sometimes you have to look at where the mind is to begin with
And then you have to look at exactly how clearly you remember the series of steps you've followed and how clearly you're aware of what you're doing right now how honest you are with yourself
As the Buddha once said that was the prerequisite for all Dhamma practice
Give me a person who is honest he said and I will teach that person the Dhamma And he doesn't mean just being honest with the teacher
You have to be honest with yourself about what you're doing what results you're getting
Once the mind settles down and you're in this spot of being centered  with the breath still with your awareness filling the body  there's a more refined level of questions to ask
This is where you have to improvise
As the Buddha said sometimes looking at things in terms of the five aggregates is what provides the important insights sometimes you have to look in terms of the six sense spheres sometimes in terms of dependent coarising sometimes in terms of the six elements
You never know beforehand which kind of analysis is going to be right for you
You have to notice as you're meditating which kind of analysis you feel more of an affinity for more of a rapport with
You've got to test it
You've got to play with these things
Some people don't like the word play because it doesn't sound serious enough but all intelligence comes from the ability to improvise
If you simply do what's in the books you're not following the Buddha's method
The Buddha didn't follow what was in books
He had to use his own powers of ingenuity
We have the advantage that we're building on the discoveries he made but we still have to go back and make those same discoveries for ourselves
We have to use the same method he used
And one element in that method is this ability to improvise
Again Richard Feynman A British physicist who went to study with Feynman in Cornell was amazed by on the one hand how brilliant he was in physics but also how playful he was
After a while he realized that the two were connected
If you don't learn to play around with ideas you don't see new things
If you don't learn to play around with what's happening in the mind you don't make any discoveries
The Buddha was the type of person who made discoveries
You have to make yourself the type of person who makes discoveries even if it's simply to reconfirm what he discovered
You have to go through the same process really testing things
Ajaan Maha Boowa would often say Try to prove the Buddha wrong  because it's only when you've done your best to prove him wrong that you can be sure that you've really proved him right
Otherwise there's always a possibility that you're simply programming your mind to think in a certain way
You tell yourself Ah if you see there's no self if you see that all things are empty that must be Awakening But that's not the case
You can't clone Awakening
It's always an unexpected discovery when it comes
It never comes quite the way you conceived it
So even though the Buddha gave us his discoveries and they've been passed down for all these generations we have to keep reproving them for ourselves because we have to keep checking our understanding of what he had to say
All of the discoveries he tells us about are in words that we can look up in the dictionary
We can understand the words but we're coming from ignorance so our understanding of the words is an ignorant understanding
We can never be quite sure that we really understand what he had to say
If we really understood things would open up
There'd be Awakening
But the fact that there's no Awakening yet means that we don't yet understand
So we have to keep testing things trying new approaches to figure where we're still ignorant where our blind spots still are
If you don't improvise if you don't play you don't see
The intelligence of a new discovery just doesn't happen
So the important thing here is the method and the heart of the method is how to get the mind centered in such a way that it's both still and alert aware all around with everything very still
See what the movements of the mind look like from that perspective
See how you can experiment with them from that perspective asking the kinds of questions the Buddha recommends
Watch things arise watch them pass away look for what their allure is what makes them attractive
Look for their drawbacks look for their escape from them the release from them
The Buddha was confident enough in his method that he encouraged people to test it for themselves
You can't go just by what your teacher says he told the Kalamas
So when you're testing his teaching make sure you've got the method right and see if you can prove for yourself whether what the Buddha said was true that there really is a deathless element and that you really can achieve it through your own efforts
One of the standard analogies for meditation is that you're going into battle with all the habits of the mind that create suffering
They're called defilements because they darken the mind
As the Buddha once said the mind is luminous but these defilements come creeping in
If the mind didn't have some luminosity you wouldn't be able to develop it
Everything would stay murky and dark
But the mind does have a knowing nature
It does have the capability of seeing things clearly both inside and out  just that the defilements get in the way
They're like clouds that obscure the sun
So these are the things that we're going to battle
Fortunately they're not clouds
If you tried to do battle with clouds you'd really be up a creek
If you tried to cut through a cloud what would there be to cut through
But if you take the analogy that you're going into battle you can start thinking about how people wage war how they engage in a successful fight
The first thing of course is learning how to pick your battles
There are a lot of things you could fight about but you'd waste your energy
If you waste your energy on the trivial things then when the important things come you're not up for them
This is why we have to focus our energies on one issue and that issue is Why does the mind create suffering for itself
Everything we do we think we're doing it for the sake of happiness for the sake of our wellbeing and yet we end up doing things that cause suffering both for ourselves and for those around us
Many times we see it very blatantly right before our eyes that yes this suffering is dependent on what we're doing and yet we seem compelled to do it
This is the important issue
If you can take care of this one issue all other issues are going to get resolved
So you focus on the qualities of mind that lead you to cause suffering
Those are the things you're going to battle
Once you've chosen your battle the next step is to find a good stronghold a place where you're secure where you have the advantage over the enemy
This is why we practice concentration this is why we develop mindfulness of the present moment
This is going to be your stronghold because this is where you can see these things in action
So you want to create a place here in the present that's comfortable where you feel at ease where you feel secure where you feel solid
Start out by staying with the breath  and just keep reminding yourself not to get entangled in any other issues right now
If other issues do come up fend them off just to the extent you need in order to create a space so you can get back to the breath to a sense of ease a sense of wellbeing with the breath so that the breath feels full as you breathe in full as you breathe out
You're not squeezing out the energy of the body as you breathe out you're not building up tension as you breathe in
Allow the breath to come in and out with a sense of fullness that you can maintain both through the inbreath and through the out
Then let that sense of fullness spread through the body
That's your stronghold
Get so that you can stay here in all situations because you're going to need your stronghold in all situations
There will be times when you venture out to do battle with the enemy and realize that the enemy has more troops than you expected so you need to beat a strategic retreat
You need a good place to retreat to a place to come back to no matter what the situation
So try to get familiar with this spot where the breath feels comfortable in the body where the mind feels at ease with the breath
That's your stronghold
It's from this position that you can do your work of insight
The qualities of insight discernment wisdom are like a sword
They cut through all the confusion they cut through all the connections that keep those defilements together that keep them strong
As you get to know the movements of your mind you begin to see that there are lots of little events in the mind that you tie together
You connect this one with that one that one with this one and all of a sudden you've strung together a huge enemy
You tell narratives that connect this event with that feeling and that feeling with that event and then it becomes a huge web by which you catch yourself
So you've got to learn to cut through that web
The nature of insight as the Buddha said is in seeing things in five ways or in understanding five things about whatever the defilement is whatever the story is
Step one is learning simply how to watch it arise
Step two watch it pass away
Learn to see these things simply as events that come and go in the mind
That helps give you some distance from them
In other words when a story world comes up in your mind you don't jump into the world
You look at it as an outsider
It's the same as when you drive past a drivein theater and see a film up on the screen
If you allow yourself to get sucked into the idea that there's actually a story being portrayed up there you could drive off the road
But if you simply see it as lights moving on the screen you don't get sucked in
That helps to dismantle any reality you'd give to the film
The same holds true with the mind We give all kinds of trust and reality to the thought constructs that come up in the mind but if you learn to see them simply as events little firings of the synapses you cut through any compulsion to get involved in that story line all over again
When you can pull yourself out of that thoughtworld you begin to see the construction that goes into maintaining it
And particularly you want to see two things about the way it's constructed
These are steps three and four
Three is What gratification do you get out of that thoughtworld
Even though it may be causing you suffering there must be some pleasure some gratification in creating it
Otherwise you wouldn't indulge in it
It would hold no attraction at all
So learn to look for where that gratification is
Sometimes when you see it you'll feel ashamed that you could have fallen for it
Then step four look for the drawbacks If you stick with that thoughtworld what is it going to do
Where does it lead you
Some of the drawbacks you'll see immediately with the sense of tension with the sense of disease that arises both mentally and physically as you create and consume that thoughtworld
Some of the drawbacks will come later
You've got to learn to look for both
The most difficult step is the fifth Learn to see the escape from that thoughtworld from that pattern from that habit
Sometimes just looking at the arising and passing away of the thoughtworld is enough to undercut any sense of reality or trustworthiness in the thoughtworld and it will go away
Other thoughtworlds are more compelling
You have to look very carefully to see the gratification to see the drawbacks and you have to use your imagination to find the escape
This is not just a passive process of watching arising and passing away
You have to see where in the mind there's that little voice telling you that you've got to believe in this narrative about that thoughtworld that you can't do it any other way
There will be that voice with its repeated message
That's why it's called a compulsion
A lot of our compulsions come from the fact that we can't imagine any other way of reacting to a particular memory or a particular idea
Our imaginations are limited  and sometimes dishonest
To break out of the limitations and shake out the dishonesty you have to sit down and very consciously try to think of other ways of reacting
One compulsion is the part of you that says You've got to get upset whenever this memory comes back
If you don't get upset you're just being a milquetoast
People are going to walk all over you Put a question mark next to that and then check to see what other voices come up
Whatever the voices learn how to put question marks next to them too
The simple act of questioning reminds you that there's an alternative
Ask yourself Does that have to be true
What if the opposite were true And just that much can be enough to jolt your imagination to think in other ways to get out of the rut of that particular defilement whether it's greed anger delusion lust fear pride jealousy whatever
Learning how to cut through any defilement requires a knowledge that has these five aspects seeing it arising seeing it passing away seeing its gratification seeing its drawbacks and then seeing the escape from it
When your sword can cut in all five directions in this way you begin to appreciate what meditation can do
It really does free you from the mind's old habits of creating suffering for itself  the habits that keep telling you I'm doing this I'm doing that because I want to be happy
You have to do things this way in order for happiness to be found and yet turning up with unhappiness as a result
There's a wrong connection in there that you've got to cut through and this fiveedged knowledge is what allows you to cut it
So these are your basic strategies your basic weapons
First you've got to choose the right battle
That's why we have Right View
Then you need a stronghold a safe place from which to launch your attack
That's what the concentration is for
And then you have to look at the events in the mind from these five angles
That's your sword
When you're equipped in this way you can take on the really essential battle in life which is to free yourself from suffering
You've got the tools the weapons you need to win
It's all very basic but so many times in life we miss out on the good things because we overlook the basics
So learn how to appreciate the basics because they're the things that can really help you
That phrase in the chant just now  those who don't discern suffering  sounds a little strange doesn't it
You'd think that everybody would discern suffering but the verb here is important
Everybody experiences suffering but not everybody discerns it
Discerning means to understand to see it for what it is to the point where you can let it go and put an end to it
That requires looking at it very carefully
And for all the suffering we go through in our lives we look at so little very carefully
That's our problem
We have a lot of ideas about suffering but have you ever stopped to ask yourself Where did you pick up those ideas Some of them go way back to before you even knew language
The first thing that happened after you were born was that you cried  unless you were too stunned even to cry and they had to spank you to make you cry
You even experienced suffering in the womb
There's a story in the Canon about a young boy who stayed in his mother's womb for years and when he finally came out he was able to speak
The first thing he talked about was how miserable he was there in the womb in that bloody prison
So we've been suffering all along and the way we dealt with our suffering from those very early times probably still has an impact on how we deal with it now
Say there's a pain in your leg
You probably have a mental image of that pain  maybe a visual image a tactile image a sense of its shape
Back as a child when you believed in ghosts you may have seen the pain as a ghost
It was a thing with a will and you thought it was coming after you
You didn't know any better
But even though your conscious mind knows better now a lot of your subconscious thoughts may not know better
This is one of the reasons why we have to meditate  to get the mind still enough so you can see these subconscious thoughts in action
You have to understand that the mind's not divided into two sections the conscious mind and the unconscious mind
It's just that there's conscious behavior in the mind and unconscious behavior conscious events and unconscious events
One of the purposes of meditation is to get the mind more still so that things that used to be subconscious can become conscious
It's like bringing them up into the light of day
Or you can compare it to tuning in to a radio station
The more precisely you're on the frequency the less static there is
The less static the more clearly you can hear the signal
You pick up a lot of the subtleties you couldn't hear before because the static was obscuring them
You get the mind still so that you can begin to discern the suffering around the pain
You'll be working on two levels
One is the physical pain itself and the other is the mental suffering
Doctors have shown that our perception of pain is really dependent on a lot of mental factors
This is something you're going to see as you meditate  and it's something that we can each know only for ourselves
Doctors can run tests and not find any physical basis for the pain in the body but the person really is experiencing pain
They can look at the pain center in the brain to see whether it's activated or not but they can't tell you how your pain feels
So just the physical pain itself has a lot of mental factors and the most important one is the factor of perception  the way we label things
Sometimes the word sañña is also translated as memory which is not really accurate
Memory plays a role in perception  we apply our old perceptions of pain to our new experience of pain  but memory deals with the past
Here we're trying to focus on the present and yet we use our memories from the past to cover up the present to shape our experience of the present
Say when there's a pain in your leg a pain in your waist a pain in the back what perceptions does the mind apply to it
If you can't see the process in action you can try consciously applying different perceptions
As you work in concentration you should be getting some practice in this  because after all each of the stages of concentration all the way up to the dimension of nothingness is called a perception attainment
For example when you're working with the breath the label of breath should be your primary perception
The label you apply to your experience of the body is breath Not only the inandout breath Try to experience all the different parts of your body as types of breath energy
If your arm really were breath energy would it be good breath energy or blocked breath energy
Just try applying that label very consistently to the sensation of the arm and after a while your experience of the arm is going to change
Try applying it to all the different parts of your body
See how that changes the way you experience those parts
You'll see that the actual physical experience of the body is going to change because of the mental label
And the advantage of this is that you can start doing different things with the sensations
If you perceive a particular sensation as something solid there's not much you can do with it
If you perceive it as blocked energy there are ways to unblock energy
You can figure out how to redirect it how to loosen up the blockage
In other words the perception is useful because you can do things with it
If you stick with that perception of the breath trying to keep it as constant as possible you learn two things
One is that you get more and more sensitive as to what you're doing in order to maintain the perception
You start seeing the process of perception a lot more clearly
Two you get the breath to calm down so that it's really really still
Once the breath energy throughout the body seems to flow nicely it'll get more and more subtle
If you stick with your one perception you find that the brain uses a lot less oxygen
And so you need to breathe less until you finally get to the point where the oxygen coming in and out of your pores is all you need
The inandout breath grows still
When the breath gets still your sense of the shape of the body begins to change
The sense of boundary between inside and outside the body begins to dissolve away
You've just got a mist of sensations and you can change your perception right there
Instead of focusing on the mist you can focus on the space between those little bits of sensation and all of a sudden you're with space
If you can hold onto that perception of space long enough it's going to change your experience of the present moment your sense of what it's like to have a physical body here
The potential for being a physical body is there but you choose not to stir up that potential
Just stay with the space
Just this much teaches you a lot about perception
Or before you go to space you might focus on the different properties in the body  the warmth the coolness the sense of heaviness
Perceive the body as all fire or as all water or as all solid Just that perception will change the way you experience the body physically
Then perceive all these various properties as balanced not too cold not too hot not too heavy not too light
Everything all mixed together just right
This will also teach you a lot about perception
You begin to see the labels you're using a lot more clearly
As you get more and more familiar with your conscious perceptions you begin to detect the less conscious ones as well
And you're ready to start taking pain apart
One of the first things you notice when you look at a pain is the sense that it seems to be a solid mass in the body
Is it really
Or is it the result of your perception
Try changing your perception to see what happens
Again think of the pain as just tiny dots of sensation that can move around that have space between them
The breath can flow through the pain
The blood can flow easily through the pain
Try to distinguish which of those sensations are just body sensations and which are the pain sensations and you begin to realize that all the things you used to glom together are actually lots of different kinds of sensation
Only the way you perceived them was what made them so threatening
You may have picked up that old way of perceiving because you thought that putting a boundary around the pain was a good way of dealing with it
Putting a boundary around the pain you thought might keep it from spreading
But when you really look at the process of putting up and maintaining that boundary you begin to see that often it's an unskillful way of dealing with the pain
So you can replace that perception with more skillful ones
Then you can look at the other perceptions and thoughtfabrications that gather around the pain  the stories the mind tells itself about how long you've had this pain or how much you've suffered in life and poor you all this suffering all this pain
You begin to ask yourself Do you really have to believe those stories
Can you stop making the stories for a little while See what happens
Pain is an excellent place to start seeing all the different processes in the mind because you begin to see that it's not only a physical pain
There's a lot of mental activity around the pain that can cause the really important pain the really important suffering in other words the mental burden you build up around the pain
If you look carefully you can see these different stories these different perceptions simply as events in the mind and you can just drop the habit of listening to them and believing them
See what happens
What you're doing is not totally dropping the habit of perception
You're applying new perceptions because you find them more skillful
This is the Buddha's approach to all of the aggregates
You're not trying to do away with form feeling perception thought constructs and consciousness  at least not right away
The first thing you've got to do is learn how to convert them into the path
They use the word aggregates heaps for the word khandha You might think of them as big heaps of gravel
And you have the choice You can put the gravel in a bag and carry it around on your shoulder weighing yourself down or you can figure out a way of turning it into an asphalt covering for your road
Put it down on the ground mix it with a binding agent  and then you have a smooth road to walk on
The binding agent here is mindfulness and alertness learning to be very mindful and alert about how you use these different aggregates
After all the aggregates themselves aren't really things
They're activities
They're events in the mind
You begin to see that even your experience of form itself is affected by perception
And you begin to approach all these things by being mindful and alert
Mindful means keeping what you want to do in mind keeping in mind your desire to put an end to stress
Alert means seeing if you're really doing it and at the same time seeing the results of what you're doing
Both of these qualities require perceptions
And then there's ardency
Being ardent means that if you see yourself causing stress you try your best to figure out other ways of acting
These three qualities  mindfulness alertness and ardency  are the binding agents that turn these events these aggregates into the path
And they require perceptions concepts in order to do their work
So we're not condemning the conceptual mind we're not condemning the mind that perceives things and puts labels on them
We're learning to look at the process of perception and figure out how to do it more skillfully
Ultimately you do get to an experience that goes beyond the aggregates but the only way to get there is to develop this path  turning the aggregates from a burden on your shoulder to a smooth road under your feet
So if you want to understand perception the first thing you've got to do is learn how to do it consciously
The more consciously you stick with a particular perception  such as breath or space  the more you can understand how the mind fashions perceptions
You begin to detect where to look to see the less conscious perceptions the ones causing stress and pain
You see them in action and you can drop them replacing them with other perceptions that are more skillful  until finally you get to the point where you don't need them at all
Those chants are often juxtaposed just before we meditate The world is swept away This body is filled with all sorts of unclean things And then May I be happy The purpose of this juxtaposition is to make you stop and think Given this sweptaway world this unclean decaying body where does true happiness lie
Where does a safe and secure happiness lie
This is the big question we have to ask ourselves because everybody wants happiness
As the Buddha said all things all phenomena that you can experience are rooted in desire
And what is the desire
It's the desire for happiness
The body events in the mind They all come from our desire for happiness
And we act on that desire sometimes in skillful and sometimes in unskillful ways
That's why the situation we're living in is such a mixed bag in terms of being satisfactory or not
You have to look carefully at your actions to see which ones really are conducive to happiness and which ones are not
You can't rest secure in the notion that there's somebody out there taking care of everything and it's all going to turn out all right in the end
We are the ones who are shaping our experience and if we're not careful we're going to shape things in an unskillful way
The Buddha saw that all of our activities are aimed at happiness
And what was especially interesting is that he saw how much of what we experience is an activity
Even our sense of self of who we are is an activity
It's a fabrication
We fabricate the decision to identify with certain things
The thought that I am the thought of identification is an act of putting things together
It's a fabrication an activity aimed at happiness
And to some extent it works
People who have a very poorly formed sense of self have trouble managing their lives
A certain level of identification is needed a certain sense of self is needed just to function properly
And so in learning to be more skillful the Buddha has us take that sense of self and try to make it more coherent so that it can promote your desire for true happiness a happiness that lasts
Then you ask yourself What am I doing that's actually leading in that direction
What am I doing that's leading in the other direction This involves maintaining a sense of what in Pali is called hiri and ottappa shame and fear of evil
In other words shame at the idea of doing something you know would be harmful and fear of the consequences of doing harmful things
This type of fear the Buddha said is a useful kind of fear
It's what keeps us on the path
And it requires a certain sense of self a certain sense of selfesteem and the opposite of apathy  realizing that what you do is important for it's going to have consequences down the line and you don't want to suffer the consequences of unskillfulness
This is what keeps you on the path the sense that there are dangers out there and that the dangers lie in your unskillful actions
But this training also implies trust trust that you can do things in the proper way trust in the principle that your actions really do matter and trust that the quest for happiness is a good quest if you do it properly
If you take your quest for happiness seriously the Buddha says you actually end up developing qualities that are the opposite of selfishness compassion wisdom and purity
First compassion You realize that if your happiness depends on the suffering of other people it's not going to last
Other people want happiness too and they're not going to sit around and allow you to maintain any happiness that oppresses them
They're going to destroy it
So if you're really sincere about happiness you also want to include their happiness in the equation
You develop the quality of compassion taking the happiness of other people into account
As for wisdom the Buddha said that the sign of a wise person is realizing that sometimes the things you like to do are going to cause suffering and the things you don't like to do are going to cause happiness
It's a measure of your wisdom to realize that and to act accordingly
In other words you have to appreciate the principle of causality for it's going to affect your happiness
That way you get wiser and wiser about causes and effects
If you're wise you'll look for a happiness that's secure and longterm rather than just simply what you can grab at any moment
And as for purity as the Buddha told his son Rahula really paying careful attention to your actions and their results and resolving not to repeat mistakes that cause suffering for yourself or for other people That's how people attain purity
So compassion wisdom and purity  the qualities we associate with the Buddha  come from taking our quest for happiness seriously
Good things come from this sense of self that wants to find a longterm happiness
Ultimately though as we all know the Buddha also teaches notself  in other words showing us that the things we tend to identify with can get in the way of a higher level of happiness
But always keep in mind that even here the quest for happiness lies in the background
It's the overriding issue
You first have to become skillful in the way you manage your happiness realizing that being generous being virtuous training the mind are things you have to do that you're responsible for your happiness and have to develop these qualities that are harmless both to yourself and to others
Once you've got that principle firmly in mind then you can start turning to the teaching on notself
You see that the various things you identify with leave you open to all kinds of dangers
If you identify with things that are impermanent things that can be changed by causal conditions beyond your control you're putting yourself in a weak position an exposed dangerous position
And this is where the teaching on notself comes in
Ajaan Maha Boowa compares this teaching to a stick that you use hit the hand of a monkey that's always grabbing at things
It's a warning to yourself that if you reach into fire it's going to burn you so you have to slap your hand away from the fire
Many people resist the teaching on notself and all the teachings that are preparatory for that like the chant we had just now on the body
They feel that these teachings are going to deprive them of the strategies they use to find happiness
But these teachings are meant to protect you from suffering
They're there to remind you that if you latch onto the body as yours in a really strong sense you're going to suffer
If you can see it as a tool that you use toward happiness that's a different issue
But so many of us don't see it in that way
The body is us
It's ours
But what happens to the body
It gets old and it can get sick in all sorts of horrible ways even before you get old
And it's not the case that these things happen only to people who don't take care of their bodies
They happen to everybody and can happen at any time
If you identify with the body you're leaving yourself exposed to all sorts of problems to all sorts of dangers
The same holds true for feelings perceptions thought constructs and consciousness
But the Buddha doesn't have you just drop and abandon these things  he has you turn them into the path
In other words you take these things you identify with and you turn them into tools
Once they're tools it's possible to get a sense of distance from them and yet still get some use out of them as well
In this way the strategy of notself instead of depriving you of your strategies for happiness actually provides you with a wider range of strategies
As we're meditating here what are we focusing on
We're focusing on the body focusing on the breath
We're learning to maximize the feelings of pleasure that come from the breath
We're learning ways of perceiving the breath energy in the body that create stronger and stronger states of concentration
We're learning to direct our thoughts and evaluate the breath  that's fabrication  and to be consciously aware of all this
So you've got all five aggregates here turned into a path
There will be a sense of identification with the path but it's different from just plain old straight identifying with these things
There's a more skillful use of them so that they lead to a greater and greater sense of wellbeing and security
As you get more identified with the path in this way the other things outside that you used to identify as you and yours  that if they changed were going to cause big trouble in your life You can pull away from those attitudes because you have a better place to be
You try to focus all of your desires around maintaining this sense of peace and wellbeing in the mind
At some point when that peace and wellbeing is really secure you can undercut those desires as well seeing that even here in this state of concentration there's still inconstancy there's still stress
In seeing that you can let go entirely
You've seen that it's possible for there to be a dimension where there's no sense of I am no sense of identification and yet it's not annihilation
In fact it is just the opposite
The only thing that gets annihilated there are stress and suffering
That's what we're aiming for as we learn to take our desire for happiness seriously and to follow it through in a consistent way
Then as Ajaan Suwat once said when you reach the ultimate happiness who cares if there's a self or not a self or whether you can find someone who's experiencing this or what
It doesn't matter for what is there is the ultimate happiness
Even though the Buddha talks a lot about suffering and stress the unattractiveness of the body the lack of control you have over things it's not for a negative or pessimistic purpose
It's to focus your desire for happiness in another direction
In effect he says Look you can't find true happiness in these places
You've got to look someplace else This is the theme underlying all of his teachings that true happiness really does matter
It's important
It's worth giving yourself over to
The desire for true happiness is worth taking seriously because it actually leads to true happiness if you follow through with it skillfully
So although sometimes we may resist his teachings  because they seem to threaten our ideas about what we need to do and to believe in order to be happy  it's good to step back and question our assumptions
There are many many people who have followed the Buddha's way and found that yes it does lead to a true happiness  and that the happiness you get from following other paths doesn't nearly compare
When you see fear in your practice remember There is skillful fear and unskillful fear
Skillful fear focuses on the harm and suffering that comes from doing unskillful things
Unskillful fear comes from holding onto things that you know are going to change
Once you understand this you can work on refining your sense of self and ultimately learn to adopt the teaching on notself as well
When you learn how to use these teachings skillfully  at their appropriate times in the appropriate places  and you find they really are conducive to happiness then you see that there's nothing to criticize in the Buddha's teachings
They're there to help us find the happiness we want
He's not forcing them on anybody
There's no power play involved here at all
He offers his teachings out of compassion
He's found that these practices work for him and they work for other people as well
It's simply a question of whether we understand them properly and learn how to use them skillfully
When we do there are no more issues
There's a passage in the Dhammapada where the Buddha says that life as a householder is difficult life as a monk gone forth is difficult
Then he ends by saying So be neither Of course what he means by that is to find a way of not having to be anything at all
That requires practice
It's a skill  the skill we're working on right here the skill that takes you out of having to live the household life or have to live the life of a monk
Without this skill those are the only choices you have
Derived from them are lots of other little choices but they're all trapped inside those two categories
What we're looking for is a path of practice that leads to freedom from any kind of category at all
As the Buddha said what you are is limited measured by what you cling to
So the path beyond categories has to be a path that gets rid of clinging
When you hold onto the body that's what you are
When you hold onto any of the other aggregates you're classified as a feelingclinger a perceptionclinger a mentalfabrication or consciousnessclinger
You create your identity by what you cling to
This is why the Buddha never answered questions about what a human being is because a human being can be almost anything
So this noble eightfold path that we're following here is a path that gets us out of having to be identified with anything of having to be limited to anything
That's the skill we're working on
It's not an easy skill but when you realize that all of the alternatives out there are difficult then you realize that it doesn't make much sense to focus on the difficulties of the path for at the very least this is a path that leads to a way out
Three years ago when I sensed that Ajaan Suwat was about to pass away I went to see him in Thailand
It was inspiring and heartening to see him because even though he went through a lot of difficulties after his accident  paralyzed from the base of the spine on down brain damage lung damage having to deal with very difficult people looking after him  he always maintained his good cheer
One of the last things he said to me was that he had begun to notice that the perceptions his brain was sending to him were getting weirder and weirder all the time
He had to learn how not to listen to them
Then he said But that thing I got from the meditation That hasn't changed
That's always there
That thing is what he called it
That's the freedom we're working toward so that no matter what happens in terms of aging illness and death there is always that thing there
That's what we want to ferret out
That's what we want to know
So we foster the customs of the noble ones which focus on taking delight in this path this path of letting go and developing
You let go of the patterns of thought speech and action that get in the way of clear knowing
You develop the qualities that encourage clear knowing Right View Right Effort Right Mindfulness Right Concentration
You learn to take enjoyment in these things
You let them capture your imagination
They've done studies of people who are expert in fields involving skill and dexterity and they've discovered that what sets the experts apart from people who are just good at those skills is that the skill captures their imaginations
One they like doing it two they like rising to the challenge
If they make mistakes they try to learn from them
One article tells of the admissions office in a very famous school of surgery
For years they were working on the questions asked at the applicant interviews to try to figure out which questions would ferret out the people who didn't have the potential to be surgeons as opposed to those who did
Because it was one of the best schools in the country all the applicants had great grades great recommendations but that was no guarantee that they'd actually do well when faced with a patient on the table
The admissions people discovered a pair of questions that were most accurate in figuring out who to admit and who not to admit
The first was Can you tell us about a mistake you made recently If the applicant said No I can't think of any mistakes I made recently he or she would be rejected
The second question was What would you do differently if you had the chance to do it again If the person was able to jump right in and say I thought that next time around I might try this that was the sort of person they wanted  someone who would look at his or her actions recognize a mistake and then immediately want to figure out how to not make that mistake again someone who exercised ingenuity in trying to figure out another approach
All across the board the ones who excel at their skills  whether as musicians sportsmen or craftsmen  are the ones who find that the skill captures their imagination
That's why the effort put into the skill is no big deal for them
They get so absorbed that the effort becomes enjoyable
They like thinking about it they like figuring out the problems they face and sometimes detecting problems that other people might not even notice
Then they try working out solutions
These are the kind of people who do well
The same principle applies in the customs of the noble ones
You delight in letting go you delight in developing
Working on the qualities of your mind really captures your imagination
That way the difficulties of living in a community with other people who are also practicing aren't big issues
You've got the rules you've got the structure you've got the support to do the practice
It's not so much that you're here to learn about Buddhism you're learning to use the tools that Buddhism offers to sort out your own mind
First the tools help you look at the habits the things the mind is doing
Then when you notice that what you're doing is causing suffering to yourself or other people you have the tools to change those habits
If the classic tools don't work you can use your own ingenuity to extrapolate on them
When you find that that captures your imagination then the difficulties don't really impress themselves on your mind
The whole purpose of this practice is to focus on what's actually happening in your mind
The big questions are What are you doing that's causing unnecessary suffering for yourself or for other people
What can you do to stop doing that These questions apply not only to things you do and say but also the way your mind operates the way the mind treats itself the way it deals with its own thoughts and feelings
You want these questions to take charge
This requires a shift in your center of gravity because for a lot of us we have a strong sense of who we are with our activities as something secondary something in service of the who that we are
If we take our sense of our self of who we are as the absolute then the question of what we're doing becomes relative
Then the preferences of that self take over and the path becomes hard
But if you switch things around so that the question of becoming more skillful in your actions becomes your absolute while your sense of who you are becomes relative to that question then the path becomes a lot easier
It's a lot more enjoyable
It makes sense
This is why the Buddha focused his four noble truths on precisely this question because that's what the four truths are an issue of skillful action desirable result unskillful action undesirable result
They're a way of sorting those issues out
As for the other questions  concerning the world the oneness or plurality of the universe the existence of a self the nature of the life force the fate of an awakened person after death Those questions get set aside
Those are not the issues
The issues are what is skillful what is not
When those questions become the center of your concern when they capture your imagination then issues of world and self fall to the wayside
This gives you a beginning sense of what it's like to be freed from the question of who you are what kind of person you are because you realize that those issues are all determined by the skill with which you act particularly the skill with which you approach your clingings your attachments
Those are the determining issues
When you learn how to practice developing concentration and discernment to see through those clingings then the whole need to identify yourself limit yourself measure yourself
goes by the wayside
As you follow the path the sufferings caused by the need to define yourself grow lighter and lighter
Even more so when all the clinging is gone That's it  no need to be defined by anything at all
There's a passage where a monk has been asked by some people from outside of the Buddha's teachings about how the Buddha answers the question of whether the awakened person exists or not after death
The monk extemporizing answers that there has to be an answer beside the four that are usually given existing not existing both neither
His questioners all make fun of him
You don't know anything about the Buddha's teaching they sneer
Even people outside the teaching knew that
So the monk goes to see the Buddha
The Buddha says How can you say anything like that
Can you identify where the Tathagata is right now
Can you define him in terms of any of the five aggregates Well no
As something separate from the five aggregates No
There's nothing that you could point to even here in the present moment  unlike your ordinary person who can be identified with his clingings
The Buddha went on to say When you can't even identify the Tathagata here and now how can you say anything about what he is after death or how he exists or what his mode of being is after death
Total freedom
Indescribable and undefined
That's what this practice is all about
If the idea of total freedom captures your imagination then the difficulties get smaller and smaller
Even though they may be large in your mind right now they start looming smaller and smaller as you stick with the path
The Buddha once said that if you could make a deal that every day for years you'd be speared with spears in the morning spears at noon spears in the evening  spearwounds every day  but with a guarantee that in years you'd gain full Awakening that would be a deal worth taking
When the Awakening came you wouldn't consider that it had been gained with difficulty
