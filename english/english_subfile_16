Nobody starts out with a comprehensive understanding of what Buddhism teachesIt would be a mistake to keep entirely to yourself and proceed on what might be false assumptionsPRENTICE One thing that strikes me particularly about what youve told me is the definitive nature of BuddhismI mean for a time I had the idea that Buddhism was sort of esoteric and otherworldly full of rhapsodies about cranes flying across the autumn moon and life being an unreal dream and so onIm beginning to understand that Buddhism is not at all vague but precise and specificWhere is the mysticism Ive heard so much aboutBHIKKHU TISSA Where indeedFind it if you canPRENTICE Of course I understood that Buddhism has a specific body of doctrine but your explanation seems more downtoearth than I had expectedYou dont leave much room for dilettantes and dabblersIt makes me a bit uncomfortable with my own approachBHIKKHU TISSA Everybody with a serious interest must inquire and consider carefullyThat doesnt make you a dilettanteAlso some people will feel inclined to devote themselves to the path more intensively than othersBut you are right that vague dabbling has no place in BuddhismThe Buddha did not teach a doctrine consisting of so many theoriesHe taught Dhamma which is to say truth reality the actual nature of thingsNow in an ordinary philosophical system a person might browse about sampling this or that idea amusing himself with this or that hypothesis as much as he pleasesBut in Buddhism such an approach is totally unprofitable and foolishFor one thing the Dhamma of the Buddha is not to be admired but practicedIt has no value as a museumpieceFor another Dhamma is Dhamma regardless of whether we believe it or notThat is reality doesnt need our stamp of approval it doesnt accommodate itself to our petty preferencesWe cant divide it up and take only the parts we likeEven the Buddha you may remember did not invent the Dhamma but discovered it and made it known to mankindSomeone who hears about Dhamma who learns something of the teaching may accept this or reject that or approve of this or disapprove of that and may even try to fit the teaching in whole or in part into his own galaxy of beliefsThis is mere dabbling and it indicates that the individual is only leaping about looking for amusement or confirmation of his prejudices and cant hold still long enough to learnTo jump toward something or to jump away from something  its all the sameBlind doubt is as bad as blind faithAnyone who wants to make progress must proceed wit an open and alert mind going step by step quickly or slowly but going not making qualifications or excuses not making a hobby out of religious practiceInsincerity is a great obstaclePRENTICE Im a little nervous wondering about my motives in interesting myself in BuddhismIm not as openminded as perhaps I should beBut at least I can say that Im sincereI have no interest in being a mere dabblerBHIKKHU TISSA GoodBy all means examine Buddhist teaching and try it for yourselfPRENTICE And Buddhist teaching I believe you said begins with examining oneselfBHIKKHU TISSA Yes but in order to get anywhere that examination must be systematicSince you were a child youve been wondering about yourself who you are why you act the way you do where you are going and so forth  but such examination is only preliminary its incomplete and likely to remain so until you begin to practice in a disciplined wayOnce you have come to certain tentative conclusions about your situation in the world and about the possibility of freeing yourself it is up to you to take the necessary stepsNobody is going to do it for youIts very important to understand thisNobody can do your work for youYou cant simply declare yourself a believer in Buddhism and wait for enlightenment to sweep you upPRENTICE As I told you earlier Venerable Tissa Ive examined myself to the point where I feel the need for the kind of path the Buddha points out and Im favorably disposed toward undertaking itIve even been doing some meditation on my own but Im not sure Im following the books correctlyOh well to be frank Im just stumbling in the dark at the moment and Id appreciate any advice you have on the correct meditation method to follow and what to watch out for and so onBHIKKHU TISSA Lets not put the cart before the horse MrPrenticeYou are I think talking about formal sitting practiceBut Im not sure you understand what meditation really meansCan you define it for mePRENTICE I couldBut I strongly suspect Id be wrongBHIKKHU TISSA In that case lets talk basicsThe Pali word usually translated as meditation is bhavana which really means mental cultivation or selfdevelopmentIt actually encompasses a great deal more than the English wordWithout any instruction in the matter a person is likely to think that Buddhist meditation means sitting in a dark place with crossed legs and contemplating infinity or something like thatPRENTICE I did entertain a similar ideaBHIKKHU TISSA Out of such ideas comes a host of mystical notions that have nothing to do with BuddhismCorrect meditation is never dreamy or romantic nor is it confined to one particular bodily position or place or time of dayThe key to the practice is mindfulness  in Pali satiMindfulness means presence of mind attentiveness awareness observation bare attentionIt is an attitude of impartial watchfulness and alertnessTo meditate means to set up mindfulness and maintain it by the power of concentration  in whatever position or circumstance you find yourselfPRENTICE It sounds like youre saying that meditation can be practiced along with any human activityBHIKKHU TISSA Not along with MrPrenticeMeditation is not something separate from ordinary life it is not an exercise we impose on top of something elseRightly speaking meditation is the mindful practice of daily life itselfPRENTICE Do you mean there really is no difference between meditation and daily lifeThats extraordinaryBHIKKHU TISSA There should be no difference no distinctionUnfortunately many people cling tenaciously to the notion that there is a time for meditation and a time for comfortable carelessnessThey think that sitting for an hour or two a day on a cushion is sufficientPRENTICE And it isntBHIKKHU TISSA One hour two hours  the time is irrelevantThis is an example of putting the cart before the horseFirst you have to understand what the practice is all aboutIf you look at meditation in the same way as say practicing the piano you are already off on the wrong pathSince it is the whole man or woman we want to develop what use is there in confining our attention to one brief activity or period of timeIf we are going to understand the world in its entirety we have to look at that worldWe have to develop and apply mindfulness at all timesPRENTICE Yes I see but how can we remember to be mindful at all times in the bustle of daily lifeWe can only think of one thing at a timeBHIKKHU TISSA The original meaning of the Pali word sati is just memory and that meaning is still present within the idea of mindfulnessWe have to have presence of mind alertness readiness recollection of our duty to observeYou are right that we can only think of one thing at a time but this does not mean that mindfulness is impossible except when we are idleTo be mindful is to be established in the present momentIf you are working then your attention should be fully on that work not wandering hither and yonIf you are eating you should be mindful of eatingIf you are taking a shower you should be mindful of showeringThe objects that present themselves to your senses are the objects of your meditationYou should merely look at them acknowledge them and let them goPRENTICE I dont understandHow does this differ from an ordinary state of mindBHIKKHU TISSA People ordinarily have only a little bit of mindfulnessThey are usually not attentive to the present momentTheir minds are scattered constantly wandering here and there thinking about the past thinking about the future thrashing about with desire and aversion  just as we spoke of earlierThey are always in a hurry to be someplace other than where they are and as a consequence they pay as little attention as possible to what is going on right before themIf you stop and think about it you will realize that most of the time the ordinary mind is without mindfulness and far away from matters at handBy consciously practicing mindfulness we counteract the wasteful agitation of the mind and return it to the present moment which is after all the only place we can really live and workPRENTICE So meditation is really a kind of training for the mindBHIKKHU TISSA YesJust as we train our overt behavior by observing the moral precepts we train our minds with the practice of meditationPRENTICE Is paying attention to the present moment all there is to meditationBHIKKHU TISSA NoBare mindfulness must be linked with concentration  samadhiMindfulness is the observing the investigating the attention to phenomenaConcentration is the focusing power that holds our attention continuously to any objectThen we must have a further development of mindfulness called sampajañña  clear comprehensionHaving fixed our attention on an object having held it there and acknowledged the object dispassionately we need this factor of clear comprehension to know what the object is to fully comprehend it to know what if any action is required of us and what benefit or danger the object representsIf we have clear comprehension of all acts we perform we will be able to distinguish the true from the false and the noble from the ignobleCarried to the highest level such a practice can dissolve the difference between daily life and meditationPRENTICE You refer to objects Are there special objects recommended for meditationBHIKKHU TISSA Any material thing or mental phenomenon can be an object of meditationWhatever we can cognize by means of eye ear nose tongue body or mind can be scrutinized as the Buddha teachesPRENTICE That covers just about everythingI can see you really mean it when you say that daily life itself should be meditationBut tell me do teachers recommend specific objects or exercises to their studentsBHIKKHU TISSA In your reading have you come across something called the Four Foundations of MindfulnessPRENTICE Yes I think so but to tell the truth my memory is a bit weakBHIKKHU TISSA In the MahaSatipatthana Sutta the Buddhas great discourse on mindfulness four categories or foundations of mindfulness are explainedFirst there is contemplation of the body kayanupassanaThis concerns everything of a physical nature that arises in our own bodiesThe Buddha has declared that in this very fathomlong body with its perceptions and thoughts there are the worlds origin the worlds ending and the path to the worlds ending In other words everything we need to discover and understand to reach liberation can be found right here in the bodySo mindfulness applied to the body and its processes is especially fruitfulThe second foundation of mindfulness is called vedananupassana  contemplation of feelingsPRENTICE What do you mean by feelings  emotionsBHIKKHU TISSA NoFeelings here refers specifically to pleasant feelings unpleasant feelings and neutral feelingsEvery object which appears to us arouses feelings which may be pleasant unpleasant or simply neutralTo practice vedananupassana is to notice mindfully the nature of these feelings  without I might add clinging to pleasant feelings or trying to avoid unpleasant feelingsFor any meditation to be effective it must be without partiality or graspingPRENTICE Now that sounds difficultNot to prefer pleasant feelings to unpleasant feelingsBut please go onBHIKKHU TISSA The third foundation of mindfulness is cittanupassana  contemplation of mental statesThis means observing the character of the mind at any given momentFor instance is the mind happy unhappy troubled elated slothful energetic concentrated unconcentratedAnd so onPRENTICE But how can the mind observe itselfIts a paradoxBHIKKHU TISSA Not reallyThe problem is only one of languageWe use words like mind as mere conventionsActually what happens is that mindfulness observes or contemplates the mind  which is nothing but a collection of processes  and notes what its character is at any given momentPRENTICE I seeSo contemplation of mental states concerns everything that is going on in the mindBHIKKHU TISSA NoContemplation of mental states concerns only the character or state of the mind at a particular timeFor the contents of the mind or the specific phenomena that engage our attention we refer to the fourth foundation  dhammanupassana or the contemplation of mental objectsIn this practice mindfulness is directed toward the mental objects that the mind deals withThese may be ideas memories concepts hopes fears thoughts of all kindsPRENTICE Why are these called foundations of mindfulnessBHIKKHU TISSA Mindfulness is the same thing no matter what its objectBut as a practical matter we need to be directed to specific objects or classes of objects in order to learn what mindfulness is and how it operatesThe Four Foundations of Mindfulness are specific aspects of experience on which we can set up or establish our practiceFor instance in contemplation of the body kayanupassana we direct our attention to the body and note the experiences that rise to our attention out of the bodyIn formal sitting practice a teacher will likely advise a student to concentrate on a single bodily object such as the breathing or the rising and falling of the abdomenMindfulness is founded on the body and built up by repeated effort and exertionThe procedure is exactly the same with regard to feelings mental states and mental objectsPRENTICE Are the four foundations then purely arbitrary categoriesBHIKKHU TISSA Not at allThe four foundations concern distinct aspects of human experience which we usually confuseRemember that Buddhism emphasizes the necessity of selfexaminationIn practicing the Four Foundations of Mindfulness we gradually learn the useful lesson that what we take to be the self is in fact a collection of quite impersonal processesThe body is we discover just a body not a selfFeelings are just feelingsMental states are just mental statesMental objects are just mental objectsPRENTICE Yes I understand thatBHIKKHU TISSA Excuse me MrPrenticeYou may understand my wordsYou may agree with what I am sayingBut let me impress upon you that you have to reach these conclusions for yourself in your own direct experienceReal understanding depends on seeing for yourselfPRENTICE I hope I can do thatBut what you said a moment ago troubles meIn connection with contemplation of feelings you said that we should not prefer pleasant feelings to unpleasant feelingsHow is such a thing possibleBHIKKHU TISSA In practicing any of these contemplations the meditator aims only to be mindful of the rising and passing away of phenomenaWhen he experiences a certain kind of feeling for instance he merely acknowledges it for what it isIf it is pleasant he notes it as pleasantIf it is unpleasant he notes it as unpleasantIf it is neutral he notes it as neutralPRENTICE But Bhikkhu Tissa surely nobody can help preferring the pleasant to the unpleasantBHIKKHU TISSA The Buddha doesnt expect us to like what is unpleasant or to dislike what is pleasantThese feelings are what they are  agreeable or disagreeable or neitherWhat the Buddha does expect us to do is to set aside desire and aversion and simply observe what isDesire and aversion cloud our understandingWhen practicing any of the contemplations I have mentioned dont hanker after something you dont have and dont run away from something you do haveYou should stay exactly where you are and note with equanimity whatever appearsPRENTICE Are you saying that we should endure any kind of unpleasantness without trying to do anything about itBHIKKHU TISSA Not at allThe Buddhist path aims at the total elimination of suffering rememberOne who starts along the path does indeed diminish the suffering or unpleasantness in his lifeEven a highly experienced practitioner will experience unpleasantness yet this need not be a problem because he will understand the unstable nature of all phenomena and will not indulge in vain clinging or aversionBy developing equanimity in the face of changing circumstances he frees himself from the jungle of likes and dislikes and their attendant miseriesHe refrains from graspingMental and physical events occur  he knows them for what they are only knows them and does not take the further step of celebrating or lamenting themPRENTICE That must require a highly developed mindBHIKKHU TISSA Every highly developed mind was once a wild and ignorant mindIf you practice the Buddhist path earnestly you will begin to train your mind and make it less dependent on changing conditionsBy practicing mindfulness you recognize impermanence within and without youAll phenomena are changing with incredible speed arising and perishing flowing on and onIf you see this truly you will no longer wish to cling to anythingPRENTICE It all comes back to craving doesnt itBHIKKHU TISSA Craving lies deep in the mind deeper than we can imagineBy practicing the Dhamma we come to know ourselves better and better and gradually we see where craving hidesIf we are attentive we will understand that craving continues as long as it is nourished by ignoranceIf we fall back into our old slothful habits of mind we may be sure that craving will go on generating suffering in our livesThe wheel of cause and effect just keeps on turningIf on the other hand we develop morality concentration and wisdom we will be able to diminish and ultimately destroy craving and the suffering that follows itThere is a task to be done we can do it or not as we choosePRENTICE And if we choose not to do it what happensMore of sameBHIKKHU TISSA More of samePRENTICE So its my responsibilityIm feeling this more and moreHappiness just will not happen to me by accident will itBHIKKHU TISSA The joys of the world come and go MrPrenticeCertainly permanent happiness will not come to you by accidentPRENTICE Is it possible to grasp real permanent happinessBHIKKHU TISSA No it is not possiblePRENTICE NoBut is it possible by not grasping to attain such happinessBHIKKHU TISSA Yes it is possiblePRENTICE Oh I see  excuse me I begin to seeBHIKKHU TISSA Words of Dhamma are written down in booksWords come out of the mouths of monks and laymenIt is worthwhile to listen and rememberBut it is not enoughPRENTICE Bhikkhu Tissa if a person were to  if I were to start on the Buddhist path could I be sure of  I mean do you think I would  succeedBhikkhu Tissa says nothingMrPrentice waits nervouslyIt is twilight now the air heavy and fragrant and stillThe darkness thickens moment by momentBhikkhu Tissa makes no answer at allMrPrentice fidgets uncomfortably in the silenceAt last he realizes that the monk is not going to replyEventually in some embarrassment he breaks the silence himselfPRENTICE Oh yesYes of courseA foolish questionIt only came to my mind because I feel I should do something  do thisWhat youve told me makes me think that  I mean I want to be free I doAfter a moment Bhikkhu Tissas voice floats out of the shadowBHIKKHU TISSA Go easy MrPrenticeKeep your mind in the present momentLook at your own hand there clutching the grass so tightly and nervouslyJust release it thats itLet go easyPRENTICE All rightBHIKKHU TISSA Now keep on letting goPRENTICE Keep onOhYes venerable sirA moment passes then he straightens upIts getting lateIf youll excuse me Ill be going nowBHIKKHU TISSA Good night MrPrenticePRENTICE Thank you for your advice Bhikkhu TissaYouve cleared up a number of doubts I hadI think I  well enough saidHe gets stiffly to his feetGood night venerable sirHe starts off across the lawnBHIKKHU TISSA MrPrenticePRENTICE SirBHIKKHU TISSA Stay mindfulPRENTICE YesIll tryMrPrentice goesBhikkhu Tissa remains where he is as the evening descendsGrass tree and monk are lost to viewTime goes on passingThe author an American from Louisville Kentucky graduated from Dartmouth after majoring in EnglishAn actor and a writer he spends his free time in reading meditating and DhammaactivitiesHis previous publications with BPS include Radical Buddhism and To the Cemetery and BackThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIn this city as in all the dead are granted a little spaceOur business and pleasure take us past the old iron gates a hundred times on the way to seemingly more immediate destinationsBut on this odd morning when time hangs lightly and pure chance finds us here gazing over these hills of stone and ivy let us actually turn our steps into the cemetery and along its crooked pathsThe day is fine the flowers glisten with last evenings rain and a fair fragrance rises with the first breezeJust inside the gates someone stands at an easel and paints flowersFarther off a caretaker trims a hedgeThe signs are propitious  we shall have privacy but not solitude and the mornings grace restrains the onslaught of gloomWe may even carefully allow ourselves to think thoughts appropriate to the placeOn these finely tended hillsides the music of birds mingles strangely with the numberless testimonies of deathThe earth is halfpaved with the stone remembrances and the middle air is full of obelisks and angelsNames and dates surround us some sharp and raw some worn nearly to oblivion all crowding upon us with the particulars of spent lives  of this family of this age with these virtues with this hope of heavenWhat can this mean to us especially if we have no family hereThe wind flings a rag of shade across the bright grass We too shall dieThe birds sing on the bees hum in the violets and the thought is not so terribleNot so terrible we remind ourselves if the fever of life ends here swathed in honeysuckles and southern airsWe stroll on reading the chronicles of grief beloved wife infant aged three days daughter son darling childrenGenerations are drawn from the world by the chain of mortalityDo these stones mark an ending or only a continuanceThe deceased fare on according to their deeds while we living stay to grieveWhere is there an endThese picturesque stones only mark the limit of our knowledgeDress them how you will O gardener they bespeak our helplessnessThe rumble of the city dwindles and fails in these granite acres until a somber stillness attends our stepsDespite our resolutions and the sparkling sun we are troubled and would turn back to the gates but unaccountably we are lost and the hills roll on with their bare legendsNothing to do but keep walkingAssuredly we still live and while we live we can try our philosophies against enormous mortality around usLook now a butterfly flails at the air in what we hope is joyBeneath that tomb lives a chipmunk  see him frisk about and vanish down his holeWe are briefly cheered and then plunged in doubt for why should we lament the extinction of life and hail its repetitionWe grow weary of sentiments careening back and forth and wish for equilibrium within the volatile universeSamsara we are told is the terrible round of birth and death but this disquiet this resolution of doubt  is it not samsara as wellHardly can we set a foot down for fear of treading wrongly so crowded is this cemeteryWe walk narrowly wobbling on over the beautiful terrible hillsHere where the path straightens for a moment let us pause and experiment by closing our eyesAt once the world collapses into red darkness and the pressure of the wind and sunNow we shall take a step hesitantly feeling the gravel underfoot imagining boundaries and perilsWe move furtherSomewhere the ground drops off but whereAnxiety throws its coils around us and we are walking through our minds  with danger unseen but guessed on every sideOpen eyesThe world blurs back to us green and lovely composing itself slowly and almost mockinglyAre we quite sure what is realAre we quite sure we understand deathHeres an iron bench in the shade we can rest and consider our positionEyes closed or open its mind that assembles our worldMind stirs up fear mind accommodates grief mind moves thoughts and limbs according to its natureWhat is this natureTo judge from our confusion and instability it is restlessnessWe are it would seem not firm in space or conviction not fully in control of anythingIf we watch closely here in the semisilence we may discern the flutter the whir the unease of this shifting mindIt knows not itself it knows not the world it only wants and hates by turnsThe odor of flowers heaves it momentarily to paradiseThe chiseled history of dead children hurls it down to despairA crow on a stone angels head call forth a smileA fresh name on an old monument chills usDelight pulls us one way grief anotherNeither can bear us across doubt or fearThe mind runs endlessly in moments that flare and fizzleThere is a beingborn and a dying with every one of them  a birth and death of every thought and every breath happening right here while we worriedly scan the horizon for a supposed Great DeathConsider this dying that goes on all the time  fits of memory and feeling spasms of cells torrents of desire and aversion all tumbling in birth and death birth and death  the weary reiteration of samsaraEach instant ends but gives no rest because it ignites its successor and in this the physical death memorialized around us is no different  the troubled flame of being is passed on and onWhat we fear out there among the graven sorrows of the cemetery is burning in here in the mind right nowDeath has been our neighbor long before we came to ponder headstonesThe Buddha understood thisWe as yet do not and tremble in the presence of innocent stone  wideeyed toward the symbol blind to the blazing factSitting here alone while the shade splashes silently around us we hold all the worlds in our lap and can study them as the Buddha taught us not with hunger but with the clean dispassion that lays bare truth and liberates the beholderThe Buddha called craving the source of suffering and indeed as we bend our attention closer what do we find but craving nesting even in the fractured momentEvery little death every wretch of disappointment is preceded by a birth an upsurge of craving founded on ignoranceBeing blind to the true nature of things we continually give rise to passion that veers this way and that never satisfied forging link by link in the moment the chain binds us over the yearsEvents in themselves are only events the deluded mind invests them with horrors and delights and ties the mortal chain around itselfThis cemetery with its solid stones is only a mirror into which the Buddha bids us look to find the funeral procession within ourselvesSay we look thenSay we are able to observe the deplorable state of our mindWhat can we do about itIf birth and death are whirling on so mechanically and inexorably all efforts would appear futileIndeed though we begin to notice the cascading instability of body and mind our mere intellectual recognition does nothing to free usBirth  that is the uprising of craving  will of necessity be followed by death  that is the pang of impermanence and lossBut craving itself is not an inevitable phenomenon it springs up only in the soil of ignorance and when ignorance is dispelled craving and its resultant miseries cease to existThe whole teaching of the Buddha drives to this endWe are urged to strive diligently to see things as they are to resist craving to observe it unsparingly to uproot it altogetherAll the defilements and afflictions of mind exist as it were with our permissionNot knowing we have the power to end them we go on muttering Yes go ahead theres no help for it But when we realize we do have the power to alter the painful course of life our excuses will no longer sufficeWe must look closely fix on a straight line and sail by the three points of morality concentration and wisdomSpurred by these thoughts we rise from the iron bench and continue walking through the endless field of gravesThis business of being alive once seemed simple  either you were or you werent  but even a brief contemplation reveals surprising complexitiesIt appears we have long considered death as a single grim monolith that will one day thump us on the head while in reality death is subtle manifold and coexistent with the mind that fears itOur steps drag slowly over the gravel and around us the cemetery seems more empty than everThere is nobody to be seen even the birds have vanished and our solitude is completeThe question must arise now if we have misunderstood death have we not misunderstood its corollary life as wellIf what we have been calling death is not singular and unique but threaded throughout the living process can we even draw a clear and meaningful distinction between the twoHere we must turn to the Buddha who did not speak of life and death as independent realities but rather pointed out that experience is a continual becoming a process of ceaseless change a flux of arising and perishing  which is to say samsara the great wheel of cause and effect on whose flashing rim no beginning and no end can be foundAs we examine mind and body we feel increasingly the inadequacy of conventional words such as birth and death We have taken definitions for granted and now find them useless when we need themExperience upsets imaginationWe are forced to ask ourselves Whatever these words mean who is it that is born who is it that lives who is it that dies Having so grossly misunderstood events we reach desperately for the one who undergoes events but can we even find such a oneThe Buddha many times patiently explained that human beings are temporary compounds of five aggregates form feelings perceptions mental formations and consciousnessThese aggregates are constantly changing but so swiftly that they appear to retain a distinctive identity  hence the conventional notions of you and I But such words and ideas are only conveniences which do not accord with ultimate realityLife and death are only the continual becoming of the five aggregates within which there can be found no indwelling core no identity or permanent self Well we may ask does suchandsuch a person live or notOf course we may say that he or she or they or I live  it is true enough on a mundane levelWe are all in a sense lost beings wandering through cycles of existenceBut we must clearly understand that ultimately there are only the five aggregates spinning through birthanddeath afflicted with pain and pleasure weighted with ignorance and goaded by desire and fearThe question Who becomes meaningless as we study mind and bodyHere we find instability misery and doubt burning in rightful chain reactionRather than searching futilely for an owner of the fire hadnt we better put it outThe Buddha did not proclaim the Dhamma in order to satisfy our curiosity about the origin or end of the universe or to reveal startling secrets or to stimulate worshipHis purpose was to teach us to put an end to suffering  the same suffering we feel now as we contemplate these symbols and evidences of deathBy investigating with dispassionate minds we come to see things as they really are seeing them we turn away from the destructive habit of craving turning away we are by degrees liberated from all sufferingWe may be familiar with this idea and may even give it our intellectual assent but until we make it work in our daily lives we must remain in doubt and under the sway of continual deathWe shall be buried soon enough  shall we stay in the tomb till thenThe light of insight can dispel the charnel darkness and free the suffering mind even in this present lifeIf the present is well attended to the future will take care of itselfWe look up through sunlight and find that our steps have gone full circle just beyond a bank of ivy and flowers stand the gaunt gates of this cemeteryThe painter has gone the caretaker is nowhere to be seen nobody accompanies us on this quiet journeyWe pause by a final marker an old one whose legend has been eaten by timeIt lays flat abject to the sky speaking no longer any name of man but uttering the truth of impermanenceIts individuality has been effaced  it is scarcely more regular then random nature  but still it declares in the soundingbox of thought the ineluctable fate of all compounded thingsIt will bear our names as easily as any others and indeed already does so  let the wise man read his ownThe death of the body is real as are the small convulsions of flesh and thought in the present momentLet us drive to the end of all of theseNo evasion shall avail us no distraction blur the sight  this marker is our ownIt shall not yield to the blows of hope or fear but only to the long cool gaze of wisdomWe issue from the iron gates into the churning city once again and the granite hills slip into distance and memoryWalking familiar pavements we find strangely that we carry still a mood or vision before which all objects fall into atoms and aspects of the Buddhas revelationThe city shows as many symbols as the graveyardAround us life burns as profligately as gunpowder  in getting and spending gaining and losing craving and hatingWe see buildings avenues hurrying people but if we are careful we also see that we are really still walking among monuments in the mindWe make our fate right hereThe cemetery and the city are oneShall we continue to build upon our little insightIts not so hard the body moves feelings spring up mind comprehends mental objects succeed one another  all these may be observedIn city or cemetery the process is the same  let us simply keep looking noting with cool attention the flow of the phenomenaThe defilements of mind cannot stand the scrutiny they must perforce dissolveWho shall oppress us thenLife till now one long fatality may unfold in understandingWhen birth and death are understood they are overcome and with them all manner of sufferingWhoever realizes a little should he not strive to realize moreWhoever would be free should he not lay hands on his chainsWhoever would act rightly should he not found his actions on knowledgeThe Buddha has declared the nature of suffering its origin its end and the means to its endHis words hang in the air  pregnant epic awesome  until we begin to move by their guidanceThen they become living truthThen the dark and mortal way we tread brightens with direct experienceFinal emancipation may be far or nearWhat matters is the goingWithout quite intending it we find ourselves over the years burdened by more and more responsibilities difficulties and doubtsIt seems practically a consequence of growing olderTime passes like a river  so smooth to our puzzled eyes  but leaves as if by magic these boulders on our backsAll of us but the very young sense this weight and wonder why since we asked for none of it it settles on us and will not be shirkedTroubles old and new bear on us despite all the care we take to persevere ourselves and to build our castles against a turbulent worldWe will all of course acknowledge the possibility of catastrophes which could plunge us into genuine grief at any moment but why now as we live in relative comfort and health should we feel this weight on the heart this strain of apprehensionLittle annoyances and thorns of worry are just part of life we tell ourselves as we make our way between the twin imponderables of birth and deathIf we are brave determined and optimistic that should be enough should it notYet even in our joys there falls the shadow  the menace of great forces around us the obscure sadness looking back at us from the mirror the occasional sense of overwhelming futility and frailtyWe look around wondering who is to blameIf no culprit is forthcoming we may turn with suspicion to the great grim world at large and wonder if its influence goes deeper than the indigestion occasioned by the evening newsEven if we are personally healthy and prosperous perhaps malaise of the times has subtly infected usIf the age we live in is corrupt and decadent can we remain altogether uncontaminatedWhat sort of age is this anywayProbably all but the most fanatical optimists have from time to time while hearing of the latest crime or war or degradation of human decency considered the proposition that the world has gone screaming madThe iniquity of mankind these days seems to surpass the merely incidental and to approach willful dementiaMoral values retreat before the onslaught of hysterical cruelty and lust and everywhere we see wicked fantasy enthroned  mankind and nations having lost faith in the god and the rightScience once hailed as our deliverance labors mightily and produces bombs and video games to pacify  in one way or another  the frenzied multitudesBut there is no peaceDrugs alcohol and insanity hang on the communal body like leeches draining what life remains and imparting a fever of nihilism that burns fearfully bright with decadent delightsThere is a murmur of woe but little resistance for who can turn the trend of historyThe honest man  never easy to find  fades from view as evildoers are first excused then celebrated by the timid and the enviousLike a wornout carousel our society jangles and wheezes toward collapseThe instinct of most of us in times such as these is to keep our heads down and hang onto our pleasures and possessions and bear our pains as best we mayWe wish to run no risks in a world with chance so badly skewed against usThe result is that we are trapped closeted with our fears while the storm rages worse outsideHere in this tight space dread grows and the possibilities for remedy are fewOn television maniacally cheerful people contrive to sell us happinessBuyEnjoyExperienceOut on the streets glowering zealots paste up posters urging struggle war confusion and the death of their enemies  after which presumably mankind will enjoy blissCivilization appears to be spiralling down into awesome decadence and the fall of Rome comes to the minds of those not altogether oblivious to historyIts an unpleasant thought so we take shelter in our small delights or else in the blandishments of psychological and religious quacks who  for a fee to defray the costs of their own indulgences  will tell us anything we want to hearDo we feel guiltyIts probably someone elses faultAre we tempted by viceGo ahead fulfill yourselvesWill we have to give up anything to achieve happinessOh neverPerish the thoughtA golden age is dawningMost of us avoid the worst excesses of the age  not out of sturdy virtue so much as out of a trembling sense of selfpreservationBut all of us Buddhists included feel the sickness in our surroundings and grow fearful hiding where we canIn a dark age who can blame our cautionYet the trouble with such caution is that it may mask mere cowardice or slothLet us examine the matter a little closerDoes this hobbling failing century really qualify as a dark ageWithout pressing evidence to the contrary we are apt to regard our own woes as the worst ever endured by the raceBut if we read a bit of history we will be hard put to champion the depravity of our own age against the pastIf we define dark age as a period when the light of understanding is eclipsed and evils multiply what age of history may not be called darkThe perfidy and wretchedness of our ancestors must give us pause and take the edge of our own complaintsWars plagues persecutions and crimes abound in every eraTheres plenty of horror to go around and the special poignancy of the present version is only that its happening to usHowever dark the world may appear to us we are not justified in retreating to the extremes of hedonism or nihilismThere is a task to be done and that task is not  as many people believe  to readjust self society or world to fit our blind desiresRather it is to train ourselves to the point where we know reality for what it is and free ourselves of the burdens of passion that now oppress usThis task faces all Buddhists though we are reluctant to admit it and tend to excuse ourselves on the grounds that the times are so bad and responsibilities so weighty that we cannot  most regrettably  take on the additional project of earnest Dhamma practiceThe woes of nations and the afflictions of persons are thereby perversely made reasons for not doing anything and the way of Dhamma is implicitly called a burdenAs if it were not suffering that first impelled the Buddha toward liberationAs if the Dhamma were not the means to that liberationSome of us may even rationalize to the extent of believing that since the times are too difficult for us to make a genuine effort toward emancipation they are probably too difficult for everybodyThe days of high attainment are gone and with them any reason to exert ourselves beyond a modicum of morality and ritual observanceWith war crime and madness round about we have enough trouble just saving our skinsBetter to keep our heads down and lament cruel fateYet to look honestly at ourselves and the Dhamma must bring us to another conclusionOne era may be better or worse than another  as the world goes  but old age sickness and death come to allAnxiety depression and grief come to allIf we cannot overcome them now how should we ever face them in heaven or a golden age when we are swimming in blissWhat motivation would we have thenA dark age will pass in five years or five hundred the age of dukkha neverThis pervasive suffering coarse or fine settles like dust on us  swiftly or slowly with the winds of circumstanceWe cant outwait it yearning for a golden age which if it ever came could only enervate us and leave us none the wiserLet it rain champagne the heart will still thirstNo time is worthier than now for we have no other timeThe past expires at our feet the future is being wrought for our present actionWe need not pretend that the world is good or evolving toward an age of light or deny the dangers that beset us in this savage century but we should rouse ourselves with the knowledge that the serenity and happiness preached by the Buddha remain as accessible now as ever transcending and abolishing the jungle of the yearsA thorn in the mind is the father of all griefsThe Buddha teaches us to pull it outThe author an American from Louisville Kentucky graduated from Dartmouth after majoring in EnglishAn actor and a writer he spends his free time in reading meditating and DhammaactivitiesReproduced from The Washington BuddhistThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseBuddhism comes West as a vast body of teaching and we who receive it are often awed by its abundance its complexity and its subtletyWhere is the center the real thing we should fix onOr is there a real thing at all to be apprehendedHistory shows that Buddhism can and will accommodate itself to new cultures and will flourish according to the perceptiveness and energy of its new adherentsNow in the West our perceptiveness and energy are put to the test to grasp the real thing by which this religion lives  its radicalismThe Buddhas only point the way and the way they point is a difficult one through the perfection of morality concentration and wisdom to the freedom from suffering called NibbanaIt is a way of actionA path is useless without the will to follow it and good intentions alone are futileTo make the journey the roots of mental defilement must be torn out entirely the old illusions we live by must be shattered the mind must seek the lightIt is a radical way because the Buddha enjoins us to give up what is before give up what is behind and give up what is in betweenThen and only then will the wheel of birthanddeath be knocked from its axisThose of us in the jaded and desperate West who hear the resonance of truth in the teachings of the Buddha must hear also that urging to act to start an inner rebellion against our ancient sloth and stupidityYet the more we ponder the more we recognize the enormity of the task and an understandable reaction is to set about redefining just what has to be done and just how prudent it might be to fling ourselves into actionThe danger here  so typical in our comfortable and seductive society  is to forget the radical imperative of suffering and try to make over Buddhism into a tame amalgam of platitudes suitable for pleasant contemplation  praising it in order to avoid practicing itIndeed Buddhism is rational patient deep in wisdom but should we then just bask in its reflected lightComplacency is deathIf out of custom and timidity Western Buddhists turn their religion into a museum piece or worse a hobby they lose the essenceIt is easy enough to settle for an undemanding status quo a modicum of calm a pleasant sense of harmonious living and it is easy enough to postpone or forget any effort to break the shackles of old delusion believing that one need not strain when the road will likely be longBut in accommodating too much to personal or societal expediency we cheapen our ideals and slide further from the disturbing implications of the Noble Truth of SufferingWe may even take the Buddhist vision of kamma as an indication that everything is as it should be But everything is not as it should beEverything is in fact miserableIf we are complacent we blind ourselves and there is no safety in blindnessIn the radical view of the Buddha Samsara is no cosmic merrygoround but a terrible juggernaut of birth and death dragging beings through endless cycles of woeFree yourselves says the BuddhaAll lives and events are variations on the theme of sufferingAll are without substance endurance permanence  merely a web of emptiness void upon voidThe self that everyone spends so much time defending and nurturing is pure fictionDismiss it says the BuddhaThe world will not conform to our wishes and to presume otherwise is folly the disciple must cease clinging to it and proceed along the path to the end of sufferingThe root problem is craving and the radical solution is the destruction of craving through wisdomThe sober truths taught by the Buddha squarely faced present us with problems and choicesAre we to assume that every Buddhist ought to be off grunting in a cave sweating his way toward enlightenmentIs this the radical conclusionActually the dilemma is not so formidableThe Buddha taught gradually according to the capacity of his hearers to understand and practiceEvery person should devote himself to the teaching as far as he is ableThe goal is ultimately the same for all though progress along the path depends on the individualThe Dhamma of the Buddha will lead us to the safety of Nibbana and it will also sustain us along the wayWhat matters is always to bear in mind where we are and where we are headedThe radicalism of the Buddha is probably no more difficult for Westerners to comprehend than for anyone else yet we are especially concerned with it now because the teaching is only just now settling into our culture and its future direction is uncertainIt is a critical time for the religionThe fundamental teachings must not be neglected lest we take to wearing our religion like warm slippers and doze into mediocrityUnderstood rightly the Noble Truths are profoundly disturbingThey compel us to act to pursue the ideal of emancipation no matter how difficult the journey appearsBuddhism truly goes against the stream of the world and demands an uncommon vigor of the discipleHow well we respond depends on individual choice and ability but what matters most is the recognition that a response is called for that a path does exist and that the goal can be achievedUnderstanding the basic teachings Western Buddhists should be wary of tendencies to turn Buddhism into an instrument of secular reform or a philosophical playground or an esoteric hobbyBefore all else there is suffering and the path to the end of sufferingThere is no safety in faddishness complacency or the compulsive intellectualism that hungers for truth but eats the menu instead of the dinnerTo reach the truth to reach deliverance we are told to give up what is before give up what is behind and give up what is in betweenThe essence of Buddhism is to let go of everything to cease clinging desperately to transient woeful empty phenomenaThe disciple who acts on this breathtaking advice may find the bottom dropping out of this fictitious worldSo be itThus begins the journeyThough seldom stated in so many words a cherished belief of all human beings is that happiness lies in the satisfaction of our desiresAll our actions are usually predicated on this seemingly selfevident factWe are devoted to obtaining the objects of our desire we consider it our right our duty and indeed our highest aspiration to get what we want to obtain what we think will bring us enjoyment satisfaction or fulfillment We are accustomed to asking one another What do you want out of life believing that if we can settle on some clear vision of happiness and go after it then all will be wellUnfortunately experience has a way of overturning our theoriesThose manifold objects we yearn for prove troublesome to capture when captured they yield less pleasure than expected when held onto they decay and cause us griefThen we are driven to turn for relief toward other enticements and thereby renew the cycleSomehow we believe that if only this search for gratification is conducted correctly if only the right objects are selected if only we can have a little luck to add to our efforts then we can certainly attain that permanent happiness that now eludes usBadly thumped by fortune we doggedly tell ourselves Yes its worth all the pain and turn a swollen eye toward fresh delightsBut is it worth all the painConsider a succulent worm bobbing just below the surface of a pond attracting the attention of a hungry fishIn a flash the fish swallows the worm only to discover the hidden hook the barb that rips into its innards and causes it terror suffering and ultimately deathThe worm is attractive but it delivers little satisfaction to the fishSuch is the nature of sensepleasuresThose objects of eye ear nose tongue body and mind that we find so alluring are more likely to cause us misery than happiness and the surprising truth is that it is not so much our choice of objects that is at fault but the mere act of choosing in the first place since all phenomena of this world are in reality flawed connected to suffering and unreliableAccording to the Buddha true happiness is not to be found in the deceptive sensepleasures of the world  not in wine or wealth or rosesNo matter how hard we try we can never reach security as long as we persist in wrong views of the desirability of this or that sensual objectWithout a clear understanding of the nature of phenomena our search is doomed from the outsetOur first task must be to confront the facts that the universe does not exist for our amusement and that such pleasures as we customarily derive from it are false impermanent and unworthy of our interestWhile the Buddha does not deny the existence of enjoyment in the world he points out that all worldly pleasure is bound up with suffering inseparable from suffering and sure to give way to sufferingTherefore in embracing the pleasant we cannot help but embrace the unpleasantOur craving prevents us from realizing these facts by continually projecting a false appearance on the world convincing us that the tempting objects around us can actually be possessed and squeezed dry of some satisfying essenceWithout the intervention of wisdom craving will keep us running from one disappointment to anotherThough we have many times taken the bait of sensepleasure and suffered the inevitable pull of the hook each new worm that comes wiggling through the water excites the heedless manThe Buddha teaches that the solution to the terrible union of pleasure and pain is not to struggle hopelessly to split them apart but to view the whole contaminated mass with detachmentAll phenomena share the same characteristics of impermanence unsatisfactoriness and unsubstantiality so it is futile to single out some objects for liking and others for loathingThe whole cast of mind that sees things in terms of likingandloathing must be abandoned in favor of the detached observation called mindfulness Clearly if the bait hides a hook we do best to curb our appetitesForsaking attachment to sensepleasures is a logical application of the Four Noble Truths yet even among those who subscribe to the teachings of the Buddha there can be found a deepseated reluctance to move from theory to practiceThe hold which craving has over our minds is so tenacious that we tend to straddle the abyss between truth arid illusion hoping to live in both with some fast philosophical footworkFor example may we not propose that sensepleasures are not in themselves harmful and may therefore be enjoyed in moderationWe may propose it but we are apt to justify thereby any craving that enters our headsAs long as one regards any experience as personal or desirable one remains mired in ignoranceThere are pleasant unpleasant and neutral feelings arising in the mind they come and they go they are to be observed not sought after because it is such seeking or craving that sustains the round of sufferingAnother common notion is that Buddhism may be employed to beautify life by making the individual more appreciative of the harmony of the universeThis is false on two countsThe Buddha did not aim to put a pleasing comforting face on things but to educate the individual to the ultimate worthlessness of sufferingdominated conditioned existenceAlso the only harmony discernible here and now is the implacable and impersonal law of cause and effect  not the blissful oneness beloved of poetsA third erroneous notion is that sensepleasures may be pursued full speed if they are part of worthy efforts and worthy goalsThis is a selfserving rationalizationWhile mundane aspirations may be quite wholesome in conception as long as they provide a surreptitious vehicle for craving they are flawedFor the proper development of insight one needs to get rid of the idea of an ego or self that enjoys possesses and appropriatesThe nobleminded man is detached from both ego and worldHe acts for the welfare of himself and others without thought of reward or gratificationHe is indifferent to results he is not swayed by the pleasant and the unpleasantIn considering the lure and danger of sensepleasures it is not difficult to see that most of us will ultimately defend our indulgences not from logic but from the blind urge I want What harm we reason can there be in a little innocent delightTo clarify the harm lies not in the sensation but in the deluded mind that fastens onto the sensation and clings to it obsessivelyWhat behooves the diligent Buddhist is to get beyond the whole idea of liking and disliking to set it aside to cease entertaining it  in order to advance to the fruitful fields of direct insightSuppose then that we acknowledge the danger of the baited hook and agree that the restless craving mind is a source of sufferingWhat do we do about itOften we complain I cant help myselfI know its dangerous but I cant help it Anyone who has tried to oppose his own ravenous appetites for pleasure amusement or gratification knows this sense of helplessnessA mind long accustomed to grasping is not dissuaded by mere rational arguments it goes its own way chewing up one experience after another in a hopeless search for happinessSo what is to be doneThe trouble here as is so often the case is one of selfdeceptionAlthough we may say we understand the danger of sensual obsession and the advantage of restraint our weakness shows that in fact we do notWisdom is simply incompatible with defilementAs long as we are willing to compromise with our obsessions we have not fully understood the Buddhas teaching about the nature of realityWe mayrecognize intellectually that craving and clinging lead to suffering but we have not penetrated to a direct experience of the truthMuch work remains to be done we cant simply throw up our hands and plead weaknessIf we truly recognize the hazards of succumbing to the baited hook we must resist its enticementsYet the Buddha does not recommend a stubborn stoical selfabnegationThe disciple must deal with the problem intelligentlyEscape from suffering does not depend on obliterating or denying sensepleasures but on seeing them for what they are through the systematic practice of mindfulnessIn ordinary life we are generally too caught up in gaining and losing to give sufficient attention to the elements and dynamics or the processWe are borne along on these ancient waves only because of compulsive habitTo stop our headlong career it is essential to develop and apply mindfulness to cultivate scrupulous attention toward even the most mundane habits and desiresSteady mindfulness intensified in meditation reveals that the mind is a ceaseless torrent of thoughts feelings perceptions and mental impressions  never still for an instant never stable enough to be considered substantial or enduringWhat we loosely term the external world is likewise a blur of evanescent phenomena all changing with incredible speed arising and vanishing with no beginning or end in sightWhere then is the object that is truly desirableGoneLost to view in the instantWhere is the one who desiresGoneThought succeeds thought effect succeeds cause in a tumble of empty foam with a desiring self nowhere to be foundMindfulness discerns these truths directly examining and breaking down experience until the permanent is understood as impermanent until the pleasant is understood as unsatisfactory until the self is understood as empty and unrealAs with all of the truths taught by the Buddha these three characteristics of existence must be realized through direct insight  not just through the ruminations of the intellectThe practice of mindfulness can lead us to such insight if we undertake the task with patience and impartialityOne who luxuriates in craving will remain twisting between misunderstood suffering and imagined pleasure but one who recognizes danger will shun the baited hook and seek the bare facts of reality beneath the dazzling magic show of the sensesBy avoiding the baited hook of sensepleasures we do not as is sometimes maintained rob life of all its joyOn the contrary we abandon false satisfaction and approach the true happiness that is born of freedomWe take worldly enjoyment in moderation keeping it in perspectiveThe wise disciple does not dwell in gloom and try to see the bad side of every experienceIf it is pleasant he notes it as pleasant if it is unpleasant he notes it as unpleasant if it is neutral he notes it as neutralWhatever its appearance he regards it with mindfulness and does not cling to itHe enjoys life simply as he finds itIn so doing he escapes the peril of hook and line and sails freely toward the end of sufferingAgain and again the Buddha exhorts his followers to be mindful because the world is burning with greed hatred and delusionFreedom can be won but not by the careless infatuated personThe one who attains freedom will be the one who has mindfulness energy and the courage to see the canker in the roseA veneer of credulity and feeble optimism covers the dark preoccupations of our livesIn an age marked everywhere with signs of spiritual decay we somehow remain ever entranced by new toys ever receptive to the latest balderdash from noisy charlatans and ever ready to abandon the present moment for the lure of the nextLet it be rumored that selffulfillment has been glimpsed in somebodys book or therapy or religion and immediately a cloud of dust obscures the sun as we stampede into the new territory  only to find ourselves puzzlingly still in the same dull companyDo we really want happiness or only titillationIts hard to say because we rarely sit still long enough to examine the matterSuspecting dimly that life is treacherous we keep moving fast to avoid calamityIf we are credulous we are no less skepticalWe are quick to believe but find belief intolerableWe topple todays idols and from their fragments eagerly assemble tomorrowsWe pace up and down the shores of doubt rousing one another with shouts of encouragement but stepping into the river we find the water cold and promptly conclude theres a better crossing further downThe water is always coldSomebody sees a vision over the horizon and the chilled troops waste no more time at this spotIn our solitary reflections we may notice our inconstancy and regretfully wonder Has it always been thus If we are Buddhists we are bound to answer Yes This endlessly mutable landscape of disappointment this lurch and halt of conviction is called SamsaraWe are accustomed to regarding the cycle of birth and death as a remote cosmic scheme of creation and dissolutionIn fact Samsara whirls with cyclonic force here in the prosaic moment here in the wavering and furtive mindIf this is that isOut of ignorance rises craving out of craving rises the whole mass of anxiety and sufferingWe deceive ourselves even in our desire for happinessOur pursuit of pleasure or selffulfillment is also a flight from despairUneasy with the deteriorating present we leap with unseemly greed toward the future which fictitious creature that it is soon fails us and leaves us exactly where we wereThe great wheel turns and has turned and will turn againFreedom from Samsara does not spring from finding the right teacher or the right temple or the right style of meditationsWe must instead begin by discarding false expedients brief enthusiasms fashions platitudes and most of all excusesSelfexcuse is just grease for the wheelAh we sigh if only we had met the Buddha in personVain foolishness thisThe Buddha was never to be found in six feet of fleshIn his time and in ours he is only seen in the destruction of the defilements in the giving up of excuses evasions and willful blindnessIf we earnestly strive to distinguish between the false and the true the shallow and the profound the path of the Buddha takes shape before usBut after so many years of quick credulity and quicker doubt of lukewarm and ambivalent effort how can we make it across that cold lonely river of ignoranceIf we divest ourselves of false and trivial comforts shall we not be left nakedIndeed we shallAnd it is in precisely that condition that we may encounter the BuddhaBuddhism is after all a religion of renunciation  renunciation of wrong thoughts wrong speech and wrong deedsWhen we give up our shabby illusions and the manifold hiding places of the mind we find ourselves naked and ready for the first time to see the world without distortionWhereas before we may have nominally accepted the reality of impermanence suffering and nonself now we may begin to discern these truths directly and realize our predicamentThe old cliche The Buddhas only point the way strikes us with fresh significanceBuddhism demands that we help ourselves and here on the long empty shore where we have so often wandered we may at last appreciate the task aheadThe world around us may be crass and wicked but not so crass and wicked as our own deluded mindsWe feast on the bones of cynicism and are not satisfiedWe give new names to iniquity and pursue it in shadowsWe mistake the pleasant for the good and perennially follow the easiest courseThen in our accidental nights of fear we stare in bafflement at the four walls and ask ourselves Havent I tried Silence replies with silence and theres nothing left for us but to blunder after a new ghost of happiness and thereby give the wheel of Samsara another spinCredulity is not faith nor is skepticism wisdomThe noble follower of the Buddha proceeds with a balanced mind considering the world as he finds it shunning the harmful and welcoming the usefulHe crosses the flood of Samsara on the raft of Dhamma knowing that nobody will make the effort for himWhat distinguishes such a person from his fellows is not necessarily brilliance of mind but plain and simple perseverance the resolve to follow the true course no matter how long it may takeWe can do likewise if we set ourselves firmly on the pathDelay is the luxury of ignoranceWe commonly suppose Nibbana the ultimate purity and freedom to be something infinitely far away and terrifically difficult to reachWe think of the Buddha as long departedBut Nibbana is near for those who would have it near and the Buddha is as close as true Dhamma truly observedWhat is required of us is to let go of our crumbling mortal toys and to come down alone to the long shore of renunciationIn that exhilarating solitude we may meet the Buddha whose body is wisdom whose face is compassion and whose hand points out the waypoints directly to the deep and hidden purity in our heartsEarly spring is a fitting time to consider death though few of us alas appreciate this healthy practiceWhen the first crocuses and skunk cabbage blunder into the sunshine the conventional mind waxes bold and brave and salutes the regeneration of the worldWe have won through once more weve got another chance we shall dawdle barefooted in gardensGone is the dark time the emphatically dead winter of land and heartWe are surely about to participate in the general leafiness of thingsThe gurgling pigeons in the park  formerly wretched pests  excite our fine feelings of sympathyWe are magnanimous at seventy degreesWe have great expectationsLegions of us swarm the sidewalks with uplifted chins celebrating what we had no part in makingBut theres a certain selfdeception hereIf the sun burns more beneficently these days is it any of our doingIf it shut down altogether would we be consultedWe may fancy ourselves philosophers improvising on the rhapsody of spring but we display in the main scarcely more independence than the pigeonsWe are seduced by the flowers April throws our way and esteem ourselves wise for having noted they are prettyWe find in the loveliness of the season not a theme for true reflection but only a license for yearningWe indulge without compunction believing that we are in accord with the sacred law of the moment when really we continue to flee the present moment and lust for the unborn fixture  some garden of promise yet to bloomBetter we should turn our minds to dissolution and death  right now in the brilliant seasonAny fellow of sound faculties can stroll through late November and remark the transience of vital forcesAh withered grass leaden skies brief span of happinessHe is moved  having as he thinks come to terms with mortalityThe same fellow come the daffodils is warbling about youth and beautyBut where is the brave heart who sees deeply in spring the bud dying to the flower the flower to the fruitWhere is he who at close of the year regards the snowbitten rose and is not cast downWhere is he who lives serenely in fair times and foulAll things shall pass not only in black November but in pastel April as well  a lapsing without pause a continual perishing of the dear the unlovely and the indifferentNature suffers no moratorium on decay it unrolls itself in seasons that we with our predilections for warmth and light habitually misunderstand finding gloom this month and gaiety in thatTo dote on April is to despise NovemberWe are caught up in liking and disliking taking a sip of truth when we cant avoid it and spitting it out at the first opportunity living tentatively like winetastersWe ride the seasons on and ever on to the sweet cruel music of hope while the world burns because of us because weve lit it with the torch of delusionShould we not now starve the fire to coolness and let be the race of forms we call our lifeChange sweeps all forms away and no one can find peace in his time who does not attend to this universal movingonSo then it is spring and the bluebirds are twitteringShall we pick our scabs and visit graveyardsOf course notLet us go on breathing if the air is sweet why then it is sweetIf the rain blows off and the sun slants warm through the willow tree so be itLet us sit on the porch and be aliveNo need to scourge ourselves or sleep on gravelNo need to curse winter or praise springThey come and go independently of us dead grass dragonflies thunderstorms and snow  what scene should we prefer when all are flowingReality cannot be seized it arises when the mind stops graspingHe who lets go is he who is establishedHe lives in all seasons but serves noneThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseMudita means appreciative joy at the success and good fortune of othersEvaluation of achievement is a precursor to mudita and appreciation a component of muditaSeeing the good in others and learning to recognize and admire what good there is is what mudita tacitly impliesLaughter and exhilaration are not characteristics of muditaMudita is joy and appreciation flowing quietly out of the core of ones heart towards others like the waters from a spring flowing outwards from the bowels of the earthSpontaneous and sincere participation in anothers glorious hour is possible only when the quality of mudita is developed to its fullestGenuine joy in the prosperity of others is indeed a rare qualityThe virtue of mudita may be best noticed at work in the joy of parents over the success of their offspring and in the genuine ecstasy of teachers over the success of their pupils particularly in the latter situation when the threat of the younger eclipsing the older is always imminentWhile it is easy to practice mudita within the narrow circle of ones family and friends to identify oneself with the joys and triumphs of outsiders requires deliberate effortYet the capacity for doing so is rooted in mans natureSmiling faces of adults make children respond readily with their own smilesThis potential in the child should be nurtured and activated by parents and educationistsFor the seed of mudita planted early in a child will grow and blossom and bear fruit in his adolescence and in his adult lifeTo some extent man is a product of his environment  with this in mind adults parents teachers and wardens who handle children should be of a cheerful disposition and an appreciative natureLatent in man are both noble characteristics as well as vicious tendenciesIt is strange that the vices latent in man seem almost natural and spontaneous whereas the dormant virtues have to be brought to the surface with great effortAs one advances in years activating and developing the potential of mudita becomes more and more difficult  though not impossibleSeeds will not take root in hard and crusty soilOne has to loosen and soften the soil if one expects shoots from seedsIn children the heart is tender and seeds planted therein will take root early and grow fastSo the best time to activate and develop the positive and saintly tendencies which lie dormant in every human being is during the tender yearsWhen a child receives praise and approbation he will naturally learn to give it to others for he knows the joy of recognition and appreciationEnvy and jealousy are the chief opponents of mudita or appreciative joyThese noxious qualities arise partly out of a lack of confidence in ones achievements and ones capacity to achieveDislike boredom  nuances of the Pali term arati  may be considered as enemies of muditaThe opposite sterling virtues which can vanquish these enemies are lovingkindness metta and compassion karunaMudita is placed third in the listing of the Brahma Viharas for mudita is the natural outcome of the two preceding benign mental statesMetta and karuna are the forces that urge one to alleviate the sufferings of others with purely altruistic motives expecting nothing in return  not even gratitudeWhat matters to the Buddhist is the little bit of joy he has brought to anothers heart by relieving him of even a little bit of sorrow of sufferingLittle do people realize how a kind word a warm smile a loving touch can act as a balm to a sorrowladen heartWe can now see how mudita becomes a natural result of metta and karunaToo often people are much more ready to sympathize with the misfortunes of others than to rejoice with them in their good fortuneWhere is a definition of a friend What are friendsAre they not dear sweet people who abuse you behind your back and take an inward deep pleasure in hearing of your faults and misfortunes We have to take ourselves to task whenever we recognize these psychological perversities within us and with great effort try to eradicate these unwholesome tendencies which seem to be deeprootedWe have to be honest with ourselves and look withinWhenever traces of envy or jealousy enter our hearts we should recognize the emotion as one which is unwholesomeWe should also make an effort not to let it take hold of usLet us ask this question Why are we enviousBecause someone possesses something we do notWhy do we not have that which we want that which would give us joyThe answer lies in our own kammaIn the light of the Buddha Dhamma no one is to blame but ourselvesThe greatest sorrow for a woman is the inability to bear a childWhy accumulate more bad kamma by envying those who have childrenUnwholesome states of mind such as hatred and anger are said to be the causes of infertilitySo why promote such a state in a future birth too by continuing that evil train of thoughtThis line of thinking of arguing needs very great effortIt is not easyThat is why the Buddha praised effort viriya as a noble virtueIf it were not possible to do good I would not tell you to said the BuddhaThis mode of thinking helps to eradicate delusion  mohaThe source of all unwholesome kamma is ignorance of mohaWhen the vail of moha is lifted one sees clearly that craving is the source of all sorrowsCraving gives rise to jealousy envy covetousness avarice greed  all enemies of muditaLet the fertile woman not look down upon her less fortunate sister who is denied the great joy of motherhoodLet not the one endowed with beauty scorn her plainlooking sisterLet not the wealthy insult the poorAfter all we must remember that this earthly existence is but a short sojourn in our journey through SamsaraThe Buddha says there is no one on earth who has not in a previous existence been a mother a father a sister a brother a child to usSo let us suffuse the whole world with metta with karuna and with muditaThis is why the Brahma Viharas are described as appamanna  illimitablesThey are socalled because they find no barrier or limitThey embrace all living beingsJealousy can poison a mans system mar his character and ruin his social relationshipsAnd what is life but a series of relationshipsIt is only in death that we are aloneToday jealousy and greed for power have poisoned the mind of the worldWe now witness jealousy on a global scaleWe are destroying each other and our home  the earthThe situation at the present is so very grave that we can no longer talk of individuals or groups or nationsWe have to speak for EarthCarl Sagan the eminent astronomer exasperated by the wanton destruction of our beautiful little planet and its resources asks Who speaks for Earth The practice of mudita never seemed to be as important as in the present dayThe forces of evil seem to have been unleashed in full measure in human hearts the world overAdvances in science and technology have been of immense value to mans material progress and development but the negative byproducts of this progress are truly frighteningDestruction of natural resources pollution unhealthy rivalry and dangerous competition have reached such colossal proportions that life on earth is threatenedDiscoveries and inventions in the fields of science and technology should be for a better and more comfortable lifeBut now many of those discoveries are a threat to life itselfIt is indeed depressing that the irony of this situation is not considered with sufficient concernThe ills of the world are insidiously increasing so that there is a growing sense of cosmic gloom and defeatismMans predicament as perceived by the modern poet George Barker is embodied in the following wordsLooking on dejected and dispirited is not the solutionWe have to struggle to save ourselves and our planetThis is why institutions like the United Nations Assembly existThough satisfactory results may not always be forthcoming the fact that while a section is destroying inventing weapons of hate another section of mankind is arguing demonstrating petitioning for peaceAs long as such forces opposing evil are in existence there is hopeThis means that there is still sympathy and love in mens hearts for their fellow beingsSo we must be hopefulConflict is eternal conflict is naturalConflict helps us to rediscover lost valuesWe must not see only hatred in conflictConflict is the natural prerequisite of a satisfactory solutionA section of the world today is enveloped by the thick veil of delusionHence their inability to see the truthFailure to perceive the Truth is delusionSo it is with persistent effort and enduring patience that those who wish to be noble and serviceable must sublimate themselves and serve humanity both by example and by preceptThe cultivation of mudita and the practice of this virtue can relieve humanity of the suffering it has brought upon itselfThose with right understanding must by personal example work out salvation for themselves and for their fellow beingsDiligent practice of mudita will make a person more amenable flexible and understandingHe will learn to live outside himselfHe will experience a new kind of happiness the joy of sharingThis virtue will elevate him to eradicate the cankers of jealousy and egoistic craving We and ours will be substituted for me and mine Wholesome camaraderie will build up and he will gradually embrace the whole world with lovingkindness  sabbe satta bhavantu sukhitattaThe ego will gradually disintegrate and he will gain insight into anatta the Buddhas central doctrineThe fetters of attachment to self will break first and with it all other fetters of attachment which will lead him gradually toward renunciationThe Buddha advocates the sharing not only of material resources but of spiritual resources as wellThe transferring of merit to our dear departed ones is a truly beautiful sharingOur loved ones who are no more with us physically feel such a sense of joy in the thought that they are not forgotten the joy that accrues to them by our enlightened acts is anumodanaMankind is on the eve of a nuclear warSure and certain destruction will be the fate of the human race if war breaks outNow is the hour to muster benign forces within the human heart on a global scaleThe virtues of metta karuna mudita and upekkha must be practiced to combat the degrading forces of greed and hatred which cause dangerous divisionsOnce the sparks of divinity in mens hearts are released all divisions of creed colour religion and race will recede into insignificanceThen only one creed will be in evidence the creed of humanitySo let us activate cultivate and develop the sublime qualities  Brahma ViharasThese powers hidden within the human heart are yet untapped yet it is through these powers that humanity can be savedThis seems to be the way  the only way out of the present entanglementThe answer of the enlightened One given centuries ago embodies the solution to the present tangleIt is in fact the answer to every generation  past present futureHe who succeeds says the Buddha in disentangling this tangle is the wise man established well in virtue who has developed consciousness and understandingMetta is a sincere wish for the welfare and genuine happiness of all beings without exceptionIt means that which softens ones heart  a friendly dispositionJust as a mother protects her only child even at the risk of her own life even so should one cultivate lovingkindness towards all living beings It is not the passionate love of the mother that is stressed here but her sincere selfless wish for a genuine welfare of her childMetta transcends all boundaries of caste class race and religionIt is limitless in size and range it has no barriers no discriminationsThink of the number of instances during a day when your actions are colored by discriminationWhen your unfortunate servant boy accidentally breaks an article you shout at himWhen your own child does it you tolerate itThat servant boy is also somebodys child who through bad kamma has come under your roof to do your menial work  to do your biddingWhen you strike a blow across your dogs back for trampling your flower bed do you realize the unwholesome state of your mind at the moment of such actionYou may even be a person who recites the gathas and the suttas who goes to the temple who observes the Eight Precepts who listens to sermons who gives almsBut at the moment of such discriminating actions you have turned away from the DhammaAt some time you may bide the time waiting for an opportunity to take revenge on someone who has slandered youDuring that period of waiting  please think of the BuddhaEnact in your minds eye the story of Cinca Manavika or the courtesan SundariThen your little embarrassments and heartaches will fade into insignificanceMetta is described as a divine state which cannot coexist with anger or hatredHatreds never cease through hatreds in this worldThrough love alone they ceaseThis is an eternal law Goodwill lovingkindness benevolence and universal love are suggested as the best renderings of the Pali word mettaA point to be clarified here is that metta is not synonymous with ordinary affectionThe world cannot exist without mutual affectionBetween parents and children between husbands and wives between teachers and pupils between friends exist varying degrees of affectionThis affection is natural and metta has to be cultivatedA benevolent attitude is the chief characteristic of mettaOne who practices metta is constantly interested in promoting the welfare of others  not only in his family and friendsSuch a person is sincere when he says May all beings be happyAnother very important point that should be clearly understood is that in exercising metta do not ignore yourselfHow often do you say Oh I got so angry with myself or I can never forgive myselfSome hasty words or actions on your part fill you with resentment towards yourselfRemorse though a fine corrective is an extreme form which can bar your progress when indulged in again and againThere are times when you may even make yourself mentally and physically illSo the most important person to make friends with is yourselfRemorse regret diffidence and hopelessness are negative tendencies the existence of which can never result in a friendly disposition towards oneselfMetta is a positive qualityUnless you feel friendly toward yourself you cannot be friendly towards othersTo the world outside you may appear to be welldisposed towards others and give the impression of possessing a benevolent magnanimous natureBut be aware of yourselfBe honest with yourselfHonesty is the starting point towards selfpurificationAll men have their frailtiesWhat is meant by making friends with oneself does not mean that we expect to find within ourselves only that which is good and perfectWe talk about understanding peopleLet us understand ourselves firstLet us recognize our strong points and feel satisfied about themLet us recognize our failings and strive towards lessening or eradicating themLet us not throw away our lives by throwing away that friend that is in usI or myself should be the central or starting pointMetta radiates from oneself to others so it is very important to feel a sense of goodwill friendliness wellbeing towards oneselfThis is a subtle point which has to be clearly understoodThe Buddha radiated metta equally towards his adversary Devadatta Yasodhara his royal wife and Patacara the demented woman his royal father Kind Dusshodana and Sopaka the humble lowcaste youthMetta then should be extended towards friend foe and mere acquaintances alikeThe identification of oneself with all beings making no difference between oneself and others is the culmination of mettaThe ideas of me and mine are building blocks of barriersMetta dissolves barriers and loosens all constraintsWith the diligent practice of metta division evaporates and humanism is realizedSuch a mind is free from illwill and this freedom is bliss or sukhaIllwill is the antithesis of mettaAnger hatred aversion are related qualitiesMetta cannot coexist with such unwholesome attitudesDisparaging condemning and belittling others is possible only through illwillPointing out anothers faults with the intention of leading him towards good does not mean a lack of mettaParents teachers and elders often have to resort to various methods of correction and reform where the young are concernedBut one has to be very watchful when one is engaged in such activityThe motive has to be analyzed carefullyElders sometimes react in angerAt such moments one must question oneself Was it to avert a disaster to the other that one acted soOr was it merely giving vent to ones own anger which oppressed oneA mother who could not convince her son that the path through the jungle was unsafe and that he should take a safer route exclaimed in despair May a bear maul you The son departed and the mother radiating metta towards her son hoped and prayed that no harm should befall himThough the jungle was infested with wild animals the lovingkindness which radiated from the core of the mothers heart towards her son was a weapon against the fierce jungle beastsMetta one has to understand is a powerful weapon against evil  and protects one from many pitfalls in lifeMetta is a constructive healthy force with the power of combating hostile influencesJust as anger can produce toxic effects on the system benign thoughts can produce soothing healthbringing physical effectsMany instances in the Buddhas life illustrate the fact that the peaceful thought vibrations of the Buddha produced salutary effects so much so that the intoxicated elephant Nalagiri and the wild Angulimala were completely subduedThe magnetic power of metta is indeed deeply rewardingMetta has a liberating influence on the one who possesses it and on the one to whom it is extendedIn our daytoday lives with its trials tribulations and complexities the art of being friendly is fast disappearingWe act like automatonsWe are so wrapped up in ourselves in our own affairs that we hardly think it is necessary to spend time over anything that is not connected directly to ourselves and our affairsWe must teach our young the value of a friendly dispositionWe must do it by example more than by preceptIn our homes in our schools in our places of work if this simple quality of friendliness is allowed to pervade the atmosphere our corner of this earth can be a little haven  a true homeLet us fill our hearts with metta and let us make our hearts a home where peace and love and friendship will dwellJust as a watercourse is dammed and directed through channels towards a chosen direction so too the mind must be bent and consciously directed towards good towards virtue towards righteousnessTo amass wealth to dig up the treasures from the bowels of the earth man makes laborious efforts and spends enormous sums of money but to dig up the invaluable treasures of the mind man makes little or no effortBut to make the effort man has first to realize he has first to understand the mysterious and mighty potentialities hidden within his mindOn the other hand if though well aware of the natural destructive forces within him man makes little or no effort to curb them he thereby causes untold misery to himself and to othersLatent in man are both saintly characteristics and destructive tendenciesIt is strange that too often the vices latent in man seem almost natural and spontaneous whereas the dormant virtues have to be brought to the surface with great effortIt is worth noting that every vice possesses its opposite a noble virtue which may not appear to be natural and automatic yet which lies within the range of every personAnd so man lives enveloped in miseries of various typesMan is never happy never satisfied always frustrated always wanting something more something newHis mind is constantly in turmoil and the misfortune is that he thinks that this has to be the natural condition common to allThis is delusion or mohaIt is a pity that man does not realize that all these fears sorrows phobias and miseries are mindmade  and can be eliminatedA man can live in a constant state of bliss and joy devoid of unnecessary sufferings and live life to its fullest if only he would live the word of the Buddha for the word of the Buddha embodies peaceThis is why the arahats often utteredA desert traveler with parched lips and burning soles will be gladdened on hearing that an oasis is not far offBut he will not experience real joy until he tastes its waters with his lips and dips his soles in the cool watersIn like manner the word of the Buddha gladdens our hearts but we should not stop until we have tasted the bliss of that noble state which is the panacea the only panacea for all the ills of the worldThe Dhamma is to be lived not merely to be read about or listened toListenThinkPracticeIn our daytoday lives in the course of being engaged in our daily chores we should think of the innumerable times when we have neglected the word of the BuddhaYet the incense chamber of the Buddha should be created within our hearts and that fragrance must pervade every thought every word every action of our waking lifePurify your mind said the Blessed OneNow think of the numberless unwholesome thoughts that daily pollute the mindWe speak and we act impulsively rashlyOur words and our actions are often harsh we cause pain of mind to others which in turn brings on remorseA whole train of unwholesome thoughts are unleashed as a result of our inability to control our mindWe get angryThat anger even results in chemical changes in the body which can be injurious to our health and to the wellbeing of othersAnd then we repent for a lifetime a few words uttered impulsivelySo realizing the unhappiness we bring upon ourselves and the suffering we cause others we must first understand and accept the fact that we are not on the right pathWhat is the remedyDo not let the mind driftTake hold if itCultivate itWhat is cultivationIt is meditationIt is a process of mind cleansingWhat are the steps leading to purification of the mind which is the heart of the Buddhas messageTo know the mind  that is so near to us and is yet so unknownTo shape the mind  that is unwieldy and obstinate and yet may turn to pliantTo free the mind  that is in bondage all over and yet may win freedom here and now The Heart of Buddhist Meditation by Nyanaponika TheraTo know the mind one has to watch it from moment to momentTake a few minutes off your daily chores and sit down in a quiet place and be mindful of your thoughtsWatch carefully the thought processes coursing incessantly through your mind like the rising and falling away of the ocean waves but continuous  in a neverending flow they arise and they fall awayRecognize each thought as pleasant or unpleasant as the nature of the thought may beWe have to be honest with ourselvesWe must recognize jealousy as jealousy know it to be unwholesome cast it aside and substitute its antidote or opposite  which is appreciative joy or muditaWe can gradually increase the period of watching by a few minutes each dayAfter some time we will find that when watching and perceiving all shades and nuances of thought pass through our mindWith practice this process will become automatic natural and effortless even while we are engaged in our daily activitiesThis is as it should be  a very desirable condition for our wellbeing for then we will be constantly mindfulAn action performed with mindfulness will be a skillful actionThe result or vipaka of such action will be pleasant and goodSo constantly our mind will be suffused with satisfaction joy and blissLet us look at a few of the common unwholesome states which too often pollute our mindsAnger is a destructive vice which can be subdued with lovingkindness or mettaAggression is another vice that is responsible for much human suffering errors and atrocitiesIts antidote is compassion or karunaJealousy poisons ones systemIt has a corroding effect on a person like rust on metalIt will destroy a personAppreciative joy or mudita is the remedyThere are other universal characteristics that upset the equilibrium of manThey are attachments to the pleasurable and aversion to the nonpleasurableThe opposite force is equanimity or upekkha which alone can combat these two subtle but most prevalent defilements ever present in the mindImpregnated in the vices mentioned are the germs of a dreaded disease which seems to be taking its toll of many human lives todaySelfdestruction depression a sense of hopelessness despair gloom pessimism meaninglessness of life are some of the symptoms of this dreaded disease which leads to so much unhappinessThe disease is ignoranceThe cure for the disease is the substitution of the opposite virtues for each of the latent vicesThis will lead to the recognition of the beauty of life its worthwhileness its purposefulnessThe substitution of wholesome pleasant thoughts is a recognized form of mental therapyThese virtues tend to elevate manIf cultivated with diligence man will realize that the earth is such a beautiful place that human life is noble and that it is still possible to gain peace for oneself and for othersMrsEileen Siriwardhana graduated from the University of Ceylon in English Singhalese and PaliShe is now the Principal of Visakha Vidyalaya the premier Buddhist Girls School in ColomboShe is also a distinguished writer in SinghaleseThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseTruly it will be not long before this body lies in the earth bereft of consciousness like a useless piece of wood which is thrown awayUsually uninstructed worldly minded people do not think of death and do not like any pointed reference made to it by othersSuch unreflecting uninstructed people often shut their minds deliberately to the fact that death is waiting for themThey reject the possibility of a future life and occupying themselves only with things of this life immerse themselves in the ephemeral joys of the five strands of sense desireTo make such people think seriously on what is perhaps the most decisive event of life they have to reckon with  an event that will determine their future lives in no uncertain way  the Blessed One said Every householder and every one who has gone forth should constantly reflect I am subject to death The uninstructed worldlyminded man sees others dying around him but through intoxication with the pride of life he acts as if he were immortalHe sees the victims of disease around him but due to intoxication with the pride of health he acts as if he were immune from diseaseEnjoying the first flush of lifes springtime he sees many an old man in the last stages of decrepitude but owing to his pride of youth through becoming intoxicated with it he acts as if he may never grow oldAnd he sees many people losing their wealth and becoming paupers suddenly but through his being intoxicated with the pride of power or position he does not pity them does not sympathize with them and does not think that he too might be overtaken by similar misfortuneThus intoxicated by these and many other intoxicants he behaves like a man beside himself heedless of right and wrong heedless of this world and the world beyond enjoying fleeting pleasures like a crab in a cooking pot before the water heats upEven in his dreams he does not suspect that evil might befall him but when he actually does he loses control of himself weeps and bewails his lotReflection on death if rightly practiced by a man opens his eyes to the individual essence of every form of being its true nature and removes the poison of pride which makes him heedless of his welfareHe sees them according to the words of the Buddha Uncertain is life certain is death it is necessary that I should die at the close of my life there is deathLife is indeed unsure but death is sure death is sureHe who thinks often of death becomes ardent in the fulfillment of his dutiesTherefore it is said The bhikkhu who is given to the practice of contemplating death becomes diligent Visnusarman says In the wise man who thinks again and again of death the terrible penalty all activity becomes lax like leather bindings soaked with rainThus in those who seek immortality all kinds of endeavor exertion to acquire worldly power and possessions become slack through the perception of death but they do all that has to be done for attaining the deathless stateIn the teaching of the Buddha the contemplation on death is intended to turn the mind away from the accumulation of mundane power and treasure and to increase the energy of the aspirant for highest freedomEven at the moment of death one has to do ones duty wellReflection on death quickens the mind and makes it develop unremitting ardor for the extinction of illSuch reflection can never make one negligent of actions leading to freedom from cravingWho thinks often of death thinks thus Now is the time to endeavor to realize the goalWho knows that Death will not come till tomorrowWhat covenant have I with Death and his hosts to keep them at bayThose who frequently entertain the thought of death become convinced of the impermanence of all formations and the futility of emotion in the face of deathHere it is good to remember how our Buddha acted as a bodhisatta and as a Buddha when death assailed him as well as those near and dear to himIn his bodhisatta days long before he became the Enlightened one he developed the mindfulness on death and urged the members of his household too to develop itAnd when his son died suddenly bitten by a snake while he was working in the field he did not wail or lamentHe thought that the destructible had been destroyed and Death had claimed what was his and reflecting thus he went on workingThen seeing a neighbor passing he sent a message to his wife which she understood and she and the rest of the household came to the field and all of them together made a pyre just in that field and burned what was the remains of one who was dear to all of them without any one of them shedding a single tearWhen the Buddha was told of the passing away of the venerable Sariputta Thera who was considered the Commander of the Army of Righteousness the Blessed One said this to the venerable Ananda Thera who was upset Tell me Ananda did Sariputta take the aggregate of virtue along with him and become extinctOr did he take the aggregate of concentration along with him and become extinctOr did he take along with him the aggregate of wisdom and become extinctOr did he take along with him the aggregate of freedom and become extinctOr did he take along with him the aggregate of knowledge and insight of freedom and become extinct  No venerable sir  Have I not indeed told you before that with all that is dear pleasing involved are change separation and variationThe Buddha shows that it is not possible to stop the breaking up of what is born produced and put together and what has the nature of breaking and compares the venerable Sariputta Thera to one of the greater branches of the mighty tree of the community of bhikkhusComparable to the breaking of a bigger branch of a mighty tree says the Buddha is the venerable Sariputta Theras passing away and no one can stop the breaking of what is breakable by ordering that thing not to breakThe Blessed One taught many persons such as Kisagotami the nature of death and led them through the gateway of the perception of death to immortality by making them follow the path of virtue concentration and wisdom in due orderThat is to say by making them first establish themselves in virtue and with virtue as the powerful condition making them bring about concentration and then with concentration as the powerful condition making them bring in to being wisdomThe Buddha himself and every one of his disciples passed through the seven purifications and the four stages of sanctitude to the ending of illWhat is deathIt is the vanishing the passing away the dissolution the disappearance the dying commonly called death the action of time the break up of the aggregates the laying down of the body of a beingOr it is what takes place when vitality actionproduced heat and consciousness leave the body and the body is fit to be abandoned as useless for work activityThis body says the Buddha is abandoned when life warmth and consciousness leave it and this body which is bereft of sense becomes the food of othersOnce when the Blessed One was staying at Ayodhya on the Ganges he spoke thusBhikkhus if in any manner this river Ganges were to bring a great ball of foam and an intelligent man were to see it reflect on it and thoroughly examine it then to that man who sees reflects on and thoroughly examines it worthless would that ball of foam appear empty and without essenceIndeed bhikkhus how can there be essence in a ball of foamIn the same way bhikkhus a bhikkhu sees reflects on and thoroughly examines form of any kind past future or present internal or external coarse or fine low or high far or nearTo the bhikkhu who sees reflects on and thoroughly examines it worthless would form appear empty and without essenceIndeed bhikkhus how can there be essence in formIf in any manner bhikkhus when in the heavy rain of autumn a bubble rises in water and passes away and an intelligent man were to see it reflect on it and thoroughly examine it then to that man who sees reflects on and thoroughly examines it worthless would that bubble appear empty and without essenceIndeed bhikkhus how can there be essence in a bubbleIn the same way bhikkhus a bhikkhu sees reflects on and thoroughly examines feeling of any kind past future or present internal or external coarse or fine low or high far or nearTo the bhikkhu who sees reflects on and thoroughly examines it worthless would feeling appear empty and without essenceIndeed bhikkhus how can there be essence in feelingIf in any manner bhikkhus when a mirage quivers at midday in the last month of the hot season and an intelligent man were to see it reflect on it and thoroughly examine it then to that man who sees reflects on and examines it worthless would that mirage appear empty and without essenceIndeed bhikkhus how can there be essence in a mirageIn the same way bhikkhus a bhikkhu sees reflects on and thoroughly examines perception of any kind past future or present internal or external coarse or fine low or high far or nearTo the bhikkhu who sees reflects on and thoroughly examines it worthless would perception appear empty and without essenceIndeed bhikkhus how can there be essence in perceptionIf in any manner bhikkhus a man who moves about having need of heartwood in search of looking for it were to enter with a sharp axe a forest see a giant young banana tree grown faultlessly cut it at the root cut off its top and strip the rind from the stalk he by stripping the rind from the stalk should not come even to sapwood how to heartwoodWere an intelligent man to see it reflect on it and thoroughly examine it then to that man who sees reflects on and thoroughly examines it worthless would that banana stalk appear empty and without essenceIndeed bhikkhus how can there be essence in a banana stalkIn the same way bhikkhus a bhikkhu sees reflects on and thoroughly examines formations of any kind past future or present internal or external coarse or fine low or high far or nearTo the bhikkhu who sees reflects on and thoroughly examines those worthless would formations appear empty and without essenceIndeed bhikkhus how can there be essence in formationsIf in any manner bhikkhus an illusionist or his apprentice were to produce an illusion at a junction of four great roads and an intelligent man were to see it reflect on it and thoroughly examine it then to that man who sees reflects on and thoroughly examines it worthless would that illusion appear empty and without essenceIndeed bhikkhus how can these be essence in an illusionIn the same way bhikkhus a bhikkhu sees reflects on and thoroughly examines consciousness of any kind past future or present internal or external coarse or fine low or high far or nearTo the bhikkhu who sees reflects on and thoroughly examines it worthless would consciousness appear empty and without essenceIndeed bhikkhus how can there be essence in consciousnessThe instructed noble disciple who sees thus turns away from form and also from feeling perception formations and consciousnessTurning away he detaches himselfWith detachment he becomes freeWhen freed he knows I am freed and understands Birth has been exhausted the excellent life has been lived what ought to be done has been done and there will be nothing more to come of this Further the Buddha said that one whose turban is on fire should be one who aspires to the deathless actThere is no excuse for delay in working for deliverance from ill Death is trying to take us alwaysOn a certain occasion the Blessed One went to a certain house set apart for sick bhikkhus and having sat down on a seat prepared for him said this Mindfully and with complete awareness should a bhikkhu meet his endThis is the advice I give youVibrant with compassion for suffering humanity the wise being bent on supreme enlightenment the Sambodhisatta thought My forbears accumulated much wealth and passed away taking nothing of their wealth with them nor did they return to enjoy their treasureAlasthey have been destroyed they have missed the luck of getting the best out of a good rebirthThus do the great beings in search of liberation from ill look upon life and they having made a gift of their possessions to the world go forth to endeavor for selfmastery that leads to final enlightenmentPenetrating into the centuries the millennia and the aeons with his unclouded knowledge the Master saw by means of his clear insight to the limits of the knowable and declared thusIn this sweeping on of lifes stream hard it is to find another who has not been a persons own father mother brother sister son or daughterTruly every living being might well have been associated closely with every other in this long trail of woe Where in the whole wide earth could be found a spot unpolluted of the deadSometime in Beings endless flux a living being has died wherever life manifested itself To a brahman who was searching for virgin ground where no corpse had been burnt the Master said that corpses of that brahmans clan had been burnt on that very spot on which he stood and that there is not any place on earth that is not a cemeteryEvery brand of suffering does one undergo through rebirth in diverse planes of becomingAnd there is nothing in the world that arises that is fully pleasantEverything is mixed with suffering in such a way that for the thoughtful all pleasure appears as menaced with suffering or moving on to it because of impermanenceTherefore the Foremost Speaker of Mankind the greatest teacher of the world the Buddha taught that all that is felt is embedded sunk planted immersed in suffering pain grief misery disappointment dissatisfactionAnd in view of the painladen character of being the Master set forth the wisdom of renunciation giving up detachment thus Not to be known is the start of beings enmeshed in ignorance and fettered by craving running on speeding on through interminable births and deathsNor can it be said of the running on and speeding on of ignorant craving beings that they are tending to an endAnd in this interminable process for long have you all experienced grief bitter and sharp and made the graveyards bigger and biggerBecause of that you should turn away from the formations cut them off and become free of themDuring a long process of wayfaring in samsara very rarely does one gain the state of a human beingIt is says the Buddha as if a man should cast into the wide ocean a yoke with a single opening in it and that yoke should be carried hither and thither on the water by the winds impetuosity  westward eastward northward and southwardSuppose a turtle blind of one eye should come to the surface of the sea once in a centuryWhat do you think bhikkhusWill that oneeyed turtle shoot its head through that yoke with the single hole every time it surfaced once in one hundred years  Venerable sir how may it be known should it succeed after a long time  Well bhikkhus a oneeyed turtle surfacing once in one hundred years should shoot its head through that yoke with the single hole before a man who has fallen into a state of regress returns to the human planeFully hard it is to accumulate merit when experiencing great suffering in states of loss or regress that is to say in the state of an animal trembling with fear of death at the time of seizure by net snare and the like as a draft animal painfully driven to work with various kinds of cruel punishment as a ghost tearful of face subject to insatiable hunger and unquenchable thirst with skinandbone body and exclaiming from time to time AlasWhat woeThus owing to extreme suffering in states of regress and owing to selfindulgence and intoxication with delight in the happy worlds of the shining ones the socalled gods devas a person does not accomplish much merit in such states of beingBut in the human state through the combination of a fair measure of pleasant living and the fellowship of the virtuous the door of merit is openIf one suffers as a human there is every chance of that very suffering becoming a supportive condition for growth in right understanding and for gaining confidence in the truthIn the fashioning of the sword of spiritual science which destroys ignorance and the passions the alternation of suffering and pleasure may be compared to the action of the smith who plunges the blade he is making alternately in fire and water to temper it by heating and cooling in turnHuman life with its tolerableness becomes a suitable ground for producing skillYet if human beings have the nature of the denizens of the states of regress that is of those tormented in hell the ghost plane or the animal plane then such human beings though in human guise do not accumulate meritThree are the kinds of unfortunate beings in human guise and they may be known thus the first kind by their readiness to take life and commit all kinds of violence theft lying impurity the second by their energilessness and consequent depression and misery the third by their extreme proneness to selfindulgence their lack of independence of character and their transgression of all codes of decencyThen to which kind of human being is it possible to acquire merit wholesome states of mind and a noble store of virtueOnly to that kind which has established itself firm in human righteousnessAnd what is thatIt is the state of being endowed with modesty and the fear to do evilIt is settled reliance on the fact of kammavipaka action and the result of action stretching beyond this life to lives after this until craving is destroyed through the consummate state arahatta the knowing of what is and what is not conducive to weal of self and society compassion plenitude of mental quickening to realize the good and the true according to actuality the rejection of wrong courses of action and the practice of the meritorious courses of actionOne established thus enters the place of merit for him the way to the acquisition of worth is open he grows in good he becomes pure and a true servant of the world and thereby one who pays homage to the Blessed One the Supremely Enlightened One the Teacher of the Path to ImmortalityBut all this can according to the Buddhas principles of perfection become accessible only through one way the way of friendliness of amity lovingkindness which is the precursor of all goodOnly through the way of friendly feeling mettayana magga does one approach perfection no Buddhist can consider any one as his enemyA Buddhist is a follower of the Enlightened One one who has put the idea of enmity far from himHe has to eliminate the hate in his heart before he does anything elseAnd when he gets rid of hate he has also canceled obliterated expunged all thought of another as his enemyReally the ill mannered the evil ones the undisciplined ones may be as vast as spaceIf a person regards all the bad people in the world as his enemies how many of them is he able to destroyBut when the thought of hate in his heart is destroyed then all enemies become nonexistent for him and in that sense they are destroyed for him through his becoming full of friendliness to themSo the poet says Bodhicariyavatara of SantidevaThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThere was once a pair of jugglers who performed their acrobatic feats on a bamboo poleOne day the master said to his apprentice Now get on my shoulders and climb up the bamboo pole When the apprentice had done so the master said Now protect me well and I shall protect youBy protecting and watching each other in that way we shall be able to show our skill make a good profit and safely get down from the bamboo pole But the apprentice said Not so masterYou O master should protect yourself and I too shall protect myselfThus selfprotected and selfguarded we shall safely do our featsThis is the right way said the Blessed One and spoke further as followsIt is just as the apprentice said I shall protect myself  in that way the foundations of mindfulness should be practicedI shall protect others  in that way the foundations of mindfulness should be practicedProtecting oneself one protects others protecting others one protects oneselfAnd how does one in protecting oneself protect othersBy the repeated and frequent practice of meditationAnd how does one in protecting others protect oneselfBy patience and forbearance by a nonviolent and harmless life by loving kindness and compassionThis sutta belongs to the considerable number of important and eminently practical teachings of the Buddha which are still hidden like buried treasure unknown and unusedYet this text has an important message for us and the fact that it is stamped with the royal seal of satipatthana gives it an additional claim to our attentionThe sutta deals with the relations between ourselves and our fellow beings between individual and societyIt sums up in a succinct way the Buddhist attitude to the problems of individual and social ethics of egoism and altruismThe gist of it is contained in those two concise sentencesProtecting oneself one protects others Protecting others one protects oneself These two sentences are supplementary and should not be taken or quoted separatelyNowadays when social service is so greatly stressed people may be tempted to support their ideas by quoting only the second sentenceBut any such onesided quotation would misrepresent the Buddhas standpointIt has to be remembered that in our story the Buddha expressly approved the words of the apprentice that one has first to watch carefully ones own steps if one wishes to protect others from harmHe who himself is sunk in the mud cannot help others out of itIn that sense selfprotection forms the indispensable basis for the protection and help given to othersBut selfprotection is not selfish protectionIt is selfcontrol ethical and spiritual selfdevelopmentThere are some great truths which are so comprehensive and profound that they seem to have an everexpanding range of significance that grows with ones own range of understanding and practicing themSuch truths are applicable on various levels of understanding and are valid in various contexts of our lifeAfter reaching the first or second level one will be surprised that again and again new vistas open themselves to our understanding illumined by that same truthThis also holds for the great twin truths of our text which we shall consider now in some detailProtecting oneself one protects others  the truth of this statement begins at a very simple and practical levelThis first material level of the truth is so selfevident that we need say no more than a few words about itIt is obvious that the protection of our own health will go far in protecting the health of others in our environment especially where contagious diseases are concernedCaution and circumspection in all our doings and movements will protect others from the harm that may come to them through our carelessness and negligenceBy careful driving abstention from alcohol selfrestraint in situations that might lead to violence  in all these and many other ways we shall protect others by protecting ourselvesWe come now to the ethical level of that truthMoral selfprotection will safeguard others individuals and society against our own unrestrained passions and selfish impulsesIf we permit the three roots of evil  greed hate and delusion  to take a firm hold in our hearts then their outgrowths will spread far and wide like a jungle creeper suffocating much healthy and noble growth all aroundBut if we protect ourselves against these three roots our fellow beings too will be safeThey will be safe from our reckless greed for possessions and power from our unrestrained lust and sensuality from our envy and jealousy safe from the disruptive consequences of our hate and enmity which may be destructive or even murderous safe from the outbursts of our anger and from the resulting atmosphere of antagonism and conflict which may make life unbearable for themThe harmful effects our greed and hate have upon others are not limited to the times when they become passive objects or victims of our hate or when their possessions become the object of our greedBoth greed and hate have an infectious power which vastly multiplies their evil effectsIf we ourselves think of nothing else than to crave and to grasp to acquire and possess to hold and to cling then we may rouse or strengthen these possessive instincts in othersOur bad conduct may become the standard of behavior for those around us  for our children our friends our colleaguesOur own conduct may induce others to join us in the common satisfaction of rapacious desires or we may arouse in them feelings of resentment and competitivenessIf we are full of sensuality we may also kindle the fire of lust in themOur own hate may provoke them to hate and vengeanceWe may also ally ourselves with others or instigate them to common acts of hate and enmityGreed and hate are indeed like contagious diseasesIf we protect ourselves against these evil infections we shall to some extent at least also protect othersAs to the third root of evil delusion or ignorance we know very well how much harm may be done to others through the stupidity thoughtlessness prejudices illusions and delusions of a single personWithout wisdom and knowledge attempts to protect oneself and others will usually failOne will see the danger only when it is too late one will not make provision for the future one will not know the right and effective means of protection and helpTherefore selfprotection through wisdom and knowledge is of the greatest importanceBy acquiring true wisdom and knowledge we shall protect others from the harmful consequences of our own ignorance prejudices infectious fanaticism and delusionsHistory shows us that great and destructive mass delusions have often been kindled by a single individual or a small number of peopleSelfprotection through wisdom and knowledge will protect others from the pernicious effect of such influencesWe have briefly indicated how our own private life may have a strong impact on the lives of othersIf we leave unresolved the actual or potential sources of social evil within ourselves our external social activity will be either futile or markedly incompleteTherefore if we are moved by a spirit of social responsibility we must not shirk the hard task of moral and spiritual selfdevelopmentPreoccupation with social activities must not be made an excuse or escape from the first duty to tidy up ones own house firstOn the other hand he who earnestly devotes himself to moral selfimprovement and spiritual selfdevelopment will be a strong and active force for good in the world even if he does not engage in any external social serviceHis silent example alone will give help and encouragement to many by showing that the ideals of a selfless and harmless life can actually be lived and are not only topics of sermonsWe proceed now to the next higher level in the interpretation of our textIt is expressed in the following words of the sutta And how does one by protecting oneself protect othersBy the repeated and frequent practice of meditation Moral selfprotection will lack stability as long as it remains a rigid discipline enforced after a struggle of motives and against conflicting habits of thought and behaviorPassionate desires and egotistic tendencies may grow in intensity if one tries to silence them by sheer force of willEven if one temporarily succeeds in suppressing passionate or egotistic impulses the unresolved inner conflict will impede ones moral and spiritual progress and warp ones characterFurthermore inner disharmony caused by an enforced suppression of impulses will seek an outlet in external behaviorIt may make the individual irritable resentful domineering and aggressive towards othersThus harm may come to oneself as well as to others by a wrong method of selfprotectionOnly when moral selfprotection has become a spontaneous function when it comes as naturally as the protective closing of the eyelid against dust  only then will our moral stature provide real protection and safety for ourselves and othersThis naturalness of moral conduct does not come to us as a gift from heavenIt has to be acquired by repeated practice and cultivationTherefore our sutta says that it is by repeated practice that selfprotection becomes strong enough to protect others tooBut if that repeated practice of the good takes place only on the practical emotional and intellectual levels its roots will not be firm and deep enoughSuch repeated practice must also extend to the level of meditative cultivationBy meditation the practical emotional and intellectual motives of moral and spiritual selfprotection will become our personal property which cannot easily be lost againTherefore our sutta speaks here of bhavana the meditative development of the mind in its widest senseThis is the highest form of protection which our world can bestowHe who has developed his mind by meditation lives in peace with himself and the worldFrom him no harm or violence will issueThe peace and purity which he radiates will have an inspiring uplifting power and will be a blessing to the worldHe will be a positive factor in society even if he lives in seclusion and silenceWhen understanding for and recognition of the social value of a meditative life ceases in a nation it will be one of the first symptoms of spiritual deteriorationWe have now to consider the second part of the Buddhas utterance a necessary complement to the first Protecting others one protects oneselfAnd howBy patience and forbearance by a nonviolent and harmless life by lovingkindness and compassionHe whose relation to his fellowbeings is governed by these principles will protect himself better than he could with physical strength or with any mighty weaponHe who is patient and forbearing will avoid conflicts and quarrels and will make friends of those for whom he has shown a patient understandingHe who does not resort to force or coercion will under normal conditions rarely become an object of violence himself as he provokes no violence from othersAnd if he should encounter violence he will bring it to an early end as he will not perpetuate hostility through vengeanceHe who has love and compassion for all beings and is free of enmity will conquer the illwill of others and disarm the violent and brutalA compassionate heart is the refuge of the whole worldWe shall now better understand how those two complementary sentences of our text harmonizeSelfprotection is the indispensable basisBut true selfprotection is possible only if it does not conflict with the protection of others for one who seeks selfprotection at the expense of others will defile as well as endanger himselfOn the other hand protection of others must not conflict with the four principles of patience nonviolence lovingkindness and compassion it also must not interfere with their free spiritual development as it does in the case of various totalitarian doctrinesThus in the Buddhist conception of selfprotection all selfishness is excluded and in the protection of others violence and interference have no placeSelfprotection and protection of others correspond to the great twin virtues of Buddhism wisdom and compassionRight selfprotection is the expression of wisdom right protection of others the expression of compassionWisdom and compassion being the primary elements of Bodhi or Enlightenment have found their highest perfection in the Fully Enlightened One the BuddhaThe insistence on their harmonious development is a characteristic feature of the entire DhammaWe meet them in the four sublime states where equanimity corresponds to wisdom and selfprotection while lovingkindness compassion and sympathetic joy correspond to compassion and the protection of othersThese two great principles of selfprotection and protection of others are of equal importance to both individual and social ethics and bring the ends of both into harmonyTheir beneficial impact however does not stop at the ethical level but leads the individual upwards to the highest realization of the Dhamma while at the same time providing a firm foundation for the welfare of societyIt is the writers belief that the understanding of those two great principles of selfprotection and protection of others as manifesting the twin virtues of wisdom and compassion is of vital importance to Buddhist education for young and old alikeThey are the cornerstones of character building and deserve a central place in the present world wide endeavor for a Buddhist revivalI shall protect myself  thus should we establish our mindfulness and guided by it devote ourselves to the practice of meditation for the sake of our own liberationI shall protect others  thus should we establish our mindfulness and guided by it regulate our conduct by patience harmlessness lovingkindness and compassion for the welfare and happiness of manyThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseWhen you hear something about Buddhism in the daily news you usually think of it having a background of huge idols and yellowrobed monks with a thick atmosphere of incense fumesYou never feel that there is anything in it for you except maybe an exotic spectacleBut is that all there is in BuddhismDo the news photographers take pictures of the real BuddhismDo the glossy magazines show you the fundamentals or only the externalsLet us see then what Buddhism really is Buddhism as it was originally expounded and as it still exists underneath the external trappings and trimmingsAlthough generally regarded as a religion Buddhism is basically a method of cultivating the mindIt is true that with its monastic tradition and its emphasis on ethical factors it possesses many of the surface characteristics that Westerners associate with religionHowever it is not theistic since it affirms that the universe is governed by impersonal laws and not by any creatorgod it has no use for prayer for the Buddha was a teacher and not a god and it regards devotion not as a religious obligation but as a means of expressing gratitude to its founder and as a means of selfdevelopmentThus it is not a religion at all from these points of viewAgain Buddhism knows faith only in the sense of confidence in the way recommended by the BuddhaA Buddhist is not expected to have faith or to believe in anything merely because the Buddha said it or because it is written in the ancient books or because it has been handed down by tradition or because others believe itHe may of course agree with himself to take the Buddhadoctrine as a working hypothesis and to have confidence in it but he is not expected to accept anything unless his reason accepts itThis does not mean that everything can be demonstrated rationally for many points lie beyond the scope of the intellect and can be cognized only by the development of higher facultiesBut the fact remains that there is no need for blind acceptance of anything in the BuddhadoctrineBuddhism is a way of life based on the training of the mindIts one ultimate aim is to show the way to complete liberation from suffering by the attainment of the Unconditioned a state beyond the range of the normal untrained mindIts immediate aim is to strike at the roots of suffering in everyday lifeAll human activity is directed either immediately or remotely towards the attainment of happiness in some form or other or to express the same thing in negative terms all human activity is directed towards liberation from some kind of unsatisfactoriness or dissatisfactionDissatisfaction then can be regarded as the starting point in human activity with happiness as its ultimate goalDissatisfaction the starting point in human activity is also the starting point in Buddhism and this point is expressed in the formula of the Four Basic Statements which set out the fact of dissatisfaction its cause its cure and the method of its cureThe First Basic Statement can be stated thusDissatisfaction is Inescapable in Enselfed LifeIn its original meaning the word which is here rendered as dissatisfaction and which is often translated as suffering embraces the meanings not only of pain sorrow and displeasure but also of everything that is unsatisfactory ranging from acute physical pain and severe mental anguish to slight tiredness boredom or mild disappointmentSometimes the term is rendered as dissatisfaction or unsatisfactoriness in some contexts these are perhaps more accurate while at other times the word suffering is more expressiveFor this reason we shall use both suffering and dissatisfaction or unsatisfactoriness according to contextIn some translations of the original texts it is stated that birth is suffering sickness is suffering old age is suffering and pleasure is sufferingIn English this last statement fails to make sense but if we restate it as pleasure is unsatisfactory it becomes more readily understandable for all pleasure is impermanent and is eventually succeeded by its opposite and from this point of view at least it is unsatisfactoryNow the Buddhadoctrine teaches that dissatisfaction or suffering is inescapable in enselfed life and the term enselfed life needs some explanationIn brief the doctrine teaches that the self considered as a fixed unchanging eternal soul has no realityThe central core of every being is not an unchanging soul but a lifecurrent an everchanging stream of energy which is never the same for two consecutive secondsThe self considered as an eternal soul therefore is a delusion and when regarded from the ultimate standpoint it has no reality and it is only within this delusion of selfhood that ultimate suffering can existWhen the selfdelusion is finally transcended and the final enlightenment is attained the ultimate state which lies beyond the relative universe is reachedIn this ultimate state the Unconditioned suffering is extinguished but while any element of selfhood remains even though it is a delusion suffering remains potentially within itWe must understand then that the First Basic Statement does not mean that suffering is inescapable it means that suffering is inescapable in enselfed life or while the delusion of selfhood remainsWe can now move on to the Second Basic Statement which saysThe Origin of Dissatisfaction is CravingIf you fall on a slippery floor and suffer from bruises you say that the cause of your suffering is the slippery floorIn an immediate sense you are right of course and to say that the cause of your bruises is craving fails to make senseBut the Second Statement does not refer to individual cases or to immediate causesIt means that the integrating force that holds together the lifecurrent is selfcentered craving for this lifecurrent  this selfdelusion  contains in itself the conditions for suffering while the slippery floor is merely an occasion for sufferingIt is obviously impossible by the nature of the world we live in to cure suffering by the removal of all the occasions for suffering whereas it is possible in Buddhism to strike at its prime or fundamental causeTherefore the Third Basic Statement statesLiberation May Be Achieved by Destroying CravingIt is selfcentered craving that holds together the forces which comprise the lifecurrent the stream of existence which we call the self and it is only with selfdelusion that unsatisfactoriness or suffering can existBy the destruction of that which holds together the delusion of the self the root cause of suffering is also destroyedThe ultimate aim of Buddhist practice then is to annihilate the selfThis is where a great deal of misunderstanding arises and naturally so but once it is realized that to annihilate the self is to annihilate a delusion this misunderstanding disappearsWhen the delusion is removed the reality appears so that to destroy delusion is to reveal the realityThe reality cannot be discovered while the delusion of self continues to obscure itNow what is this reality which appears when the delusion is removedThe ultimate reality is the Unconditioned called also the Unborn the Unoriginated the Uncreated and the UncompoundedWe can inadequately and not very accurately describe it as a positive state of beingIt is characterized by supreme bliss and complete freedom from suffering and is so utterly different from ordinary existence that no real description of it can be givenThe Unconditioned can be indicated  up to a point  only by stating what it is not for it is beyond words and beyond thoughtHence in the Buddhist texts the Unconditioned is often explained as the final elimination from ones own mind of greed hatred and delusionThis of course also implies the perfection of the opposite positive qualities of selflessness lovingkindness and wisdomThe attainment of the Unconditioned is the ultimate aim of all Buddhist practice and is the same as complete liberation from dissatisfaction or sufferingThis brings us to the last of the Four Basic StatementsThe Way of Liberation Is the Noble Eightfold PathThe eight factors of the path are theseNow you will see that in this Noble Eightfold Path there is nothing of an essentially religious nature it is more a sort of moral psychologyBut in the East as well as in the West people as a whole demand external show of some sort and  on the outside at least  the nonessentials have assumed more importance than the essentialsWhile some external features in the practice of Buddhism must of necessity vary according to environment the essential and constant characteristics of that practice are summed up in the following outline of the Noble Eightfold Path the Middle Way between harmful extremes as taught by the BuddhaAlthough it is convenient to speak of the various aspects of the eightfold path as eight steps they are not to be regarded as separate steps taken one after anotherOn the contrary each one must be practiced along with the others and it might perhaps be better to think of them as if they were eight parallel lanes within the one road rather than eight successive stepsThe first step of this path right understanding is primarily a matter of seeing things as they really are  or at least trying to do so without selfdeceit or evasionIn another sense right understanding commences as an intellectual appreciation of the nature of existence and as such it can be regarded as the beginning of the path but when the path has been followed to the end this merely intellectual appreciation is supplanted by a direct and penetrating discernment of the principles of the teaching first accepted intellectuallyWhile right understanding can be regarded as the complete understanding of the Buddha doctrine it is based on the recognition of three dominating characteristics of the relative universe of the universe of time form and matterThese three characteristics can briefly be set out in this wayThe self then is not a static entity but an everchanging fluxThis dynamic concept of existence is typical of deeper Buddhist thought there is nothing static in life and since it is everflowing you must learn to flow with itAnother aspect of right understanding is the recognition that the universe runs its course on the basis of a strict sequence of cause and effect or of action and reaction a sequence just as invariable and just as exact in the mental or moral realm as in the physicalIn accordance with this law of moral action and reaction all morally good or wholesome will actions eventually bring to the doer happiness at some time while unwholesome or morally bad willactions bring suffering to the doerThe effects of wholesome and unwholesome willactions  that is to say the happiness and suffering that result from them  do not generally follow immediately there is often a considerable timelag for the resultant happiness and suffering can arise only when appropriate conditions are presentThe results may not appear within the present lifetimeThus at death there is normally a balance of merit which has not yet brought about its experience of happiness and at the same time there is also a balance of demerit which has not yet given rise to the suffering which is to be its inevitable resultAfter death the body disintegrates of course but the lifecurrent continues not in the form of an unchanging soul but in the form of an everchanging stream of energyImmediately after death a new being commences life to carry on this life current but the new being is not necessarily a human being and the instantaneous rebirth may take place on another plane of existenceBut in any case the new being is a direct sequel to the being that has just diedThus the new being becomes an uninterrupted continuation of the old being and the lifecurrent is unbrokenThe new being inherits the balance of merit built up by the old being and this balance of merit will inevitably bring happiness at some future timeAt the same time the new being inherits the old beings balance of demerit which will bring suffering at some time in the futureIn effect in the sense of continuity the new being is the same as the old beingIn just the same way  that is in the sense of continuity only  an old man is the same as the young man he once was the young man is the same as the boy he once was and the boy is the same as the baby he once wasBut the identity of the old man with the young man and with the boy and with the baby is due only to continuity there is no other identityEverything in the universe changes from day to day and from moment to moment so that every being at this moment is a slightly different being from that of the moment before the only identity is due to continuityIn the same way the being that is reborn is different from the previous one that died but the identity due to continuity remains as beforeThese teachings are basic to the Buddhadoctrine  the illusory nature of the self the law of action and reaction in the moral sphere and the rebirth of the lifeforces  but there is no need for anyone to accept anything that does not appeal to his reasonAcceptance of any particular teaching is unimportant what is important is the continual effort to see things as they really are without selfdeceit or evasionSo much for a brief outline of the doctrine under the heading of right understandingThe second step right thought or aim is a matter of freeing the intellectual faculties from adverse emotional factors such as sensuality illwill and cruelty which render wise and unbiased decisions impossibleRight speech right action and right livelihood together make up the moral section of the path their function being to keep the defilements of the mind under control and to prevent them from reaching adverse expressionThese defilements however cannot be completely eradicated by morality alone and the other steps of the path must be applied to cleanse the mind completely of its defilementsNow in the next step  right effort  we enter the sphere of practical psychology for right effort in this context means effort of willIn other words the sixth step of the path is selfdiscipline the training of the will in order to prevent and overcome those states of mind that retard development and to arouse and cultivate those that bring about mental progressThe seventh step of the path is also one of practical psychology this is the step called right mindfulness and it consists of the fullest possible development of the ordinary faculty of attentionIt is largely by the development of attention  expanded and intensified awareness  that the mind can eventually become capable of discerning things as they really areThe primary function of the seventh step right mindfulness is to develop an increasing awareness of the unreality of the selfHowever it functions also by continually improving the normal faculty of attention thus equipping the mind better to meet the problems and stresses of the workaday worldIn the Buddhaway mindfulness consists of developing the faculty of attention so as to produce a constant awareness of all thoughts that arise all words that are spoken and all actions that are done with a view to keeping them free from selfinterest from emotional bias and from selfdelusionRight mindfulness has many applications in the sphere of everyday activitiesFor example it can be employed to bring about a sharpened awareness a clear comprehension of the motives of these activities and this clear comprehension of motive is extremely importantIn right concentration the last of the eight steps the cultivation of higher mindstates  up to the meditative absorptions  is undertaken and these higher mindstates serve to unify purify and strengthen the mind for the achievement of liberating insightIn this ultimate achievement the delusion of selfhood with its craving and suffering is transcended and extinguishedThis penetrating insight is the ultimate goal of all Buddhist practices and with it comes a direct insight into the true nature of life culminating in realization of the UnconditionedWhile the Unconditioned is the extinction of self it is nevertheless not mere nonexistence or annihilation for the extinction of self is nothing but the extinction of a delusionEvery description of the Unconditioned must fail for it lies not only beyond words but beyond even thought and the only way to know it is to follow the Noble Eightfold Path to its endThis then is the original Buddhism this is the Buddhism of the Noble Eightfold Path of the path that leads from the bondage of self to liberating insight into realityLeonard ABullen was one of the pioneers of the Buddhist movement in AustraliaHe was the first president of the Buddhist Society of Victoria when it was established in and one of the first officebearers of the executive committee of the Buddhist Federation of AustraliaHe was also a coeditors of the Buddhist journal MettaHe passed away in at the age ofHis other publications issued by BPS are A Technique of Living and Action and Reaction in Buddhist Teaching in Kamma and Its FruitThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe ultimate goal of Buddhism is the deathless condition of Nibbana the sole realityHence one who aspires to that state should renounce mundane pursuits and attachments which are ephemeral for the sake of that realityBut there are very few who are sufficiently mature to develop themselves to achieve that state in this very lifeThus the Buddha does not force the life of renunciation upon those who lack the spiritual capacity to embark upon the higher lifeTherefore one should follow the path of mundane advantage which is twofold namely the advantage obtainable here in this very life and the advantage obtainable in future lives as steps on the path to the spiritual lifeAlthough one may enjoy the pleasures of life one must regard ones body as an instrument with which to practice virtue for ones own and others benefit in short one should live a useful life of moral integrity a life of simplicity and paucity of wantsAs regards acquisition of wealth the Buddha said One must be diligent and energetic and as regards the safeguarding of ones wealth one must be mindful and economicalIt is not impossible that even the life of such a man may be somehow or other disturbed and harassed as a result of the actions of unskillful menAlthough this might induce him to abandon his chosen path it is at such times that one must not forget the steps to be taken for the purpose of establishing peaceAccording to the teaching of the Buddha this includes the reflection Others may be harmful but I shall be harmless thus should I train myself We must not forget that the whole spirit of Buddhism is one of pacificationIn the calm and placid atmosphere of the Buddhas teaching there is every chance every possibility of removing hatred jealousy and violence from our mindIt is no wonder if we at times in our everyday life feel angry with somebody about somethingBut we should not allow this feeling to reside in our mindWe should try to curb it at the very moment it has arisenGenerally there are eight ways to curb or control our angerThe first method is to recollect the teachings of the BuddhaOn very many occasions the Buddha explained the disadvantages of an angry temperHere is one of his admonitionsSuppose some bandits catch one of you and sever his body limb from limb with a twohanded saw and if he should feel angry thereby even at that moment he is no follower of my teaching Kakacupama Sutta Majjhima Nikaya As a log from a pyre burnt at both ends and fouled in the middle serves neither for firewood in the village nor for timber in the forest so is such a wrathful man Anguttara Nikaya II Further we may consider the Buddhas advice to be found in the DhammapadaHe abused me he beat me he defeated me he robbed me of my propertyWhosoever harbor such thoughts will never be able to still their enmityNever indeed is hatred stilled by hatred it will only be stilled by nonhatred  this is an eternal law Dhp vvDo not speak harshly to anyoneThose who are harshly spoken to might retaliate against youAngry words hurt others feelings even blows may overtake you in return Dhp vForbearance is the highest observancePatience is the highest virtueSo the Buddhas say Dhp vLet a man remove his angerLet him root out his prideLet him overcome all fetters of passionsNo sufferings overtake him who neither clings to mindandbody nor claims anything of the world Dhp vConquer anger by nonangerConquer evil by goodConquer miserliness by liberalityConquer a liar by truthfulness Dhp vGuard your mind against an outburst of wrong feelingsKeep your mind controlledRenouncing evil thoughts develop purity of mind Dhp vIf by contemplating the advice of the Buddha in this way one cannot curb his anger then let him try the second methodNaturally any bad person may possess some good qualitySome men are evil in mind but speak in deceptive language or slyly perform their deeds in an unsuspecting mannerSome men are coarse only in their language but not in their mind or deedsSome men are coarse and cruel in their deeds but neither in their speech nor in their mindSome are soft and kind in mind speech and deed as wellWhen we feel angry with any person we should try to find out some good in him either in his way of thinking or in his way of speaking or in his way of actingIf we find some redeeming quality in him we should ponder its value and ignore his bad qualities as natural weaknesses that are to be found in everyoneWhilst we think thus our mind will soften and we may even feel kindly towards that personIf we develop this way of thinking we will be able to curb or eliminate our anger towards himAt times this method may not be successful and we shall then have to try the third methodBasically this entails reflecting thusHe has done that wrong being subject to anger should I too follow him making my mind subject to angerIs it not foolish to imitate himHe harboring his hatred destroys himself internallyWhy should I on his account destroy my reputationAll things are momentaryBoth his mind and body are momentary tooThe thoughts and the body with which the wrong was done to me are not now existingWhat I call the same man now are the thoughts and physical parts which are different from the earlier ones that harmed me although belonging to the same psychophysical processThus one thought together with one mass of physical parts did me some wrong and vanished there and then giving place to succeeding thoughts and material parts to appearSo with which am I getting angryWith the vanished and disappeared thoughts and physical parts or with the thoughts and material parts which do not do any wrong nowShould I get angry with one thing which is innocent whereas another thing has done me wrong and vanishedThe socalled I is not the same for two consecutive momentsAt the moment the wrong was done there was another thought and another mass of molecules which were regarded as I whereas what are regarded as I at the present moment are a different thought and collection of molecules though belonging to the same processThus some other being did wrong to someone else and another gets angry with anotherIs this not a ridiculous situationIf we scrutinize the exact nature of our life and its happenings in this manner our anger might subside or vanish there and thenThere is another way too to eliminate upsurging angerSuppose we think of someone who has done wrong to usOn such occasions we should remember that we suffer harm or loss as a result of our previous kammaEven if others were angry with us they could not harm us if there were no latent force of past unwholesome kamma committed by us which took advantage of this opportunity to arouse our adversarySo it is I who am responsible for this harm or loss and not anybody elseAnd at the same time now while I am suffering the result of past kamma if I on account of this should get angry and do any harm to him by that do I accumulate much more unwholesome kamma which would bring me correspondingly unwholesome resultsIf we recall to mind this law of kamma our anger may subside immediatelyWe can consider such a situation in another way tooWe as the followers of Buddha believe that our Bodhisatta passed through incalculable numbers of lives practicing virtues before he attained BuddhahoodThe Buddha related the history of some of his past lives as illustrations to teach us how he practiced these virtuesThe lives of the prince Dhammapala and the ascetic Khantivadi are most illustrative and draw our attentionAt one time the Bodhisatta had been born as the son of a certain king named MahapatapaThe child was named Culla DhammapalaOne day the Queen sat on a chair fondling her child and did not notice the King passing byThe King thought the Queen was so proud of her child as not to get up from her chair even when she saw that her lord the King passed that waySo he grew angry and immediately sent for the executionerWhen he came the King ordered him to snatch the child from the Queens arms and cut his hands feet and head off which he did instantlyThe child our Bodhisatta suffered all that with extreme patience and did not grow illtempered or relinquish his impartial love for his cruel father lamenting mother and the executionerSo far had he matured in the practice of forbearance and lovingkindness at that timeAt another time our Bodhisatta was an ascetic wellknown for his developed virtue of forbearance and consequently people named him Khantivadi the preacher of forbearanceOne day he visited Benares and took his lodgings at the royal pleasure groveMeanwhile the King passed that way with his harem and seeing the ascetic seated under a tree asked what virtue he was practicing to which the ascetic replied that of forbearanceThe King was a materialist who regarded the practice of virtue to be humbugSo hearing the words of the ascetic he sent for the executioner and ordered him to cut off his hands and feet and questioned the ascetic as to whether he could hold to forbearance at the severing of his limbsThe ascetic did not feel illtempered but even at that time he lay down extending his lovingkindness and holding his forbearance undiminishedHe spoke to the King in reply to the effect that his forbearance and other virtues were not in his limbs but in his mindThe King being unsuccessful in his attempts to disturb the ascetics feelings grew angrier and kicked the stomach of the ascetic with his heel and went awayMeanwhile the Kings minister came over and seeing what had happened bowed before the dying ascetic and begged him saying Venerable one none of us agreed to this cruel act of the King and we are all sorrowing over what has been done to you by that devilish manWe ask you to curse the King but not us At this the ascetic said May that king who has caused my hands and feet to be cut off as well as you live long in happinessPersons who practice virtues like me never get angry Saying this he breathed his lastSince the Buddha in his past lives while still imperfect like us practiced forbearance and lovingkindness to such a high extent why cannot we follow his exampleWhen we remember and think of similar noble characters of great souls we should be able to bear any harm unmoved by angerOr if we consider the nature of the round of rebirths in this beginningless and infinite universe we will be able to curb our upspringing angerFor it is said by the Buddha It is not easy to find a being who has not been your mother your father your brother sister son or daughter Hence with regard to the person whom we have now taken for our enemy we should think This one now in the past has been my mother who bore me in her womb for nine months gave birth to me unweariedly cleansed me of impurities hid me in her bosom carried me on her hip and nourished meThis one was my father in another life and spent time and energy engaged in toilsome business with a view to maintaining me even sacrificing life for my sake and so onWhen we ponder over these facts it should be expected that our arisen anger against our enemy will subsideAnd further we should reflect on the advantages of the development of mind through the practice of extending lovingkindnessFor the Buddha has expounded to us eleven advantages to be looked for from its developmentWhat are the elevenThe person who fully develops lovingkindness sleeps happilyHe wakes happilyHe experiences no evil dreamsHe is beloved of menHe is beloved even of nonhuman beingsHe is protected by the godsHe can be harmed neither by fire poison or a weaponHis mind is quickly composedHis complexion is sereneAt the moment of his death he passes away unbewilderedIf he can go no further along the path of realization he will at least be reborn in the heavenly abode of the Brahma DevasSo by every similar and possible way should we endeavor to quench our anger and at last be able to extend our lovingkindness towards any and every being in the worldWhen we are able to curb our anger and control our mind we should extend from ourselves boundless love as far as we can imagine throughout every direction pervading and touching all living beings with lovingkindnessWe should practice this meditation every day at regular times without any breakAs a result of this practice we will be able one day to attain to the jhanas or meditative absorptions comprising four grades which entail the control of sensuality illwill and many other passions bringing at the same time purity serenity and peace of mindOnce while the Blessed One stayed near Rajagaha in the Veluvana Monastery at the Squirrels Feeding Place there lived at Rajagha a Brahman of the Bharadvaja clan who was later called the Reviler When he learned that one of his clan had gone forth from home life and had become a monk under the recluse Gotama he was angry and displeasedAnd in that mood he went to see the Blessed One and having arrived he reviled and abused him in rude and harsh speechThus being spoken to the Blessed One said How is it Brahman do you sometimes receive visits from friends relatives or other guestsYes Master Gotama I sometimes have visitorsWhen they come do you offer to them various kinds of foods and a place for restingYes I sometimes do soBut if Brahman your visitors do not accept what you offer to whom does it then belongWell Master Gotama if they do not accept it these things remain with usIt is just so in this case Brahman you revile us who do not revile in return you scold us who do not scold in return you abuse us who do not abuse in returnSo we do not accept it from you and hence it remains with you it belongs to you Brahman Abridged and freely rendered from Samyutta Nikaya Brahmana Samyutta NoVerses translated by AFRhys Davids in Kindred Sayings volIRetold from an ancient Buddhist Story by Nyanaponika TheraOnce there lived a demon who had a peculiar diet he fed on the anger of othersAnd as his feeding ground was the human world there was no lack of food for himHe found it quite easy to provoke a family quarrel or national and racial hatredEven to stir up a war was not very difficult for himAnd whenever he succeeded in causing a war he could properly gorge himself without much further effort because once a war starts hate multiplies by its own momentum and affects even normally friendly peopleSo the demons food supply became so rich that he sometimes had to restrain himself from overeating being content with nibbling just a small piece of resentment found closebyBut as it often happens with successful people he became rather overbearing and one day when feeling bored he thought Shouldnt I try it with the gods On reflection he chose the Heaven of the Thirtythree Deities ruled by Sakka Lord of GodsHe knew that only a few of these gods had entirely eliminated the fetters of illwill and aversion though they were far above petty and selfish quarrelsSo by magic power he transferred himself to that heavenly realm and was lucky enough to come at a time when Sakka the Divine King was absentThere was none in the large audience hall and without much ado the demon seated himself on Sakkas empty throne waiting quietly for things to happen which he hoped would bring him a good feedSoon some of the gods came to the hall and first they could hardly believe their own divine eyes when they saw that ugly demon sitting on the throne squat and grinningHaving recovered from their shock they started to shout and lament Oh you ugly demon how can you dare to sit on the throne of our LordWhat utter cheekinessWhat a crimeyou should be thrown headlong into the hell and straight into a boiling cauldronYou should be quartered aliveBegoneBegoneBut while the gods were growing more and more angry the demon was quite pleased because from moment to moment he grew in size in strength and in powerThe anger he absorbed into his system started to ooze from his body as a smoky redglowing mistThis evil aura kept the gods at a distance and their radiance was dimmedSuddenly a bright glow appeared at the other end of the hall and it grew into a dazzling light from which Sakka emerged the King of GodsHe who had firmly entered the undeflectible Stream that leads Nibbanawards was unshaken by what he sawThe smokescreen created by the gods anger parted when he slowly and politely approached the usurper of his throneWelcome friendPlease remain seatedI can take another chairMay I offer you the drink of hospitalityOur Amrita is not bad this yearOr do you prefer a stronger brew the vedic SomaWhile Sakka spoke these friendly words the demon rapidly shrank to a diminutive size and finally disappeared trailing behind a whiff of malodorous smoke which likewise soon dissolved Based on Samyutta Nikaya Sakka Samyutta NoThe gist of this story dates back to the discourses of the BuddhaBut even now over years later our world looks as if large hordes of Angereating Demons were haunting it and were kept well nourished by millions slaving for them all over the earthFires of hate and widetraveling waves of violence threaten to engulf mankindAlso the grass roots of society are poisoned by conflict and discord manifesting in angry thoughts and words and in violent deedsIs it not time to end this selfdestructive slavery of man to his impulses of hate and aggression which only serve the demoniac forcesOur story tells how these demons of hate can be exorcised by the power of gentleness and loveIf this power of love can be tested and proven at grassroot level in the widely spread net of personal relationships society at large the world at large will not remain unaffected by itThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseFor inspiration to write this little booklet I wish to thank my good friend and teacher Anagarika TibbotuwawaI also wish to thank my husband for his kindly suggestions and excellent editingMay all beings be well and happyFor the beginning meditator I believe it would be helpful to establish an order in the various steps taken in meditationFirst then it would be wise to establish a place of quiet to which one may retire daily and not be interrupted in his endeavorsThen wash carefully face hands and feetBetter yet if time permits take a cleansing shower and put on loose comfortable clothesIt is wise to meditate at the same time daily to establish a habitI do it at amand pmwhen the birds begin to retire in the eveningThen when you begin to meditate consider your postureWith spine erect and a spirit of awareness be mindful of sitting without strain but with complete alertnessNow you are ready to beginBut first some introductory thoughtsAs Sujata states in his little book Beginning to See Meditation is the best thing you can do for yourself However it is far from the simple thing it may seem to beginnersIt takes a strong urge to peer deeply within oneself and beyond itIt takes discipline and willingness to go farther than merely trying to escape or sidestep personal problems one may haveWhy meditateThere are many reasonsBut those that stand out most strongly are learning to think clearly and to dispel ignorance illusion greed hatred and cravingThis is the road to Nirvana or Nibbana through which one must lose all clinging to self The feeling of having a self is highly resistant to extinguishingIt is persistent and deviousOften one may feel it has vanished only to have it crop up againOnly by diligence and persistence  and the road for many may be long  can victory over it be achievedYou are seated now crosslegged on the floor in a quiet chamberIn lotus position if you can or in halflotus or even on a chair if disability precludes otherwiseKeep your head erect and balanced lightly on your shouldersStill do not strain be comfortable relaxed and attentiveThe first stages of meditation should be simply observation of breathConcentrate on the nostrils where the breath flows in out in outBe aware of the touch of air as it strikes the passage through the nostrilsIn fact be aware of everything and nothingThis sounds contradictoryYet it is really notFor this is no time to daydream to entertain vagrant and migratory thoughtsYou are aware of your physical postureThen you forget that alsoYou are aware that the past is dead that it is goneYet specific consciousness of your whole preceding life is absentThe future does not yet existAll you have is right now the in out in out rhythm of the breath of lifeThe idea is to empty the mind to get rid of all garbage all fleeting and intruding thoughtsSimply to breathe  in out  in out never forcing the breathYou are not even the breather but the breathing breathing you the you which as time goes on will grow more and more vague as it begins to dissipate disappearJust allow the mind to feel the touch of breath as it flows in and flows outIn your first sessions think of nothing moreYou will find the breath thinning out as it becomes more subtle and finer until in time you begin to feel you are not breathing at allThis is the calming of the breath flowIt becomes very pleasant and satisfyingI keep a candle burning in the meditation chamberIt serves two purposes maybe threeAt first if the mind wanders it serves as a point of focusThe eyes at first observing the candle soon close lightly easily by themselvesBut even through closed lids one feels the presence of the lightOne can see it in ones minds eyeIt restores the minds wandering back to the presentThe second purpose is symbolic to me it signifies the Light of the Dhamma the doctrine on which the meditation is basedAnd finally it makes for a pleasant lovely atmosphereIncense flowers Buddha sculpture are nice but really not necessaryOne can in truth meditate anywhere any quiet place where there can be no interruptionWherever you meditate if it is at home and you have a telephone it is wise to remove the receiver to avoid incoming callsBear in mind that the place of meditation is not of key importance but it is wise to return to the same place at the same time daily so that the habit of meditating becomes establishedThe Buddha meditated under a Bodhi tree where he achieved enlightenmentAn advanced meditator can choose almost any place and it will serve his purpose  a crowded market place a burial ground a cave a park or a refuse dumpIn his inward turning he becomes totally oblivious of his surroundings or contrariwise makes the very surroundings as he advances deeper and deeper into meditating the subject of his thoughtsThe important thing to remember is that these thoughts must be schooled and channeledThey must be kept on centerBut you now are still in your beginning stagesUntoward thoughts will persist in entering your mindThis is only naturalYou will be amazed at how many and how trivial these intrusions can beYou must learn however to treat these intruders with courtesyDo not shove them away in angerBe gentle kindlyLabel each one  past  present  futureWorthyUnworthyAnimosityVanityDesireEgotismYour very act of branding them will assist in their cessationAs they begin to disappear your mind will gently return to your nostrils your breathingIt will grow quieter and quieterOther hindrances will obtrude themselvesNoises will penetrate your consciousness  children playing and shouting buses or airplanes passingLabel them as you do other passing thoughtsKeep centering on the breathing the slowing inflow outflowIn time the noises too will vanishWhenever you find yourself out there bring yourself gently back to here and to right now When you have been able to accomplish this no thought for at least a half hour your breathing will have slowed to a point of almost indistinguishable rhythm to it breathing you and not the other way aroundI find it helps in all of this to keep a semismile on my face such as that of the BuddhaIt aids in brightening the mind makes it happierAt this point in your beginning meditation if you have been at it a half hour or longer you may terminate it if you wish or continue as beforeOr you can go on to extend metta or lovingkindnessThis meditation subject is good because it eliminates hatred envy anger and selfpityIt accomplishes love for all destruction of self sympathetic joy and a good feeling for every being or nonbeing that lives or has left this lifeYour extension of lovingkindness should reach out to encompass the earth the universeYou will find it difficult in time to snuff out the life of even the smallest insectIn extending lovingkindness it is of great importance that you first love yourselfIn the right way of courseYou accomplish this by ridding your thoughts of all impurities Think to yourself I will rid my mind of every defilement anger hatred ignorance fear greed cravingI will make my mind clear fresh and pureLike a transparent window is my mindThen with my stainfree mind I pour out thoughts of lovingkindness of love and of kindnessTry to get a mental image of each one you are extending this lovingkindness toGet into that personFeel his or her personality enter your own being and direct your feeling straight into the mind and heart of that individualYou will find in time that there is a sort of mental telepathy emergingYou will feel the warmth of responseDo not dwell on thisGo on to the next person and the next and nextBring forth all the warmth and kindness of your spirit and instill this into the being or nonbeing it is directed towardIf you do this once or twice daily your horizon will widenYou will find yourself directing these vibrations to all beings and nonbeings who have entered your consciousness without exceptionsThis will include brandnew acquaintances you hardly knowPeople you do not even know but see pass by regularly or irregularly down the streetAll who liveAll who have diedKnown and unknownAll animals insects treesEverything organic and inorganicAnd in this outflowing there will ride your self vanishing into the allinclusiveWhen you have completed this meditation sitting later try a walking meditation and in this think of the Four Noble Truths of the Buddha that all beings are born to suffer etcThen go on to find the way out the way out and the end of sufferingFind this secure path and incorporate it into your daily life and this accomplished find Nibbana right here on earthWhen I first came to Sri Lanka from America I had just about given up all hope of livingThe doctors in America had provided me with maybe twentyfive different drugs for a very bad heart condition and other ailmentsWe fled America my husband and I to live out our lives among peaceful surroundings  in the heart of BuddhalandShortly after arrival what with the long trip and thoughts of death I truly was dyingI had a myocardial infarction and was taken to the hospitalI found the hospital conditions so deplorable I felt it would be better to die in bed at homeConsequently I left the hospitalMy husband had found a lovely home for us and there I waited to dieAfter much pain and emotional upheaval my husband found an anagarika a Buddhist lay brother who came to our home and performed a miracle or to state it better pointed out to me the path that I shall follow for the rest of my days here on earthThis monklike follower of the Buddha the Anagarika Tibbotuwawa instructed me in meditationWe went through four stages and in time I threw out all drugs and the life here and now became clear and meaningfulMany strange things began to occur in the course of meditationFirst I began to feel that I was on another plane of consciousnessI no longer had a self sick or otherwiseI was at one with all all of us in a new world with all nonbeings tooI found that the ego that nearly wrecked my life was now goneI felt reborn and extended my meditation to vibrations of lovingkindnessThought messages I call themThen one morning a friend called from AmericaOn the phone he said that he had received my messageHe was elated beyond belief thanked me and promised to come here in the near futureThe strangest of all was a telegram from my sisterShe asked if we could accommodate her at our home in three weeksI nearly had a heart attackMy sister is seventyeight years oldI had heard no word from her for fifteen yearsYet I had been sending her thought messages of lovingkindness and her image was growing clearer and clearer  even before arrivalShe was with me even before arrivalAt age seventyeight she had traveled halfway around the world to see meWhen she arrived she said she had had a compelling urge to see meWe were both delighted and to my amazement she meditated each evening with me and said she had never known such peace and love as she found in our homeShe could not remain with us as I had hoped but had responsibilities at home that she felt better able to cope with nowShe left adding I have promises to keep  and many miles to go before I sleepThese few experiences have been so uplifting that now even though I never proselytize many young people come to me for instruction in meditationRecently a young man from Switzerland came to our homeHe felt he was dying of rabiesI was so sure he did not have this disease that I suggested that he meditate with me and Anagarika that day and he seemed pleased with the experienceWell this young man came not only each evening but also every morning at ambringing fresh flowers for the BuddhaHe left after three weeks of intensive meditation and instruction and reading of the Dhamma well and happy and full of ideas to help suffering humanityThere are of course many ideas I have omitted which are advanced procedures in insight meditation the three stages which usually follow the concentration on breathingThese are body feelings perceptions and consciousness ultimately expressing themselves in the mind experiencing pure mind I feel however that the reader can find these steps in many publications that have been released on this subjectIf this booklet helps the beginner with just a little insight into the way and the why of meditation this will be my happinessThis is a question which is often askedIt really depends upon how one defines religionIf it is thought of as a belief in a supreme being to whom one prays for redemption security favors or relief from suffering then no Buddhism is not a religionThe Buddha himself never claimed divinity  only clearsightedness and purity of apprehension of truth through deepest intuition leading to equanimity and enlightenmentHe was a great and rare individual but not a godIf some simple and mistaken few have elevated him to godship and worship him with requests for favors and special dispensations this does not alter the situation one bitIt seems that in these troubled times as indeed since time immemorial man has felt the need to have a faith in a supreme being one who could redeem him from sin and relieve his sufferingThis is a great fallacyIf indeed there were such a being why should he be asked to give redemptionIsnt it more important for man to redeem himselfThis is what the Buddha believedMan he said is born to sufferingLife is sufferingThat is the first of the Four Noble Truths he enunciates  that there is sufferingIn the Second Truth he points out that all suffering has its origins which we must learn to understand because this is the only way we can arrive at the Third Truth which is that cessation of this suffering can be achievedHis Fourth Truth clarifies the way out from suffering via the Eightfold Path which we will discuss laterTherefore we ask if Buddhism is not a religion what then is itOur reply is Buddhism is a way of life a philosophy a psychology a way of thinking through which we may ourselves take on the responsibility of determining how our lifebearing kamma will work out for usMeditation is one of the procedures of mental discipline and purification through which we may begin to learn such responsibilityMany young people have come to me saying How can I embrace Buddhism without destroying my own beliefs and culture I tell the Christians among them to think about the precepts of ChristAre they so totally opposed to and different from those of the BuddhaThou shalt not killThou shalt not steal or commit adulteryThe ethical injunctions among the Ten Commandments  are they not almost exactly the same as the precepts of the moral life laid down by the BuddhaI tell them that the Dhamma the sacred texts of Buddhism are much more voluminous and explicit than those of the Old and New Testaments and commentariesThe Buddhist texts are in fact elevenfold as extensive and contain an enormous range of wise teachings none of them derogatory to the faiths of other creedsHe did not deny the existence of deities but he did reserve scepticism as to the infinity of their duration their omnipotency their powers to help mankind in every kind of urgencyHave these gods and messiahs which we of Western faiths have been prone to believe in been sublimely successful in the mitigation of human suffering hunger sorrow and afflictionThe answer is open to doubtSo to these young Christians I can say Believe in Christ if you wish but remember Jesus never claimed divinity either Yes believe in a unitary God too if you wish but cease your imploring pleading for personal dispensations health wealth relief from sufferingStudy the Eightfold PathSeek the insights and enlightenment that come through meditative learningsAnd find out how to achieve for yourself what prayer and solicitation of forces beyond you are unable to accomplishThere are many young people who believe that God answers their prayersDoes heIs prayeranswering the purpose of a supreme beingA young man recently came to us asking for food and shelterHe was young ablebodied and yes intelligentWe received him fed him and gave him a room for several daysWhen it became apparent that this fellow had no intention of ever leaving we felt he should go off on his ownHe was highly indignantWhen he left we asked him if he intended to work and earn enough to take care of his own needsHe answered No God will provideIf I follow his light that is enoughHe will take care of meIf there is a God why should he take care of ablebodied young men simply because they have unreserved and total faith in him when there are so many really unfortunate desolate people who really need helpDid God provide for the millions of Jews in concentration camps who were slowly gassed to death enmasse their agonies of asphyxiation often lasting a full halfhour before they were incinerated in German ovensIs he there offering respite each day to the millions who are dying of cancer and other agonizing diseases all over the universeDoes he provide for all the masses of people victims of floods disasters and earthquakes who are homeless and starving daily throughout the worldYes believe in a God if you will I tell them but dont ask ask and askDont begProvide as best you are able for yourself firstThen fill your heart and mind with love with metta and help to the fullest possible extent in the relief of suffering among othersThis is the answer I give themBut cease your petitioning your constant solicitation for private preferenceA Jewish girl from Israel came to meditateShe felt happy and calm in meditation but she was worriedShe said I do not want to forget my heritageI was born in Jerusalem and am steeped in Jewish tradition I answered her No problemWhen you finish meditating say the Shmah This is the ancient prayer of the Jews to be said each morning of their lives and on their deathbedsIt consists of the words Hear O Israel the Lord our God the Lord is one This to those of the Jewish faith may be a solacing thought one that may yield them comfort I told herThere is nothing in Buddhism as a matter of fact denying the right to believe in God if you so wishYet it must be pointed out that Buddhism places deityship on quite a different plane than monotheistic and polytheistic religions doStill with all your beliefs intact you can benefit from much that Buddhism teaches for instance from Buddhist meditationWe are all interrelated in common sufferingEven the word religion derived from Latin means joined or linkedJust as the word yoga also means the same unitedWhether this is expressed through a belief in a deity or not is of less importance than the fact that we recognize and accept the wonder of our common interrelationshipCertainly I told her there is nothing in the practice of Judaism that denies mans common relationshipThe young lady was satisfiedAs far as I know she still meditates daily and recites the ShmahSometimes it is said that the Buddhists worship idolsWhy all the incense oil lamps flowers set before BuddhaimagesYou must understand I tell these young people that the Buddhists are merely expressing their reverence for a great man of overwhelming vision and insight one of the wisest teachers that ever lived a man who laid out a whole way of life an a means of alleviating sorrow strife and sufferingWhen they bow to him with hands clasped before them they do so in reverence and worshipBut the meaning they attach to worship is not that of Western religionistsThey ask nothing for their separate selves no intercession of gods no personal favorsWhy is thatBecause the Buddhist neither in his life practice nor his philosophy believes himself to be a separate being a singular self apart from othersTherefore lacking separate personhood there is no one for whom preference is soughtFor the Buddhist worship then mean praise reverence a desire to imitate and be like the Buddha to follow his ways and show appreciation for his teachingsHe offers them no dispensations or favors only a body of wisdom contained in the Dhamma which if they but apply it to themselves amounts to selfdispensationIn essence this means dispensing with all vanity clinging attachments greed and ignorance which may yet hamper them from being like the Buddha and aspiring to the perfection of being which he in his life attained when reaching Nibbana here and nowThe great American statesman Thomas Paine said My mind is my church In this statement he reiterates the belief of the BuddhaBuddhists do not believe it is necessary to have a middleman intercede between them and the perfection of the Master they chose to emulate and be likeIn Buddhism there is no need for priests ministers and preachers to pray for them in churches or templesThe Buddhist monk teaches not preachesHe teaches man to find his wayHe teaches purity of mind and compassion and love for all beingsHe does not perform marriage service but devotes his life only to teaching and scholarship and study and to continuing selfpurification through meditation so that he can be an example to othersWho may become a BuddhaAnd how does one become oneThese are questions frequently asked meThe answers are that one has to enroll or join nothing sign no document be initiated by no baptism nor disavow any other beliefAll he has to do is to begin to live as Buddhists live to find inspiration in the Buddha to like and reverence his teachings to begin to try to follow his Eightfold Path and through meditation to seek to gain merit and purityTo aspire in fact to become a Buddha himselfFor Buddhahood is not a limited societyIt is open to allMany have attained itEven the Buddha himself in previous lives chose to deny himself release through Nibbana and chose rebirth so that he might stay on and teach othersNow let us examine the Buddhas remedy for the ending of sufferingA friend of mine once said with respect to this It is all very simple practice right thought right speech and right actionVery good and very importantHowever not so fast my friendAll of the Eightfold Path is necessary not just the small part of it you mentionIt is all beautifully interrelatedThere must be right understanding with right speechThere must be right actionThere must be right effortAnd with the right effort must follow right livelihoodAnd for all of these steps to work think of them as stepsYou dont get very far just moving up one step and remaining thereYou have to combine them join them link them and finally climax them with still one more step to reach the topAnd that step is right mindfulnessHow beautifully all these hang together like pearls on a necklaceBut now think for a moment about what is meant by right that is to say the rightness of speech thought actionFew pause to think what right means within this contextDoes it mean right as opposed to wrongPerhaps it doesAnd then again perhaps it doesntHow many of us are able to discriminate at every juncture of our lives what is right and what is wrongDoes right then mean appropriateAppropriate action appropriate speech etcAppropriate means suitable suitable for the occasionIs that always so easy to determineWhat then does the Buddhas use of the word right come down toDoes it not come down to the fact that he is pointing out that there is choice and that we have choice that we can go this way or go that way and that it is up to us and not him and no god or supreme being to determine our wayIs he not saying that this choice or volition amounts to our own kammaAnd that while a lot of it is predetermined through our past lives or genetically however you want to think of it we can still alter correct change refine reaim this kamma change its courseWe and nobody elseAnd does not all of this point back to such qualities of action speech and thought as are characterized as greedy selfish hateful hostile hurtfulAs opposed to such qualities as generousness selflessness lovingness kindliness helpfulnessDo you not see that the Buddha is telling us to look behind words and not to accept them for their face value but for their internal shall we say nuclear meaningsSo we return again to the question as to whether Buddhism is a religionIn the sense that it offers us a moral code helping to conjoin us in the living together of a better life yes it is a religionFor that is the inner or nuclear meaning of religion  relinking rejoiningBut if Buddhism is taken to imply belief in a supreme being who rules the universe and can be bribed to alter his decisions by our prayers and solicitations for personal preference it is not a religionAnd this Buddhism does not doWell then the Christian may argue man without God without conscience without a ruler of the universe will revert to bestialityIs this not like saying a being cant exist without a taskmasterAre we then childrenSo weak that we cant exist without being told what we can and cannot doHow can we justify thisThe answers should be obviousMan can rely on himselfMan can train his mind to right thinking not because thereby he will be saved by a righteous God but because right thinking will lead him on to the path of final liberation from suffering which consists of right moral conduct right meditation and right wisdomNow look at BuddhismDoes it not look up to you rather than down to you treat you as an adult rather than a child not demand and command but patiently teach and instruct what practically amounts to the same thingThe Buddha states that we are heirs to our kamma that we make it form it and that what we do in this existence does affect our lives in the next oneHowever in Buddhism there is no need of beating our breasts and heeding authoritarian demands that we repentWe can rise up out of our sloth and torpor out of evil and ugliness by following the path If it were true that without a vengeful God man would be less than human how do we justify the existence for thousands of years of Buddhists living in peace and love with each otherChrist and Buddha were alike in many waysIt is not my intention to disparage anyones belief in ChristChrist said Love thy neighbor as thyself Buddha said Show compassion and lovingkindness to all beings God said to the Jews Do not unto others that which you would not do unto yourself This is what Christ later said in reverse positively but with the same meaningIt was Moses who interpreted the words of God to his people but for that reason they did not clothe him in divinity nor did he do so himselfWhere the Buddhists and Christians part company is the Christs followers accorded him divinity whereas Buddhas disciples accord him reverence as a great beingBuddha had taught that it is mans clinging to the idea of separate selfness which is the cause of his sufferingImplicit in separate selfhood is egotism and cravingThis is illusion the basic illusionThe man who prays to God expresses cravingHe is a clingerHe wishes something for self is egotisticEven the idea of a God expresses the thought of an extension of his egotism into a future life  in heaven or whereverThe prayer craves for a beautiful painfree future or continuation of the presentIn return he promises his God to be of good behaviorBuddha teaches that beauty is fleeting life is impermanent and transitory that pain and sorrow are an outcome of the craving egotistic selfThat craving is our sufferingCraving implies cravennessTo be craven is to fearFearfulness is sufferingLife is fearfulThere is suffering in the world because the fearful fearing self continues in its illusion of lonely separatenessThe separate self clings to its fears its selfseeking its pleading hoping cravingGive me it implores its God help me What is the Buddhas answer to thisDoes he not say Cleanse yourself of the selfidea of its greed hatred ignoranceAnd what is this ignoranceIs it not our ignoring our refusal to see the basic illusion of selfhoodWe finally return to meditation again to why we meditateMeditation is a way the Buddhas way of selfcleansing selfelimination of freeing the mind of its attachments to the impermananent and illusoryThrough meditation we learn to detach the self from its assumptions to realize that ego is substanceless to free our mind from its defilements and illusions to approach through wisdom and compassion the ultimate cessation of suffering which comes with Nibbana the utter abandonment of our selfhoodIn this no eternity is sought no endless continuityAnd no annihilationFor since there is no one what is there to annihilateOr to eternalizeIn a way of thinking is not this a kind of sublime mysticismA creed or belief that yields unseeking equanimity quietude and the end of sufferingSince all being in the end is mystery since trembling transitory being is but an illusory drop of water in a depthless ocean why not accept it as soThose who crave for and pray to gods often achieve thereby a kind of mental purificationEven the prayers of sceptics often achieve the same resultIf prayer brings relief and quietude remission of suffering it cannot be badBut what if the relief is unlastingApart from the notion that prayer implies a dependency on external or supernatural authority which I have no reason to bring into question it definitely is based on the idea of a self as opposed to an other and of bringing the two together in a sort of bargaining processBut what if we can accept the idea that there is no self to begin with and therefore no one to do the bargainingI am reminded in conclusion of a little storyA Christian missionary found a Chinese priest chanting in a templeWhen the Chinese had finished the missionary asked him To whom were you prayingTo no one replied the Chinese priestWell what were you praying for the missionary insistedNothing said the ChineseThe missionary turned away baffledAs the was leaving the temple the Chinese added kindly And there was no one praying you knowI have learned that through meditation one comes to appreciate vistas of truth in no other way attainable and that if one does not come to understand totally and unquestionably the fullest depths of meaning possible as to the causes of suffering one does at least arrive by painful experience and mindfulness to comprehension of its imponderability and immensityI see it in a personal way in my seventh decade in severe and frequent anginas in arthritic pains which make sittings so difficult that I must frequently change positions during meditation or do standing meditationI see it in my deafened and daily worsening hearing the dimming of my eyes and in the realization that in the course of minding my breath and giving consideration to the dissolution of every component of my body anicca impermanence is the source out of which this suffering or dukkha flowsOut of this impermanence too I sense the vastness of the illusion that we possess anything life abiding continuous and distinguishable selfhood and that the epitome of suffering arises from this basic illusion  that there is a one a self which is suffering or sufferableThe facts of suffering its truth and the facts of impermanence as well are widely recognized by most religionsAll accept the basic tragical quality of lifeWhere Buddhism goes forward from the rest is in the maintenance and espousal of the theme of noselfLife death impermanence and suffering then become but a process in which in an ultimate and fundamental sense there is no personal participationFrom this notion comes release emancipation and enlightenmentAs phenomena we may continue to go on until the ultimate collapse of our bodies and death overtakes usBut since no self is any longer engaged in the process it becomes depersonalizedWe are no longer subjects or even objects of calamity despair diseaseDisturbance dejection worry dread anguish decay enfeeblement senility no longer concern usSerenity and equanimity come with a new wisdom reflecting our detachment not alone from these negative emotions but also from the positive ones such as longing craving hoping desiring wishing clingingBecause whether we realize and attain the positive results or goals sought through these emotions or do not there is continued sufferingWe suffer if we fail to attain them and there is disappointmentIf we do attain them they are impermanent suffer their own kind of decay and out of this loss we suffer as wellThe goal in the end becomes the evenminded depersonalized middle course wherein irritation aversion uncertainty vanishHate and animosity become impossibleOne is neither submissive nor rebelliousWe transcend the need for personal love or hateQuietude comes to usReleaseThese are the goals of insight or vipassana meditation whose aim is release from sufferingHow close we come to realizing them will depend on the quality of those we seek out to teach us and on our own assiduity in the mindfulness with which we seek through our meditation to arrive at the other shoreThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe idea of renunciation has never been a particularly attractive one for most people even when its importance as an ideal has been admittedFor much of the Western world today however renunciation seems not so much unpalatable as unfamiliar and indeed all but incomprehensibleThis was not always so of courseThe people of the Middle Ages were well acquainted with the traditional Christian conception of this world as something which presents many snares for the soul and is of little importance when compared with the eternal life to comeThat this conception has ceased to be as influential as it once was is the result of a number of complex historical processes but as far as presentday attitudes are concerned the factor of the greatest and most immediate importance would probably be the rapid development of science and technology in the nineteenth and twentieth centuryScience has I think influenced peoples attitudes towards the world in three waysFirstly it appears to have confirmed by its achievements the ancient Greek philosophers faith in the ability of human reason to fathom all the mysteries of the universeSecondly these impressive achievements have led people to feel the physical world which has up till now been the province of scientific investigation is the only world worth investigating and even the only real worldAnd thirdly by providing through the technology which it has made possible an abundance of good things for our enjoyment science has encouraged a preoccupation with the objects and pleasures of the senses and a corresponding indifference to those things which are presumed to lie outside the range of the sensesIf then this world we perceive is the only reality and the senses and the reason are the only valid means of knowledge it follows that renunciation of the world is pointless and that aspiration to a reality which transcends the reason and the senses is bound to be futileThere have always been many people who would agree with this and materialist philosophers were not lacking even in the Buddhas dayBut I think it would be true to say that ideas of this nature have never been so widely accepted as they are in Western and Westerninfluenced countries todayEven religious thought has been affected and a number of progressive Christian theologians are trying to adapt their doctrines to the spirit of the age by glossing over the element of renunciation in Jesus teaching and Christian tradition and stressing after the Jewish fashion involvement in the world rather than detachment from itA similar tendency can be observed elsewhere in many of the  new religions of modern Japan for example or in the writings of Indian thinkers like Radhakrishnan and Sri AurobindoIn light of all this Buddhism must be considered somewhat unfashionableSome critics have accused it of being pessimistic nihilistic and lifedenyingOf course Buddhism is not pessimisticIn fact it is the most optimistic of religions for it teaches that man can perfect himself here and now and free himself by his own efforts from all suffering and unhappinessNor is it nihilisticAs the Buddha has often pointed out he taught only the annihilation of suffering and ignoranceAnd if Buddhism is lifedenying it is only because it is deathdefying for life and death are inseparableNevertheless these critics have sensed an important truth about the Dharma that it is essentially a teaching of renunciationIn one sense Buddhism is more thisworldly than any other religion since it takes as its starting point not some remote and transcendental Being or Act but the world as it is experienced by ordinary living beingsIn another sense however it is more otherworldly than most for according to the Buddha the world as we know it has three fundamental characteristics it contains nothing that is permanent it is for that reason essentially unsatisfactory to those who see it as it really is and are not led astray by superficial appearances and finally it contains nothing worth consideration as me or mine nothing that is in any way unchanging or substantialThese three characteristics are the basis of the Buddhas Teaching and the second of them known as ill or suffering is the theme of the Four Truths which the Buddha expounded in his first sermonThere is nothing ambiguous about thisThe Buddha was well aware that much pleasure and happiness is to be found in the world as it is ordinarily experienced but he insisted that these pleasures were transient and therefore relative and limited and that true happiness is only to be found by renouncing what is worldly transient relative and limited and seeking instead what is transcendental unchanging absolute and unlimitedThis absolute state is what is called NirvanaIt can be defined if at all only in negative terms for what is completely transcendental is necessarily indescribableIt is certainly not a God creating and sustaining the world nor is it a Godhead which is the source or substance of the worldIn fact although it can be attained by those still living in the world it really has no connection with the world whatever and for that reason its nature cannot be conveyed by means of such an earthbound thing as language although the poetic use of language may certainly be able to suggest something of its quality as in the following famous passage There is monks a realm where there is neither earth nor water nor fire nor wind neither this world nor the next neither sun nor moonThere monks I say there is neither coming nor going nor remaining neither deceasing nor being bornWithout foundation is it without continuity without support this is the end of sufferingBuddhism then is a teaching of renunciationIt remains to see what is renounced and whyThe Buddha said What I teach is just ill and its cessation What is renounced then is ill suffering unsatisfactorinessBut what is unsatisfactorinessHere is the Buddhas answer Birth is ill old age and decay are ill death is ill sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are ill not to get what one wants is illIn short the five groups that are the object of clinging are ill These five groups taken together constitute the totality of what we call a being and what that being feels to be its self They may be translated as follows form or matter feeling perception or ideation motivation or mental activities and consciousnessIt is oneself then that is the source of suffering and it is self that must be renounced if one would be free from sufferingThis is a truth which is recognized by most religions but only in Buddhism is it fully understoodThe feeling of self the deeprooted sense of Iness involves the desire for the continued existence of selfIt generates in other words greed and attachment both for the self and also for those things which enhance the existence of the self and make it feel secure such things as sensepleasures possessions kinship with others and so onIt also generates hatred for or aversion from what is antiself that is from those things which threaten the continued existence or the happiness of the self by attacking it or by frustrating it in any wayThus the self can never be really happy for it is continually agitated by desires and fears which bind it tightly to the world and cause the ill for which the Buddha has prescribed the cureIt will be seen from this brief analysis that the self and the world are interdependent our emotional responses to the world strengthening our sense of self and our sense of self causing the illusory appearance of a permanent and substantial world with objective qualities of desirability and undesirabilityTherefore renunciation of the world and the renunciation of the self are but two aspects of the same thing and what we see as the world may on deeper analysis be found present within ourselvesSo the Buddha said In this very body six feet in length with its senseimpressions its thoughts and ideas are the world the origin of the world the cessation of the world and the Way that leads to the cessation of the worldIn the practice of renunciation three stages may be distinguishedFirst of all there is outward renunciation as when a man or woman leaves the household life to become a monk or a nunOutward renunciation has no intrinsic value and may theoretically be dispensed with but there is no doubt that it makes true renunciation very much easierTrue renunciation is a matter of the heart and mind rather than the bodyIt is renunciation of the world of desires and aversions within rather than of the world of objects withoutFinally there is the ultimate renunciation which is the renunciation of ones self in its entirety and the consequent destruction of all illTo illustrate the traditional Buddhist method of renunciation I should like to examine a stereotype passage which occurs with slight variations at a number of places in the Pali canonIt describes the ideal life of the monk beginning with his first hearing of the Dharma and concluding with his attainment of NirvanaIt starts as followsSuppose that a Perfect One arises in the world an Accomplished One fully Awakened complete in knowledge and conduct knower of the worlds sublime incomparable trainer of those tobetamed teacher of gods and men Awakened blestHaving thoroughly understood by his own supernormal insight this world with its gods its Mara its Brahma its ascetics and brahmans its gods and men he declares his knowledgeHe preaches the Truth good in its beginning good in its development good in its consummationHe makes known the holy life in all its fullness and purityA householder or a householders son or one born into some good family hears that DharmaHaving heard it he comes to feel faith in the Perfect OnePossessed of this faith he reflects thus The household life is crampedIt is a path choked with dustTo leave it is to come out into the open airIt is not easy for one who lives at home to lead the holy life in all its perfect fullness and purity bright as motherofpearlSurely I should now shave off my hair and beard go forth into the homeless life In course of time he gives up his possessions be they many or few and his circle of kinsmen be it small or large shaves off his hair and beard puts on the yellow robe and leaving his home goes forth into the homeless lifeSo far this is outward renunciationNow the new monk must turn his attention to the world withinThe first step is to free his mind from the domination by unwholesome emotions and sensedesires and to this end he begins to discipline himself by strict observance of moralityThe text continues So he lives the homeless life observing selfrestraint according to the rules of the Order possessed of good conduct seeing danger in the slightest offense accepting and training himself in the precepts There follows a detailed account of over forty things which the monk must shunThe first seven are of basic importance for they are the most general in characterThey are also worth looking at because they stress the positive qualities of mind which the monk should be developing at this time thereby helping to dispel the impression which a series of prohibitions tends to give that observance of the moralities is something dry and negativeIn fact just as one only renounces Samsara in order to obtain Nirvana so the sole purpose of renouncing bad or unwholesome qualities is to allow good or wholesome ones to take their placeThe wording of these first seven precepts makes this quite clearHere the monk having abandoned the taking of life continues to abstain therefromHaving once used stick and sword now feeling shame he is kind and compassionate to all living things Having abandoned the taking of what is not given he continues to abstain therefromTaking only what is given he waits for the giftCommitting no theft he lives as one who become pure Having abandoned unchasity he is chaste and keeps aloof abstaining from coition from the practice of the villagefolk Having abandoned false speech he continues to abstain therefrom and is a speaker of truthPledged to truth he is reliable and trustworthy never lying to the world Having abandoned slander he continues to abstain therefromWhat he hears here he does not repeat elsewhere in order to raise a quarrel against the people hereWhat he hears elsewhere he does not repeat here in order to raise a quarrel against the people thereThus he reconciles those who are divided and encourages those who are friendsHarmony is his pleasure his delight and joy and he speaks words that creates harmony Having abandoned harsh speech he continues to abstain therefromWhatever words are gentle pleasing to the ear affectionate touching the heart polite pleasant and agreeable to the people  such are the words he speaks Having abandoned trivial chatter he continues to abstain therefromHis words are timely in accordance with the truth meaningful concerning the Dharma and the Discipline and the OrderHe speaks words that are worth treasuringThey are uttered at the right time are accompanied by reasons are welldefined and profitableThese are the first seven moral observancesThe rest concern other things to be avoided such as harming vegetation and various activities connected with mealtimes personal adornments entertainments games trading and so onThe section on morality concludes as followsThen the monk being thus complete in morality sees no reason for fear on any side as far as selfrestraint in his conduct is concernedJust as a ruler duly anointed whose enemies have been crushed sees no reason for fear on any side as far as enemies are concerned so the monk thus being complete in morality sees no reason for fear on any side as far as selfrestraint in his conduct is concernedAnd possessed of this noble group of moralities he experiences unalloyed happiness within himselfSo far the monk has progressed through two stages of renunciationFirst he has publicly renounced the world and left the household lifeThen by strict selfdiscipline he has ensured that no moral lapse on his part will cause him to become entangled once again in the life that he has left behind and his success in this selfdiscipline has given him a confidence and a happiness that he never had beforeThus he has made his initial outward renunciation secureNow he is free to turn his attention to renunciation of the other inner world of the psychophysical life which is his self He begins by endeavoring to become detached from the activities of his senses and of his mind and body by the practice of mindfulnessHe will now observe the things which impinge on his senses watching to see that he does not react to them in an unwholesome or unskillful mannerThus morality becomes mindcontrolThen when senseimpressions are no longer capable of agitating his mind unduly he learns to become aware of his bodily actions as he performs them contemplating his body disinterestedly as though it were somebody elsesHow is the monk guarded as to the doors of his sensesHaving perceived a form with his eye he does not fasten on its general appearance or on its secondary characteristicsAs long as he lived with his faculty of sight unrestrained he fell prey to craving and unhappiness to evil and unskilled states of mindSo he undertakes restraint watching over his faculty of sight and restraining itThe monk possessed of this noble restraint of the faculties experiences unalloyed happiness within himselfAnd how is the monk mindful and awareThe monk in going forth or returning is clearly aware of his actionSo also when looking ahead or looking around when bending his arm in or stretching it out when wearing his robe or carrying his alms bowl when eating drinking chewing or tasting when defecating or urinating when walking standing sitting sleeping waking speaking or keeping silent in all this he is clearly aware of what he is doingThus is the monk mindful and awareThe monk has now shaken off most of his worldly desires and has gained a considerable degree of detachment from himselfAs a consequence he is perfectly content with his lot and with his few necessary possessions He is contented with the robes that protect his body and the alms food that protects his belly Just as a bird carries its wings with it wherever it flies so the monk is contented with the robes that protect his body and the alms food that protect his belly and he has only them with him wherever he goesThus he is contentNow having surrendered attachment both to the world and to his own body the monk can concentrate all his efforts on the true source of ill which is his mindSitting in a quiet spot he strives to cleanse his mind of what are known as the five hindrances The text describes the process as followsHaving given up covetousness for the world he remains with his heart free from and cleansed of covetousnessHaving given up ill will and hatred he remains with his heart free from ill will and hatredFriendly and compassionate to all living things he remains free of themConscious of light mindful and fully aware he cleanses his heart of sloth and torporHaving given up restlessness and worry he remains free of themInwardly calm he cleanses his heart of restlessness and worryHaving given up doubt he remains having passed beyond doubtNo longer uncertain of what is skillful he cleanses his mind of doubtHaving brought about a subsidence of the five hindrances he is filled with an exhilarating sense of freedomThe Buddha compares his feelings of relief and happiness to those of a man who has just discharged a debt or recovered from a painful illness or been freed from prison or released from slavery or who has safely crossed a dangerous wildernessThis subsidence of the five hindrances and the ensuing calmness and happiness of the body and mind make it possible for the monk to attain what is called the first absorption This is the first of a series of levels of consciousness which can be achieved by the successful practice of intense concentration of the mind  a process which is often called rather vaguely meditation The attainment of these absorptions not only produces a blissfulness that is far beyond the range of worldly pleasures it is also makes the mind an instrument of knowledge that can transcend the limitations of the sensesAfter attaining the first absorption the monk passes on to the second third and fourth shedding successively thought conception the exhilarating and blissful sensations that arise in him and finally all feelings of happiness and unhappiness pleasure and displeasureHe is now in a state of pure mindfulness and equanimity and his mind  which has become composed purified spotless undefiled pliant workable firm and imperturbable  is capable of that direct and penetrating insight into the true nature of existence which brings deliveranceNow he has left the world a long way behind but he must turn his mind back to it if he would complete the process of renunciation for the final deliverance comes not from looking away from the world or the self but from seeing through themSo he scrutinizes his self his body and his mind noting that this is my body possessed of form composed of the four elements springing from father and mother built up by solid and liquid food a thing impermanent by nature fragile perishable and subject to total destructionAnd this is my consciousness bound up with and dependent on itAt this point he is said to be able to acquire certain supernormal powers if he wishes including the ability to recall his own innumerable past lives and the direct awareness of the death and rebirth of other beings in accordance with their past actionsHis final deliverance his ultimate renunciation comes now with the destruction of what are known as the asavas or asravas a word which defies translationThese cankers epitomize the forces which bring about continued existence or becoming and their destruction involves complete and perfect understanding of the conditioned and unsatisfactory nature of becoming as it is summed up in the Four TruthsIt is as if the Buddha says there were a pool of water in the mountains limpid clear and still and a man were to stand on the bank and see with his eyes the various shells the gravel and pebbles and the shoals of fish moving about or at rest So the monk with his mind composed purified cleansed spotless undefiled pliant workable firm and imperturbable directs his mind to the destruction of the cankersHe knows as it really is This is ill this is the origin of ill this is the cessation of ill and this is the Way that leads to cessation These are the cankers this is their origin this is their cessation and this is the Way that leads to their cessation Knowing and seeing thus his heart is freed from the cankers of sensedesires the canker of becoming and the canker of ignoranceFree he knows that he is free and he understands Exhausted is birth the holy life is fulfilled what was to be done has been done there will be no more of the present state With this final and certain insight renunciation of both self and world becomes complete and the monk now an arahant has attained the deathless state NirvanaHaving considered the theory and practice of renunciation as it is set forth in the Pali texts I should like to conclude by examining some possible misconceptions concerning the nature of renunciation in general and Buddhist renunciation in particularFirst of all one may note that the text quoted in the previous section deals with the life of a monkThis is true of the great majority of the discourses in the Pali canon and some people have concluded that Buddhism teaches a path of total renunciation which can only be followed by monks and nunsTo show that this is a misunderstanding one need only point to the many instructions on political social moral and religious matters which the Buddha addressed to lay peopleOne might also mention the many lay men and women throughout Buddhist history who have successfully followed the Buddhas Teaching even to the threshold of NirvanaAnd finally there is the fact that although a discourse may be addressed to monks it is not necessarily intended for them exclusivelySo the Commentary to the Greater discourse on Mindfulness for example says The monk is given here as an example of those dedicated to the practice of the Teaching Whoever undertakes that practice is here included under the term monk Nevertheless while the Buddha never neglected his lay followers it cannot be denied that he gave more attention to his monks and nunsIt is as if he says there were a farmer with three fields one good one middling and one poorHe would sow the good one first then the middling one and he may or may not sow the poor oneThese three fields the Buddha likens respectively to his monks and nuns his lay followers and recluses brahmans and wanderers of other sects Just as the farmer sows his crop in the fields so the Buddha teaches Dhamma to all impartially even to the last of the three groups for if they were to understand even a single sentence that would be a blessing and a happiness for them for a long timeIt is clear however that as the farmer will expect a greater yield from the first field so the Buddha expected his teachings to bear more fruit amongst his monks and nuns then among the laityThe reason is that the Dhamma as has been said aims at an inner renunciation and the outward renunciation of the monastic life consequently provides the best conditions for its practiceTo perfect oneself in morality mindfulness and concentration is no easy task and monks and nuns are not hampered in their pursuit of it by having to worry about earning a living about money property family and all the daily noise and bustle that distracted the householders life even in ancient India and no doubt do so still more in our modern urban civilizationIn short although the Path of renunciation is theoretically open to all whoever and wherever they are yet success in following it can be greatly affected by ones outward circumstance and a layman will have to overcome many more obstacles than a monkWhat then of the weaker vessels among the laity who may not have the opportunity the ability or even the desire to renounce the worldIt would be a mistake here to imagine that the Buddhist is called upon to make an immediate onceandforall choice between Samsara and Nirvana renouncing the world in the same spirit as the candidate for Christian baptism renounces Satan and all his worksFor a start there is no need for the Buddhist to hurry unless he truly desires to do soAn infinity of deaths and births stretches before him and he has plenty of time in which to prepare himself for renunciation if he is not yet ready for it  provided of course that he continues to lead a morally blameless life thus ensuring that he will continue to be born in more or less favorable circumstances in futureAgain there is no sharp distinction in Buddhism between the saved and the damnedThere are many degrees of spiritual development and as a skilled teacher should the Buddha always adapted his message to the needs and capacities of his audienceTo those who were aware of the hollowness of worldly things he taught the path of final deliverance while to those who were still in love with the world he simply pointed out the way to lead a good life one which would bring as much benefit as possible and as little harm or suffering for themselves and othersHe never demanded more from anybody than they were capable of at any given time saying that just as the great ocean deepens gradually as one goes further out from shore and does not plunge down abruptly so in this Dharma and Discipline the training is gradual the practice is gradual the progress is gradualThere is no abrupt attainment of the ultimate knowledge So there is no need for anybody to try and plunge into deep water before he has first learned to swim in the shallowsSuch a procedure would in fact be very dangerous as the Dhammapada warns As a blade of grass will cut the hand when wrongly grasped so the ascetic life will drag one down to hell if wrongly taken up And the disciple need not lack for means of selfimprovement even at the beginning of the pathDevotional practices living as blameless a life as possible by observing the precepts trying to be kind to others and speak and think kindly of them study of and reflection on the Dharma degree of selfknowledge through mindfulness and some practice of meditation perhaps all of these things among others are within the reach of the most worldlyminded and will have a good resultOne does not have to be a saint or even a monk or nun to attempt themPatience and persistence are all that is necessary to ensure progressHere one might recall the words of the Dhammapada Do not underrate goodness thinking it will not come to me By falling drops of water a water jug is filled and a wise man will be full of goodness even though he accumulates it bit by bitAnd again Let the wise man gradually remove the impurities form himself as the smith from silver bit by bit and from moment to momentA second misconception is that renunciation is a gloomy and depressing businessA biographer of the Christian mystic StJohn of the Cross says that on a first reading of his work Few persons however spiritually minded will fail to find it repellentIt strikes a deadly chill not only into the unhealthy heat of senseaffection but into the glowing warmth of what one had hoped and believed to be pure love of GodIt calls on one to go out from Godgiven light into a black and unknown darkness I think that God aside many people are repelled in a similar way when they first encounter the Buddhas Teaching of renunciation which may be one reason for the recurrent charges of nihilism and pessimismThe reason for this reaction is not far to seek and the clue lies in the words unknown darknessFor most people the pleasures of the senses are the only pleasures the only source of happiness that they knowNaturally they do not take kindly to the suggestion that they give these up for some faroff and indescribable goalBut it is only ignorance that makes the goal appear darkThe darkness is as it were only the objective counterpart of a subjective blindness and in fact as those who have had experience of this forbidding darkness repeatedly assert the successful abandoning of sensepleasures brings a happiness far greater than anything that they had known hithertoIt is not difficult to see why this should be so when one considers the way in which sensepleasures come aboutA sensepleasure arises from the gratification of a desire in the following wayFirst of all a desire arises and creates a kind of tension in the mind of the being which feels the desireSince this tension is felt as unpleasant the being is then impelled to get rid of it by gratifying the desireWhen the desired object is obtained the desire is gratified and the tension in the mind is relaxedFrom the relaxation of the tension flows a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment a greater or lesser degree of happiness or pleasureNow as long as existence continues desires of one kind and another will be continually arising at every moment and agitating the mindThis means that the relaxation of tension and hence the pleasure of happiness which comes from their gratification can never be anything but temporary and incompleteIf then happiness comes not from desire itself but from its subsiding it follows that the renunciation of sensedesires so far from making one miserable really opens up the only path to true and lasting happinessAnd when the goal has been attained becoming has ceased and the mind is no longer troubled by the arising of any kind of desireThe result must be a state of calm and imperturbable happiness that ordinary beings still enmeshed in worldly desires can scarcely comprehendEven the temporary quiescence of the mind in deep meditation is said to create a sense of bliss that far surpasses anything in ordinary experience and in this way to give a foretaste of the unutterable peace of NirvanaIt is important to bear all this in mind otherwise it might be easy to imagine that Buddhism is pessimistic and that Buddhists seek to renounce the world out of hatred for itBut there is no more unBuddhist emotion than hatred whether for the world or anything else and to attempt renunciation for that reason would not be only futile but deadlyThe correct motive for renunciation is rather that given in the Dhammapada If by surrendering a slight happiness one may realize a great happiness the wise man should give up the slight happiness considering the greater oneAnother error would be to suppose that Buddhists like followers of some other religions think that one should renounce the world because it is corrupt or evil or ugly but no Buddhist has ever held such a viewIt is not that worldly happiness and beauty are nonexistent or sinful or even worthlessIt is just that they are flawed by their transience and their liability to change into suffering and uglinessThe Buddhist ideal is to feel neither attachment in the case of happiness and beauty nor revulsion in the case of suffering and ugliness but simply to observe things as they really are with equanimity and perfect freedom of mindA different kind of mistake is to think that renunciation is impossibly difficult only to be achieved if at all by a superhuman effort of will and forcible suppression of natural desiresOf course to sever the ties that bind one to the world are rarely an easy or a pleasant task and strict selfdiscipline and persistent effort are necessary until the goal has been attainedNevertheless renunciation should never be forcedThe man who has to force himself to renounce the world only shows that he is not yet ready to do so and he must learn to be more patient for otherwise he will only strengthen his bonds instead of loosening themWe do not have to compel ourselves to abandon the games and toys of our childhood we simply outgrew themSo should it be with one who renounces worldly pleasures and preoccupationsEven though he may not yet be entirely free from nostalgia for these things of his spiritual childhood he is beginning to outgrow them and he no longer truly desires themFor him renunciation while it may be difficult is not a forbidding and distasteful taskIt is on the contrary the only way to genuine and lasting happinessTrue renunciation does not involve driving Nature out with a pitchfork it is simply a question of learning to let goFinally I would like to consider the objection that renunciation is a flight from the worlds problems a selfish escapismI think that enough has already been said to show that renunciation is by no means an easy way out of anythingOn the contrary it requires a considerable effort of selfdisciplineAgain the aim of renunciation is to overcome the ills of the world to understand and destroy the suffering that is at the root of the worlds problems and not run away from itAs for the charge of selfishness and lack of concern for the welfare of others it could be answered in a number of waysFirst one might point out that in the Buddhas words it is not possible for one who is himself sunk in a mire to pull out another who is in the same situationBut it is possible for one who is not sunk in a mire to pull out another who isIn other words no one can give effective help to others unless he has first helped himselfNobody can solve for others problems that he has not yet solved for himself and that is why selfdevelopment must precede altruistic activitySecondly one might reply that not only is deliberate selfishness impossible for a true follower of the Buddha for he will be aiming at the destruction of self but also as was seen above kindness and compassion towards all living things are enjoined on the monk as an indispensable part of the pathAfter he has succeeded in his aim and attained final deliverance he will continue to live only for the sakes of others in order to pull them out of the mire The Buddha himself set the example in this and when his first sixty monks had realized Nirvana he sent them out singly to preach with those words Go your way monks for the benefit of the many for the happiness of the many out of compassion for the world for the welfare the benefit the happiness of gods and menFinally it should be remembered that compassion for the world and detachment from the world are not incompatibleOn the contrary they are inseparable for compassion is purest only where it is totally disinterestedIt is easy to see that if I help another from some ulterior motive such as expectation of a reward my compassion if compassion is present in me at all will be tainted by selfinterestWhat is perhaps not so obvious is that if I am in any way concerned about my action or its results if I care about the person I am helping my motives are still touched with selfishness for I am identifying myself with my action or with the other personFurthermore since a sense of self is an indication that ignorance has not been completely eliminated it shows that I am not yet out of the mire and my help will for that reason be less effective than the help of someone who is completely disinterestedThus one arrives at the paradoxical conclusion that perfect compassion can arise and perfect help can be given only where there is perfect detachment and that those who have totally renounced the world are precisely the people who can be of most benefit to itThe clearest illumination of this is the life of the Buddha himselfHe began by renouncing the world and finally transcended itAnd yet despite the fact that he had nothing whatever to gain from it he spent the remainder of his long life after his Awakening tramping on the roads of northeastern India in order to help beings which he knew full well had no substantial existenceThere is no doubt that he did this out of the purest compassion for being totally disinterested in the matter he could have had no other motive and to the extent of the help that he was able to give twentyfive centuries of Buddhist history bear eloquent witnessThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe mental exercise known as meditation is found in all religious systemsPrayer is a form of discursive meditation and in Hinduism the reciting of slokas and mantras is employed to tranquilize the mind to a state of receptivityIn most of these systems the goal is identified with the particular psychic results that ensue sometimes very quickly and the visions that come in the semitrance state or the sounds that are heard are considered to be the endresult of the exerciseThis is not the case in the forms of meditation practiced in BuddhismThere is still comparatively little known about the mind its functions and its powers and it is difficult for most people to distinguish between selfhypnosis the development of mediumistic states and the real process of mental clarification and direct perception which is the object of Buddhist mental concentrationThe fact that mystics of every religion have induced on themselves states wherein they see visions and hear voices that are in accordance with their own religious beliefs indicates that their meditation has resulted only in bringing to the surface of the mind and objectifying the concepts already embedded in the deepest strata of their subconscious mindsThe Christian sees and converses with the saints of whom he already knows the Hindu visualizes the gods of the Hindu pantheon and so onWhen Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa the Bengali mystic began to turn his thoughts towards Christianity he saw visions of Jesus in his meditations in place of his former eidetic images of the Hindu AvatarsThe practiced hypnotic subject becomes more and more readily able to surrender himself to the suggestions made to him by the hypnotiser and anyone who has studied this subject is bound to see a connection between the mental state of compliance he has reached and the facility with which the mystic can induce whatever kind of experiences he wills himself to undergoThere is still another possibility latent in the practice of meditation the development of mediumistic faculties by which the subject can actually see and hear beings on different planes of existence the Devalokas and the realm of the unhappy ghosts for exampleThese worlds being nearest to our own are the more readily accessible and this is the true explanation of the psychic phenomena of Western SpiritualismThe object of Buddhist meditation however is none of these thingsThey arise as sideproducts but not only are they not its goal but they are hindrances which have to be overcomeThe Christian who has seen Jesus or the Hindu who has conversed with Bhagavan Krishna may be quite satisfied that he has fulfilled the purpose of his religious life but the Buddhist who sees a vision of the Buddha knows by that very fact that he has only succeeded in objectifying a concept in his own mind for the Buddha after his Parinibbana is in his own words no longer visible to gods or menThere is an essential difference then between Buddhist meditation and concentration and that practiced in other systemsThe Buddhist embarking on a course of meditation does well to recognize this difference and to establish in his own conscious mind a clear idea of what it is he is trying to doThe rootcause of rebirth and suffering is avijja conjoined with and reacting upon tanhaThese two causes form a vicious circle on the one hand concepts the result of ignorance and on the other hand desire arising from conceptsThe world of phenomena has no meaning beyond the meaning given to it by our own interpretationWhen that interpretation is conditioned by avijja we are subject to the state known as vipallasa or hallucinationSaññavipallasa hallucination of perception cittavipallasa hallucination of consciousness and ditthivipallasa hallucination of views cause us to regard that which is impermanent as permanent that which is painful as a source of pleasure and that which is unreal or literally without any self existence as being a real selfexisting entityConsequently we place a false interpretation on all the sensory experiences we gain through the six channels of cognition that is the eye ear nose tongue sense of touch and mind cakkhu sota ghana jivha kaya and manoPhysics by showing that the realm of phenomena we know through these channels of cognition does not really correspond to the physical world known to science has confirmed this Buddhist truthWe are deluded by our own sensesPursuing what we imagine to be desirable an object of pleasure we are in reality only following a shadow trying to grasp a mirageIt is anicca dukkha anatta  impermanent associated with suffering an insubstantialBeing so it can only be the cause of impermanence suffering and insubstantiality since like begets like and we ourselves who chase the illusion are also impermanent subject to suffering and without any persistent egoprincipleIt is a case of a shadow pursuing a shadowThe purpose of Buddhist meditation therefore is to gain more than an intellectual understanding of this truth to liberate ourselves from the delusion and thereby put an end to both ignorance and cravingIf the meditation does not produce results tending to this consummation  results which are observable in the character and the whole attitude to life  it is clear that there is something wrong either with the system or with the method of employing itIt is not enough to see lights to have visions or to experience ecstasyThese phenomena are too common to be impressive to the Buddhist who really understands the purpose of Buddhist meditationThere are actual dangers in them which are apparent to one who is also a student of psychopathologyIn the Buddhas great discourse on the practice of mindfulness the Mahasatipatthana Sutta both the object and the means of attaining it are clearly set forthAttentiveness to the movements of the body to the everchanging states of the mind is to be cultivated in order that their real nature should be knownInstead of identifying these physical and mental phenomena with the false concept of self we are to see them as they really are movements of a physical body an aggregate of the four elements subject to physical laws of causality on the one hand and on the other a flux of successive phases of consciousness arising and passing away in response to external stimuliThey are to be viewed objectively as though they were processes not associated with ourselves but belonging to another order of phenomenaFrom what can selfishness and egotism proceed if not from the concept of selfIf the practice of any form of meditation leaves selfishness or egotism unabated it has not been successfulA tree is judged by its fruits and a man by his actions there is no other criterionParticularly is this true in Buddhist psychology because the man is his actionsIn the truest sense they or the continuity of kamma and vipaka which they represent are the only claim he can make to any persistent identity not only through the different phases of this life but also from one life to anotherAttentiveness with regard to body and mind serves to break down the illusion of self and not only that it also cuts off craving and attachment to external objects so that ultimately there is neither the self that craves nor any object of cravingIt is a long and arduous discipline and one that can only be undertaken in retirement from the world and its caresYet even a temporary retirement a temporary course of this discipline can bear good results in that it establishes an attitude of mind which can be applied to some degree in the ordinary situations of lifeDetachment objectivity is an invaluable aid to clear thinking it enables a man to sum up a given situation without bias personal or otherwise and to act in that situation with courage and discretionAnother gift it bestows is that of concentration  the ability to focus the mind and keep it steadily fixed on a single point and this is the great secret of success in any undertakingThe mind is hard to tame it roams here and there restlessly as the wind or like an untamed horse but when it is fully under control it is the most powerful instrument in the whole universeHe who has mastered his own mind is indeed master of the Three WorldsIn the first place he is without fearFear arises because we associate mind and body with self consequently any harm to either is considered to be harm done to oneselfBut he who has broken down this illusion by realizing that the five khandha process is merely the manifestation of cause and effect does not fear death or misfortuneHe remains equable alike in success and failure unaffected by praise or blameThe only thing he fears is demeritorious action because he knows that no thing or person in the world can harm him except himself and as his detachment increases he becomes less and less liable to demeritorious deedsUnwholesome action comes of an unwholesome mind and as the mind becomes purified healed of its disorders bad kamma ceases to accumulateHe comes to have a horror of wrong action and to take greater and greater delight in those deeds that are rooted in alobha adosa and amoha  generosity benevolence and wisdomOne of the most universallyapplicable methods of cultivating mental concentration is anapanasati attentiveness on the ingoing and outgoing breathThis unlike the Yogic systems does not call for any interference with the normal breathing the breath being merely used as a point on which to fix the attention at the tip of the nostrilsThe attention must not wander even to follow the breath but must be kept rigidly on the selected spotIn the initial stages it is advisable to mark the respiration by counting but as soon as it is possible to keep the mind fixed without this artificial aid it should be discontinued and only used when it is necessary to recall the attentionAs the state of mental quiescence is approached the breath appears to become fainter and fainter until it is hardly discernibleIt is at this stage that certain psychic phenomena appear which may at first be disconcertingA stage is reached when the actual bodily dukkha the sensation of arising and passing away of the physical elements in the body is feltThis is experienced as a disturbance but it must be remembered that it is an agitation that is always present in the body but we are unaware of it until the mind becomes stabilizedIt is the first direct experience of the dukkha which is inherent in all phenomena  the realization within oneself of the first of the Four Noble Truths Dukkha Ariya SaccaWhen that is passed there follows the sensation of piti rapturous joy associated with the physical bodyThe teacher of vipassana however is careful never to describe to his pupil beforehand what he is likely to experience for if he does so there is a strong possibility that the power of suggestion will produce a false reaction particularly in those cases where the pupil is very suggestible and greatly under the influence of the teacherIn kammattana it is permissible to use certain devices such as the earth or color kasina as focal points for the attentionA candle flame a hole in the wall or some metal object can also be used and the method of using them is found in the Pali texts and the VisuddhimaggaIn the texts themselves it is to be noted that the Buddha gave objects of meditation to disciples in accordance with their individual characteristics and his unerring knowledge of the right technique for each came from his insight into their previous birthsSimilarly with recursive meditation a subject would be given which was easily comprehensible to the pupil or which served to counteract some strong unwholesome tendency in his natureThus to one attracted by sensual indulgence the Buddha would recommend meditation on the impurity of the body or the cemetery meditation Here the object is to counterbalance attraction by repulsion but it is only a skillful means to reach the final state in which attraction and repulsion both cease to existIn the arahant there is neither liking nor disliking he regards all things with perfect equanimity as did Thera Maha Moggallana when he accepted a handful of rice from a leperThe use of the rosary in Buddhism is often misunderstoodIf it is used for the mechanical repetition of a set formula the repeating of so many phrases as an act of piety as in other religions its value is negligibleWhen it is used as means of holding the attention and purifying the mind however it can be a great helpOne of the best ways of employing it because it calls for undivided attention is to repeat the Pali formula of the qualities of Buddha Dhamma and Sangha beginning Itipi so Bhagava   with the first bead starting again with the second and continuing to the next quality Itipi so Bhagava Arahan   and so on until with the last bead the entire formula is repeated from beginning to endThis cannot be carried out successfully unless the mind is entirely concentrated on what is being doneAt the same time the recalling of the noble qualities of Buddha Dhamma and Sangha lifts the mind to a lofty plane since the words carry with them a meaning the impresses itself on the pattern of the thoughtmoments as they arise and pass awayThe value of this in terms of Abhidhamma psychology lies in the wholesome nature of the cittakkhana or consciousnessmoment in its uppada thiti and bhanga phasesEach of these wholesome cittakkhana contributes to the improvement of the sankhara or aggregate of tendencies in other words it directs the subsequent thoughtmoments into a higher realm and tends to establish the character on that levelSamatha bhavana the development of mental tranquillity with concentration is accompanied by three benefits it gives happiness in the present life a favorable rebirth and the freedom from mental defilements which is a prerequisite for attainment of insightIn samatha the mind becomes like a still clear pool completely free from disturbance and agitation and ready to mirror on its surface the nature of things as they really are the aspect of them which is hidden from ordinary knowledge by the restlessness of cravingIt is the peace and fulfillment which is depicted on the features of the Buddha investing his images with a significance that impresses even those who have no knowledge of what it meansSuch an image of the Buddha can itself be a very suitable object of meditation and is in fact the one that most Buddhists instinctively useThe very sight of the tranquil image can calm and pacify a mind distraught with worldly hopes and fearsIt is the certain and visible assurance of NibbanaVipassana bhavana is realization of the three signs of being anicca dukkha and anatta by direct insightThese three characteristics impermanence suffering and nonself can be grasped intellectually as scientific and philosophical truth but this is not in itself sufficient to rid the mind of egoism and cravingThe final objective lies on a higher level of awareness the direct intuitional plane where it is actually experienced as psychological factUntil this personal confirmation is obtained the sphere of sense perception and sensoryresponses remain stronger than the intellectual conviction the two function side by side on different levels of consciousness but it is usually the sphere dominated by avijja which continues to determine the course of life by volitional actionThe philosopher who fails to live according to his philosophy is the most familiar example of this incompatibility between theory and practiceWhen the direct perception is obtained however what was at its highest intellectual level still merely a theory becomes actual knowledge in precisely the same way that we know when we are hot or cold hungry or thirstyThe mind that has attained it is established in the Dhamma and pañña wisdom has taken the place of delusionDiscursive meditation such as that practiced in Christian devotion is entirely on the mental level and can be undertaken by anyone at any timeIt calls for no special preparation or conditionsFor the more advanced exercises of samatha and vipassana however the strictest observance of sila the basic moral rules becomes necessaryThese techniques are best followed in seclusion away from the impurities of worldly life and under the guidance of an accomplished masterMany people have done themselves psychic harm by embarking on them without due care in this respectIt is not advisable for anyone to experiment on his own those who are unable to place themselves under a trustworthy teacher will do best to confine themselves to discursive meditationIt cannot take them to enlightenment but will benefit them morally and prepare them for the next stageMetta bhavana is the most universally beneficial form of discursive meditation and can be practiced in any conditionsThoughts of universal undiscriminating benevolence like radio waves reaching out in all directions sublimate the creative energy of the mindWith steady perseverance in metta bhavana a point can be reached at which it becomes impossible even to harbor a thought of illwillTrue peace can only come to the world through minds that are at peace If people everywhere in the world could be persuaded to devote half an hour daily to the practice of metta bhavana we should see more real advance towards world peace and security than international agreements will ever bring usIt would be a good thing if in this new era of the Buddha Sasana people of all creeds could be invited to take part in a worldwide movement for the practice of metta bhavana and pledge themselves to live in accordance with the highest tenets of their own religion whatever it may beIn so doing they would be paying homage to the Supreme Buddha and to their own particular religious teacher as well for on this level all the great religions of the world uniteIf there is a common denominator to be found among them it is surely here in the teaching of universal lovingkindness which transcends doctrinal differences and draws all being together by the power of a timeless and allembracing truthThe classic formulation of metta as an attitude of mind to be developed by meditation is found in the Karaniya Metta SuttaIt is recommended that this sutta be recited before beginning meditation and again at its close a practice which is invariably followed in the Buddhist countriesThe verses of the sutta embody the highest concept to which the thought of lovingkindness can reach and it serves both as a means of selfprotection against unwholesome mental states and as a subject of contemplationIt is taught in Buddhism that the cultivation of benevolence must begin with oneselfThere is a profound psychological truth in this for no one who hates or despises himself consciously or unconsciously can feel true lovingkindness for othersTo each of us the self is the nearest object if ones attitude towards oneself is not a wholesome one the spring of love is poisoned at its sourceThis does not mean that we should build up an idealized picture of ourselves as an object of admiration but that while being fully aware of our faults and deficiencies we should not condemn but resolve to improve ourselves and cherish confidence in our ability to do soMetta bhavana therefore begins with the thought May I be free from enmity may I be free from illwill may I be rid of suffering may I be happyThis thought having been developed the next stage is to apply it in exactly the same form and to the same degree to someone for whom one has naturally a feeling of friendshipIn so doing two points must be observed the object should be a living person and should not be one of the opposite sexThe second prohibition is to guard against the feeling of metta turning into its near enemy sensualityThose whose sensual leanings have a different orientation must vary the rule to suit their own needsWhen the thought of metta has been developed towards a friend the next object should be someone towards whom one has no marked feelings of like or dislikeLastly the thought of metta is to be turned towards someone who is hostileIt is here that difficulties ariseThey are to be expected and the meditator must be prepared to meet and wrestle with themTo this end several techniques are described in the Visuddhimagga and elsewhereThe first is to think of the hostile personality in terms of anatta  impersonalityThe meditator is advised to analyze the hostile personality into its impersonal components  the body the feelings the perceptions the volitional formations and the consciousnessThe body to begin with consists of purely material items hair of the head hair of the body skin nails teeth and so onThere can be no basis for enmity against theseThe feelings perceptions volitional formations and consciousness are all transitory phenomena interdependent conditioned and bound up with sufferingThey are anicca dukkha and anatta impermanent fraught with suffering and void of selfhoodThere is no more individual personality in them than there is in the physical body itselfSo towards them likewise there can be no real ground for enmityIf this approach should prove to be not altogether effective there are others in which emotionally counteractive states of mind are brought into play as for example regarding the hostile person with compassionThe meditator should reflect As he is so am As I am so is heWe are both bound to the inexorable Wheel of Life by ignorance and cravingBoth of us are subject to the law of cause and effect and whatever evil we do for that we must sufferWhy then should I blame or call anyone my enemyRather should I purify my mind and wish that he may do the same so that both of us may be freed from sufferingIf this thought is dwelt upon and fully comprehended feelings of hostility will be cast outWhen the thought of lovingkindness is exactly the same in quality and degree for all these four objects  oneself ones friend the person toward whom one is neutral and the enemy  the meditation has been successfulThe next stage is to widen and extend itThis process is a threefold one suffusing metta without limitation suffusing it with limitation and suffusing it in all of the ten directions east west north south the intermediate points above and belowIn suffusing metta without limitation the meditator thinks of the objects of lovingkindness under five heads all sentient beings all things that have life all beings that have come into existence all that have personality all that have assumed individual beingFor each of these groups separately he formulates the thought May they be free from enmity may they be free from enmity may they be free from ill will may they be rid of suffering may they be happyFor each object he specifies the particular group which he is suffusing with metta May all sentient beings be free from enmity etc May all things that have life be free from enmity etc This meditation embraces all without particular reference to locality and so is called suffusing without limitationIn suffusing metta with limitation there are seven groups which form the objects of the meditationThey are all females all males all Noble Ones all imperfect ones all Devas all human beings all beings in states of woeEach of the groups should be meditated upon as described above May all females be free from enmity etc This method is called suffusing metta with limitation because it defines the groups according to their nature and conditionSuffusing with metta all beings in the ten directions is carried out in the same wayDirecting his mind towards the east the meditator concentrates on the thought May all beings in the east be free from enmity may they be free from ill will may they be rid of suffering may they be happy And so with the beings in the west the north the south the northeast southwest northwest southeast above and belowLastly each of the twelve groups belonging to the unlimited and limited suffusions of metta can be dealt with separately for each of the ten directions using the appropriate formulasIt is taught that each of these twentytwo modes of practicing metta bhavana is capable of being developed up to the stage of a appanasamadhi that is the concentration which leads to jhana or mental absorptionFor this reason it is described as the method for attaining release of the mind through mettaIt is the first of the Four Brahma Viharas the sublime states of which the Karaniya Metta Sutta Brahmam etam viharam idhamahu  Here is declared the Highest LifeMetta karuna mudita upekkha lovingkindness compassion sympathetic joy and detachment these four states of mind represent the highest levels of mundane consciousnessOne who has attained to them and dwells in them is impervious to the ills of lifeLike a god he moves and acts in undisturbed serenity armored against the blows of fate and the uncertainty of worldly conditionsAnd the first of them to be cultivated is metta because it is through boundless love that the mind gains its first taste of liberationThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIf one regards himself superior or equal or inferior by reason of the body that is impermanent painful and subject to change what else is it than not seeing realityOr if one regards himself superior or equal or inferior by reason of feelings perceptions volitions or consciousness what else is it than not seeing realityIf one does not regard himself superior or equal or inferior by reason of the body the feelings perceptions volitions or consciousness what else is it than seeing realityIn Christian literature of the lighter sort we sometimes come across the expression Little Devil DOUBT This personage is not known to Buddhists but another little devil can be still more devastatingHe is an ugly little Mara named CONCEITUnlike his big brother Pride who is not lacking in dignity Conceit is a mean slinking little devil lurking in dark corners and always ready to rush out and nip our heelsDoubt is slain when the disciple wins the stream Conceit being a manifestation of Pride remains a menace to the very endPride in all its forms devolves from selfesteem which is in reality egoworship It stems so they say from Greed the first of the Roots of evilThe thought here is rather subtle when the ordinary person thinks of greed he thinks first of what one puts into ones tummy  that second helping of plumpudding or the consumption of a pound of candies in a single eveningThe commentators of old were much more drasticGreed is delight in ones own possessions Hence we can be greedy about anything to which we have affixed the label mine My car my table my cat my best belovedThe Greedy aspect of Conceit is recognized when we realize we are taking delight in our own good qualities or capacitiesConceit can arise from the most trivial causeOne completes a piece of work and having made a good job of it one is naturally pleasedTheres no harm in that we all know the difference between a worker whose only interest is his paypacket and the man who takes pride in his workThe trouble arises when we begin to make comparisons  couldnt have done it half as well That may be quite true but it is dangerous to think that because ones skill is superior in a single instance that one is therefore a better personThat is Superiority Conceit and it has its counterpart in the Inferiority Conceit of the unsuccessful person and the Equality Conceit of the man who says Im as good as you With the underlying implication And a good deal betterA feeling of superiority is a very pleasant mental state but it is essentially akusala  unhealthy and unskilled highly dangerous in its resultsAny conceit that arises in connection with the practice of Dhamma is much to be deploredThis sometimes occurs when students are making good progress in their studiesSome queer experience or flash of insight is assumed to be a sign of virtue or an advance towards Higher Consciousness and the student instead of checking up on his experience with a wise teacher jumps to the conclusion that he is halfway to being an ArahantWe do well to remember that no two people have exactly the same experience in regard to meditation practiceThe was recognized in the Buddhas own day Sariputta was revered for his wisdom and Moggallana for his psychic powers but both were venerated as Great BeingsConceit is very prone to arise when one is praised for some particular work or mental qualityWithin limits praise from a knowledgeable person is stimulating and encouraging some people who are modest or diffident by nature can only work well when they are appreciatedThe trouble is that too much praise particularly if it borders on flattery stimulates the sense of InessThe ego sticks out its chest and feels two inches taller it has a delicious feeling of security and believes itself to be invulnerableThis is the nasty sort of pride that the ancient Greeks called hubris it was looked upon as an insult to the gods and when the Olympians found a man suffering from it they unloosed Nemesis the goddess of revenge who brought him to death or destructionThe cultivation of humility is not easy theres a temptation to indulge in mockmodesty and untruthfully disclaim any real achievement and still worse to be conceited about not being conceitedIt is wiser I think to tackle Conceit at its first uprising if one can do that then Humility will develop in the natural course of eventsFor our comfort we find that much can be done to curb the activities of this persistent MaraPride has been aptly described as the giant weed We may grub up a few roots in this lifespan but the thing has already gone to seed and will appear in the futuresay the old gardenersIf we acquire the habit of eradicating conceit in this life the habit will travel on in our sankharas and bear good fruit in future livesRecognize Conceit whenever he pops up and name himThis as readers will remember is the advise given by Nyanaponika Thera in his valuable articles in Sangha Mara like Satan hates to be recognizedThis practice is doubly effective because it keeps one on ones toes and induces a real dislike of the tendencyGet back to the first two steps of the Noble Eightfold Path Right Understanding of the mental quality or capacity involved to see according to reality This is not mine I am not this there is no self in it Right Aspiration towards the expunging of ConceitIn the Discourse on Expunging we read Now I say that the arising of thoughts is very helpful in regard to skilled states of mindTherefore the thought should arise Others may be harmful as to this we will not be harmful and so on for all our evil propensitiesOthers may be conceited but we as to this will not be conceited The method of analysis is also helpfulI am being praised for some real or imagined virtue say generosityGenerosity is nongreed one of the Good Roots and as such appears in the list of dharmas given in the Abhidharma philosophyAccording to Mahayana All dharmas are empty of ownbeing  that is to say they are nonexistentTherefore I am being praised for something which doesnt existThis is so absurd that it knocks the bottom out of my conceitAlternatively I am the result of past kammaMy talents are not due to my own virtue but have arisen on account of the skilled actions performed by vanished personalities whose kammic descendant I amTherefore it is silly of me to be conceited about qualities which are not in any real sense mineAgain and again in the suttas we find the expression Thus must you train This is Buddhist mental culture it is Right or Supreme Effort to put down unskilled mental states and prevent them rising in the future and furthermore to encourage the arising of skilled statesA word of warning may not be out of place hereIt is inadvisable to dwell too much on our soobvious faultsBy unwisely reflecting on them we encourage them to root themselves still more firmly in our unconsciousInstead remember the advice of Paul the Apostle Whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things We as Buddhists have the Buddha Dhamma to think about  lovely in the beginning lovely in the middle lovely in the ending This as DrHenn Collins has pointed out is the true philosophers stone whose alchemy will transmute the base metal of our ordinary consciousness into the gold of EnlightenmentFew of us are free from Pride in one form or anotherWe know that in the interests of spiritual development it must be killed outWe are taught as much and accept the teaching without questionBut the method by which Pride may be eliminated is a problem not easy to solve and the indirect sweeping precepts of the sages are of little practical help to usIt is all very well saying Kill out this and kill out that but what we want to know is how may we go about itIn the first place what is PrideLet us call analogy to our aidRegard pride as a weed propagating itself with alarming fecundity in the garden of the mindIts root is not visible but the flowering shoots are in plain viewCut down these shoots and either they grow again or the roots puts out new onesThe only way to destroy it is to dig it up altogetherThat root is SelfEsteemFrom it grow the roots of Conceit Boastfulness Ambition Jealousy Envy and IntoleranceThere are others but let us take these six manifestations for the sake of discussionsUnbiased detached selfscrutiny will disclose what others may exist in ones own character and it is unlikely that all will be found equally developedThere is cause for alarm when we discover them in ourselvesPride is invariably despised when observed in others yet we sometimes boast of possessing itI have my pride you know is a common assertionBeneath every manifestation of Pride lies SelfEsteemIt is the conviction of superiority over others  the feeling that we are what they are not or that we can do what they cannot doSuccesses in early childhood may sow the seeds of itThe praise of relatives fosters itOnce planted it grows and not even the flattening criticism by ones own contemporaries in adolescence can stop itBy and by it becomes a habit to compare oneself with the people one meets or passes in the street generally to their disadvantageWhat we know of our own accomplishments is measured by what we presume they lackWe think we know our friends inside and out and our judgments are based on a firm belief in the infallibility of our perceptionThere is a tendency to group those who are not obviously outstanding under the heading of Ordinary People and sometimes to place them in the inferior category for no more reason than that they look as if they belong thereHow often we hear the remark He seems so ordinary but when you get to know him theres a lot in him We are surprised to see our spot judgment wrong  that there really is something in that very ordinarylooking personCan we honestly claim to be free of this habit of automatically comparing others with our own ideas of ourselvesIf so then SelfEsteem is not presentIt would be bad enough if Pride flourished in no more then SelfEsteem but it must manifest itself in every way it canIt strives to show on the surface which is perhaps just as well for then it becomes obviousConceit first shoot of the weed Pride is SelfEsteem manifesting in visible formNot content with merely feeling superior to the people around us we show it in our bearingA glance from some passerby of the opposite sex may be interpreted as a look of approvalThe fine figure reflected in the shop window as we pass engenders a feeling of warm satisfactionSmart clothes we believe do justice to our carriageWe may not be so tall as that person over yonder but we have a more distinguished lookNo one would pick out any one of them in a crowd but all can see we are differentCrude isnt itBut that is the way Conceit affects us and its crudity is indeed shocking when selfanalysis brings us face to face with itInspired by a consciousness of a desire for Truth our minds turn the searchlight of enquiry inwards upon our own characters and then there dawns the realization that Conceit has been part of us for as long as we rememberFormerly we would have angrily denied the charge of being conceitedNow we see that it is well foundedOur apartness our treasured individuality is plainly one of its aspectsConceit has grown without its presence being suspected and an even more dangerous and disgusting shoot has sprung up beside itThis is Boastfulness  SelfEsteems oral manifestationOne of our national conventions is the taboo on bragging and the idea of voicing a plain undisguised boast would shock us as much as it would disgust the conventional listenera very admirable convention too  but it by no means eliminates Boastfulness for there are other ways of boasting and as long as the desire to call attention to oneself exists that particular ramification of Pride is a dangerWe can get others to boast for usWe can also impress them that they sing our praises to othersIn this way we gain more than were it to come from ourselves and run no risk of its incurring disagreeable criticismWe can seek publicity and once gained declaim itWe may artfully bring a conversation round to a point at which we modestly have to admit to something we are really proud ofIt takes a certain amount of courage to probe ones own secret heart and bring to light some of the many ways in which we who sincerely believe ourselves to be guiltless can actually indulge in BoastfulnessIt is one of the most persistent roots of the weed of Pride and the most dangerous because so frequently overlookedThere are two kinds of AmbitionThere is Wrong Ambition and Right AmbitionOne is based on SelfEsteem the other is free of any taint of itWrong Ambition is the desire to excel or succeed in order to enhance ones standing  ones reputationIt is the urge to achieve with the object of putting the other chaps eye out In its more acceptable and therefore more insidious aspect it is the will to gain admiration and respect  to become in fact a worldly success which nearly always means a financial successConfident of our great worth we cannot be satisfied until repeated success have called the attention of others to itWe feel that wealth is a concrete recognition of itRight Ambition on the other hand is above itselfIt is the will to succeed not for the gratification of selfesteem but to further achievement for its own sakeThe painter who strives to express adequately the idea inspiring him  the poet who seeks to express an emotion as it has never been expressed  the craftsman ever intent on bettering his achievement  all are followers of Right AmbitionTheir selves are forgottenThey work as instruments and they feel that in the expression of their art is little personal but rather a universal power whose tools they areNoblest ambition of all is the desire to achieve an objective of disinterested service to ones fellow creatures whether human or animalit is sometimes gratifying to learn how many of us have this objectiveJealousy might be defined as the resentment felt against another for competing at the same levelNote that it is at the same level that competition begets jealousyAn admission of inferiority by the other will quickly banish the jealousy we may feel against himThose we admit to be our superiors do not arouse our jealousyIt is a bestial emotion but one that undoubtedly had its uses in our passage through the lives in the Instinctive Mind for it was an aid to our survivalCarried over into the influence of Intellect it has no place and puts a drag on our upward progressHe who is at one moment the object of our jealousy is regarded with affection once that jealousy has been smotheredWhat may has served us for the conservation of the means of life when we existed in a lower condition is now no more than a vehicle for Prides manifestation and its redundancy is obvious the moment the reason has torn Jealousys red veil from the perceptionWe know it is useless and long to rid ourselves of itWe seem to succeed and then conditions come about favorable to its reappearance and the unwelcome pangs are felt againRemember then that it is a shoot of SelfEsteem and until that root has been killed out the shoot may be beaten down only to blossom againWe joke about Envy and are inclined to look on it as less despicable than Jealousy its near relativeThink about it  think over and around it  define it to yourself  get to know itWhen the nature of an unpleasant thing is known it is less to be dreadedWith all these ramifications of the weed of Pride the same approach can be recommendedDefine them to yourselfFigure out what they are and how much you are subject to their influenceEnvy can be called the resentment felt against another for possessing that which one values and does not posses oneselfIt may be only a gentle resentment sometimes but is dangerous nevertheless for it may become fierceUnderlying it is the feeling Why should he have it and not I SelfEsteem is outragedThen there is IntoleranceSometimes it is the only form of Pride we are subject toIt is often the most robust shoot of the whole plantIt springs directly from SelfEsteem for it is a refusal to accept anything that conflicts with our own ideasIt is to brand as wrong all that to us is not rightIntolerance causes us to condemn a person for doing that with which we disagree but let him do just what we would do ourselves and  here is what is so unreasonable  a feeling of jealousy may be arousedPride sweeps us first one way then anotherThere is no keeping our feet when once in its graspDont expect Pride to be in any way reasonable for it wilts and disappears in the light of reason its greatest foeWe are repeatedly being asked Why carry the burden of PrideThrow it asideIt is so much relief to rid yourselves of its weight and know the lightness of freedom We feel inclined to retort  Thats all very well but how can we get rid of itWe know we must but we dont know how to beginThe sickle which can cut down these roots is Reason  calm reflection  MeditationMake it your task for a few weeks to give up half an hour daily for reasoning it out and the results may amaze youLook at yourself as it were from outsideBe honest with yourself in making a searching examination to determine how Pride is manifesting through you for fair selfanalysis is in itself a powerful weapon to use against itClassify those manifestationsReason them outDo they make senseIn your everyday life try and form the habit of watching with interest to spot each of Prides several shoots as it appears and once a week spend a meditation hour in asking yourself for a detailed report of every one notedForm a picture in your mind of the perfect character and compare your own character with itFor example say to your self Now I think there was an inclination to boast in my remark to MrsSoandso at tea yesterdayHow would the Ideal Being have acted under the circumstances Or again Would the Ideal Being have considered himself superior in bearing to those ugly people I passed in suchandsuch a streetOf course notHe would have been above that The power of standing apart from and criticizing the Ego who is subject to Pride allows you to find satisfaction in adverse criticism from othersWhereas formerly you felt bitter if ridiculed or put in the wrong it now amuses you for you see what good medicine it is for the Self you desire to set freeWhen others treat you with intolerance welcome it for they are doing you a favor by striking direct at your own intoleranceSeek those things which formerly aroused in you the pangs of Envy or JealousyFind pleasure in feeling that other self hurt by them knowing that the wounds are suffered by the false Ego  Pride  and not by the real YouIt will not be long before the pain is gone and then you will have a good laugh at the memory of that squirming demon who fled surprised and vanquishedWe who are subject to Conceit dread ridiculeCease to dread itWhen we see the wicked caricatures or witness those vivid mimicries of ourselves it is for us to welcome them for they are aiding us materially in the conquest of PrideSo also to hear ourselves belittled is an antidote for BoastfulnessWhen we do there is no need to hide a raging heart behind a sickly smileOnce we have learned the trick of standing apart from ourselves these things can no longer hurtBut beat down the shoots of Pride as we may we cannot be free from the weed until the root has goneIt is right to prevent the shoots from thrivingDestroy them by all meansBut Pride will persist in making its appearance until SelfEsteem is rooted out  and to accomplish that is the hardest job of allHere is a tip that may perhaps be of serviceTry and form the habit of supposing every passerby on whom the thoughts rest to be possessed of at least one attribute superior to your ownThink to yourself This creature isnt much to look at but Ill bet she is far more eventempered than I am Look at that rather foppish young man whose appearance used to annoy you and think All the same in a pinch he would show far greater physical courage than I Cease to regard the large loudmouthed person as emptyheaded and think instead Hes probably far cleverer with his hands than I We are all learning our lessons in Lifes schoolroomSome are more advanced than us in one thing and behind us in othersThe person who cannot resist the temptation to gratify the senses may nevertheless be a good angel to others in need of helpThe thief may be an actual heroIf we consistently regard others as possessing at least one of those desirable characteristics we ourselves are striving for we are actually admitting our inferiority and SelfEsteem suffers a staggering blowRemember that SelfEsteem is a habit and just as a habit must be acquired so may it be abandonedWe are not born with itWe cultivate it by regarding ourselves as superior to others in some particular thing  later in more things  ultimately in everythingKill it out by recognizing the superiority of others in some wayCredit them with that superiority even though you dont know they possess itSelfEsteem will die for lack of nourishment and one day will come the first joyful realization that there is no Him nor Her nor You but that we are all oneYou need not fear going too far and acquiring an inferiority complex Your eyes will be open and what you will find is True HumilityThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital

light but also its many legendary histories and biographiesAmongst this class of literature one name that came to be noticed was that of Asoka a good king who was supposed to have ruled India in the distant pastStories about this king similar in outline but differing greatly in details were found in the Divyavadana the Asokavadana the Mahavamsa and several other worksThey told of an exceptionally cruel and ruthless prince who had many of his brothers killed in order to seize the throne who was dramatically converted to Buddhism and who ruled wisely and justly for the rest of his lifeNone of these stories were taken seriously  after all many premodern cultures had legends about too good to be true kings who had ruled righteously in the past and who people hoped would rule again soonMost of these legends had their origins more in popular longing to be rid of the despotic and uncaring kings than in any historical factAnd the numerous stories about Asoka were assumed to be the sameBut in James Prinsep succeeded in deciphering an ancient inscription on a large stone pillar in DelhiSeveral other pillars and rocks with similar inscriptions had been known for some time and had attracted the curiosity of scholarsPrinseps inscription proved to be a series of edicts issued by a king calling himself BelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi In the following decades more and more edicts by this same king were discovered and with increasingly accurate decipherment of their language a more complete picture of this man and his deeds began to emergeGradually it dawned on scholars that the King Piyadasi of the edicts might be the King Asoka so often praised in Buddhist legendsHowever it was not until when another edict actually mentioning the name Asoka was discovered that the identification was confirmedHaving been forgotten for nearly years one of the greatest men in history became known to the world once againAsokas edicts are mainly concerned with the reforms he instituted and the moral principles he recommended in his attempt to create a just and humane societyAs such they give us little information about his life the details of which have to be culled from other sourcesAlthough the exact dates of Asokas life are a matter of dispute among scholars he was born in about Band became the third king of the Mauryan dynasty after the death of his father BindusaraHis given name was Asoka but he assumed the title Devanampiya Piyadasi which means BelovedoftheGods He Who Looks On With Affection There seems to have been a twoyear war of succession during which at least one of Asokas brothers was killedIn BC eight years after his coronation Asokas armies attacked and conquered Kalinga a country that roughly corresponds to the modern state of OrissaThe loss of life caused by battle reprisals deportations and the turmoil that always exists in the aftermath of war so horrified Asoka that it brought about a complete change in his personalityIt seems that Asoka had been calling himself a Buddhist for at least two years prior to the Kalinga war but his commitment to Buddhism was only lukewarm and perhaps had a political motive behind itBut after the war Asoka dedicated the rest of his life trying to apply Buddhist principles to the administration of his vast empireHe had a crucial part to play in helping Buddhism to spread both throughout India and abroad and probably built the first major Buddhist monumentsAsoka died in Bin the thirtyeighth year of his reignAsokas edicts are to be found scattered in more than thirty places throughout India Nepal Pakistan and AfghanistanMost of them are written in Brahmi script from which all Indian scripts and many of those used in Southeast Asia later developedThe language used in the edicts found in the eastern part of the subcontinent is a type of Magadhi probably the official language of Asokas courtThe language used in the edicts found in the western part of India is closer to Sanskrit although one bilingual edict in Afghanistan is written in Aramaic and GreekAsokas edicts which comprise the earliest decipherable corpus of written documents from India have survived throughout the centuries because they are written on rocks and stone pillarsThese pillars in particular are testimony to the technological and artistic genius of ancient Indian civilizationOriginally there must have been many of them although only ten with inscriptions still surviveAveraging between forty and fifty feet in height and weighing up to fifty tons each all the pillars were quarried at Chunar just south of Varanasi and dragged sometimes hundreds of miles to where they were erectedEach pillar was originally capped by a capital sometimes a roaring lion a noble bull or a spirited horse and the few capitals that survive are widely recognized as masterpieces of Indian artBoth the pillars and the capitals exhibit a remarkable mirrorlike polish that has survived despite centuries of exposure to the elementsThe location of the rock edicts is governed by the availability of suitable rocks but the edicts on pillars are all to be found in very specific placesSome like the Lumbini pillar mark the Buddhas birthplace while its inscriptions commemorate Asokas pilgrimage to that placeOthers are to be found in or near important population centers so that their edicts could be read by as many people as possibleThere is little doubt that Asokas edicts were written in his own words rather than in the stylistic language in which royal edicts or proclamations in the ancient world were usually written inTheir distinctly personal tone gives us a unique glimpse into the personality of this complex and remarkable manAsokas style tends to be somewhat repetitious and plodding as if explaining something to one who has difficulty in understandingAsoka frequently refers to the good works he has done although not in a boastful way but more it seems to convince the reader of his sincerityIn fact an anxiousness to be thought of as a sincere person and a good administrator is present in nearly every edictAsoka tells his subjects that he looked upon them as his children that their welfare is his main concern he apologizes for the Kalinga war and reassures the people beyond the borders of his empire that he has no expansionist intentions towards themMixed with this sincerity there is a definite puritanical streak in Asokas character suggested by his disapproval of festivals and of religious rituals many of which while being of little value were nonetheless harmlessIt is also very clear that Buddhism was the most influential force in Asokas life and that he hoped his subjects likewise would adopt his religionHe went on pilgrimages to Lumbini and Bodh Gaya sent teaching monks to various regions in India and beyond its borders and he was familiar enough with the sacred texts to recommend some of them to the monastic communityIt is also very clear that Asoka saw the reforms he instituted as being a part of his duties as a BuddhistBut while he was an enthusiastic Buddhist he was not partisan towards his own religion or intolerant of other religionsHe seems to have genuinely hoped to be able to encourage everyone to practice his or her own religion with the same conviction that he practiced hisScholars have suggested that because the edicts say nothing about the philosophical aspects of Buddhism Asoka had a simplistic and naive understanding of the DhammaThis view does not take into account the fact that the purpose of the edicts was not to expound the truths of Buddhism but to inform the people of Asokas reforms and to encourage them to be more generous kind and moralThis being the case there was no reason for Asoka to discuss Buddhist philosophyAsoka emerges from his edicts as an able administrator an intelligent human being and as a devoted Buddhist and we could expect him to take as keen an interest in Buddhist philosophy as he did in Buddhist practiceThe contents of Asokas edicts make it clear that all the legends about his wise and humane rule are more than justified and qualify him to be ranked as one of the greatest rulersIn his edicts he spoke of what might be called state morality and private or individual moralityThe first was what he based his administration upon and what he hoped would lead to a more just more spiritually inclined society while the second was what he recommended and encouraged individuals to practiceBoth these types of morality were imbued with the Buddhist values of compassion moderation tolerance and respect for all lifeThe Asokan state gave up the predatory foreign policy that had characterized the Mauryan empire up till then and replaced it with a policy of peaceful coexistenceThe judicial system was reformed in order to make it more fair less harsh and less open to abuse while those sentenced to death were given a stay of execution to prepare appeals and regular amnesties were given to prisonersState resources were used for useful public works like the importation and cultivation of medical herbs the building of rest houses the digging of wells at regular intervals along main roads and the planting of fruit and shade treesTo ensue that these reforms and projects were carried out Asoka made himself more accessible to his subjects by going on frequent inspection tours and he expected his district officers to follow his exampleTo the same end he gave orders that important state business or petitions were never to be kept from him no matter what he was doing at the timeThe state had a responsibility not just to protect and promote the welfare of its people but also its wildlifeHunting certain species of wild animals was banned forest and wildlife reserves were established and cruelty to domestic and wild animals was prohibitedThe protection of all religions their promotion and the fostering of harmony between them was also seen as one of the duties of the stateIt even seems that something like a Department of Religious Affairs was established with officers called Dhamma Mahamatras whose job it was to look after the affairs of various religious bodies and to encourage the practice of religionThe individual morality that Asoka hoped to foster included respect towards parents elders teachers friends servants ascetics and brahmans  behavior that accords with the advice given to Sigala by the BuddhaHe encouraged generosity to the poor to ascetics and brahmans and to friends and relativesNot surprisingly Asoka encouraged harmlessness towards all lifeIn conformity with the Buddhas advice in the Anguttara Nikaya II he also considered moderation in spending and moderation in saving to be goodTreating people properly he suggested was much more important than performing ceremonies that were supposed to bring good luckBecause it helped promote tolerance and mutual respect Asoka desired that people should be welllearned in the good doctrines of other peoples religionsThe qualities of heart that are recommended by Asoka in the edicts indicate his deep spiritualityThey include kindness selfexamination truthfulness gratitude purity of heart enthusiasm strong loyalty selfcontrol and love of the DhammaWe have no way of knowing how effective Asokas reforms were or how long they lasted but we do know that monarchs throughout the ancient Buddhist world were encouraged to look to his style of government as an ideal to be followedKing Asoka has to be credited with the first attempt to develop a Buddhist polityToday with widespread disillusionment in prevailing ideologies and the search for a political philosophy that goes beyond greed hatred and delusion Asokas edicts may make a meaningful contribution to the development of a more spiritually based political systemBelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi has caused this Dhamma edict to be writtenHere no living beings are to be slaughtered or offered in sacrificeNor should festivals be held for BelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi sees much to object to in such festivals although there are some festivals that BelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi does approve ofFormerly in the kitchen of BelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi hundreds of thousands of animals were killed every day to make curryBut now with the writing of this Dhamma edict only three creatures two peacocks and a deer are killed and the deer not alwaysAnd in time not even these three creatures will be killedEverywhere within BelovedoftheGods King Piyadasis domain and among the people beyond the borders the Cholas the Pandyas the Satiyaputras the Keralaputras as far as Tamraparni and where the Greek king Antiochos rules and among the kings who are neighbors of Antiochos everywhere has BelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi made provision for two types of medical treatment medical treatment for humans and medical treatment for animalsWherever medical herbs suitable for humans or animals are not available I have had them imported and grownWherever medical roots or fruits are not available I have had them imported and grownAlong roads I have had wells dug and trees planted for the benefit of humans and animalsBelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi speaks thus Twelve years after my coronation this has been ordered  Everywhere in my domain the Yuktas the Rajjukas and the Pradesikas shall go on inspection tours every five years for the purpose of Dhamma instruction and also to conduct other businessRespect for mother and father is good generosity to friends acquaintances relatives Brahmans and ascetics is good not killing living beings is good moderation in spending and moderation in saving is goodThe Council shall notify the Yuktas about the observance of these instructions in these very wordsIn the past for many hundreds of years killing or harming living beings and improper behavior towards relatives and improper behavior towards Brahmans and ascetics has increasedBut now due to BelovedoftheGods King Piyadasis Dhamma practice the sound of the drum has been replaced by the sound of the DhammaThe sighting of heavenly cars auspicious elephants bodies of fire and other divine sightings has not happened for many hundreds of yearsBut now because BelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi promotes restraint in the killing and harming of living beings proper behavior towards relatives Brahmans and ascetics and respect for mother father and elders such sightings have increasedThese and many other kinds of Dhamma practice have been encouraged by BelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi and he will continue to promote Dhamma practiceAnd the sons grandsons and greatgrandsons of BelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi too will continue to promote Dhamma practice until the end of time living by Dhamma and virtue they will instruct in DhammaTruly this is the highest work to instruct in DhammaBut practicing the Dhamma cannot be done by one who is devoid of virtue and therefore its promotion and growth is commendableThis edict has been written so that it may please my successors to devote themselves to promoting these things and not allow them to declineBelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi has had this written twelve years after his coronationBelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi speaks thus To do good is difficultOne who does good first does something hard to doI have done many good deeds and if my sons grandsons and their descendants up to the end of the world act in like manner they too will do much goodBut whoever amongst them neglects this they will do evilTruly it is easy to do evilIn the past there were no Dhamma Mahamatras but such officers were appointed by me thirteen years after my coronationNow they work among all religions for the establishment of Dhamma for the promotion of Dhamma and for the welfare and happiness of all who are devoted to DhammaThey work among the Greeks the Kambojas the Gandharas the Rastrikas the Pitinikas and other peoples on the western bordersThey work among soldiers chiefs Brahmans householders the poor the aged and those devoted to Dhamma  for their welfare and happiness  so that they may be free from harassmentThey work for the proper treatment of prisoners towards their unfettering and if the Mahamatras think This one has a family to support That one has been bewitched This one is old then they work for the release of such prisonersThey work here in outlying towns in the womens quarters belonging to my brothers and sisters and among my other relativesThey are occupied everywhereThese Dhamma Mahamatras are occupied in my domain among people devoted to Dhamma to determine who is devoted to Dhamma who is established in Dhamma and who is generousThis Dhamma edict has been written on stone so that it might endure long and that my descendants might act in conformity with itBelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi speaks thus In the past state business was not transacted nor were reports delivered to the king at all hoursBut now I have given this order that at any time whether I am eating in the womens quarters the bed chamber the chariot the palanquin in the park or wherever reporters are to be posted with instructions to report to me the affairs of the people so that I might attend to these affairs wherever I amAnd whatever I orally order in connection with donations or proclamations or when urgent business presses itself on the Mahamatras if disagreement or debate arises in the Council then it must be reported to me immediatelyThis is what I have orderedI am never content with exerting myself or with despatching businessTruly I consider the welfare of all to be my duty and the root of this is exertion and the prompt despatch of businessThere is no better work than promoting the welfare of all the people and whatever efforts I am making is to repay the debt I owe to all beings to assure their happiness in this life and attain heaven in the nextTherefore this Dhamma edict has been written to last long and that my sons grandsons and greatgrandsons might act in conformity with it for the welfare of the worldHowever this is difficult to do without great exertionBelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi desires that all religions should reside everywhere for all of them desire selfcontrol and purity of heartBut people have various desires and various passions and they may practice all of what they should or only a part of itBut one who receives great gifts yet is lacking in selfcontrol purity of heart gratitude and firm devotion such a person is meanIn the past kings used to go out on pleasure tours during which there was hunting and other entertainmentBut ten years after BelovedoftheGods had been coronated he went on a tour to Sambodhi and thus instituted Dhamma toursDuring these tours the following things took place visits and gifts to Brahmans and ascetics visits and gifts of gold to the aged visits to people in the countryside instructing them in Dhamma and discussing Dhamma with them as is suitableIt is this that delights BelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi and is as it were another type of revenueBelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi speaks thus In times of sickness for the marriage of sons and daughters at the birth of children before embarking on a journey on these and other occasions people perform various ceremoniesWomen in particular perform many vulgar and worthless ceremoniesThese types of ceremonies can be performed by all means but they bear little fruitWhat does bear great fruit however is the ceremony of the DhammaThis involves proper behavior towards servants and employees respect for teachers restraint towards living beings and generosity towards ascetics and BrahmansThese and other things constitute the ceremony of the DhammaTherefore a father a son a brother a master a friend a companion and even a neighbor should say This is good this is the ceremony that should be performed until its purpose is fulfilled this I shall do Other ceremonies are of doubtful fruit for they may achieve their purpose or they may not and even if they do it is only in this worldBut the ceremony of the Dhamma is timelessEven if it does not achieve its purpose in this world it produces great merit in the next whereas if it does achieve its purpose in this world one gets great merit both here and there through the ceremony of the DhammaBelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi does not consider glory and fame to be of great account unless they are achieved through having my subjects respect Dhamma and practice Dhamma both now and in the futureFor this alone does BelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi desire glory and fameAnd whatever efforts BelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi is making all of that is only for the welfare of the people in the next world and that they will have little evilAnd being without merit is evilThis is difficult for either a humble person or a great person to do except with great effort and by giving up other interestsIn fact it may be even more difficult for a great person to doBelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi speaks thus There is no gift like the gift of the Dhamma acquaintance with Dhamma distribution of Dhamma and kinship through DhammaAnd it consists of this proper behavior towards servants and employees respect for mother and father generosity to friends companions relations Brahmans and ascetics and not killing living beingsTherefore a father a son a brother a master a friend a companion or a neighbor should say This is good this should be done One benefits in this world and gains great merit in the next by giving the gift of the DhammaBelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi honors both ascetics and the householders of all religions and he honors them with gifts and honors of various kindsBut BelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi does not value gifts and honors as much as he values this  that there should be growth in the essentials of all religionsGrowth in essentials can be done in different ways but all of them have as their root restraint in speech that is not praising ones own religion or condemning the religion of others without good causeAnd if there is cause for criticism it should be done in a mild wayBut it is better to honor other religions for this reasonBy so doing ones own religion benefits and so do other religions while doing otherwise harms ones own religion and the religions of othersWhoever praises his own religion due to excessive devotion and condemns others with the thought Let me glorify my own religion only harms his own religionTherefore contact is goodOne should listen to and respect the doctrines professed by othersBelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi desires that all should be welllearned in the good doctrines of other religionsThose who are content with their own religion should be told this BelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi does not value gifts and honors as much as he values that there should be growth in the essentials of all religionsAnd to this end many are working  Dhamma Mahamatras Mahamatras in charge of the womens quarters officers in charge of outlying areas and other such officersAnd the fruit of this is that ones own religion grows and the Dhamma is illuminated alsoBelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi conquered the Kalingas eight years after his coronationOne hundred and fifty thousand were deported one hundred thousand were killed and many more diedAfter the Kalingas had been conquered BelovedoftheGods came to feel a strong inclination towards the Dhamma a love for the Dhamma and for instruction in DhammaNow BelovedoftheGods feels deep remorse for having conquered the KalingasIndeed BelovedoftheGods is deeply pained by the killing dying and deportation that take place when an unconquered country is conqueredBut BelovedoftheGods is pained even more by this  that Brahmans ascetics and householders of different religions who live in those countries and who are respectful to superiors to mother and father to elders and who behave properly and have strong loyalty towards friends acquaintances companions relatives servants and employees  that they are injured killed or separated from their loved onesEven those who are not affected suffer when they see friends acquaintances companions and relatives affectedThese misfortunes befall all and this pains BelovedoftheGodsThere is no country except among the Greeks where these two groups Brahmans and ascetics are not found and there is no country where people are not devoted to one or another religionTherefore the killing death or deportation of a hundredth or even a thousandth part of those who died during the conquest of Kalinga now pains BelovedoftheGodsNow BelovedoftheGods thinks that even those who do wrong should be forgiven where forgiveness is possibleEven the forest people who live in BelovedoftheGods domain are entreated and reasoned with to act properlyThey are told that despite his remorse BelovedoftheGods has the power to punish them if necessary so that they should be ashamed of their wrong and not be killedTruly BelovedoftheGods desires noninjury restraint and impartiality to all beings even where wrong has been doneNow it is conquest by Dhamma that BelovedoftheGods considers to be the best conquestAnd it has been won here on the borders even six hundred yojanas away where the Greek king Antiochos rules beyond there where the four kings named Ptolemy Antigonos Magas and Alexander rule likewise in the south among the Cholas the Pandyas and as far as TamraparniHere in the kings domain among the Greeks the Kambojas the Nabhakas the Nabhapamkits the Bhojas the Pitinikas the Andhras and the Palidas everywhere people are following BelovedoftheGods instructions in DhammaEven where BelovedoftheGods envoys have not been these people too having heard of the practice of Dhamma and the ordinances and instructions in Dhamma given by BelovedoftheGods are following it and will continue to do soThis conquest has been won everywhere and it gives great joy  the joy which only conquest by Dhamma can giveBut even this joy is of little consequenceBelovedoftheGods considers the great fruit to be experienced in the next world to be more importantI have had this Dhamma edict written so that my sons and greatgrandsons may not consider making new conquests or that if military conquests are made that they be done with forbearance and light punishment or better still that they consider making conquest by Dhamma only for that bears fruit in this world and the nextMay all their intense devotion be given to this which has a result in this world and the nextBelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi has had these Dhamma edicts written in brief in medium length and in extended formNot all of them occur everywhere for my domain is vast but much has been written and I will have still more writtenAnd also there are some subjects here that have been spoken of again and again because of their sweetness and so that the people may act in accordance with themIf some things written are incomplete this is because of the locality or in consideration of the object or due to the fault of the scribeBelovedoftheGods says that the Mahamatras of Tosali who are judicial officers in the city are to be told this I wish to see that everything I consider to be proper is carried out in the right wayAnd I consider instructing you to be the best way of accomplishing thisI have placed you over many thousands of people that you may win the peoples affectionAll men are my childrenWhat I desire for my own children and I desire their welfare and happiness both in this world and the next that I desire for all menYou do not understand to what extent I desire this and if some of you do understand you do not understand the full extent of my desireYou must attend to this matterWhile being completely lawabiding some people are imprisoned treated harshly and even killed without cause so that many people sufferTherefore your aim should be to act with impartialityIt is because of these things  envy anger cruelty hate indifference laziness or tiredness  that such a thing does not happenTherefore your aim should be May these things not be in me And the root of this is nonanger and patienceThose who are bored with the administration of justice will not be promoted will move upwards and be promotedWhoever among you understands this should say to his colleagues See that you do your duty properlySuch and such are BelovedoftheGods instructions Great fruit will result from doing your duty while failing in it will result in gaining neither heaven nor the kings pleasureFailure in duty on your part will not please meBut done properly it will win you heaven and you will be discharging your debts to meThis edict is to be listened to on Tisa day between Tisa days and on other suitable occasions it should be listened to even by a single personActing thus you will be doing your dutyThis edict has been written for the following purpose that the judicial officers of the city may strive to do their duty and that the people under them might not suffer unjust imprisonment or harsh treatmentTo achieve this I will send out Mahamatras every five years who are not harsh or cruel but who are merciful and who can ascertain if the judicial officers have understood my purpose and are acting according to my instructionsSimilarly from Ujjayini the prince will send similar persons with the same purpose without allowing three years to elapseLikewise from Takhasila alsoWhen these Mahamatras go on tours of inspection each year then without neglecting their normal duties they will ascertain if judicial officers are acting according to the kings instructionsBelovedoftheGods speaks thus This royal order is to be addressed to the Mahamatras at SamapaI wish to see that everything I consider to be proper is carried out in the right wayAnd I consider instructing you to be the best way of accomplishing thisAll men are my childrenWhat I desire for my own children and I desire their welfare and happiness both in this world and the next that I desire for all menThe people of the unconquered territories beyond the borders might think What is the kings intentions towards us My only intention is that they live without fear of me that they may trust me and that I may give them happiness not sorrowFurthermore they should understand that the king will forgive those who can be forgiven and that he wishes to encourage them to practice Dhamma so that they may attain happiness in this world and the nextI am telling you this so that I may discharge the debts I owe and that in instructing you that you may know that my vow and my promise will not be brokenTherefore acting in this way you should perform your duties and assure them that The king is like a fatherHe feels towards us as he feels towards himselfWe are to him like his own childrenBy instructing you and informing you of my vow and my promise I shall be applying myself in complete fullness to achieving this objectYou are able indeed to inspire them with confidence and to secure their welfare and happiness in this world and the next and by acting thus you will attain heaven as well as discharge the debts you owe to meAnd so that the Mahamatras can devote themselves at all times to inspiring the border areas with confidence and encouraging them to practice Dhamma this edict has been written hereThis edict is to be listened to every four months on Tisa day between Tisa days and on other suitable occasions it should be listened to even by a single personActing thus you will be doing your dutyBelovedoftheGods speaks thus It is now more than two and a half years since I became a laydisciple but until now I have not been very zealousBut now that I have visited the Sangha for more than a year I have become very zealousNow the people in India who have not associated with the gods do soThis is the result of zeal and it is not just the great who can do thisEven the humble if they are zealous can attain heavenAnd this proclamation has been made with this aimLet both humble and great be zealous let even those on the borders know and let zeal last longThen this zeal will increase it will greatly increase it will increase up to oneandahalf timesThis message has been proclaimed two hundred and fiftysix times by the king while on tourBelovedoftheGods speaks thus Father and mother should be respected and so should elders kindness to living beings should be made strong and the truth should be spokenIn these ways the Dhamma should be promotedLikewise a teacher should be honored by his pupil and proper manners should be shown towards relationsThis is an ancient rule that conduces to long lifeThus should one actWritten by the scribe ChapalaPiyadasi King of Magadha saluting the Sangha and wishing them good health and happiness speaks thus You know reverend sirs how great my faith in the Buddha the Dhamma and Sangha isWhatever reverend sirs has been spoken by Lord Buddha all that is wellspokenI consider it proper reverend sirs to advise on how the good Dhamma should last longThese Dhamma texts  Extracts from the Discipline the Noble Way of Life the Fears to Come the Poem on the Silent Sage the Discourse on the Pure Life Upatisas Questions and the Advice to Rahula which was spoken by the Buddha concerning false speech  these Dhamma texts reverend sirs I desire that all the monks and nuns may constantly listen to and rememberLikewise the laymen and laywomenI have had this written that you may know my intentionsBelovedoftheGods speaks thus This Dhamma edict was written twentysix years after my coronationHappiness in this world and the next is difficult to obtain without much love for the Dhamma much selfexamination much respect much fear and much enthusiasmBut through my instruction this regard for Dhamma and love of Dhamma has grown day by day and will continue to growAnd my officers of high low and middle rank are practicing and conforming to Dhamma and are capable of inspiring others to do the sameMahamatras in border areas are doing the sameAnd these are my instructions to protect with Dhamma to make happiness through Dhamma and to guard with DhammaBelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi speaks thus Dhamma is good but what constitutes Dhammalittle evil much good kindness generosity truthfulness and purityI have given the gift of sight in various waysTo twofooted and fourfooted beings to birds and aquatic animals I have given various things including the gift of lifeAnd many other good deeds have been done by meThis Dhamma edict has been written that people might follow it and it might endure for a long timeAnd the one who follows it properly will do something goodBelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi speaks thus People see only their good deeds saying I have done this good deed But they do not see their evil deeds saying I have done this evil deed or This is called evil But this is difficult to seeOne should think like this It is these things that lead to evil to violence to cruelty anger pride and jealousyLet me not ruin myself with these things And further one should think This leads to happiness in this world and the nextBelovedoftheGods speaks thus This Dhamma edict was written twentysix years after my coronationMy Rajjukas are working among the people among many hundreds of thousands of peopleThe hearing of petitions and the administration of justice has been left to them so that they can do their duties confidently and fearlessly and so that they can work for the welfare happiness and benefit of the people in the countryBut they should remember what causes happiness and sorrow and being themselves devoted to Dhamma they should encourage the people in the country that they may attain happiness in this world and the nextThese Rajjukas are eager to serve meThey also obey other officers who know my desires who instruct the Rajjukas so that they can please meJust as a person feels confident having entrusted his child to an expert nurse thinking The nurse will keep my child well even so the Rajjukas have been appointed by me for the welfare and happiness of the people in the countryThe hearing of petitions and the administration of justice have been left to the Rajjukas so that they can do their duties unperturbed fearlessly and confidentlyIt is my desire that there should be uniformity in law and uniformity in sentencingI even go this far to grant a threeday stay for those in prison who have been tried and sentenced to deathDuring this time their relatives can make appeals to have the prisoners lives sparedIf there is none to appeal on their behalf the prisoners can give gifts in order to make merit for the next world or observe fastsIndeed it is my wish that in this way even if a prisoners time is limited he can prepare for the next world and that peoples Dhamma practice selfcontrol and generosity may growBelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi speaks thus Twentysix years after my coronation various animals were declared to be protected  parrots mainas aruna ruddy

twentysix years since my coronation prisoners have been given amnesty on twentyfive occasionsBelovedoftheGods speaks thus Twelve years after my coronation I started to have Dhamma edicts written for the welfare and happiness of the people and so that not transgressing them they might grow in the DhammaThinking How can the welfare and happiness of the people be secured I give attention to my relatives to those dwelling near and those dwelling far so I can lead them to happiness and then I act accordinglyI do the same for all groupsI have honored all religions with various honorsBut I consider it best to meet with people personallyThis Dhamma edict was written twentysix years after my coronationBelovedoftheGods speaks thus In the past kings desired that the people might grow through the promotion of the DhammaBut despite this people did not grow through the promotion of the DhammaBelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi said concerning this It occurs to me that in the past kings desired that the people might grow through the promotion of the DhammaBut despite this people did not grow through the promotion of the DhammaNow how can the people be encouraged to follow itHow can the people be encouraged to grow through the promotion of the DhammaHow can I elevate them by promoting the Dhamma BelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi further said concerning this It occurs to me that I shall have proclamations on Dhamma announced and instruction on Dhamma givenWhen people hear these they will follow them elevate themselves and grow considerably through the promotion of the Dhamma It is for this purpose that proclamations on Dhamma have been announced and various instructions on Dhamma have been given and that officers who work among many promote and explain them in detailThe Rajjukas who work among hundreds of thousands of people have likewise been ordered In this way and that encourage those who are devoted to Dhamma BelovedoftheGods speaks thus Having this object in view I have set up Dhamma pillars appointed Dhamma Mahamatras and announced Dhamma proclamationsBelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi says Along roads I have had banyan trees planted so that they can give shade to animals and men and I have had mango groves plantedAt intervals of eight krosas I have had wells dug resthouses built and in various places I have had wateringplaces made for the use of animals and menBut these are but minor achievementsSuch things to make the people happy have been done by former kingsI have done these things for this purpose that the people might practice the DhammaBelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi speaks thus My Dhamma Mahamatras too are occupied with various good works among the ascetics and householders of all religionsI have ordered that they should be occupied with the affairs of the SanghaI have also ordered that they should be occupied with the affairs of the Brahmans and the AjivikasI have ordered that they be occupied with the NiganthasIn fact I have ordered that different Mahamatras be occupied with the particular affairs of all different religionsAnd my Dhamma Mahamatras likewise are occupied with these and other religionsBelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi speaks thus These and other principal officers are occupied with the distribution of gifts mine as well as those of the queensIn my womens quarters they organize various charitable activities here and in the provincesI have also ordered my sons and the sons of other queens to distribute gifts so that noble deeds of Dhamma and the practice of Dhamma may be promotedAnd noble deeds of Dhamma and the practice of Dhamma consist of having kindness generosity truthfulness purity gentleness and goodness increase among the peopleBelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi speaks thus Whatever good deeds have been done by me those the people accept and those they followTherefore they have progressed and will continue to progress by being respectful to mother and father respectful to elders by courtesy to the aged and proper behavior towards Brahmans and ascetics towards the poor and distressed and even towards servants and employeesBelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi speaks thus This progress among the people through Dhamma has been done by two means by Dhamma regulations and by persuasionOf these Dhamma regulation is of little effect while persuasion has much more effectThe Dhamma regulations I have given are that various animals must be protectedAnd I have given many other Dhamma regulations alsoBut it is by persuasion that progress among the people through Dhamma has had a greater effect in respect of harmlessness to living beings and nonkilling of living beingsConcerning this BelovedoftheGods says Wherever there are stone pillars or stone slabs there this Dhamma edict is to be engraved so that it may long endureIt has been engraved so that it may endure as long as my sons and greatgrandsons live and as long as the sun and the moon shine and so that people may practice it as instructedFor by practicing it happiness will be attained in this world and the nextThis Dhamma edict has been written by me twentyseven years after my coronationTwenty years after his coronation BelovedoftheGods King Piyadasi visited this place and worshipped because here the Buddha the sage of the Sakyans was bornHe had a stone figure and a pillar set up and because the Lord was born here the village of Lumbini was exempted from tax and required to pay only one eighth of the produceBelovedoftheGods commands The Mahamatras at Kosambi which is now united is not to be admitted into the SanghaWhoever whether monk or nun splits the Sangha is to be made to wear white clothes and to reside somewhere other than in a monasteryIt has also been said Generosity is good But there is no gift or benefit like the gift of the Dhamma or benefit like the benefit of the DhammaThere a friend a wellwisher a relative or a companion should encourage others thus on appropriate occasions This should be done this is good by doing this one can attain heaven And what greater achievement is there than this to attain heavenDRBhandarkar AsokaCalcutta RMookerji AsokaDelhi ASen Asokas EdictsCalcutta ASeneviratna King Asoka and BuddhismKandyScheduled forDSircar Inscriptions of AsokaDelhi The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseInnumerable books have been written about Buddhism but most of these are far too exhaustive too specialized or too scholarly to be of much practical help to the busy lay Buddhist in search of concise guidanceA short clear and simple handbook on how to live a proper Buddhist lay life was therefore a much felt needThe present essay attempts to fill that gap by providing exactly what its title offers A Simple Guide to LifeFor easy reference the essay has been divided into short convenient sectionsThe first section is theoretical in emphasisIt attempts to fix in the readers mind the essential principles of the Buddhas teaching without complicated and sophisticated explanationsThe principles discussed here should serve as a clearcut philosophy of life a framework which illuminates the meaning and purpose of the Buddhist lifeThese principles will enable the lay Buddhist to understand his or her place in the larger scheme of things to order priorities and to devise a proper way to achieve themThe lack of a clear philosophy of life so widespread today is largely responsible for the steady decline in ethical standards both individually and socially in Sri Lanka and in the world as a wholeThe second section is concerned with the practical implications of adopting the understanding of existence sketched in the first sectionWe here examine the visible benefits of accepting the BuddhaDhamma as a way of thinking and living in this section we will also throw a sidelong glance at what happens to a society when spiritual values are abandoned in favor of an exclusive stress on material developmentThe next two sections discuss respectively the need to draw up an individual life plan and the obstacles likely to impede the successful implementation of that planThe central problem of a Buddhist lay follower is to combine a successful lay life with Buddhist moral and spiritual principlesThis problem can be solved by organizing ones life as a lay Buddhist within the framework of the Noble Eightfold Path which represents the Masters teaching in practiceBecause some degree of economic security is essential to growth in the Dhamma the Buddha was concerned with the material welfare of his lay disciples as much as with their spiritual developmentHe did not deter them from seeking mundane happiness but he stressed that in pursuing mundane goals the lay Buddhist should take great care to avoid breaking the basic rules of moralityThese rules are summed up in the Five Precepts of virtue the minimum code of ethics to be followed by a Buddhist householderAs the Five Precepts are thus of such fundamental importance to a Buddhist lay follower a separate section is devoted to discussing themThe remaining sections of the essay show how to apply the basic principles of Buddhism to the other major areas of a Buddhist householders lifeThe essay ends with a section briefly describing what is expected of an ideal lay Buddhist in daily lifeThe guiding maxim of the entire essay is A little well done is better than a lot poorly doneTo sum up The Buddhas teaching which is unique in its completeness is the most rational and consistent plan for wholesome livingIt is not based on dogma or blind faith but on facts and verifiable conclusionsIt therefore offers a reasonable way of life which should be attractive to any thinking personMoreover the Dhamma is completely compatible with the advances of modern science and does not require clever reinterpretations to avoid clashes with scientific discoveriesThe mere fact of accepting Buddhism intellectually however will not ensure happiness and securityTo yield its fruit the Buddhas teaching has to be utilized intelligently and constructively in all the activities of our daily lifeIt has to be adopted adapted and applied until all its basic principles are absorbed and made habitual by repeated practice for a theoretical knowledge of Buddhism is insufficient in itselfIf one wishes to make changes in the changing personality that one now is these changes will take time and patienceThe lofty heights of Nibbana are not to be reached by a sudden leap but by quiet persistent endeavor over a long period guided by the Masters teachingLet us not forget that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single stepDaily practice beginning with the strict observance of the Five Precepts is the way to orderly progress along the pathEven a little practice every day brings the practitioner a little nearer to the goal each dayI take this opportunity to offer the merit of this gift of Dhamma most gratefully and most devotedly to my parents now no moreSuch a gift excels all other gifts Sabbadanam dhammadanam jinatiMay it redound to their happinessTo be happy successful and secure we must first learn to see ourselves and the world as they truly are and should then shape our everyday activities in keeping with this viewWe must also look for solutions to our problems in terms of the relationship of cause and effect for the universal law of causality operates in the field of human behavior as much as it does in the physical worldThe foundation for a fruitful life is an understanding of the moral law of kammaKamma is volitional action action that expresses morally determinate intentions or volitionsWe need to recognize clearly that wholesome and unwholesome deeds produce corresponding good and bad resultsAs a person sows so shall he reapGood begets good and evil begets evilThis retributive power is inherent in volitional action or kammaKamma is also cumulativeNot only do our deeds generate pleasant and painful results but in their cumulative force they also determine our characterThe deeds we perform in any one life are transmitted to future lives in the form of dispositionsThese dispositions constitute our character traitsInherent in the action is the power of producing its due resultThis happens without the intervention or help of any external agencyBuddhism denies the existence of a CreatorGodKamma is neither fate nor predestination but our own willed action considered as capable of producing resultsUnderstanding the kammic moral law of cause and effect we will learn to control our actions in order to serve our own welfare as well as to promote the good of othersThere are ten unwholesome courses of action deeds which originate from the defilements of greed hatred and delusionThese are killing stealing sexual misconduct lying slander harsh speech useless talk covetousness ill will and false viewsContrary to these there are ten bases of merit deeds which spring from the virtuous qualities of detachment goodwill and wisdom and which generate wholesome kamma generosity morality meditation reverence service transference of merit rejoicing in the good deeds of others hearing the Dhamma expounding the Dhamma and straightening out ones viewsIt is lack of right understanding and ignorance of the underlying laws of life that account for the prevalence of materialism in todays world even in the traditional homelands of the BuddhaDhammaWhen people become convinced that everything perishes at death they lose sight of lofty ethical ideals and become indifferent to the longrange consequences of their deedsTheir entire lives revolve around the blind pursuit of sensual pleasuresThus we find that today people worship money regardless of how it is earned hunt for pleasure no matter where it is found chase power and fame regardless of the cost to their personal integrityIgnorance of the law is no valid excuse in a court of law and so it is with regard to the moral law of kamma the law operates regardless of whether one believes in it or not due effects following from their respective causesJust as an infant will get burnt if it touches fire regardless of whether or not it understands the dangers in playing with fire so those who violate the laws of morality will have to face the consequences when their kamma ripens regardless of whether or not they accept the teaching of kammaJust as a shadow is connected with an object so is rebirth connected with kammaCraving selfish desire prompts us to do lifeaffirming deeds kamma volitional actionNo force in nature is ever lost and moral energy is no exceptionSo long as craving and ignorance remain in the mind kamma must find expression at deathThe inevitable fruit of craving for existence is rebirthBuddhism affirms the continuity of the individual lifeflux at death but denies the existence of a permanent soulMind is a flux of mental processes without any persisting core yet this flux though insubstantial continues from life to life as long as it is driven on by the thirst for more becomingThe mind of a dying person owing to the latent craving for continued existence grasps at some object idea or feeling connected with an action done during his lifetime and this grasping vitalizes an appropriate germ of lifeThe new form of life may be human or nonhuman in keeping with the kamma or moral forces generated during the deceaseds lifetimeThe germ of life kindled by the process of rebirth is endowed with an initial consciousness in which lie latent all the past impressions characteristics and tendencies of that particular individualHence death leads to birth and birth to deathRebirth is thus possible without a transmigrating soulThe twin Buddhist doctrines of kamma and rebirth are the middle way that provides a satisfactory answer to the problem of lifeThe middle way avoids the extremes of theism and materialism preserving moral accountability without the problems raised by positing an almighty yet benevolent GodA human being is the visible expression of his or her own past actionOne is born from ones past kamma supported by ones present kamma and at death goes where ones accumulated kamma leads oneBuddhism teaches that human beings evolve according to the quality of the kamma they have performed during their lifetimeThis supplies a rational basis for morality in place of the commandments of a CreatorGodAccording to the Buddhas teachings there can be regression from the human plane to subhuman realms such as the animal world and progress from the human plane to the heavenly planesTaking into account the dangers of a fall to subhuman realms one should always act with careVirtue based on a righteous code of conduct protects one from regression and ensures spiritual progressA true follower of the Buddha accepts the moral law of kamma as just recognizing it as the chief reason for the many inequalities among human beings in regard to health wealth and wisdomHe also learns to face lifes losses disappointments failures and adversities calmly without complaining for he knows that they are the result of his own past misdeedsIf he asks himself Why has this happened to me the answer will be expressed in terms of action and resultHe will try to solve his problems to the best of his ability and will adjust himself to the new situation when external change is not possibleHe will not act rashly nor fall into despair nor try to escape his difficulties by resorting to drink drugs or suicide as so often happens in Sri LankaSuch conduct only shows emotional immaturity and ignorance of the Buddhas teachingsFor a genuine Buddhist then ones everyday activities by way of thought word and deed are more important than anything else in lifeA proper understanding of the Buddhist moral law of kamma and rebirth is essential for happy and sensible living and for the welfare of the worldIn the Buddhas own words Samyutta Nikaya Kosala Samyutta transby Sir Robert ChalmersAlthough we imagine ourselves to be a self  a real substantial individual  according to the Buddhas teaching we are in reality nothing more than a flamelike process an everchanging combination of matter and mind neither of which is the same for two consecutive momentsAll the components of our being are impermanent unsatisfactory and devoid of selfLife is not a being an identity but a becoming not a product but a processThere is in actuality no doer only a doing no thinker only a thinking no goer only a goingThe Buddha teaches us how to put an end to the beginningless cycle of rebirths in which we undergo the manifold kinds of sufferingThe way to end the cycle is by removing the causes that drive it forward life after lifeThe principal cause is craving which assumes many formsCraving impels a person to engage in action designed to satisfy the craving yet as craving is essentially insatiable the result is rebirthCraving is a powerful mental force latent in all unenlightened beingsThe cause of craving is ignorance of the true nature of life not knowing that life is an everchanging process subject to suffering and totally devoid of a self or coreAll life wherever it is found bears this same nature a process stamped with the three marks of impermanence unsatisfactoriness and egolessnessThe Buddha realized for himself the true nature of life and through this realization attained to something beyond life and death a reality that is permanent blissful and deathlessThis state cannot be described but has to be realized inwardly as a matter of direct personal experience it has to be attained for oneself and by oneselfThis ultimate reality where thought expires in experience is Nibbana the goal of the Buddhist pathThe Buddhas teachings may thus be condensed into these four verifiable truths called the Four Noble Truths suffering its cause its cessation and the way leading to cessation of sufferingThese are eternal truths truths that do not change and cannot change with time and placeThe only way for us to avoid unhappiness and dissatisfaction is to eliminate the craving that gives birth to it for everything eagerly sought for and clung to is impermanentNothing lasts forever  no person no object no experienceWhatever arises must perish and to cling to the perishable sooner or later ends in sufferingIt is by no means easy to eliminate craving in fact it is the most difficult challenge of allBut when we do so we will reach a state of inward perfection and unshakable calmWe can reach the end of suffering by cultivating the Noble Eightfold Path in its three stages of morality concentration and wisdom  sila samadhi paññaMorality purifies conduct and concentration makes the mind calmWhen the mind is calm and concentrated wisdom arises clear insight the knowledge and vision of things as they really areWith the arising of wisdom craving in all its forms is forever destroyed the flame of life is then extinguished for want of fuelThe Unconditioned has been won  Nibbana which is deathless blissful and realThe Noble Eightfold Path consists of the following eight factors interrelated and interconnected ordered into three groupsThese eight factors summarize the Buddhas teaching and its practiceThey are the very heart of the BuddhaDhammaIt is not enough to know and admire the Dhamma it must be practiced in daily life for the difficulty of knowing what is right is nothing compared to the difficulty of putting it into practiceWe really know something only when we do it repeatedly when we make it part of our natureThe practical side of the Dhamma is the threefold training in morality concentration and wisdom which collectively constitute the Noble Eightfold Path the middle way discovered by the Blessed One for the realization of NibbanaMonastics and laypeople alike tread the same pathBoth start from the same foundation right understanding both pursue the same goal NibbanaThe only difference lies in the degree of commitment to the practice and the pace of progressBut whether as a layperson or as a monk the systematic practice of the Eightfold Path will foster the growth of the wholesome qualities leading to liberation  generosity goodwill and wisdomAs these qualities gradually reach maturity they will weaken and finally snap the fetters of greed hatred and delusion which have held us for so long in bondage to the round of rebirth and sufferingRight understanding is the foundation for developing a proper sense of values so sorely lacking in our ageWithout right understanding our vision is dimmed and the way is lost all our efforts will be misguided and misdirected all our plans for individual and social development must flounder and failSuch plans will have to be based on the Eightfold Path with its emphasis on selfeffort selfcontrol and respect for the individualWhen wrong views prevail we will operate with a perverted sense of values we will fling ourselves into the blind pursuit of wealth power and possessions we will be obsessed by the urge to conquer and dominate we will pine for ruthless revenge we will dumbly conform to social conventions and normsRight views will point us towards an enlightened sense of values towards detachment and kindness towards generosity of spirit and selfless service to others towards the pursuit of wisdom and understandingThe confusion and moral lunacy now prevalent in the world can be eased if not eliminated if the path of the Buddha is followedRight livelihood and right action for instance can help us avoid the conflicts that result from a wrong way of life and wrong action thereby enabling a society to live in peace and harmonyAlthough in the affluent countries of the West people now enjoy high standards of goods and services the inward quality of their lives does not bear evidence of a corresponding level of improvementThe reason for the poverty of their interior life is the neglect of spiritual valuesWhen materialism erodes the higher spiritual dimension of life a plunge into moral nihilism is bound to followWe see this in the alarming statistics characteristic of materialist society in the increased rate of suicide in the explosion of crime in the proliferation of sexual offenses alcoholism and drug abuseThis shows that a onesided stress on material development in a pleasureseeking society is ultimately selfdestructive like a piece of iron that is devoured by the rust arising from within itselfEven knowledge and discipline on their own are not adequate for without moral ideals they may turn a society into nothing more than a massscale workshop or military campIt is only the cultivation of a proper sense of values that can make society cultured and civilized in the true meaning of those termsHaving right understanding will enable us to recognize that worldly values are manmade and relativeThese false worldly values lead people astray and make them suffer in vainA Buddha teaches authentic values real values values that are grounded in timeless truthA Buddha first realizes for himself the true nature of life then he reveals to blind worldlings the Dhamma the eternal law of righteousness and truthThis Dhamma includes the Four Noble Truths and the principles of kamma and rebirthAny values that deviate from these principles no matter how widely they may be accepted as the common norm are worthless and deceptiveWhile those whose minds are shrouded in wrong views will be deceived by them one with right view will realize their hollowness at onceSeeing that life involves incessant change and that it is subject to many forms of suffering one with right understanding learns to live simply and to regulate desireA wise and virtuous person is moderate in his desires and follows the middle way in all mattersUnderstanding the close connection between craving and suffering he will realize the importance of holding desire in check by simple livingOne with right understanding is aware that real happiness is an inward state  a quality of the mind  and should therefore be sought inwardlyHappiness is independent of external things though of course a certain degree of material security is necessary as a basis for inner developmentWe require only four basic kinds of physical sustenance wholesome food clothing shelter and medicineComplementary to these we have four mental needs right knowledge virtue guarding the doors of the senses and meditationThese are the two sets of basic requisites for leading a lofty lifeLiving simply without superfluous possessions and entanglements leads to contentment and peace of mind releasing time and energy to pursue higher virtues and valuesIt is pride and vanity that keep us tied to false goals and the smaller the mind the greater is the prideBuddhism upholds the objectivity of moral values for its ethics is based on the law of cause and effect in the moral sphere and this law like the physical law of gravity is an unvarying truth valid for all timeGood deeds and bad deeds will produce their respective pleasant and painful fruits regardless of the views and wishes of the people who engage in themRecognizing the objectivity of the moral law and the undeviating connection between deeds and their results a person with right view will abstain from wrong actions and adhere to the standards of wholesome conduct embodied in the Five Precepts of virtuous conductAs instability is inherent in life the most unexpected things can happenTherefore the wise Buddhist recognizes the need to control his feelingsWhen calamity comes we must face it calmly without lamenting or falling into despairThe ability to remain equanimous amidst the fluctuations of fortune is a benefit of right understandingWe should understand that everything that happens to us happens because of causes and conditions for which we are ultimately responsibleSimilarly as we obtain some degree of emotional control we will be able to discard irrational fears and worriesThe seeming injustices of life grievances emotional maladjustments etc are all explained fully and rationally by the law of kamma and rebirthBy understanding this law we will see that in the final analysis we are the architects of our own destinyA further fruit of right understanding is the ability to look at people things and events objectively stripped bare of likes and dislikes of bias and prejudiceThis capacity for objectivity a sign of true mental maturity will issue in clearer thinking saner living a marked reduction of susceptibility to the pernicious influence of the mass media and an improvement in interpersonal relationshipsOne with right understanding will be able to think for himselfHe is able to make up his own mind to form his own opinions to face lifes difficulties armed with the principles of reality taught by the BuddhaThe true Buddhist will not be a moral and intellectual coward but will be prepared to stand alone regardless of what others say or thinkOf course he will seek advice when necessary but he will make his own decisions and have the courage of his convictionsRight understanding will give us a purpose for livingA lay Buddhist must learn to live purposefully with a worthy aim  both an immediate aim and an ultimate aim the one fitting harmoniously into the otherTo be truly happy we require a simple but sound philosophy of lifePhilosophy is the keen desire to understand the nature of man and our destiny in the universeIt gives life a sense of direction and meaningWithout one we either dream our way through life or muddle through lifeA clearcut philosophy makes life meaningful and fruitful enabling us to live in harmony with our fellows and with the natural environmentTo make the best use of our human potential we need not only a practical aim in life but a life plan for achieving that aimThe preceding two sections of this essay show the groundwork for developing a proper sense of values the values essential for gaining happiness success and security within the mundane life and for progressing towards the ultimate goal of the Buddhist path NibbanaWhile we walk along the path to liberation as laypeople we have to live in the world and our immediate objective will be to make our life in the world both a means to worldly success and a steppingstone to final liberationTo accomplish this we must organize our life within the framework of the Noble Eightfold PathWe can best realize our immediate aims by drawing up an individual life plan in keeping with our powers and circumstancesThis life plan must be realisticIt must envisage a realistic development of our innate potential steering us towards the fullest actualization of our possibilitiesAt the start we require an honest understanding of ourselvesIt is pointless to devise a workable life plan on the foundation stone of grandiose delusions about our character and abilitiesThe more we find out about ourselves by selfobservation and selfexamination the better will be our chances of selfimprovementWe should ask ourselves how far and to what degree we are generous kind eventempered considerate honest sober in morals truthful diligent energetic industrious cautious patient tolerant and tactfulThese are the qualities of a welldeveloped Buddhist the qualities we ourselves should emulateWe need to improve ourselves wherever we are weakA little practice everyday is all that is necessaryWe should remember that the more often an action is performed the easier it becomes for us to perform it in the future and the stronger becomes the tendency to do it again and again until it becomes a habit an ingrained part of our characterOur life plan should cover all the main areas of a normal householders life including occupation marriage the procreation and raising of children retirement old age and deathThe happiness of lay life consists in finding out exactly what one can do and doing it wellA clear mental picture of a practical aim in life and a realistic sketch of the steps needed to achieve that aim will help guide us to the fulfillment of our idealWe tend to become what we really want to be provided we act realistically and effectively to realize our aimThe following five states are likely to prevent or block the success of our efforts to lead the upright life of a Buddhist lay followerThey are called by the Buddha the five mental hindrances because they close the doors to both spiritual and worldly progressAlthough the Buddha originally taught them as the main obstacles to meditation with a little reflection we can see that they are equally detrimental to success in our mundane undertakingsThe first of the five hindrances is sensual craving obsessive hankering for possessions or for the gratification of the sensesWhile the lay Buddhist will seek wealth and possessions as an integral part of mundane happiness he will also be aware of the limits to be observed in their pursuitHe will recognize that if one obtains wealth and position by unjust means or becomes excessively attached to them they will become a source of misery and despair rather than of joy and contentmentMoney alone cannot solve all our problemsMany people never learn this and spend their time and energy accumulating wealth and the socalled good things it can buyBut in fact the more they acquire the more they wantSuch people can never find happinessA lay Buddhist must be moderate in all thingsExtreme desires  for riches the enjoyment of sex liquor the ostentatious display of ones success  are sure signs of internal insecurity things to be avoidedIll will or hatred the second hindrance is the emotional opposite of desire yet it is an equally potent obstacle to personal developmentBecause we are attracted to desirable things we are repelled by what is undesirableLike and dislike are the two forces that delude the world leading people astray into conflict and confusion and drenching the earth with bloodBoth are born of ignoranceDesire colors everything in tinsel and drives us to acquire what we wantHatred colors everything black and drives us to destroy what we suspect is inimical to our interestsThe best way to overcome hatred is by cultivating lovingkindness explained later in this essayIndolence and mental inertia is the next hindrance the obstacle to strenuous effortThe lazy person is not inclined to strive for correct understanding or high standards of conductHe is a drifter or a dreamer easy prey to the thieves of craving and hatredRestlessness and worry are twin hindrances very much in evidence todayRestlessness is manifest in the agitation impatience thirst for excitement and unsettled character of our daily existenceWorry is the guilt and remorse that one feels when one broods sadly or regretfully over an evil deed that has been done or a good deed left undoneThe best remedy for a lapse or transgression already committed is to decide never to repeat it the best remedy for neglecting to do good is to do it without delayThe last hindrance is doubtDoubt is the inability to decide the lack of resolution that prevents one from making a firm commitment to higher ideals and from pursuing the good with a steady willThese five hindrances are great handicaps to ones progressThey deprive the mind of understanding and happiness and cause much unnecessary sufferingBy cultivating the five cardinal virtues  confidence energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom  and by constant effort one can reduce their harmful influenceModern life is full of stress and strainTherefore relaxation is a necessary ingredient of happinessBy understanding the causes of stress and by regulating these causes we can live calmly even in the midst of strenuous activityHard work without tension never killed anyoneWhy is it then that some people always work anxiously and feverishlyGenerally such a person is driven by craving by intense desireHe wants to achieve his goal so eagerly with such avidity that he simply cannot rest until he gets it or he is so fearful of losing something he prizes that he cannot relax and enjoy the present moment or he is driven by resentment against those who obstruct his thirst or he is constantly hankering after power position and prestige on account of some irrational need to prove his worth to himself and othersIf a person wants to avoid stress and strain then he will have to train his mind to view everything he encounters  persons objects events and experiences  realistically as transient phenomena dependently arisen through conditionsHe should reflect upon them in terms of the three characteristics  as impermanent unsatisfactory and without a selfDoing so will help to reduce the investment of selfconcern in these phenomena and thereby will reduce the craving and attachment for themHe should also avoid anger anxiety and pride  the thoughts of me and mine  since such emotions are productive of stress and strainWhen one adopts this attitude to life one will discover greater detachment deeper calm more durable peace of heart even amidst the same situations that previously produced nothing but stress and worryThe key to managing stress is through the disciplining and mastery of the mindOne can also reduce stress by forming good work habitsOne should confine oneself to doing one thing at a time since attempts to juggle multiple tasks only lead to poor results in all of themOne should keep work and leisure separateOne should work in a relaxed frame of mind repeatedly reminding oneself during the course of the day that one can accomplish more work and better work if one works calmly and intersperses ones routine with breaksThe following additional disciplines will also be helpful in combatting stress and tensionKeeping the Five Precepts conscientiouslyThe feeling of guilt increases stressBy observing the precepts a person leads a blameless life and thereby enjoys freedom from the nagging sense of guilt that harasses one who violates the basic rules of moralityA guilty conscience is a vexing companion during the day an uncomfortable bedfellow at nightSense controlThe mind is constantly attracted to pleasant sense objects and repelled by unpleasant objectsWandering recklessly among the objective fields it becomes scattered and distraughtBy guarding the sense doors this wasteful agitation is checkedThe mind becomes calm and settled and as a result one experiences an unblemished happinessMeditationMeditation or bhavana purifies the mindAs the mind is gradually cleansed one can see with greater clarity the true nature of lifeOne then becomes increasingly detached from worldly things and develops an equanimity that cannot be shaken by the fluctuations of fortuneCultivating the four sublime attitudesThe four sublime attitudes are lovingkindness compassion altruistic joy and equanimityThese are enlightened emotions that reduce the stress and strain of daily life improve interpersonal relationships at home and in the workplace promote racial accord and amity help in the development of an even mind and increase calm and inner peaceOne final piece of practical advice Time energy and funds are limited while wants are unlimitedTherefore a person must have a sense of prioritiesA lay Buddhist in particular must be able to discriminate to know what is really essential to a wholesome life what is desirable but not urgent what is trivial and dispensable and what is detrimentalHaving made these distinctions one must pursue what ranks high in the scale of priorities and eschew what ranks lowThis will enable one to avoid unnecessary waste and worry and help to promote balanced frugal livingThe minimal code of ethics followed by a lay Buddhist is the Five Precepts of virtueThese precepts are moral rules voluntarily undertaken to promote the purity of ones own conduct and to avoid causing harm and suffering to othersEvil conduct is harmful to oneself and others and strengthens the defilements of greed hatred and delusionTo engage in unwholesome activity is not merely a matter of free choice it is a violation of the cosmic moral law entailing inevitable suffering both in this life and in future existencesThe opposite of evil conduct is virtueVirtue involves the avoidance of immoral deeds by voluntarily accepting ethical principles of restraintVirtuous action springs from the three wholesome roots of nonattachment goodwill and wisdomBy undertaking moral precepts one pledges to regulate ones conduct in accordance with these three virtuous qualitiesThe Five Precepts are as followsFollowing the Five Precepts also implies shunning the five kinds of occupation forbidden to a lay Buddhist trading in arms in human beings in flesh in intoxicants and in poisonsVirtue though formulated negatively in the precepts is not a mere negative stateTo the contrary it is most decidedly a powerful mental achievementTo observe the precepts conscientiously in ones daily life brings a simultaneous growth in mental purity skillfulness and wisdomRefraining from killing for example increases compassion and lovingkindness for all living beings two of the sublime attitudes extolled by the BuddhaHonesty gives courage generosity and love of justiceSexual restraint results in physical strength vitality and keenness of the sensesTruthfulness makes for uprightnessAvoiding intoxicants and stupefying drugs promotes clarity of mindFinally mindfulness is essential to observing all the precepts and ones constant effort to maintain the precepts in turn issues in an increase in the clarity of mindfulnessThe habitual practice of the Five Precepts leads to increased selfcontrol and strength of characterThe mind that succeeds in controlling desire even to a slight degree gains in powerDesire is a force every bit as real as electricityWhen desire is uncontrolled allowed to run riot it expends itself in the pursuit of things that are harmful to oneself and othersThe Buddhas teaching far from encouraging the proliferation of desire counsels us in the methods by which we may harness divert and sublimate the powerful force of desire and use it for worthy endsVirtue is the first stage in the development of the Noble Eightfold Path as explained above it comprises the path factors of Right Speech Right Action and Right LivelihoodThe energy conserved by virtue is then used for the practice of the second stage concentration of mind which in turn is the soil for the growth of wisdomThe observance of the Five Precepts is a voluntary act which each individual must take up on his or her own initiativeThe Buddha did not formulate the precepts as commandments nor did he threaten anyone with punishment for violating themHowever this much has to be said The Buddha perfectly understood the workings of the universe and he proclaimed the inviolable moral law of cause and effect good deeds beget pleasant fruits evil deeds beget painful fruitsThe Five Precepts are the guidelines the Buddha has bequeathed us to steer us away from evil conduct and towards the lines of conduct that will prove most beneficial for ourselves and othersWhen we mold our actions by the Five Precepts we are acting in accordance with the Dhamma avoiding future misery and building up protection and happiness for ourselves and others both here and in the hereafterThus the closer we live to the Five Precepts the greater will be the blessing power of our livesAn emotion is a state of deep feeling an inward stirring which can act as a motivation for actionEmotions are often associated with the instincts the inborn tendencies to act in specific ways in specific situationsHuman beings are conditioned to a very great extent by their emotions by their likes and dislikesToo often their emotions are biased by selfinterest and egotism even to the extent that they overwhelm sense and reason compelling us to act in ways that in saner moments we regard with dismayEmotions generally arise in response to the spontaneous evaluation of perceptionsA person evaluates his or her percepts  of another person an object a situation  as desirable or undesirable as helpful or as threateningOn the basis of this evaluation an emotion will arise in response to the situation desire for those things positively evaluated aversion or fear towards those things seen in a negative lightEmotions may be harmful such as lust anger and fear or wholesome such as sympathy and compassionWhile desire and aversion are the prototypes of the unwholesome emotions lovingkindness and compassion are outstanding examples of emotions that ennoble us and elevate human naturePeople vary widely in their emotional development and in the range and strength of their emotionsWhile one person is passionate and impulsive another is cool and reflective while one is quick to anger another is patient while one is emotionally impassive another is capable of running through a wide range of emotions in less time than a finger snapOne important reason for these differences is that each individual brings along a different kammic inheritance of tendencies and character traits from previous livesWhether emotions are repressed or expressed indulged in or sublimated depends on a combination of factors innate temperament family background and the ethos and traditions of the larger societyWe cannot grow in the Dhamma or find happiness without some degree of emotional controlA person who easily gets angry spoils his own happiness and disturbs the peace of mind of others as wellInstinctive emotions are the raw material of characterIf an instinctive impulse is misdirected or repressed much harm and suffering may ensueBut if the energy that is normally channeled into this emotion is redirected towards a worthy object the force of the emotion will be sublimated in a way that results in great benefit to oneself and to the communityFor the Buddhist the worthiest of all ideals is the attainment of Nibbana hence it is the quest for this ideal that has the capacity to absorb and transform our emotional lifeSuch a noble ideal has the power of evoking and harmonizing all our emotional energies so that they guide us towards the realization of our ultimate goodWithout deliberate effort emotions will not be under the direct control of the willThe Buddhist training aims at mastering the emotionsThe first step in gaining such mastery is the observance of the Five PreceptsPracticing the precepts in everyday life will help us to control the grosser forms of craving and emotionThe next step is to train the mind to control the emotions just as they begin to ariseThis is accomplished by mindfulness by objectively watching with close attention the emotions that arise and swiftly ascribing a name to them a mental label thus mind with lust mind with anger mind with jealousy mind with sorrow etcOnce we have named the emotion we are then in a better position to let it go without being swept away by itThe moment one calmly registers the fact that one is angry  when one is aware of the fact that a mind with anger has arisen  one then ceases to be angryA mind that is occupied with the wholesome thought of mindful awareness has no scope within it simultaneously for an unwholesome thought of angerThis same procedure should be adopted with any other harmful emotion that arisesAt the start it may prove helpful if during the course of the day one mentally repeats to oneself a formula such as What am I feeling now or What am I thinking now and immediately answers the question thus I am feeling angry or I am feeling jealous etcWe should also investigate even later when and why anger  or any other adverse emotion  overwhelmed us then and thus avoid such situations and responses in the futureBy patient and persistent practice we can gradually gain control over our harmful emotionsThe discipline and effort involved is worthwhile for it will bring greater harmony internally  in ones own mind  and externally in ones relations with othersThe key to such control is firm adherence to the basic precepts of morality and above all mindfulness of ones own thoughts and emotionsBuddhism teaches the need for clear thinking selfcontrol selfhelp and meditationAlthough each human being is endowed with a mind very few of us use that mind to think for ourselvesThe great majority of people today allow others to do their thinking for themThe mind absorbs a great deal of poison from the outer environment by continuous exposure to suggestions from othersThis mental passivity has become especially baneful with the development of the mass mediaRadio television and newspapers pulp journals and tabloids blare their messages at us every minute of the day and their power of penetration is reinforced by the ingrained human disposition to accept what we are told and to comply with what we are urged to doBombarded left and right by ten thousand inducements we no longer think our own thoughts feel our own emotions or initiate our own actions instead we think as others want us to think feel as others want us to feel act in ways that will win the approval of our peers and superiorsThe pull of the crowd has become irresistibleEvery time we open a newspaper turn on the radio or sit down before the television set we are immediately subjected to propaganda advertising and subtle social suggestionsThis is done daily deliberately and systematicallyAll these media are teaching us to suspend our capacity for thought or if we are to think at all to think as they would like us to thinkNewspapers for instance seek to command assent not only by their editorials and opinion columns but by their layout language and lines of emphasisThose who exploit the media in this manner are generally small but powerful groups the owners and sponsors of the media advertising agencies the masters of commerceSuch people are motivated primarily by selfinterest greed for wealth and power a sense of selfimportanceOften they play dominant roles in various walks of life including politics business law medicine and educationAmong the general public the role of reason tends to be subordinate to that of emotion while mental inertia and indifference make the conquest of reason easierHence by shaping public opinion through the manipulation of the media a small minority is able to control the majorityThose who comprise this small but powerful minority all have something to sellCommercial advertisements make us want more and more goods that bring us no real happiness no real peace of mindWe are told that our felicity depends on having a radio television video player stereo set and computer gamesYet however much we deck ourselves with all these instruments of diversion we still feel our lives painfully lackingThe speed power and efficiency of all these technological and social developments within a purely materialistic society such as ours has led to a rising incidence of stress disease and mental breakdownThose who do not crack under pressure find other escape routes such as drugs alcohol and psychotic cults while for those who cannot cope at all there remains the last resort suicide which has reached alarming proportions in our midstHow then is a Buddhist to protect himself or herself from the baneful influences to which we are everywhere exposed in the modern worldAs lay Buddhists we should always adopt a critical attitude towards the written and spoken word and should always apply mindfulness to protect ourselves from being emotionally swayed by those who seek to win our favorWe should stand back from the topic under review and examine it objectively from all anglesOnly after appraising the alternatives should we arrive at a decision or evaluationWhen we hear a particular opinion being voiced we should make an effort to find out who the writer or speaker is what interests he or she represents including political affiliations religious leanings and social backgroundWe should also never forget that there are at least two sides to any issue and that we are more likely to arrive at a correct stand if we first give unbiased consideration to both sidesBefore arriving at a conclusion one should gather all the relevant facts maintain a calm mind free from emotional excitation and prevent oneself from being swayed by preferences and anger praise and blameThe same principle of objective thinking should also be applied to other matters in everyday lifeIf we properly understand the working of kamma and rebirth we will recognize that no one can be alike and thus we will also avoid drawing comparisons for this is a world of comparisons as well as of propagandaThe only meaningful comparison that one should make is between the person that one was a month ago a year ago or a decade ago and the person that one is now physically intellectually morally and financiallyIf there has been no improvement or insufficient improvement one should inquire why this is so and remedy ones deficiencies without delayIf this annual stocktaking is done regularly it will be most beneficialPutting aside pride and prejudice revising ones values and outlook one will then lead a simpler saner and happier lifeFor the adult it is natural to love one person of the opposite sexThe lay Buddhist will recognize that there is nothing sinful or shameful in sex and hence will not suffer from a guilt complex over sexual desireAt the same time he or she will be aware that sexual desire like any other form of desire must be regulated and controlled to avoid harm to oneself and to othersIn a successful marriage the contracting parties must realize that love is a sentiment far wider than sexual attractionIf one person really loves another he or she has to learn to give without expecting anything in returnOnly in this way can the problem of sex be solved satisfactorilyFurther the wouldbe partners should ask themselves What do I expect of my partner and should find out objectively to what extent the prospective partner has the requisite qualitiesOne might enlist the help of a trustworthy balanced friend who has known the wouldbe partner for some time and might be in a better position to offer a correct evaluationThere are obvious dangers in being ones own marriage brokerToo often one is inclined to endow the wouldbe partner with qualities and virtues that she clearly lacks in the eyes of the unbiased observerThis danger has to be frankly acknowledged for disillusionment might otherwise set in sooner or later and then the stage is set for marital discontent and miseryNo doubt in married life sex is important but it must be kept in its proper place as an expression of marital loveSex is by no means the sole concern of married life only when it is subordinated to personal love and affection does sexuality provide a truly satisfying emotional experienceAbove and beyond sexual compatibility a happy marriage calls for mutual understanding and adjustments for sacrifices and selflessness for tolerance and patienceMarried life becomes truly a blessing rather than a curse when it is viewed as a partnership of two persons who are committed to think more of the partnership than they do of themselves who are ready to make the mutual effort necessary to attain harmony and contentmentMost married couples hope to have childrenChildren differ for each brings his or her own kammic inheritance from many past lives a kammic inheritance that includes potential tendencies that set the general tone and trend of the childs characterThis fact indicates both the responsibilities and the limitations of the parents in the upbringing of their childrenThe child spends most of the formative years of his or her life at home and early in life learns to follow by imitation the values and lifestyle of the parentsSchools and other influential agencies cannot supplant or replace the parentsBuddhist parents should recognize their solemn obligation to serve as models for their childrenThey should therefore regularly observe the Five Precepts and show their children by example that the Dhamma yet lives and rules their daily livesParents must be aware that the child has immense potentials for both good and evil and thus must fulfill their responsibility to help the child to develop his or her potential for good and to check the potential for evilIt is only if parents bestow their loving care and attention on their child that the child will be able to satisfy the hopes and aspirations of the parentsThe Buddha has advised parents to guide their children to supply their needs to see to their education to give them in marriage at the proper time and to attend to all other aspects of their wellbeingUnfortunately however many parents today do not discharge these duties with the result that too often children go astrayResponsible Buddhist parents must be prepared to forgo their own pleasure in order to attend to the upbringing of their childrenThey must realize that the home influence is ultimately what matters most in forming the childs character outweighing all other outside influences to which the child may be exposedIn areas where the parents lack adequate expertise they should be prepared to consult a nontechnical manual on proper child rearingThe first five years of a childs life are the most crucial in the formation of his or her character and it is at this stage that they are most susceptible to the influence of the parentsThereafter the needs of the child change and will continue to change radically at different stages of developmentParents should remember this and meet the new needs as they ariseIn the early years three factors are essential for balanced and wholesome growth parental love and affection a stable home environment and scope for creative activity and personal initiativeYoung children learn largely by imitationIf parents show emotional maturity avoid quarrels respect and trust each other and do likewise with their children then the children will develop characters that are sound both morally and psychologicallyWhen the child is brought up with love and understanding with insight into his or her changing needs nourished with high ideals and lofty aspirations then he or she will have a secure foundation upon which to build a character and a futureIn this way the very first steps along the Buddhas path will have been well plantedAdolescence is a period of stress and strain when children may be inclined to rebel against parental authorityIt is therefore at this stage that the greatest love and understanding are called forIn adolescence as the sexual instinct awakens sensible Buddhist parents should be capable of guiding their children and helping them to adjust to the changes taking place in their bodies and their livesWhen children ask their parents questions about sex the parents should be ready to answer them calmly and briefly in a matteroffact way just as they would answer any other questionIf parents are unable to tell the adolescent children the facts of life in an unselfconscious manner they might give them a suitable book to enable them to instruct themselves about the subjectAbove all in this age of sexually provocative entertainment irresponsible promiscuity and an exploding AIDS epidemic withholding vital information is not a means of protecting the youngster but of exposing him or her to dangerWhen parental control supervision and proper guidance are lacking the children often incline to delinquency and drugsParents should therefore take greater interest in their children should spend more time with them should know how they use their leisure and should make the acquaintance of their friendsReal problem children are few it is only problem parents who are manyAs the child reaches maturity it is the duty of the parents to help him wisely choose a suitable career as well as a mate but the childs wishes in these spheres have to be respectedTo order the young person about as if he or she were still a child is only to invite troubleSince we live in a world of keen competition in many areas of life wise Buddhist parents will limit the size of their family in order to give their children the bestIn developing countries like Sri Lanka where the rate of reproduction is generally higher than the rate of production of real wealth this is a necessary measure to eliminate poverty especially among the working classes in both town and countryside whose families are generally large with many dependantsBuddhism is not opposed to population control except by means of abortion and with the worlds resources dwindling today under dense population pressure Buddhist parents should recognize the need for family limitation to ensure the best for the childrenIn a country like Sri Lanka it is the duty of the state to popularize family limitation by making freely available safe effective and inexpensive methods of birth controlProduction that is centered on the population at large  rather than on enhancing the wealth of a privileged few  using appropriate technology with just distribution of resources and extensive family planning will increase real wealth and help to improve the quality of life of the masses provided they also cultivate a wise sense of valuesOtherwise they will always remain poorThe moral and spiritual edification of the children should accompany their physical and emotional developmentAs they grow up parents should teach them the essentials of the BuddhaDhamma using simple language and everyday examplesThey should explain the working of the moral law of kamma and rebirth should instruct them in the proper rules of conduct and should clarify the reasons for practicing virtue in daily lifeFurthermore in a Buddhist country children should be regularly taken to the temple especially on quiet daysThey should be enrolled in Dhamma school if such is available and should be encouraged to ask their questions and discuss their problems with wise and virtuous bhikkhusThe Dhamma after all is intended to guide us in how to live this very life we are leading nowIt is the art of happiness here and now and the path to deliverance in the hereafterMaterialism is steadily eroding traditional values moral spiritual and socialThe influence of materialism now reaches even the remote villages the ancient strongholds of the Buddhist way of lifeBut young people who have been rightly brought up by Buddhist parents to discover the value of the Dhamma for themselves are unlikely to be led astrayThe desire to do good to bring about the happiness and wellbeing of others is effectively cultivated in Buddhism by the systematic practice of the four sublime attitudes lovingkindness compassion altruistic joy and equanimityBy cultivating these qualities a Buddhist can gradually remove the mental defilements such as hatred cruelty and envy and bring into being the most exalted virtuesThe sublime attitudes elevate human beings to a divinelike stature they break the barriers that separate individuals and groups they build bridges more solid than those constructed of stone and steelMetta is goodwill lovingkindness universal love a feeling of friendliness and heartfelt concern for all living beings human or nonhuman in all situationsThe chief mark of metta is a benevolent attitude a keen desire to promote the welfare of othersMetta subdues the vice of hatred in all its varied shades anger illwill aversion and resentmentThe Buddha saidThis stanza is of special significance to us in this nuclear era when the most appalling destructiveness has erupted all over the globePeace will never be achieved by meeting force with force bombs with bombs violence with retaliationMetta or lovingkindness is the only effective answer to violence and destructiveness whether by conventional weapons or nuclear missilesKaruna is the attitude conveyed by such terms as compassion sympathy pity and mercyIts basic characteristic is sympathy for all who suffer and it arouses a desire to relieve or remove the pain and suffering of othersKaruna helps to eliminate callousness and indifference to others woesIt is the direct antidote to cruelty another vice common in the world todayIt is compassion that prompts one to serve others selflessly expecting nothing not even gratitude in returnMudita is altruistic joy appreciative joy the desire to see others rejoicing in their happiness the ability to share the happiness and success of othersThis attitude is the complement of karuna while karuna shares the sorrow of others mudita shares their joyMudita is the direct antidote to envyEnvy arises over the good fortune of others it resents those who achieve position prestige power and successBut one who practices mudita will not only be happy when others do well but will try to promote their progress and welfareHence this attitude is of vital importance for achieving social concord and peaceUpekkha the last of the four sublime attitudes is equanimityUpekkha establishes an even or balanced mind in an unbalanced world with fluctuating fortunes and circumstances gain and loss fame and illrepute praise and blame pleasure and painUpekkha also looks upon all beings impartially as heirs to the results of their own actions without attachment or aversionUpekkha is the serene neutrality of the one who knowsThe constant methodical and deliberate cultivation of these sublime virtues in everyday life transforms the attitudes and outlook of the practitionerThey should be the foundation of all Buddhist social action as well as of individual and collective peace and harmonyBuddhist social welfare work may take many forms but what is most essential is the spirit in which it is performedThis spirit should be marked by the subordination of the private good to the good of the wholeFor Buddhist social work to be of real value action should spring from genuine love sympathy and understanding for ones fellow humans guided by knowledge and trainingWelfare work should be the perfect expression of compassion untouched by condescension washed clean of pride  even of the pride of doing goodIt should be a sheer manifestation of the brotherhood of all human beingsThe four sublime attitudes should be diligently cultivated with unremitting effort by every true follower of the MasterThese qualities never become obsoleteThey convey a universal message which transforms us into universal human beingsMind occupies the preeminent place in Buddhism for everything that one says or does first arises in the mind as a thoughtTo have a welltrained mind is indeed to possess a treasureWhen a person trains the mind turns inward to examine and cleanse his own mind he will find therein a vast storehouse of happinessReal happiness is a quality of the mind which has to be sought and found in the mindThe Buddha teaches that nonattachment to worldly pleasures is a greater happiness than the enjoyment of worldly pleasuresNibbana is the highest happiness the happiness of relief from suffering and from repeated birth and this happiness is only to be attained by freeing the mind from its defilementsThe misguided worldling thinks otherwiseIn his view the enjoyment of sensual pleasures is the only real happinessHe forgets however that sensual happiness arises merely from the gratification of desire and thus that this happiness must fade when the desired object is obtainedNor will the multiplication of desires make sensual pleasure permanent for there is no permanence in the passingThe pursuit of sensual pleasures ends only in restlessness and dissatisfactionThe aim of Buddhist mental culture is to gain direct intuitive knowledge of the real nature of existence by systematic training of the mind through meditationThis practice issues in detachment and thus frees the mind from its delusionsMeditation leads the mind from the painladen things of the world to the sorrowless transcendent state of deliverance NibbanaThe basic cause of rebirth and suffering is ignorance of the true nature of lifeWe consider what is passing unsatisfactory and empty to be permanent a source of true happiness and substantialThis delusion sustains the craving for more existence and leads to the accumulation of kammaMeditation is designed to lead stepbystep to the dissolution of these delusions and thereby to freedom from the grip of cravingThere are two kinds of meditation recognized in Buddhism the development of tranquillity which emphasizes concentration and the development of insight which emphasizes wisdomThese two types of meditation respectively correspond to the second and third groups of the Noble Eightfold Path the concentration group and the wisdom groupConcentration means onepointedness of the mind the ability to fix the mind on a single object to the exclusion of all elseConcentration is not an end in itself but to be developed primarily because it is the basis for wisdom the ability to see things exactly as they areIt is this wisdom that frees the mind from bondageTo train the mind is not at all easy for the mind has long been accustomed to flow in the channels of greed hatred and delusion through ages we have relished sense pleasures raged with anger wallowed in torpor fidgeted restlessly and vacillated with doubtSuch habits are indeed difficult to breakMoreover it is the very nature of the untrained mind to wander from one idea to anotherThus when the meditator sits down to begin the practice strange thoughts may dance before his mindTo overcome these disturbances the Buddha has taught five methods of expelling distracting thoughtsAt the outset meditation will be a continual effort to pull the mind back whenever it strays from the subject of meditationIt will seem impossible to focus the attention on the selected subject for more than a few seconds at a stretchWith continued practice however one will refine ones skills until one can keep the mind focused steadily and calmly on the chosen topic for increasingly longer periodsThen the practice becomes more engaging more rewarding and also less tiringEventually ones efforts will culminate in onepointedness of mind samadhiWith the attainment of the onepointed mind the meditator turns this pure steady clear mind to the contemplation of existence itselfThis marks the beginning of vipassanabhavana the meditative development of insightThe meditator mindfully investigates his own compound of the five aggregates He sees that the body or form is made up of changing physical qualities while mind itself consists of fleeting mental factors feeling perception mental formations and consciousnessHe sees that these all occur in mutual dependence all in a flowThere is no substantial self no immortal soul within them to be called I or mine As the impermanence the unsatisfactoriness and the selfless nature of the five aggregates become manifest to the meditator he realizes that nothing conditioned is worth clinging to for everything conditioned is fleeting and in the fleeting it is impossible to find stable happinessThis is pañña wisdom the third and final stage in the Noble Eightfold PathWith the development of wisdom ignorance ceases in all its forms and shadesCraving and kamma the fuel for the flame of becoming is exhausted and no more fresh fuel is suppliedHence the flame of existence burns out for lack of fuelWhen such a person who has reached the goal passes away he no longer takes rebirth in any realm of becomingHe has attained Nibbana the DeathlessMindfulness of breathing is an excellent subject of meditation particularly useful to the busy layperson as it can be practiced safely by anyone anywhere at any timeTo practice this type of meditation one should first adopt a seated meditation postureThose who can sit comfortably in full lotus or halflotus posture may adopt those positions those who find this difficult may assume any crosslegged sitting posture that enables them to hold upright the upper part of the body those who find even this difficult may sit on a straightbacked chairThe torso should be held erect but not stiff the hands should be placed one over the other on the lap and the feet should rest on the floorThe meditator should then breathe calmly and naturally mentally following the whole breath in and out without a break in attentivenessAt the outset one should simply breathe in and out without reflecting about itOne may fix the attention on the nostrils or upper lip wherever the breath is felt most distinctly as one breathes in and outThere the attention should remainAs one proceeds with the observation of the breath one becomes more and more deeply concentrated upon itOne then feels light in body and mind very calm and peaceful one may even feel as if one were floating in the airWhen strong calm is established and the mind becomes onepointed one may then turn ones attention towards the development of insight aiming to gain direct insight into the true nature of existenceThis type of meditation when successful leads by stages to the realization of NibbanaApart from its ultimate benefits mindfulness of breathing has an immediate value that can be seen in ones daily lifeIt promotes detachment and objectivityIt allows one the mental distance needed to arrive at wise decisions in the countless difficulties of daily lifeRegular practice of this meditation brings increased concentration and selfcontrol improved mindfulness and is also conducive to healthy and relaxed livingDeath is the only absolutely certain thing in life yet how many of us plan for it and prepare ourselves adequately in advance to face it calmlyAll human beings must dieThe body disintegrates breaks apart and turns to ashes and dustThe only thing we own that remains with us beyond death is our kamma our intentional deedsOur deeds continue bringing into being a new form of life until all craving is extinguishedWe are born and evolve according to the quality of our kammaGood deeds will produce a good rebirth bad deeds a bad rebirthThe materialistic view that a human being is merely a biological result of the union of sperm and ovum which utterly terminates in death is inadequate as a total explanation of human lifeNature and nurture heredity and the environment cannot by themselves explain for example why twins born of the same parents physically almost identical enjoying equal privileges brought up in the same environment often exhibit widely different characteristics mental moral and emotionalMoreover science would meet difficulties accounting for the existence of infant prodigies and the recollection of past lives particularly by childrenA realistic Buddhist knowing that death is inevitable plans for it and trains himself to face it with equanimityHe also knows that the best way to plan for death is to lead a virtuous and upright lifeThus the devoted Buddhist regularly observes the Five Precepts performs many kind and generous acts and endeavors to lessen his greed and hateThe fact that one has led a blameless life will be an added solace and source of strength at deathThe fear of death then loses its force and stingIn preparing for death a householder should fulfill his obligations to his family to others and to his religionIn practice this means leaving behind a sufficient income for ones family making out a proper last will planning ones own funeral arrangements and providing funds for the maintenance of virtuous and learned monks who observe the rules of discipline and who can preach the correct DhammaThe Buddha teaches his lay followers as well as the monks and nuns that they should often reflect on the inevitability of death Death is certain life is uncertainThese words are a clarion call reminding us of the need to put our own house in order morally and philosophically without delay and to face each day as if it were our lastThe world of today would indeed be a happier and safer place to live if people the world over would only pay heed to this callThe preceding sections of this essay will help the Buddhist lay follower to understand from a practical angle the main points of the Buddhas teachings as they bear on the conduct of daily lifeConstant practice of these principles will ensure that they are built into his character enabling him to develop into a wellrounded human being a center of sanity in a confused world adrift in fashionable philosophies full of empty promisesAt the very minimum a lay follower of the Buddha must keep the Five Precepts which enables him to develop virtue in regard to his bodily and verbal behaviorBut one should not stop with thisOne who seeks the true perfection of happiness must also attend to the cultivation of the mindOne must be mindful of the arising of unwholesome states such as greed anger and delusion and know how to deal with them effectively when they threaten to throw one off balanceOne should proceed even further and attempt to cultivate the mind systematically through the practice of meditation for tranquillity and insightThe society in which we live is a reflection of the minds of the human beings who have created that societyIf our society has become corrupt rife with immorality and destructive of the higher potentials of human nature that is because the people who comprise that society have allowed themselves to drift into corrupt and immoral states of mindThe quality of a society inevitably rests on the quality of the lives led by the persons who make up that societyOne single individual may not be able to change the whole society for the betterBut each one of us can at any rate transform the world of our own mindHow is this to be doneBy observing the Five Precepts flawlessly by being as mindful as possible in everyday life by cleansing the mind of its blemishes by cultivating the four sublime states by meditating energetically every day by listening to discourses on the Dhamma and clarifying ones doubts about the teachingBy following these guidelines one is sure to reap their fruits peace of mind contentment the absence of inner conflicts even in the midst of our confusing and chaotic worldA good Buddhist should ever seek the opportunity to do deeds of mercy kindness and charityHe should be keen on helping those less fortunate than himselfWhen practicing giving however one should give with discrimination as the Buddha advises viceyya danam databbamThus the most needy will be benefited with the things they need mostA good Buddhist should set apart a few minutes every day to review the days happenings and to see whether or not he has strayed from the Masters teachingsIf so he should inquire why he has done so in order to avoid a future repetitionMethodical reading on the Dhamma will also help one to put the whole of life into the right perspectiveIt is a useful habit to read daily an inspiring discourse of the Buddha such as the MahaMangala Sutta or to recite some verses of the Dhammapada and reflect for a few moments on their relevance to ones own lifeDoing so will help one to forget ones trifling worries and troubles to clarify ones thinking and to recall the ultimate values and truths upon which one should build ones lifeThe Buddhas teachings consist of virtue concentration and wisdomOnly with their practice will the BuddhaDhamma flourish when they are neglected the BuddhaDhamma will declineThis fact should always be remembered by those who are anxious to avert the decline and disappearance of the SasanaAs religion withers the world over more and more attention is paid to empty rites rituals and ceremonies while little or no attention is paid to the actual practice of the principles of religion as they bear on real lifeIt is this however that matters mostBy following the above guidelines a good Buddhist will grow in all aspects of the DhammaThese guidelines will help to mold ones whole personality to instil the true principles of the Dhamma into ones understanding to train the emotions and to discipline the willDoing so will conduce to the ultimate best interest of oneself and help one to make ones life a blessing for others as wellRobert Bogoda was born in in Colombo the business capital of Sri LankaHis secondary education was cut short by the sudden demise of his father which compelled him to work at a modest job as a teacherWhile engaged in teaching he obtained by self study the BScand MScdegrees from the University of London specializing in Social AdministrationNow retired he pursues his interests in Buddhism and social welfareThe essay A Simple Guide to Life was written against this backgroundThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseAtamJapanese time on August th a USplane dropped a bomb named Little Boy over the center of the city of HiroshimaThe total number of people who were killed immediately and in the following months was probably close toSome claim that this bomb and the one which fell on Nagasaki ended the war quickly and saved American and Japanese lives  a consequentialist theory to justify horrific violence against innocent civiliansOthers say the newly developed weapons had to be tested as a matter of necessityHiroshima and Nagasaki ushered in a new ageHumankinds tendency towards conflict and violence can now wipe out the entire human habitatThe weapon used on Hiroshima had a destructive force ofkilotons a contemporary cruise missile has the power of kilotonsAll war violence and conflict at national and international levels in the last quarter of the twentieth century has thus taken on sinister proportionsIt is not that human nature has changed but that the resources at our disposal haveNo country is free from the threat of nuclear annihilation no country is free from internal conflict and the barrel of the gunIt is against the urgency of this background that the teachings of Buddhism about violence must be studied and interpretedExcerpts such as the following have been extracted and used to sum up the Buddhist attitude to this issueThese verses would seem to indicate a clearly defined Buddhist perspectiveYet such text extraction can lead to misrepresentation if not undergirded with a strong supporting frameworkFurthermore if Buddhism has a message for a violent world it must do more than condemn violenceIt must be able to interpret its nature its roots its hold on the world and the possibilities for its transformationIt must dialogue with other philosophies and ideologies such as utilitarianism scientific socialism and the belief in a just or holy warFor instance utilitarianism still lives among those who believe that violence can be justified if more people will benefit than will be hurt and the consequentialist theory mentioned with reference to Hiroshima is similar to thisThen there are those who hold that certain forms of injustice and exploitation can only be destroyed through violence and that history will justify its legitimacyThe view that violent change is a historical inevitability is close to thisBuddhism must be able to comment on the stance which argues that if Hitler had been assassinated early in his career numerous deaths would have been avoided or the claim that force is justified against a government which is using violence against its people under the pretext of lawIf it cannot it will stand accused of irrelevanceIn this study I define violence as that which harms debases dehumanizes or brutalizes human beings animals or the natural world and the violent person as one who causes harm in speech or action either directly or indirectly or whose mind is filled with such thoughtsThe approach will be scriptural and the resource I use will be the Pali textsThe basic issue I investigate is what this resource says on the subject of violenceIdentity is not assumed between the sixth century Band the twentieth century ADRather the potential of the scriptures of any religion to provide guidelines for action and models for contemporary interpretation is recognizedHence the following specific questions will provide the framework for my studyFor what reasons do the texts condemn violence or call it into questionWhat do they see to be the roots of violenceDo the texts give any guidelines for the eradication of violence in the individual or in societyThe sermons of the Buddha as they have been handed down to us are replete with details about the contemporary realities of the timesThey reveal much about the social contexts within which the Buddha moved and the faces of society with which he was familiarThe Canki Sutta shows a brahman overlord insisting that the Buddha is equal to him in birth riches and the knowledge of the VedasHe continuesImportant here is the reference to kingsThe texts show clearly that the Buddha had an intimate knowledge of statecraftRecords of his conversations with Pasenadi and Bimbisara show him speaking in a language which those involved in government could understandPasenadi for instance comes through as a man torn between his duties as king involving some degree of ruthlessness and his concern for spiritual thingsAt one moment he is seen preparing a sacrifice in which many animals are to be slaughtered and menials beaten and at another speaking seriously with the Buddha about the dangers of wealth power and evil conductWhat is significant is the level of knowledge shown by the Buddha about the pressures on a king such as PasenadiHis use of similes and illustrations for instance appeals to Pasenadis experience including the central concern of all rulers at that time  defense against aggressionAt one point Pasenadi asks about the value of gifts and to whom a gift should be given for the gift to bear much fruitThe Buddha repliesThe Buddha thus uses similes from Pasenadis military world to indicate that virtue does not depend on birth but on qualities of characterIn fact in a number of texts illustrations drawn from the context of the state defense and martial arts can be foundNot only does the Buddha make use of military metaphors but the texts show that he had extensive knowledge of the strategies of war punishment and political patronageThe Mahadukkhakkhandha Sutta for instance uses graphic description to show that war and conflict spring from sensual desiresAnd again monks when sense pleasures are the cause having taken sword and shield having girded on bow and quiver they leap on to the newly daubed ramparts and arrows are hurled and knives are hurled and swords are flashingThose who wound with arrows and wound with knives and pour boiling cowdung over them and crush them with the portcullis and decapitate them with their swords these suffer dying then and pain like unto dyingIn the next part of the sutta a variety of horrific punishments are described and a keen awareness of their nature is seenIn another sermon handed down to us two men are pointed out while the Buddha is talking to a headman PataliyaOne of them is garlanded and wellgroomed the other is tightly bound about to lose his headWe are told that the same deed has been committed by bothThe difference is that the former has killed the foe of the king and has been rewarded for it whilst the latter was the kings enemyHence it is stressed that the laws of the state are not impartial they can mete out punishment or patronage according to the wish of the king and his cravings for revenge or securityIt cannot be argued that the Buddha was ignorant of the political realities of his dayHe spurned frivolous talk about such things as affairs of state but he was neither indifferent to them nor uninformedOn the contrary his concern for the human predicament made him acutely aware of the potential for violence within the economic and political forces around himThe political milieu of rival republics and monarchies in northern India forms a backdrop to his teaching whether the rivalries between the kingdoms of Kosala and Magadha or the struggles of the republics to maintain their traditions and their independence in the face of the rising monarchiesHowever the violence attached to politics and statecraft forms one section only of the picture which emerges from the textsViolence is detected in the brahmanical sacrificial system in the austerities practiced by some wanderers and in the climate of philosophical dispute among the many sramana groupings as well as in the area of social discrimination and the economic orderReligion to take this first is seen as a cause of physical verbal and mental violenceThe violence inflicted through sacrifices is described thusIn contrast the sramana groupings within this period eschewed sacrificeDenying the authority of the Vedas and a realm of gods to be manipulated their emphasis was on renunciation the gaining of insight and philosophical debateNevertheless a form of violence was presentThe austerities practiced by some of those who came to the Buddha were worse than any enemy might inflict as punishmentThe Buddha himself confessed to having practiced them before his enlightenmentIn the MahaSaccaka and the Mahasihanada Suttas there is vivid description of the excesses undertakenTaken together the two suttas cover the complete range of contemporary Indian practices which included nakedness or the wearing of rags treebark fiber kusa grass wood shavings or human hair deprivation of food to the extent of existing on a single fruit or rice grain selfmortification through lying on thorns or exposing the body to extremes of heat and cold copying the habits of animals such as walking on all fours or eating similar foodIt was the Buddhas view that such practices were a form of violence although undertaken in the name of religion and truthseekingUndertaken also in the name of truth were verbal battles between different groups of wanderersThe Buddhas followers in fact were frequently at the receiving end of an aggressive campaign by other groups to ridicule their beliefsThe description of these incidents gives useful evidence of the prevailing atmosphereIn the Udumbarika Sihanada Sutta Nigrodha the Jain claimsIn the Kassapa Sihanada Sutta the Buddha speaks outViolence of state and violence in the name of religion were two faces of the Buddhas societyViolence within the economic order was anotherThe sixth century Bin India witnessed urbanization and commercial growthSavatthi Saketa Kosambhi Benares Rajagaha and Champa would have been some of the most important centers known to the Buddha who spent much time in urban environmentsAs Trevor Ling argues in his study The Buddha the growth of these cities spawned individualism and competition in response to changing economic patterns and social dislocationThe potentially violent tensions generated are reflected in the Buddhas teachings through such themes as the rightful gaining of wealth the place of service and work correct duties towards employees and the wise choosing of friendsFor instance a Samyutta Nikaya text contains a conversation between Rasiya the Headman and the BuddhaThe Buddha speaks out against those who gain wealth by unlawful means especially with violenceThen in the Sigalovada Sutta the Buddha outlines rights and duties for the different social relationships in societyAn employer is advised to assign work according to the strength of the employee supply food and wages tend workers in sickness share with them unusual delicacies grant them leaveThe same sutta comments on friendship and says that four foes in the likeness of friends should be avoided a rapacious person a man of words not deeds the flatterer and the fellowwasterThe study of what the Early Buddhist texts say about violence must be seen against this background of political violence and social changeThe empiricism of Early Buddhism also demands this  the Buddhas appeal to what is observed in society as a basis for evaluating the truth of his teachingsThe analysis of historical context calls into question whether any philosophy or thought system can have universal relevanceSince the human situation across the permutations of history is indeed subject to change the issue is a valid oneYet there is also a continuity in evolution such that parallels can be drawn between the forces at work in the sixth century Band those operating in the latter part of the twentieth centuryThe sixth century Bis not identical to the twentieth but neither is it completely differentThe teaching of Early Buddhism on violence therefore should not be used as if there were either identity or utter separatenessIn each new context and historical period there is a need for reinterpretation and reevaluationAt this point it is enough to stress that the texts reveal much about Indian society at the time of the Buddha and about the Buddhas own breadth of awarenessIt cannot be argued that he had no knowledge of the violence within his own society or that his words were divorced from the tensions around himOn the contrary their import drew urgency from contemporary observable realityCentral to Buddhisms approach to the analysis of social phenomena is the doctrine of paticca samuppada or dependent origination which can be expressed thusEvents and tendencies within the material world are interpreted from the standpoint of causalityPhenomena are conditionedBuddhism therefore calls for an analytical attitude in dealing with anything to do with human life including the question of violenceOne consequence which flows from this is that generalizations and statements based on categories of pure reason are suspectEvidence can be drawn from the suttas to show that the Buddha insisted on making discriminations when presented with dogmatically held viewsFor instance in the Subha Sutta Subha comes out with the view that a householder is accomplishing the right path and one who has renounced is notThe Buddha replies On this point brahman youth I discriminate on this point I do not speak definitely He stresses that both householder and the one who has renounced can be living wrongly both can be living rightlyThe deciding factor is not the label but rightness of action speech and thoughtA similar approach can be seen in the Esukari Sutta where the Buddha speaks about serviceIn this case the deciding factor as to whether a person should serve is whether the one who serves is better for the service in terms of such things as growing in moral habit and wisdomThen when faced with the question of sacrifice by the brahman Ujjaya there is again discrimination according to conditionNot every sacrifice is blameworthyWhere living creatures are not killed or where the sacrifice is an offering for the welfare of the family there is no blame No brahman I do not praise every sacrificeYet I would not withhold praise from every sacrifice The deciding factor here is the presence of suffering for animalsPaticca samuppada opposes the human tendency to generalize and encourages analysis on the basis of empirical data and moral values applied to theseIt criticizes standpoints which use inappropriate categories through insufficient observation and dogmatic statements about right and wrong which do not take empirically observed facts into accountTo understand Early Buddhisms analysis of violence this conditionality is importantWhen the Buddha speaks about the causes and the remedies of violence his approach is dependent on the conditions prevalent in a particular situationFor instance psychological factors are not emphasized when the Buddha is speaking to those in power about societal disruption social and economic causes are stressed insteadYet in other contexts particularly when monks are addressed it is the psychological factor which is given prominenceIn contrast again with King Pasenadi the Buddha does not condemn violence in defense of the realm but places it within the larger context of impermanence and death to encourage reflectionIt is possible to hold together the above divergent emphases if we bear in mind the full implications of conditionality and the empiricism of Early BuddhismWe should not expect dogmatic nonempirical generalizationsFor instance if craving is to be posited as the root of much violence it would not follow that every situation was conditioned by tanha in the same way or that the remedy in each situation would be identicalLikewise it would not follow that what was incumbent on one type of person in one situation would be incumbent on all sections of society in all contextsBefore looking more closely at what is said about the roots of violence it is worth drawing out reasons given in the texts for the avoidance questioning or nonespousal of violenceInterconnected frameworks emerge nibbana as the goal of the spiritual life the demands of metta and karuna the need for peace concord and harmony within societySince the ultimate goal of the spiritual path for the Buddhist is nibbana attitudes towards violence must first be seen in relation to itNibbana is the ultimate eradication of dukkhaIt is a possible goal within this life and among other things involves a complete detoxification of the mind from greed hatred and delusion a revolution in the way the world is perceived freedom from craving and liberation from the delusion of egoThe Therigatha or Songs of the Sisters contain some of the most moving testimonies to this reality they are paeans of joy about liberationNibbana and samsara are antitheticalOne is the ceasing of the otherIn the context of the goal of nibbana actions thoughts and words can be evaluated as to whether they build samsara or lead to nibbana whether they are unskilled or skilledIndulgence in violence is normally deemed akusalaIn other words it cannot lead to the goal of nibbanaIn the AmbalatthikaRahulovada Sutta the Buddha says to the Venerable RahulaHarm to others is central to what is unskilledIn the Sallekha Sutta advice is given to monks about the cleansing of the mind as the basis of spiritual progressForemost among the thoughts which have to be cleansed are those connected with harming and violence both represent unskilled states which lead downwardsWhen the Buddha is in conversation with Bhaddiya sarambha is added to lobha dosa and moha as a defilement which flows from themSarambha can be translated as accompanied by violence As the mind filled with lobha dosa and moha is led to actions which are akusala so is the mind filled with the violence which accompanies the triadAll lead to a persons lossThe point of the above suttas is that violent action and violent thought actions which harm and debase others and thoughts which contemplate the same stand in the way of spiritual growth and the selfconquest which leads to the goal of existenceIn this respect indulging in violence is doing to oneself what an enemy would wishIt is a form of selfharmingIn contrast abstaining from violence has personal benefit in the present and in the futureIt is part of the training of mind and body which lays the foundation for spiritual progressThe accusation has been made that the application of the terms kusala and akusala are oriented only towards an individualistic goal making the motivation for abstention from violence a selfish oneBut it can be argued that the distinction between altruism and egoism breaks down for anyone truly following the Noble Eightfold PathThere are also many textual references to the inherent importance of harmony justice and compassion in society to balance those passages which seem to be solely individualisticHarmony and justice are recognized as worthwhile in themselves as well as a prerequisite for the spiritual progress of societys membersHence in society violence is to be eschewed because it brings pain to beings with similar feelings to oneselfOn the level of personal analogy men and women are to condemn violenceIt is an analogy which demands metta and karuna of the human beingThey call on a frame of mind which cannot remain insensitive to suffering in others or untouched by the agony produced by violenceNonviolence therefore arises through the urge to prevent anguish in othersThe Buddha however did not credit all people with this level of awarenessHe is recorded as saying that shame and fear of blame protect the world and if there were not these forces the world would come to confusion and promiscuityNot all beings rally to the call for compassion on the grounds that others have like feelings to themselves or that harmony in society is necessaryTherefore some texts invoke the concepts of heaven and hell rewards and punishments to control violenceVivid pictures are drawn of the agonies of hellEven so monks that anguish and dejection that man experiences while he is being stabbed with three hundred spears compared with the anguish of Niraya Hell does not count it does not amount even to an infinitesimal fraction of it it cannot even be compared to itMonks the guardians of Niraya Hell subject him to what is called the fivefold pinionThey drive a redhot iron stake through each hand and each foot and a redhot iron stake through his breastThereat he feels feelings that are painful sharp and severeBut he does not do his time until he makes an end of that evil deedHere selfinterest in terms of avoidance of future pain is appealed to as a reason to desist from violenceThis emphasis can also be seen in the Petavatthu in which those fallen to the realm of the petas speak to those on the human level about the reasons for their sufferingFalsehood failing in the duties of wife or husband stinginess and fraud are some of the actions mentionedStory No however speaks of a deerhunter who explains that he was a ruthless man of bloody hands Among harmless creatures I with wicked mind walked about very ruthless ever finding delight in slaying others unrestrained he declares in verse threeHis punishment is to be devoured by dogs during the daytime the hours when he used to be involved in slaughterHe is able to teach the living that the First Precept should be kept and that it applies not only to the killing of human beings but also to animalsThe deerhunter therefore is held up as an authoritative witness to what happens to violent individualsHis story is useful as a deterrent to socially disruptive elements and is confirmation of the importance Buddhism places on nonviolence within the social fabricThe threat of future punishment is used to control potentially violent elementsTwo broad interconnected areas therefore emerge in the reasons for the condemnation of violence within the Early Buddhist textsFirstly thoughts of violence and violent action are defilements and must be eradicated if nibbana is to be reachedIn this light nibbana is the highest ethical goodThis stress alone however can lead to distortion if nibbana is seen as a metaphysical state above the empirical world and the path to it as divorced from societyEarly Buddhism was rooted in the empiricalViolence was to be repudiated because it caused anguish to men and women and disruption in societyThe human person was seen as preciousHarming a being who desired happiness and felt pain could rarely be rightIf a society was to be established in which people could live without fear and with the freedom of mind to follow the Eightfold Path violence had to be eschewedThe question of political defensive violence however must be mentioned hereCan violence be justified in a situation where the state needs to defend its citizens against external and internal threatsIs this a situation in which violence is not condemnedThe texts suggest Buddhism would here insist on discriminationThe Cakkavatti Sihanada Sutta gives this advice to the righteous kingThis passage implies that the need for an army and consequently for the use of force in defense is accepted as a worldly necessityBut the picture which emerges is not glorification of the just war but an appeal for war and violence to be seen against a higher set of valuesRelevant perspectives on these political realities are seen in the Buddhas advice to the Vajjians and to King PasenadiThe Vajjians are faced with vicious aggression from King Ajatasattu King of Magadha who is bent on destroying themThe latter sends a brahman to the Buddha for advice and a prediction about how successful he will be in warThe very fact that he does so shows that he does not consider the Buddha either illinformed or dismissive of such political conflictsThe reply he receives is significantThe Buddha does not refer directly to Ajatasattu but implies that the use of arms against a people who are morally pure and in concord would be fruitlessHis words to Ajatasattu become words of advice to the Vajjians that they should meet together in concord and give respect to their elders their ancient institutions their traditions and their womenNo mention is made of the Vajjian military strength only of their moral strengthMoral strength is held up as defense against violenceYet it is not denied but implicitly understood that the Vajjians would have to use force to repulse aggression and also present is an implicit condemnation of Ajatasattus intentionsKing Pasenadi is also seen in conflict with Ajatasattu meeting force with forceAt first Ajatasattu is the aggressor and the victorThe reported response of the Buddha is significantThus Pasenadis role as defender of the nation against aggression is accepted as necessary and praiseworthyIn the next battle Pasenadi is the victorAjatasattus army is confiscated but Pasenadi is merciful enough to grant Ajatasattu his lifeIt is still Ajatasattu who is condemnedHis fate is seen in kammic termsIn one respect Pasenadi becomes an instrument of kamma for AjatasattuAt another level acceptance of political realities emergesThe king has a duty to protect his citizens from external threats of violenceTherefore the advice given to a king or those with responsibility for government about reacting to the violence of others is fitted to the situation a situation in which the use of violence may become a political necessity in a world governed by cravingYet even with affairs of state war is placed in the perspective of a more important set of valuesTo Pasenadi burdened by responsibility the Buddha saysWar is not presented as worthy of praise in itselfIt is recognized that battle cannot take place without hatred and the wish to kill in both the mind of aggressor and victimA Samyutta Nikaya passage illustrates thisA fighting man comes to the Buddha and explains his belief that the warrior who is killed whilst fighting energetically in battle is reborn in the company of the Devas of Passionate DelightThe Buddhas answer condemns this idea as pervertedA warrior is always led by the idea Let those beings be exterminated so that they may be never thought to have existed Such a view can only lead downwards rather than to any heavenly worldThe Buddha thus rejects any glorification of war since there can be no glory when the mind is dominated by hateAnother duty of the state is to punishPunishment although a harming of creatures and a cause of pain to them is nevertheless seen as a social necessity because of the need to protect society from the greater violence which would flow from undeterred greedFear of punishment is described in vivid terms with the mention of specific punishmentsA man sees them and thinks If I were to do such deeds as those for which the rajahs seize a bandit a miscreant and so treat him they would surely treat me in like manner Important here is the fact that Early Buddhism would make discriminations about the question of punishmentAs a deterrent punishment has valueMeted out as an expression of hate it is to be rejectedInflicted where social justice is the requisite it is also condemned as seen in the Kutadanta Sutta referred to in the next partThe Attadanda Sutta of the Sutta Nipata is the voice of someone overcome by despair because of the violence he seesSeeing people struggling like fish writhing in shallow water with enmity against one another I became afraidAt one time I had wanted to find some place where I could take shelter but I never saw such a placeThere is nothing in this world that is solid at base and not a part of it that is changelessI had seen them all trapped in mutual conflict and that is why I had felt so repelledBut then I noticed something buried deep in their heartsIt was  I could just make it out  a dartThe above is from a translation of the Sutta Nipata which attempts to preserve the spirit of the text rather than the letterHere it is the spirit of dismay and fear leading to discovery which is of prime importanceThe speaker detects a common root  the dart of craving and greed  a view directly in line with the Four Noble TruthsViolence arises because the right nourishment is presentHowever it has been pointed out earlier that differences may exist in the way in which tanha conditions situations of violenceOn analysis two broad and mutually interdependent areas emerge violence arising from an individuals maladjustment and craving and violence arising from unsatisfactory social and environmental conditions caused by the craving of othersThe latter can be taken first with reference to the following texts The Kutadanta Sutta the Cakkavatti Sihanada Sutta and certain Anguttara Nikaya passagesThe first weaves a myth within a mythThe inner myth tells the story of a king King WideRealm whose land is wracked with discontent and crime such that people are afraid to walk in the streets for fear of violenceThe kings solution is to hold a sacrifice for the nation and he goes to a holy man for adviceBut the king is not given what he expectsThe sage tells the king that fines bonds and death for the wrongdoers would be selfdefeatingPunishment is not the right pathOn the contrary it would increase the malady because the root causes remained untouched in this instance economic injustice and povertyKing WideRealm is advised to give food and seed corn to farmers capital to traders and food to those in government serviceThe above analysis recognizes that men and women can be pushed to violence if the prevailing conditions do not enable them to preserve their own lives without itThe instinct to survive is credited with enough strength to push people to struggle before they will sink into needIn such a situation it follows that to press down the hand of the law will not be effectiveIn fact it could encourage a growth in serious crimeThis is what happens in the Cakkavatti Sihanada Sutta another mythological story dealing with disruption in societyIt has already been mentioned with reference to the duty of kingshipBut there is one clause concerning his duty that has not yet been mentioned Throughout your kingdom let no wrongdoing prevailAnd whosoever in your kingdom is poor to him let wealth be given The kings of the story who keep to this are blessed with peaceYet a king eventually arises who neglects the giving of wealth to the poorHe is soon faced with a situation beyond his controlPoverty becomes rampant and this leads to theft since people would rather steal than dieWhen the king realizes the cause he starts by being lenient on the wrongdoer by giving him the means to liveSuch kindness too late leads others to see the only way to survive is turning to theft and receiving a royal handout in returnThe king has given charity not justice and crime increases leading to a return to brutal punishmentsThe brutality of the punishments encourages the people to be more extreme in their own crime as they try to survivePunishment here fails to deter because of the desperation of the peopleThe sutta presents a disturbing picture of how a society can fall into utter confusion because of a lack of economic justiceThe extremes reached are far greater than anything envisaged in the Kutadanta Sutta and they stem from the states blindness to the realities of povertyThus the sutta states in refrain after every deteriorationTheft and killing lead to false speech jealousy adultery incest and perverted lust untilAmong such humans brethren there will arise a swordperiod of seven days during which they will look on each other as wild beasts sharp swords will appear ready to their hands and they thinking This is a wild beast this is a wild beast will with their swords deprive each other of lifeIn the Cakkavatti Sihanada Sutta the nourishment of the violence is the states neglect of the poorThe whole myth illustrates the principle of paticca samuppadaEach state of degeneration is dependent on the state before itAn evolutionary process is seenAn inevitability seems to emerge an inevitable movement towards bestialityIt is significant that the sutta does not concentrate on the psychological state of the peopleThe obsessive cravings which overtake them are traced back to the failure of the state rather than to failings in their own adjustment to realityThe root is the defilement in the state  the raga dosa and moha in the king which afflict his perception of his dutyAn Anguttara Nikaya passage states this principle in simple and direct termsIf the king is righteous his ministers will be righteous the country will be righteous and the natural world will be a friend rather than an enemyThe opposite of course is also true and is placed first in the suttaThe above passages show that a change of heart is needed where violence exists but this change is needed in those who wield power in societyWhen a state is corrupt the citizens become victims of the state and their own wish to survive and they are then led to actions they would never consider if they were free from wantThere is an understanding that besides those who do evil there exists a category of people to whom wrong is done and whose reactions are conditioned by the original wrongdoingTo pass now to the psychological roots of violence another myth can be cited the Aggañña SuttaLike the Cakkavatti Sihanada Sutta it describes an evolutionary process which takes on its own momentumThe root of the process is significant  the craving of beingsThe sutta explains in myth form the process by which undifferentiated beings come to earth from a World of Radiance to eat the earths savory crust to the point where there is private property and the division of laborOne of its purposes is to challenge the static nonevolutionary theory of a divinely ordained caste system but it is significant also because evolution is guided by the growth of craving and individualismThe whole sutta turns on the individual and his craving as the root of violenceIt depicts a situation before state power is establishedCraving first enters when the beings taste the crust of the earthThe craving developsThe natural world evolves to accommodate the beings becoming ever less easy to manageThe bodies of the beings become gross and individually differentiated into male and female comely and unlovelyJealousy and competition enterThe savory crust disappearsVegetables and plant life evolveAn important point is reached when the beings establish boundaries around their individually owned rice plotsIndividualism is therefore institutionally consolidated and the consequence is violenceThe sutta illustrates that tanha coupled with individualism nourishes violence and conditions the necessity for state power to curb excessesAs such its teaching is directly in the mainstream of Buddhist thought craving and grasping lie at the root of negative and unwholesome states in societyHowever more needs to be said about the causes and consequences of individualismThe term puthujjana is used to describe the ordinary average personThe term puthu has two main meanings several many numerous on one hand and separate individual on the otherThe usual definition of puthujjana is one of the many folk linking it with the first of the abovementioned meaningsHowever a case can be made for the second meaning alsoIn this analysis the puthujjana is one who believes himself to be separate from the rest of humankind one who believes he has a self to be protected promoted and pamperedIt is this assumption which leads to so much that is disruptive in societyViolent tendencies link at this point with the defilement of moha delusion in terms of a misunderstanding of anicca and anattaThe latter states that there is no abiding unchanging substance within the human beingMen and women are verbs rather than nouns causal processes rather than unchanging soulsBuddhism does not deny that there is a person but it reformulates the definition of what constitutes a person to embrace continuity rather than static entityAs the sound of the lute cannot be found within the lute as it is taken apart so the I am cannot be found in the human personality when it is dissected into the five khandhasMuch anger and violence stem from the felt need to defend what is seen to be ones own or to grasp personal gainIt is a need which sees the gain of others as a threat to personal power and the rights of others as an attack on personal prestigeThis is none other than the fault of the puthujjana a failure to see the truth of anatta and the interdependence of all phenomenaIt is this failure which leads to the self becoming the touchstone and measuring rule for every perception and judgmentIt is the failure which leads to the urge to be violent in defense of needs and seeming rightsThe Aggañña Sutta shows this ego illusion manifesting itself in the form of competitive individualismThat the ego illusion and tanha feed on one another is a theme found in many textsMonks when there is the thought I am  there come to be the thoughts I am in this world I am thus I am otherwise I am not eternal I am eternal Should I beShould I be in this worldShould I be thusShould I be otherwiseMay I becomeMay I become in this worldMay I become thusMay I become otherwiseI shall becomeI shall become otherwise These are the eighteen thoughts which are haunted by craving concerning the inner selfOne result of this interdependent feeding the Buddhist texts assert is disruption in societyAnother important area of study is the mechanism through which the I notion helps to generate unwholesome statesBuddhism sees a danger in the view of some schools of psychology that there is a creative use of the concept of selfIn this respect the Pali term papañca commonly translated as proliferation is importantThe Madhupindika Sutta declares papañca to be the root of taking up weapons and the defeat of papañca is the way to end such violenceAs the previous analysis in this paper points out discrimination is central to the Buddhist approach and therefore generalizations such as the above need to be studied carefullyThere is no doubt however that papañca is central to a Buddhist psychology of violence and to an understanding of the danger in the I am notionA study by Bhikkhu Nanananda Concept and Reality gives extensive coverage to the term papañcaHe puts forward the view that it is linked with the final stage of sense cognition and that it signifies a a spreading out a proliferation in the realm of concepts a tendency for the conceptual process to run riot and obscure the true reality of thingsHe makes much use of the abovequoted Madhupindika Sutta and quotes the followingThe same is said of the other sensesNanananda points out that a grammatical analysis of the above reveals that the process of perception involves deliberate activity up until papañcetiAfter this deliberation vanishesThe subject becomes the objectThe person who reasons conceptually becomes the victim of his own perceptions and thought constructionsSo Nanananda writesHis analysis is of immense significance to the study of how certain negative and destructive tendencies can grow in society how objective perception and reason can seem to fade before the force of what might be irrational and obsessiveHe roots the cause in the nature of language in the minds of persons governed by tanha mana and ditthi  craving conceit and views  which in themselves flow from egoconsciousnessPapañca according to this analysis manifests itself through tanha mana and ditthiIt underlies each of these qualities and breeds conflict in societyTo look at the process in more detail The conventions of language enter near the beginning of the process of sense perception at the point where feeling gives rise to mental activity and conceptsThe mind if unchecked will attempt to place order on its feelings through languageThis language immediately introduces the duality of subject and object subject and feelingThe I enters with I feel aversion or I feel attraction or I like this or I dont like this This emphasis on the I is predetermined by the very nature of language and reinforces the strength of the feeling and the tendency for the person to identify completely with what is feltWhat seems to happen after that is that language takes on a dynamism of its ownConcepts proliferate and leave the empirical behind under the driving force of tanha mana and ditthiFor instance the observation I feel aversion might lead to further thoughts such asThus the entrance of I leads to the urge to protect the wishes of the ego and what is egobased becomes a seemingly rational decision about dutyThe above is a purely hypothetical progression yet it is not an implausible oneIt illustrates the way in which thought progresses further and further away from what is empirically observedSpeculation enters as the mind attempts to reasonEventually as the thought process develops further what might appear to be reason cloaks obsession which in turn can make the person a victim of the apparent logic of languageKant in his Critique of Pure Reason seems to adopt a similar point of viewHe challenged the view that speculative metaphysics using the categories of pure reason could extend our knowledge of realityHe attacked particularly those theologians who believed that the existence of God could be proved through logic aloneThere was he claimed an irresistible impulse of the mind towards seeking unification and synthesis which led to the illegitimate use of languageIt is this which is particularly relevant to this studyFor instance he posited that the mind assumed an unconditional personal ego just because all representations were unified by the I think constructionIt also assumed a concept of God because of the drive to find an unconditioned unitySuch concepts Kant felt arose through the impulse of the mind and passed beyond the legitimate purview of languageIt passed beyond the perceptions which could add knowledge and were not based on truly empirical dataTherefore they could not give statements with any factual realityKant grasped that there was an irresistible impulse which led to concepts taking on an unwarranted life of their ownBuddhism says that these concepts can generate obsessions victimize the person who believes he or she is thinking logically and lead to disruption in societyWhat is lost in the process is the ability to see objectively and value the empirical through senses unclouded by craving conceit and views or by greed hatred and delusionPapañca fed and generated by tanha is therefore central to the theme of violence in the thoughts and actions of human beingsBuddhism suggests that the human person can become the victim of obsessive actions thoughts and inclinationsIt holds that the drift towards violence within one person or within society especially if a communal or cultural obsession has arisen may become an inevitable causal process unless the inner mechanism is discoveredRelated to this is the danger and motivating force of dogmatic and speculative views as one of the roots of violence  the ditthi connected in the above analysis with papañcaIn his advice to the Kalamas and to Bhaddiya the Buddha saidHere logic and inference are deemed to be as dangerous as what is passed on by doubtful report and traditionThe same approach is seen in the Brahmajala Sutta where a number of mistaken views according to Buddhist analysis are discussedTanha is seen as the root of these but logic and inference are also mentionedIn the following the question of conflict in relation to dogmatic views is more clearly expressedThe Buddha points out the danger of saying This is indeed the truth all else is falsehoodFor dispute is the result and If there is dispute there is contention if there is contention there is trouble if there is trouble there is vexation Adhering dogmatically to views is a form of papañca a particularly dangerous formSeveral suttas in the Sutta Nipata take up this theme the Pasura Sutta and the Kalahavivada Sutta for instanceThe former speaks of the person who goes forth roaring looking for a rival to contest with filled with pride and arrogance over his theoriesA battlelike situation is implied an attitude closely allied to that which actually results in warfare and armed struggleContemporary struggles in the world give ample evidence to prove that war and struggle are caused by the conflict of ideas ideologies and conceptsThey show how powerful and charismatic a force ideas can beWhether it is nationalism ethnicity or religion groups can be pushed towards violence in defense of themBuddhist analysis points out that some ideologies which might appear logical could in fact be the fruit of papañcaAdherents may be convinced of their truth but they might have progressed far from analysis based on empirical dataIn the above analysis of the roots of violence two broad areas have been studied the external and the internal the environmental and psychologicalYet the two are not separateThey interconnect and feed one another just as external sense objects interconnect with the senses giving rise to consciousness and psychological processesIf a peoples environment is unhealthy corrupt or unjust the seeds are sown for violent resistance through the growth of motivating ideologies which take on a life of their own as they grip the minds of those who are being oppressedIf the environment is excessively competitive consumeroriented and materialistic tanha will quickly arise develop and expand into obsessive patterns of greed taking over and dominating the perception of people who find themselves victims of craving rather than masters of their own perceptual processesThe step to violence is then smallIf other elements are present such as a group without access to the wealth visible in others discrimination against minorities or racism then the drive towards violence will be more rapidThere is an optimism at the heart of BuddhismThe Four Noble Truths and paticca samuppada present a doctrine of hope because they affirm change and evolutionMen and women are not pawns of fate chance or a capricious metaphysical beingThey can be makers of their own futureApplied to the issue of violence and disruption this means that violence within the individual and in society is not intransigent although the Buddhist texts make it quite clear that the obstacles to transformation are largeBuddhism has no concept of a worldly utopiaSamsara is samsara characterized by dukkhaNibbana is a victory over samsara not a destruction of samsaraThe doctrine of anicca in fact undermines any dream of a golden future or a straight road of development towards harmony and peaceYet the worth of working for conditions for concord is never deniedThe important questions which emerge are How feasible is the lessening of violent tendencies in societyCan changes in the individual affect society as a wholeWhen there is violence inherent in the structures of society what steps can be takenTo take the possibility for change within the individual first certain passages from the texts suggest that the Buddha had rather a low opinion of the puthujjana and his or her ability to changeVerse of the Dhammapada readsHis sermons show that he recognizes that reaching people set on material things with a new message is difficult because their perception and ability to hear has been conditioned by the pattern of their cravingA bad man monks is possessed of bad states of mind he consorts with bad men he thinks as do bad men he advises as do bad men he speaks as do bad men he acts as do bad men he has the views of bad men he gives gifts as do bad menAnd how monks does a bad man act as do bad menAs to this monks a bad man is one to make onslaught on creatures to take what has not been given to enjoy himself wronglyIn one passage a prince Prince Jayasena is pictured in conversation with a novice monk who speaks about aloofness and onepointedness of mindOn the evidence given the prince declares such an achievement to be impossibleConfused the novice goes to the Buddha who says that such direct teaching could not possibly have been understood by one of such a lifestyle as the princeThe above passages might seem to imply the reverse of hope on the very same ground as hope was confirmed in the introduction to this section  paticca samuppadaIf perception is conditioned by a persons lifestyle the friends he or she chooses and greed for material objects then appreciation of another set of values will not arise from that nourishmentSuch an argument would seem to be realistic given the framework of conditionalityHowever this realism must be balanced with instances in the texts where change does take place in the lives of individualsThe case of Angulimala is one of the best known and most frequently quotedAngulimala is a multiple murderer the terror of SavatthiHe is described as having depopulated villages and districts through his urge to killThe Angulimala Sutta describes the storyThe Buddha ignoring the fear of the people sets out by himself toward where Angulimala is said to beAngulimala on seeing him decides to give him the same fate as others who had dared to walk the roadsHowever at this point the Buddha uses a technique which slaps Angulimala so hard that he gains sudden insight into the futility of the path he had been takingThe Buddha uses his psychic power to ensure that Angulimala cannot catch up with him however much effort he appliesThis opens up the opportunity for the question of walking and standing still to be raisedAngulimala is forced into the realization that his life has been a futile chase a fretful searching without peace or fulfillmentThe tranquillity of the Buddha contrasts sharply with his own turbulence and the destructive state of his mindThe contrast makes him see the nature of his mindA revolution  in its true sense of a complete turning around  takes placeAngulimala the murderer becomes a completely changed personHe asks the Buddha for ordination as a monk and soon becomes an arahant a saintSome interpretations have attempted to explain this in terms of a form of grace coming from the Buddha to the murdererNo doubt the person of the Buddha had a profound effect on the manThe sheer contrast between the states of mind and consequent physical appearance and bearing of the two would have shaped the eventYet it is perhaps more helpful to think of Angulimala as being ready to change ready to face what he was doing to his lifeThe Buddhas words acted as a sudden jolt to shock him into realization and changeA similar transformation can be seen at the end of the Cakkavatti Sihanada Sutta mentioned earlier when bestiality has overtaken society to the point that a reaction takes placeAt the point when beings think of one another as wild beasts some begin to thinkThe depth of barbarism causes a reversal a disgust with the nourishment on which violent thoughts were feedingSomething new seems to enter but it is nevertheless part of the ongoing causal processThe important point is that there can be a stage at which the unwholesome is recognized as such by those who are perpetrating itThe process through which those who followed the Buddha saw the household life as a fetter a state in which it was difficult to avoid greed materialism and competitiveness to a certain extent parallels thisThat it is possible for people to change accords with human experienceIt is also worth going back to the advice given to the novice who had tried to instruct Prince JayasenaThe story does not end with the Buddhas words about the impossibility of reaching the mind of the princeAn alternative method is stressed  gradual trainingThe Buddha explains that the prince might have understood if told that the process of understanding was gradualThe simile of the training of an elephant is used At first the elephant is brought from the forest into the open he is addressed with kindly words and fed then tasks are given to him progressing from the simple to the more complex up to the point where the animal can endure blows of the sword and the din of war without flinchingThe stress on a gradual process of change and training beginning with moral habit stretches like a thread across the Buddhist textsThere is a firm belief that discipline education and the taking of one step at a time can lead people from a state of relative ignorance to greater wisdomThe possibility of gradual change must be admitted alongside the sudden change of AngulimalaThe two are complementaryIn the Kevaddha Sutta Kevaddha a young householder comes to the Buddha and pleads with him to perform a mystic wonderThe Buddha names three wonders of which he has knowledge the mystic the wonder of manifestation and the wonder of educationThe first two are to be feared and abhorredIt was the latter which was to be praised as the most worthy  the wonder of educationChange through a gradual process is therefore deemed possible but it is also recognized as something of a wonder given the strength of craving and graspingEvidence that groups of both lay and ordained people were following the gradual training comes from the Mahaparinibbana SuttaThe sutta speaks of the fourfold society being a reality  the fourfold society as composed of monks nuns laymen and laywomenMara is seen to approach the Buddha urging him to die because the task he had set himself earlier had been completedIn the above description both lay and ordained are described with the same adjectivesLay people as well as ordained are credited with considerable knowledgeThere are grounds of hope here since the first stage of gradual training is morality the foundation of which is the Five PreceptsAll of these are linked with abstaining from different forms of violence direct and indirect killing theft the exploitation of women the violence connected with speech violence to oneself through the use of drugsThe Early Buddhist texts are replete with exhortations to keep the preceptsHeaven and hell bliss and torture are held up and paeans of praise are given to those who follow themThere are examples however of lay people going beyond moralityPessa the son of an elephant trainer claimsPessa receives the recognition and praise of the Buddha for thisIt is significant that mindfulness is crucial in halting the flow of mind in halting papañca as described earlier and the violent thoughts which might consequently flowThe key to mindfulness is the development of the ability to stand aside detached from what is happening to the body to feeling to thought processes and mental objects so that ever arising and passing movement feelings and thoughts are carefully chartedIt is an approach which recognizes both anicca and anatta anicca because what is attended to is seen as an everchanging process anatta because the elements of the process are not assumed to belong to the person and therefore are not clung to as unchanging truthsMindfulness in fact can stop the mind before obsessions based on tanha mana and ditthi can growGuarding the doors of the senses is one form of practice of mindfulness frequently mentioned as the second step in the gradual trainingThe traditional way of describing this isThe same is said of the other sense organsA guard is placed at the point where contact between the sense and the sense object results in feelingKnowledge of how the mind works is gainedMindfulness is thus an antidote to papañca and stops the mechanism through which papañca developsIt demands effort and disciplineThe texts show that such mindculture is possible and suggest that it would lead to the lessening of violence as an expression of personal greedThe example of the Sangha the Order of Monks must also be looked atNo compromises were made concerning violence when it came to the monkThe Sangha was intended to be a model of harmonious interpersonal relationshipsIt was to provide an alternative set of values to lay people to present a pattern of sharing rather than of competitive individualismIf the Sangha had been able to carry out successfully this role a disturbing challenge would have been presented to the communities among which the monks walkedThe Kakacupama Sutta is one of the best examples of the extent to which violent retaliation was condemned for the monkThe key sentence repeated many times speaks of the attitude to be cultivated in the face of abuse or violenceWhat is significant is the extent to which this is to be takenThe Punnovada Sutta describes a monk who took this teaching to heartHe intends to travel to a district where the people are known to be hostileThe Buddha questions him about how he will deal with abuse and violencePossibilities are mentioned increasing each time in intensity from verbal abuse to loss of lifeAfter each one Punna responds by saying that he would be thankful that the abuse was not even more seriousWhen the Buddha finally mentions murder he saysHe is said to have made a thousand followers suggesting that his attitude became a true inspiration to a people who were characterized by violenceIn contrast to the above there are examples of monks presenting a harmful example to lay peopleAs the Sangha grew in number and in reputation the initial enthusiasm of the first disciples became diffusedEvidence in suttas such as the Bhaddali Sutta the Kakacupama Sutta the Kitagiri Sutta and the Anumana Sutta shows that there were forces of deteriorationSome monks were difficult to exhort some were rebellious towards the rules some were incapable of taking correction from othersIn this way their ability to provide an example to lay people would have been weakenedYet it would be wrong to place too much emphasis on this weaknessOther suttas can be quoted to show what an impact the Buddhas followers had on other groups of wanderers and even on kingsThe important point here is that hope for change in the Early Buddhist texts also lies in the Sangha as example and educatorLay people were encouraged to show devotion to the Sangha and to listen to its teachingAs outlined above there is evidence that there was a body of lay people who were very serious in their striving to undertake the precepts and to train their mind so that tanha could be reducedThat change in the individual is possible is confirmed by a study of the early followersThe above picture combines hope with realismThe obstacles mentioned at the beginning of the section must not be overlooked the barriers to change are greatAccording to Buddhism the average person will often need the threat of punishment either in the present or in a future life to be deterred from socially disruptive activitiesIt has also been pointed out that it is not enough to concentrate on the individualA society is more than the sum of its individualsJust as the human person is such because of the specific relationship between the five khandhas so a society takes on its character because of the way in which its parts are organized through institutions traditions and external influencesThe next question which must be looked at is how the individual can affect society as a whole or more exactly what the consequences are when a person follows the gradual training of BuddhismAs with the other questions raised the method of this paper is to discover what the texts say to uncover the guidelines or resources they provide for the analysis of contemporary issuesIn a previous section it was suggested that one of the causes of violence was the proliferation of concepts and ideas flowing from the perceptual process when governed by tanha mana and ditthiIs the answer then a retreat into silence and inaction away from all conceptsThe evidence suggests notThe Buddha was quick to condemn any inference that he taught a doctrine of either inaction or apathyOne example will illustrate thisThe Buddha is seen in conversation with a person called PotaliyaPotaliya declares that the most worthy person is the one who speaks neither in dispraise of what deserves not praise nor in praise of the praiseworthyHe advocates what would seem a complete withdrawal from judgment and a supreme detachment from the issues governing societyAnd the term Potaliya uses to describe the frame of mind he is talking about is upekkha  equanimityThe Buddha however disagrees with himFar better is the person of discrimination who speaks in dispraise of the unworthy and in praise of the praiseworthy saying seasonably what is factual and the truthIn other words he challenges the view that upekkha means the quality Potaliya advocatesThe Buddha puts forward another qualityThe Buddha mentions the quality of kalaññuta in place of the word used by Potaliya  upekkhaThe translation given by the Pali Text Society is discrimination of proper occasions The ability to discriminate and make objective evaluations not indifference is the consequence of curbing papañcaA certain silence of the mind is indicated but it is not the silence of apathyThe proliferation of concepts which is papañca results in an obscuring of the empirical since this proliferation moves one further and further away from the empirical because of the linguistic edifice of therefore and therein erected on top of the initial emotion of like or aversionPreventing the erection of this edifice on the foundation of tanha leads to a clearer perception of the empirical and to judgments and analyses being made with greater validityThe conclusions reached through papañca may seem to be analyticalThey are notResisting papañca is not a moving away from analysis but a moving towards objective analysis unclouded by emotional responsesIt is this kind of analysis which is so often lacking when there is violence and conflict in societyWhen perceptions judgments and consequent action are governed by the roots of papañca there will be no objectivity but a danger that obsessions will growWhen papañca is allayed what is good and bad kusala and akusala praiseworthy and blameworthy will be more clearly visibleThe injustices in society for instance will be more apparentJudgments about those who are oppressed in society or about those who gain wealth illegally through violence and extortion will not be clouded either by the tendency to look down on those who suffer or the wish to gain patronage from the wealthyWhat is wrong and what is right what harms and what promotes happiness will stand out untouched by personal wishes or personal greedThis clarity of judgment can be seen in the words of the BuddhaIn the Assalayana Sutta the Aggañña Sutta and the Madhura Sutta the caste system is vigorously opposedThe Esukari Sutta condemns the kind of service which becomes slaveryMeaningless ritual is attacked in the Sigalovada SuttaBrahmanical excesses are uncovered in the Brahmajala Sutta the Ambattha Sutta and the Tevijja SuttaThe violence and shame of sacrifices is condemned in the Kutadanta SuttaThese are not the only examplesThe Buddha is revealed as a person who was unafraid to point out wrong when he saw it and to use uncompromising wordsIt is this kind of effective speech and action which should flow when tanha mana and ditthi are reducedAbstention from the harmful or violent is not enough by itselfThe texts stress that the active cultivation of the opposite is necessaryA replacement is needed as well as an annihilationThis is seen at lay level as well as among the ordainedFor instance in the Saleyyaka Sutta addressed specifically to lay people the two courses of faring by Dhamma and notDhamma are explainedMalevolence is explained by reference to the wish to killFaring by Dhamma is explained in opposite terms and yet the effect is not merely a negation of or a restraining from notDhamma but the practice of positive virtueSo the one who abandons slanderous speech becomes a reconciler of those who are at variance and one who combines those who are friends The one who restrains himself from malevolent thought is the one who thinks Let those beings friendly peaceful secure happy look after self Similarly during meditation positive qualities are to be cultivated to replace the five hindrancesFor instanceThe Early Buddhist emphasis therefore indicates that the eradication of the tendencies which cause violence leads to greater realism the growth of positive wholesome qualities and more effective speech and action against what is unjust and exploitativeAn important question however remains unanswered the third question mentioned at the beginning of this section When there is violence inherent in the structures of society as a whole what steps can be takenIn many societies violence is institutionalized in structures which oppress certain sections of the peopleSome would mention the caste system in India in this context corrupt trading practices or the forces which keep some groups of people poorOn the other hand violence can flow from the monarchy or state from internal terrorist groups or an outside threatIn these situations violence is rarely lessened by changes in a few individuals unless these individuals have considerable powerWhat strategies should be used to oppose such violenceIs there any situation where violence should be met with violenceIs there a different path for the lay person than for the monkIs there a situation where it might be justifiable to overthrow the stateIf so could this lead to a changed societyIf undeserved suffering occurs because of the greed of others do the demands of compassion ever involve what could be called violent resistance to the perpetratorsThese are crucial questions in the light of current world tensions such as racial injustice capitalistic monopolies terrorism and fascismThe question here is whether any guidelines can be gained from the Buddhist texts themselvesThere is no doubt that the person who renounces the household life is called to abstain from violence completelyIt is one of the hallmarks of the bhikkhuNot to react in violent retaliation to abuse was part of the training of the discipleWhere there was stateinstigated violence the Early Buddhist position seems to have been that the Sangha could act as advisers to rulers and in this capacity could raise issues connected with righteous government but it could not become involved in violent resistanceAs for the lay follower of the Buddha he or she undertakes to desist from harming others through the first preceptTo break this intentionally is to risk serious kammic consequencesFor the lay person as for the monk the approved line of action would seem to be advice and nonviolent pressure or resistance towards those in a position to change violent structuresA different set of responsibilities however is laid on the state itselfAs previously discussed rulers with the protection of their citizens at heart were inevitably drawn into conflict when threatened by aggressionThe question can therefore be raised as to whether nonviolence is an absolute value in BuddhismFor instance is a father as head and protector of the family justified in using violence against a person forcefully entering his house with the intention to killHas an elder sister the duty to protect a younger brother if he is attacked violently by using similar violenceHas a group of citizens the right to kill a dictator if by doing so they might save the lives of oppressed minorities to whom the citizens feel a dutyShould the terrorist gun be challenged with similar methodsThese are areas where absolutes seem to break downAs a ruler might realize that some aggressor cannot be deterred by persuasion so some citizens might feel that violence or injustice in society cannot be stopped merely by giving advice to those in powerThat lay people should never initiate violence where there is harmony or use it against the innocent is very clearThat they should not attempt to protect those under their care if the only way of doing so is to use defensive violence is not so clearGuidelines about the consequences of violence however are laid downThe danger of violence even if it is defensive is that it will generate further violenceNonhatred and loving kindness are the powers which halt itMetta is shown to have great power it can turn away the poison of a snake or the charge of an elephant it can render burning ghee harmlessThe latter story concerns a wife Uttara who is married to an unbelieverA courtesan Sirima is given to her husband so that Uttara can be released to attend on religious dutiesA quarrel arises between the two women which ends in Sirima pouring boiling ghee over UttaraAs she prepares to do this Uttara thinks My companion has done me a favorThe circle of the earth is too narrow the world of the devas is too low but the virtue of my compassion is great because by her help I have become able to give alms and listen to DhammaIf I am angry with her may this ghee burn me if not let it not burn me The ghee does not burnSirima tries againThen the other women present attack Sirima and throw her to the groundUttara continues to show compassion by coming to her rescue by preventing her from being hurtResponding to violence with metta and nonanger is deemed superior to any other pathNonviolent resistance is clearly the best pathYet Buddhism cannot claim to be completely pacifisticAbsolutes of that kind cannot be found and perhaps should not be sought for in a teaching which spoke of the danger of claiming of a view this alone is truth all else is falsehood The person who feels violence is justified to protect the lives of others has indeed to take the consequences into accountHe has to remember that he is risking grave consequences for himself in that his actions will inevitably bear fruitHe or she has to be aware that there is a dynamism within hatred and violence when the causal chain has not had its nourishment removedSuch a person needs to evaluate motives in the knowledge that violent tendencies are rooted in the defilements of lobha dosa and moha and in the obsessions generated by papañcaYet that person might still judge that the risks are worth facing to prevent a greater evilWhether the assassination of Hitler would have prevented numerous innocent deaths is still an open questionIn conclusion it can be said that Buddhism lays down a form of mental culture to lessen the minds tendency to veer towards violenceHowever it is a culture which involves qualities of faith and effort that many in society are unable to cultivateTherefore punishment either by the state or in an afterlife is seen as a valid deterrent for extremes of violenceHowever where violence flows directly and unjustifiably from the state or from other groups or institutions questions are raised which are not dealt with directly by the textsThe drawing of conclusions is therefore fraught with difficultyYet these questions must be tackled if Buddhism is to provide guidelines in a violent worldWhat seems to emerge from the above analysis is that nonviolence in the face of violence although preferable for all and incumbent on the monk is not a moral absolute in all circumstancesIt was claimed at the beginning that the advent of the nuclear bomb had issued in a new era of violence and that Buddhism should be able to address this developmentThe foregoing analysis started from a study of the Buddhas awareness of violence in his own society and passed to questions concerning the condemnation of violence the roots of violence and the possibilities for its eradication or reductionEach of these issues has relevance for the present age although it has been pointed out that many conditions have changed between the sixth century Band the twentieth century ADOne area in which difference can be seen is in the nature of warfareIn the Buddhas time professional armies were used to settle conflictsAlthough civilians were no doubt killed as victorious armies took their plunder it was the army itself which bore the brunt of the slaughterToday the cost in civilian animal and plant life in any future nuclear war is thinkable only in terms of the most horrific nightmareThe duty of the Cakkavatti King might be to defend his peopleYet no nuclear weapon can be used in defenseIf it was it would prove the Buddhist view that the use of violence leads to escalationThe slim evershaky defense that nuclear weapons provide is MAD  Mutually Assured Destruction  an uneasy computercontrolled peace feeding on fear and the willingness to annihilate millions in retaliation if the other side dares to be the aggressorIt would seem that in nuclear weapons man has created something out of his greed which now makes him victimThe analysis given earlier about the effects of papañca and the process of perception is relevant hereSome people might see the development of ever more sophisticated weapons of destruction as the result of objective scientific probing into the nature of reality in this case the use of the atomAn approach more in accordance with Buddhism would be to see the root as tanha mana and ditthi the craving for power over the material world and over other people the wish to protect self and judge other groups as inferior the clinging to one ideology whilst condemning all othersThe result of tanha mana and ditthi is papañca the proliferation of ideas which turn the socalled perceiver into the victim of obsessions bearing little relation to the empiricalNuclear and chemical weapons are horrific projections of the human mindIt has come to the point where they possess the mind rather than the mind the weaponsHumanity is now the victimWithin this atmosphere one may ask how effective change in the individual is and whether the few who work to conquer tanha mana and ditthi can act as leaven within the wholeThe obstacles are great today as they were in the Buddhas timeThe Buddha saw the puthujjana as a person hard to convince or change given the strength of craving and viewsToday ideas have a charismatic forceNationalism ethnicity and religion for instance push groups towards violenceThey form egofeeding identitycreating creeds which are hard to break downIn such situations empirical evidence shows that some who try to show the alternative force of metta become the victims of violence at least in the frame of their present lifeTwo insights from the foregoing study are relevant here the reaction which took place in the Cakkavatti Sihanada Sutta and the interdependent nature of the environmental and the psychologicalIn the Cakkavatti Sihanada Sutta the truth that violence leads to greater violence and crime to everdeepening bestiality eventually pierces the consciousness of some members of society as they see what is happening around themSome realize that change is possible through a change in thought patternsA reaction takes place after the trough of bestiality has been reachedToday there are those who are turning around who are realizing how destructive and bestial is the present and potential violence in the worldHowever for just as long as the external environment remains tensioncreating the rise of violent tendencies will continueSimilar injustices exist today as are mentioned in the Kutadanta Sutta but their scope has altered and widened to include relationships between blocks of countries as well as within countriesIn most countries of the world the poor are becoming poorerBetween countries the richer nations are becoming richer at the expense of the poorerThe warning which the Buddhist texts give is that such conditions breed violence and that the arm of the law or the gun will not curb itOnly change at the level of the root causes will create more peaceful conditionsThis is one of the gravest challenges which the world faces since it points to a complete redrawing of the world economic systemThe formidable obstacle in the way of such change is tanha in those with power or economic might  for profit influence and a luxurious lifestyleOne reaction of the individual to the above tension is complete withdrawal into a life of inactionThis was evidently a temptation in the sixth century BIt has been a temptation across all religions throughout the centuriesThe mistake is to confuse renunciation and inaction detachment and apathyThe life of renunciation aims at detachment from raga dosa and moha but the result should not be apathy but rather greater compassion and loving kindnessIn the Samanamandika Sutta a wanderer Uggahamana declares that the one who does no evil deed with his body speaks no evil speech intends no evil intention and leads no evil livelihood is the recluse who has obtained the most worthy endThe Buddha respondsIn contrast the Buddha lays down the importance of developing wholesome qualities not merely abstaining from what is unwholesomeThe demands of the Eightfold Path are stressed demands incumbent not only on the monk but on all followersIn a violent world therefore the duty of the Buddhist disciple is not inactive withdrawal or apathy but culture of the mind to root out personal defilements so that perception and judgment can be unbiased and objective cultivation of positive qualities which will create harmony and peace and most important a readiness to speak out and act against what is blameworthy and in praise of what is worthy of praiseTextual references have been taken from the Pali Text Societys editions of the NikayasUnless specified otherwise English translations have been taken from the PTS versions though some have been slightly alteredThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe original translations of the two suttas included in this booklet were made by VenBhikkhu anamoliThey are taken from his complete translation of the Majjhima Nikaya which I have edited and revised for publication by Wisdom Publications BostonThe numbers enclosed in square brackets are the page numbers of the Pali Text Society edition of the Pali textThe introductions and notes are my ownIn these the following abbreviations are employedBhikkhu BodhiAmong the hordes of animals that roam the wild whether the jungle the mountains or the plain the lion is universally recognized to be their chiefThe living embodiment of selfpossessed power he is the most regal in manner and deportment the mightiest the foremost with respect to speed courage and dominionThe expression of the lions supremacy is its roar  a roar which reduces to silence the cries howls bellows shrieks barks and growls of lesser creaturesWhen the lion steps forth from his den and sounds his roar all the other animals stop and listenOn such an occasion none dares even to sound its own cry let alone to come into the open and challenge the fearless unsurpassable roar of the goldenmaned king of beastsThe Buddhas discourses as found in the ancient Pali canon frequently draw their imagery from the rich and varied animal life of the luxuriant Indian jungleIt is thus not surprising that when the Buddha has occasion to refer to himself he chooses to represent himself as the stately lion and to describe his proclamation of the Dhamma bold and thunderous as a veritable lions roar in the spiritual domainThe Majjhima Nikaya the Collection of Middle Length Discourses contains two suttas which bear this metaphor in their titleThese two  Noand Noin the collection  are called respectively the Shorter Discourse on the Lions Roar and the Great Discourse on the Lions RoarThe variation in their titles signalled by the Pali words cula minor and maha great evidently refers at one level to their different lengths the one being four pages in the Pali the other sixteenAt another level these different designations may allude to the relative weight of the subject matter with which they deal the great discourse being a rare revelation by the Buddha of his exalted spiritual endowments and allencompassing knowledge which entitle him to roar his lions roar in the assemblies of human beings and godsStill both suttas as their controlling image suggests are of paramount importanceEach delivers in its own way an eloquent and inspiring testimony to the uniquely emancipating nature of the Buddhas Teaching and the peerless stature of the Teacher among the spiritual guides of humanityThe Pali Commentaries explain that there are two kinds of lions roar that of the Buddha himself and that of his disciplesThe former is sounded when the Buddha extols his own attainments or proclaims the potency of the doctrine he has realized the latter when accomplished disciples testify to their own achievement of the final goal the fruit of arahantshipViewed in the light of this distinction the Shorter Discourse on the Lions Roar exhibits a hybrid character being a sutta spoken by the Buddha to instruct his disciples how they should affirm in discussions with others who hold different convictions the singular greatness of the TeachingSectionThe Buddha opens the discourse by disclosing the content of this roarHe tells his monks that they can boldly declare that only here  ie in the Dispensation of the Enlightened One  is it possible to find true recluses of the first second third and fourth degreesThe expression recluse here refers elliptically to the four grades of noble disciples who have reached the stages of realization at which final deliverance from suffering is irrevocably assured the streamenterer the oncereturner the nonreturner and the arahantThe doctrines of others the Buddha says are devoid of true recluses of those who stand on these elevated planesIn order to understand this statement properly it is important to distinguish exactly what the words imply and what they do not implyThe words do not mean that other religions are destitute of persons of saintly statureSuch religions may well engender individuals who have attained to a high degree of spiritual purity  beings of noble character lofty virtue deep contemplative experience and rich endowment with love and compassionThese religions however would not be capable of giving rise to ariyan individuals those equipped with the penetrative wisdom that can cut through the bonds that fetter living beings to samsara the round of repeated birth and deathFor such wisdom can only be engendered on a basis of right view  the view of the three characteristics of all conditioned phenomena of dependent arising and of the Four Noble Truths  and that view is promulgated exclusively in the fold of the Buddhas DispensationAdmittedly this claim poses an unmistakable challenge to eclectic and universalist approaches to understanding the diversity of humankinds religious beliefs but it in no way implies a lack of tolerance or good willDuring the time of the Buddha himself in the Ganges Valley there thrived a whole panoply of religious teachings all of which proposed with a dazzling diversity of doctrines and practices to show seekers of truth the path to liberating knowledge and to spiritual perfectionIn his frequent meetings with uncommitted inquirers and with convinced followers of other creeds the Buddha displayed the most complete tolerance and gracious cordialityBut though he was always ready to allow each individual to form his or her own convictions without the least constraint or coercion he clearly did not subscribe to the universalist thesis that all religions teach essentially the same message nor did he allow that the attainment of final release from suffering Nibbana was accessible to those who stood outside the fold of his own DispensationWhile this position may seem narrow and parochial to many today when reaction against the presumptions of dogmatic religion has become so prevalent it is not maintained by the Buddha as a hidebound dogma or from motives of selfexalting pride but from a clear and accurate discernment of the precise conditions required for the attainment of deliveranceThe Buddhas statement on this issue emerges in at least two important passages in the Canon each of which reveals from a slightly different angle exactly what those conditions areOne is found in the Mahaparinibbana SuttaWhile the Buddha was lying between the twin sal trees on the eve of his demise a wandering ascetic named Subhadda came into his presence to resolve a doubt he wished to know whether or not the other great religious teachers contemporary with the Buddha who were regarded as saints by the multitude had actually attained spiritual realization as they claimed to have doneThe Buddha shifted the burden of the discussion away from a question aimed at assessing particular individuals and rephrased it in terms of a general evaluative principleHe declared In whatsoever Dhamma and Discipline the Noble Eightfold Path is not found there one cannot find true recluses of the four degrees of liberationBut in whatever Dhamma and Discipline the Noble Eightfold Path is found there one can find the four types of true recluses Then the Buddha imparted to Subhadda the information that was important for him to know In this Dhamma and Discipline the Noble Eightfold Path is found and in it alone are found also the true recluses of the four degreesOutside this Dispensation the four types of enlightened individuals are not to be foundThe doctrines of others are devoid of true recluses In this passage the thrust of the Buddhas explanation points to a particular method of practice as essential to the attainment of true realizationThat method of practice is the training in the Noble Eightfold Path and because this path in its fullness and perfection is unique to the Dispensation of a Fully Enlightened One it follows that persons who have reached the planes of deliverance are unique to his Dispensation as wellIn the Shorter Discourse on the Lions Roar the reason for the Buddhas exclusivistic claim does not focus upon practice but upon doctrine upon the understanding of the nature of reality that separates his own Dhamma from all other attempts to comprehend the human situationAs the argument unfolds the Buddha will show that the essential key to liberation the key that he alone makes available is the teaching of anatta of nonself or egolessness which is at the same time the boundary line that marks the difference between his own doctrine and the doctrines of other teachersSections After announcing the lions roar in Section in the next section the Buddha begins to construct an imaginary dialogue between the wanderers of other sects ie the proponents of the rival religious systems and his own ordained disciples the bhikkhusIn the first stage of the discussion the wanderers ask the bhikkhus about the grounds on which they advance their seemingly sweeping claimThe Buddha advises the monks that they should answer by mentioning four reasons that they have confidence in the Teacher they have confidence in his Teaching they have fulfilled the precepts of training and their coreligionists both monastic and lay live together in cordial harmonyThe wanderers however do not remain satisfied with this answer but join issue with the bhikkhus by pointing out that the four reasons that the Buddhists have offered are also found in their own sectsThus there seems to be no essential distinction between them that the bhikkhus can appeal to as the basis for their thesisSectionThe Buddha does not meet this challenge with a direct reply but instead approaches it via an indirect routeHe enters upon this route by first clarifying through questioning of the wanderers the criteria of a truly emancipating teachingAs a matter of mutual consensus both the bhikkhus and the wanderers agree that such a teaching must posit a goal that can be attained only by those who have achieved complete purification freedom from lust hate and delusion from craving and clinging from arbitrary prejudices and from the coils of proliferation ie thought constructions born of craving and groundless speculationAlthough the bhikkhus and the wanderers both agree on these criteria this does not suffice to establish that they are shared equally by the different spiritual systems nor does this imply that they are capable of being fulfilled regardless of the specific doctrine to which one subscribes or the discipline in which one trainsTo show again in an indirect manner that the outside systems are not capable of leading to final liberation the Buddha points out that there are two broad families of views diametrically opposed to each other under which the wide diversity of speculative systems can be subsumedThese two views are called in the sutta the view of being and the view of nonbeingThe view of being is identical with eternalism the positing of some eternal entity or spiritual principle ie a substantial self or soul as the essence of the individual and the positing of an eternal entity such as a creator God or metaphysical Absolute as the ground or source of the objective universeThe view of nonbeing is identical with annihilationism the repudiation of any principle of continuity beyond death and the denial of an objective transpersonal foundation for moralityWhile those who adhere to the former view do concur with the Buddhists in accepting the efficacy of spiritual practice their teachings according to the Buddha are not free of an erroneous grasp of actualityThey spring from a deep clinging to the notion of a permanent self which issues in an edifice of doctrine designed to substantiate that idea and guarantee the immortality of the imagined selfHence the Buddha traces this view to its root in the craving for being and he maintains that those who adopt such a view are for that very reason the victims even though unwittingly of craving and attachmentThe view of nonbeing on the other hand arises from an attitude of contempt towards existence and finds its root in the craving for nonbeingThe thinkers who adopt this view generally begin as the Buddha does by recognizing the pervasive nature of suffering but instead of pursuing this suffering back to its true causes they rush to an unwarranted extreme by declaring that the entire lifeprocess comes to an absolute end with the breakup of the body at death so that at death a being is annihilated and exists no more in any wayHaving isolated these two views and shown them in their mutual opposition the Buddha then states that any recluses or brahmans ie spiritual teachers who do not understand these views as they really are fail to measure up to the criteria of those who have achieved the final goalThey are still subject to lust hatred and delusion to craving and clinging etc and thus they cannot claim to be freed from the cycle of repeated birth and deathOnly those who have comprehended these views who see their dangers and have relinquished them are accessible to the right view that leads beyond all erroneous extremes and it is by the instrumentality of that view that they are capable of cutting off the defilements and arriving at release from the samsaric roundSections Even at this point however the Buddha has not yet explicitly shown that liberation from cyclic existence is an exclusive prerogative of his own DispensationHe has only left this conclusion as an inference for those who are already aware that his Dhamma makes known the middle way that transcends extremist viewsIn the present sequence however he will bring his argument to its conclusion by homing in on the crucial point that separates his own teaching from all other religious and philosophical systemsHe takes up this task by way of an examination of the mental activity of clingingHe states that there are four kinds of clinging clinging to sense pleasures clinging to speculative views regarding the self and the world clinging to rules and observances ie to external rules rituals and austerities in the belief that they lead to liberation and clinging to a doctrine of self ie to a view of a truly existent selfThe last type of clinging the subtlest and most elusive of the group is tantamount to what the texts refer to as personality view the view of a substantial self taken to be either identical in some way to the five aggregates that constitute the personality or to stand in some relationship to those aggregatesThe Buddha next points out that the recluses and brahmans who propose a path to liberation all declare that they propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging a phrase the commentary to the sutta glosses as meaning the overcoming of all kinds of clingingHowever the Buddha says in spite of this claim the other spiritual teachers recognize and attack only a limited number of the forms of clinging at best they might teach the overcoming of the first three forms of clingingWhat they cannot teach because they have not comprehended this for themselves is the overcoming of clinging to a doctrine of self and it is this fourth type of clinging that vitiates even the aspects of their teachings that are wholesome and praiseworthyBecause they perceive the dangers in the grosser types of clinging they might urge their disciples to relinquish them to give up sensuality dogmatism and ritualism and to cultivate in their place renunciation detachment and equanimityThereby they can enjoin their disciples to engage in virtuous courses of spiritual practice courses which have the potency to generate superior states of rebirth within the round of samsaraHowever what they have not discovered because of the insurmountable limits to their range of understanding is the buried root of the entire cycle of repeated existence which consists precisely in that adherence to the notion of selfFor this reason the Buddha maintains such a Dhamma and Discipline cannot show the way to the uprooting of the belief in self and he therefore concludes that it is unemancipating unconducive to peace  the final peace of NibbanaBeing taught by one who is not a Fully Enlightened Buddha such a system does not merit the confidence of those who can be satisfied with nothing less than complete release from all samsaric sufferingIn contrast to other spiritual teachers the Buddha continues he himself the Tathagata describes the full understanding of all kinds of clinging inclusive of the clinging to a doctrine of selfRecognizing the danger in views of self aware that all such views no matter how lofty are undermined by a fundamental cognitive error he proclaims a path that leads to the eradication of views of self in all their bewildering varietyHence the Buddha says his Dhamma and Discipline is truly emancipating truly capable of leading to final peace promulgated by a Fully Enlightened One the proper field of confidence for seekers of liberationSections In the final sections of the discourse the Buddha will validate his claim regarding the emancipating quality of his Dispensation by showing how a disciple who undertakes the practice of his teaching can reach the fruit of final deliveranceHe first takes up the four kinds of clinging the subject around which the preceding portion of the exposition revolved and connects this topic with another major principle of his doctrine dependent arisingBy applying the principle of dependent arising he traces clinging to its source in craving and then continuing this line of inquiry he pursues the entire sequence of conditional factors at the base of samsara back to its deepest and most pernicious root ignoranceIn the final paragraph he introduces a bhikkhu who arrives at the culmination of the path one who develops wisdom to the fullest extent abandons all ignorance and arouses the liberating knowledgeSuch a one no longer clings through any kind of clinging he has eradicated all four types of clinging including the clinging to a doctrine of self and with their eradication has attained the final goal the personal realization of Nibbana right in this very lifeThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThere he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus  Venerable sir they repliedThe Blessed One said thisBhikkhus only here is there a recluse only here a second recluse only here a third recluse only here a fourth recluseThe doctrines of others are devoid of recluses that is how you should rightly roar your lions roarIt is possible bhikkhus that wanderers of other sects might ask But on the strength of what or with the support of what do the venerable ones say thus Wanderers of other sects who ask thus may be answered in this way Friends four things have been declared to us by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened on seeing these in ourselves we say thus Only here is there a recluse only here a second recluse only here a third recluse only here a fourth recluseThe doctrines of others are devoid of recluses What are the fourWe have confidence in the Teacher we have confidence in the Dhamma we have fulfilled the precepts and our companions in the Dhamma are dear and agreeable to us whether they are layfolk or those gone forthThese are the four things declared to us by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened on seeing which in ourselves we say as we doIt is possible bhikkhus that wanderers of other sects might say thus Friends we too have confidence in the Teacher that is in our Teacher we too have confidence in the Dhamma that is in our Dhamma we too have fulfilled the precepts that is our precepts our companions in the Dhamma are dear and agreeable to us too whether they are layfolk or those gone forthWhat is the distinction here friends what is the variance what is the difference between you and usWanderers of other sects who ask thus may be answered in this way How then friends is the goal one or many Answering rightly the wanderers of other sects would answer thus Friends the goal is one not many  But friends is that goal for one affected by lust or free from lust Answering rightly the wanderers of other sects would answer thus Friends that goal is for one free from lust not for one affected by lust  But friends is that goal for one affected by hate or free from hate Answering rightly they would answer Friends that goal is for one free from hate not for one affected by hate  But friends is that goal for one affected by delusion or free from delusion Answering rightly they would answer Friends that goal is for one free from delusion not for one affected by delusion  But friends is that goal for one affected by craving or free from craving Answering rightly they would answer Friends that goal is for one free from craving not for one affected by craving  But friends is that goal for one affected by clinging or free from clinging Answering rightly they would answer Friends that goal is for one free from clinging not for one affected by clinging  But friends is that goal for one who has vision or for one without vision Answering rightly they would answer Friends that goal is for one with vision not for one without vision  But friends is that goal for one who favors and opposes or for one who does not favor and oppose Answering rightly they would answer Friends that goal is for one who does not favor and oppose not for one who favors and opposes  But friends is that goal for one who delights in and enjoys proliferation or for one who does not delight in and enjoy proliferation Answering rightly they would answer Friends that goal is for one who does not delight in and enjoy proliferation not for one who delights in and enjoys proliferationBhikkhus there are these two views the view of being and the view of nonbeingAny recluses or brahmans who rely on the view of being adopt the view of being accept the view of being are opposed to the view of nonbeingAny recluses or brahmans who rely on the view of nonbeing adopt the view of nonbeing accept the view of nonbeing are opposed to the view of beingAny recluses or brahmans who do not understand as they actually are the origin the disappearance the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of these two views are affected by lust affected by hate affected by delusion affected by craving affected by clinging without vision given to favoring and opposing and they delight in and enjoy proliferationThey are not freed from birth aging and death from sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair they are not freed from suffering I sayAny recluses or brahmans who understand as they actually are the origin the disappearance the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of these two views are without lust without hate without delusion without craving without clinging with vision not given to favoring and opposing and they do not delight in and enjoy proliferationThey are freed from birth aging and death from sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair they are freed from suffering I sayBhikkhus there are these four kinds of clingingWhat fourClinging to sensual pleasures clinging to views clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of selfThough certain recluses and brahmans claim to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging they do not completely describe the full understanding of all kinds of clingingThey describe the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures without describing the full understanding of clinging to views clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of selfWhy is thatThose good recluses and brahmans do not understand these three instances of clinging as they actually areTherefore though they claim to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging they describe only the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures without describing the full understanding of clinging to views clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of selfThough certain recluses and brahmans claim to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging they describe the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures and clinging to views without describing the full understanding of clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of selfWhy is thatThey do not understand two instances therefore they describe only the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures and clinging to views without describing the full understanding of clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of selfThough certain recluses and brahmans claim to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging they describe the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures clinging to views and clinging to rules and observances without describing the full understanding of clinging to a doctrine of selfThey do not understand one instance therefore they describe only the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures clinging to views and clinging to rules and observances without describing the full understanding of clinging to a doctrine of selfBhikkhus in such a Dhamma and Discipline as that it is plain that confidence in the Teacher is not rightly directed that confidence in the Dhamma is not rightly directed that fulfillment of the precepts is not rightly directed and that the affection among companions in the Dhamma is not rightly directedWhy is thatBecause that is how it is when the Dhamma and Discipline is badly proclaimed and badly expounded unemancipating unconducive to peace expounded by one who is not fully enlightenedBhikkhus when a Tathagata accomplished and fully enlightened claims to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging he completely describes the full understanding of all kinds of clinging he describes the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures clinging to views clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of selfBhikkhus in such a Dhamma and Discipline as that it is plain that confidence in the Teacher is rightly directed that confidence in the Dhamma is rightly directed that fulfillment of the precepts is rightly directed and that the affection among companions in the Dhamma is rightly directedWhy is thatBecause that is how it is when the Dhamma and Discipline is well proclaimed and well expounded emancipating conducive to peace expounded by one who is fully enlightenedNow these four kinds of clinging have what as their source what as their origin from what are they born and producedThese four kinds of clinging have craving as their source craving as their origin they are born and produced from cravingCraving

ignoranceBhikkhus when ignorance is abandoned and true knowledge has arisen in a bhikkhu then with the fading away of ignorance and the arising of true knowledge he no longer clings to sensual pleasures no longer clings to views no longer clings to rules and observances no longer clings to a doctrine of selfWhen he does not cling he is not agitatedWhen he is not agitated he personally attains NibbanaHe understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being That is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThe page numbers enclosed in square brackets in the above text are the page numbers of the Pali Text Society edition of the Pali textThe Mahasihanada Sutta the Great Discourse on the Lions Roar is a text of awesome scope and power one of those rare suttas in which the Buddha discloses the greatness and loftiness of his own spiritual endowmentsTowards the end of the sutta the Buddha says that he has reached his eightieth year which allows us to place the discourse in the final year of his lifeThus the sutta serves as a convenient summation of the exalted qualities that enabled the Buddha to function so effectively as teacher and spiritual guide through the fortyfive years of his missionIt is not typical of the Buddha to extol himself for he did not intend his Dispensation to evolve into a personality cult centered around himself as a charismatic and powerful leaderThroughout his ministry he constantly emphasized the primacy of his role as guide as the discoverer and proclaimer of the pathHis task is not to command reverence but to steer his disciples onto and along the path for it is only the practice of the path the cultivation of the training that can effect the deep interior purification by which one can reach the extinction of the defilements and liberation from sufferingHowever while the Buddha functions primarily as the revealer of the path confidence in him as the Supreme Teacher remains an essential element of the trainingIt is this confidence freshly arisen that induces the curious inquirer to cross the great divide that separates the admirer of the Dhamma from the practitioner and it is this same confidence that drives the aspirant forward until the task of selfcultivation has been completedFrequent reflection on the greatness of the Master inspires joy and courage sustaining ones commitment during those dark periods when prospects for progress appear bleak and desire and doubt  those twin conspirators  combine forces to attempt to persuade one of the futility of ones effortsHence in order to provide a spur to awaken and nurture the confidence necessary to tread the path through its downward turns as well as its ascents the Buddha on occasion offers us revelations of his Buddhagunas the excellent qualities of a Fully Enlightened One that entitle him to serve as the first of the Three Gems and Three RefugesOne of the most impressive of these rare disclosures is the Great Discourse on the Lions RoarSpoken as a rebuttal to the charges of a renegade disciple who in the midst of the populous city of Vesali had been denouncing the Buddha and attempting to dissuade others from following his teaching the sutta recapitulates the various distinguished qualities of the Blessed One with special emphasis upon his ten Tathagata powers and four intrepidities the sutta also affords us a glimpse of the demanding ordeal he underwent over many past aeons seeking the path to deliveranceWhen it was first spoken the sutta had such a powerful impact on one monk in the assembly that his bodily hairs stood on end and thus during an early period the sutta was known by the alternative title The Hairraising Discourse Even today centuries later the Great Discourse on the Lions Roar can continue to serve as a fecund source of inspirationThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living at Vesali in the grove outside the city to the westNow on that occasion Sunakkhatta son of the Licchavis had recently left this Dhamma and DisciplineHe was making this statement before the Vesali assembly The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesThe recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him and when he teaches the Dhamma to anyone it leads him when he practices it to the complete destruction of sufferingThen when it was morning the Venerable Sariputta dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Vesali for almsThen he heard Sunakkhatta son of the Licchavis making this statement before the Vesali assemblyWhen he had wandered for alms in Vesali and had returned from his almsround after his meal he went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one side and told the Blessed One what Sunakkhatta was sayingSariputta the misguided man Sunakkhatta is angry and his words are spoken out of angerThinking to discredit the Tathagata he actually praises him for it is a praise of the Tathagata to say of him When he teaches the Dhamma to anyone it leads him when he practices it to the complete destruction of sufferingSariputta this misguided man Sunakkhatta will never infer of me according to Dhamma That Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessedAnd he will never infer of me according to Dhamma That Blessed One enjoys the various kinds of supernormal power having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one he appears and vanishes he goes unhindered through a wall through an enclosure through a mountain as though through space he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water he walks on water without sinking as though it were earth seated crosslegged he travels in space like a bird with his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so powerful and mighty he wields bodily mastery even as far as the BrahmaworldAnd he will never infer of me according to Dhamma With the divine ear element which is purified and surpasses the human that Blessed One hears both kinds of sounds the heavenly and the human those that are far as well as nearAnd he will never infer of me according to Dhamma That Blessed One encompasses with his own mind the minds of other beings other personsHe understands a mind affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust he understands a mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate he understands a mind affected by delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion he understands a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted he understands an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted he understands a surpassed mind as surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed he understands a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated he understands a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberatedSariputta the Tathagata has these ten Tathagatas powers possessing which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of BrahmaWhat are the tenHere the Tathagata understands as it actually is the possible as possible and the impossible as impossibleAnd that is a Tathagatas power that the Tathagata has by virtue of which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of BrahmaAgain the Tathagata understands as it actually is the results of actions undertaken past future and present with possibilities and with causesThat too is a Tathagatas powerAgain the Tathagata understands as it actually is the ways leading to all destinationsThat too is a Tathagatas powerAgain the Tathagata understands as it actually is the world with its many and different elementsThat too is a Tathagatas powerAgain the Tathagata understands as it actually is how beings have different inclinationsThat too is a Tathagatas powerAgain the Tathagata understands as it actually is the disposition of the faculties of other beings other personsThat too is a Tathagatas powerAgain the Tathagata understands as it actually is the defilement the cleansing and the emergence in regard to the jhanas liberations concentrations and attainmentsThat too is a Tathagatas powerAgain the Tathagata recollects his manifold past lives that is one birth two births three births four births five births ten births twenty births thirty births forty births fifty births a hundred births a thousand births a hundred thousand births many aeons of worldcontraction many aeons of worldexpansion many aeons of worldcontraction and expansion There I was so named of such a clan with such an appearance such was my nutriment such my experience of pleasure and pain such my lifeterm and passing away from there I reappeared elsewhere and there too I was so named of such a clan with such an appearance such was my nutriment such my experience of pleasure and pain such my lifeterm and passing away from there I reappeared here Thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past livesThat too is a Tathagatas powerAgain with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human the Tathagata sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and he understands how beings pass on according to their actions thus These worthy beings who were illconducted in body speech and mind revilers of noble ones wrong in their views giving effect to wrong view in their actions on the dissolution of the body after death have reappeared in a state of deprivation in a bad destination in perdition even in hell but these worthy beings who were wellconducted in body speech and mind not revilers of noble ones right in their views giving effect to right view in their actions on the dissolution of the body after death have reappeared in a good destination even in the heavenly world Thus with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human he sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and he understands how beings pass on according to their actionsThat too is a Tathagatas powerAgain by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge the Tathagata here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taintsThat too is a Tathagatas power that a Tathagata has by virtue of which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of BrahmaThe Tathagata has these ten Tathagatas powers possessing which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of BrahmaSariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of me The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesThe recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him  unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as carried off and put there he will wind up in hellJust as a bhikkhu possessed of virtue concentration and wisdom would here and now enjoy final knowledge so it will happen in this case I say that unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as carried off and put there he will wind up in hellSariputta the Tathagata has these four kinds of intrepidity possessing which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of BrahmaWhat are the fourHere I see no ground on which any recluse or brahman or god or Mara or Brahma or anyone at all in the world could in accordance with the Dhamma accuse me thus While you claim full enlightenment you are not fully enlightened in regard to certain things And seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidityI see no ground on which any recluse or anyone at all could accuse me thus While you claim to have destroyed the taints these taints are undestroyed by you And seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidityI see no ground on which any recluse or anyone at all could accuse me thus Those things called obstructions by you are not able to obstruct one who engages in them And seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidityI see no ground on which any recluse or anyone at all could accuse me thus When you teach the Dhamma to someone it does not lead him when he practices it to the complete destruction of suffering And seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidityA Tathagata has these four kinds of intrepidity possessing which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of BrahmaSariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of me he will wind up in hellSariputta there are these eight assembliesWhat are the eightAn assembly of nobles an assembly of brahmans an assembly of householders an assembly of recluses an assembly of gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings an assembly of gods of the heaven of the Thirtythree an assembly of Maras retinue an assembly of BrahmasPossessing these four kinds of intrepidity the Tathagata approaches and enters these eight assembliesI recall having approached many hundred assemblies of nobles many hundred assemblies of brahmans many hundred assemblies of householders many hundred assemblies of recluses many hundred assemblies of gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings many hundred assemblies of gods of the heaven of the Thirtythree many hundred assemblies of Maras retinue many hundred assemblies of BrahmasAnd formerly I had sat with them there and talked with them and held conversations with them yet I see no ground for thinking that fear or timidity might come upon me thereAnd seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepiditySariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of me he will wind up in hellSariputta there are these four kinds of generationWhat are the fourEggborn generation wombborn generation moistureborn generation and spontaneous generationWhat is eggborn generationThere are these beings born by breaking out of the shell of an egg this is called eggborn generationWhat is wombborn generationThere are these beings born by breaking out from the caul this is called wombborn generationWhat is moistureborn generationThere are these beings born in a rotten fish in a rotten corpse in rotten dough in a cesspit or in a sewer this is called moistureborn generationWhat is spontaneous generationThere are gods and denizens of hell and certain human beings and some beings in the lower worlds this is called spontaneous generationThese are the four kinds of generationSariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of me he will wind up in hellSariputta there are these five destinationsWhat are the fiveHell the animal realm the realm of ghosts human beings and godsI understand hell and the path and way leading to hellAnd I also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hellI understand the animal realm and the path and way leading to the animal realmAnd I also understand how one who has entered this path will

understand how one who has entered this path will by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taintsBy encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell And then later on with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human I see that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell and is experiencing extremely painful racking piercing feelingsSuppose there were a charcoal pit deeper than a mans height full of glowing coals without flame or smoke and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same charcoal pitThen a man with good sight on seeing him would say This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that he will come to this same charcoal pit and then later on he sees that he has fallen into that charcoal pit and is experiencing extremely painful racking piercing feelingsSo too by encompassing mind with mind piercing feelingsBy encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in the animal realm And then later on with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human I see that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in the animal realm and is experiencing painful racking piercing feelingsSuppose there were a cesspit deeper than a mans height full of filth and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and

understand a certain person thus This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in the realm of ghosts And then later on I see that he has reappeared in the realm of ghosts and is experiencing much painful feelingSuppose there were a tree growing on uneven ground with scanty foliage casting a dappled shade and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same treeThen a man with good sight on seeing him would say This person so behaves that he will come to this same tree and then later on he sees that he is sitting or lying in the shade of that tree experiencing much painful feelingSo too by encompassing mind with mind much painful feelingBy encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear among human beings And then later on I see that he has reappeared among human beings and is experiencing much pleasant feelingSuppose there were a tree growing on even ground with thick foliage casting a deep shade and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same treeThen a man with good sight on seeing him would say This person so behaves that he will come to this same tree and then later on he sees that he is sitting or lying in the shade of that tree experiencing much pleasant feelingSo too by encompassing mind with mind much pleasant feeling By encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly world And then later on I see that he has reappeared in a happy destination in the heavenly world and is experiencing extremely pleasant feelingsSuppose there were a mansion and it had an upper chamber plastered within and without shut off secured by bars with shuttered windows and in it there was a couch spread with rugs blankets and sheets with a deerskin coverlet with a canopy as well as crimson pillows for both and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same mansionThen a man with good sight on seeing him would say This person so behaves that he will come to this same mansion and later on he sees that he is sitting or lying in that upper chamber in that mansion experiencing extremely pleasant feelingsSo too by encompassing mind with mind extremely pleasant feelingsBy encompassing

he here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints and is experiencing extremely pleasant feelingsSuppose there were a pond with clean agreeable cool water transparent with smooth banks delightful and nearby a dense wood and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed towards that same pondThen a man with good sight on seeing him would say This person so behaves that he will come to this same pond and then later on he sees that he has plunged into the pond bathed drunk and relieved all his distress fatigue and fever and has come out again and is sitting or lying in the wood experiencing extremely pleasant feelingsSo too by encompassing mind with mind extremely pleasant feelingsThese are the five destinationsSariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of me The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesThe recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him  unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as carried off and put there he will wind up in hellJust as a bhikkhu possessed of virtue concentration and wisdom would here and now enjoy final knowledge so it will happen in this case I say that unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as carried off and put there he will wind up in hellSariputta I recall having lived a holy life possessing four factorsI have practiced asceticism  the extreme of asceticism I have practiced coarseness  the extreme of coarseness I have practiced scrupulousness  the extreme of scrupulousness I have practiced seclusion  the extreme of seclusionSuch was my asceticism Sariputta that I went naked rejecting conventions licking my hands not coming when asked not stopping when asked I did not accept food brought or food specially made or an invitation to a meal I received nothing from a pot from a bowl across a threshold across a stick across a pestle from two eating together from a pregnant woman from a woman giving suck from a woman lying with a man from where food was advertised to be distributed from where a dog was waiting from where flies were buzzing I accepted no fish or meat I drank no liquor wine or fermented brewI kept to one house to one morsel I kept to two houses to two morsels I kept to seven houses to seven morselsI lived on one saucerful a day on two saucerfuls a day on seven saucerfuls a day I took food once a day once every two days once every seven days and so on up to once every fortnight I dwelt pursuing the practice of taking food at stated intervalsI was an eater of greens or millet or wild rice or hideparings or moss or ricebran or ricescum or sesamum flour or grass or cowdungI lived on forest roots and fruits I fed on fallen fruitsI clothed myself in hemp in hempmixed cloth in shrouds in refuse rags in tree bark in antelope hide in strips of antelope hide in kusagrass fabric in bark fabric in woodshavings fabric in headhair wool in animal wool in owls wingsI was one who pulled out hair and beard pursuing the practice of pulling out hair and beardI was one who stood continuously rejecting seatsI was one who squatted continuously devoted to maintaining the squatting positionI was one who used a mattress of spikes I made a mattress of spikes my bedI dwelt pursuing the practice of bathing in water three times daily including the eveningThus in such a variety of ways I dwelt pursuing the practice of tormenting and mortifying the bodySuch was my asceticismSuch was my coarseness Sariputta that just as the bole of a tinduka tree accumulating over the years cakes and flakes off so too dust and dirt accumulating over the years caked off my body and flaked offIt never occurred to me Oh let me rub this dust and dirt off with my hand or let another rub this dust and dirt off with his hand  it never occurred to me thusSuch was my coarsenessSuch was my scrupulousness Sariputta that I was always mindful in stepping forwards and stepping backwardsI was full of pity even for a drop of water thus Let me not hurt the tiny creatures in the crevices of the ground Such was my scrupulousnessSuch was my seclusion Sariputta that I would plunge into some forest and dwell thereAnd when I saw a cowherd or a shepherd or someone gathering grass or sticks or a woodsman I would flee from grove to grove from thicket to thicket from hollow to hollow from hillock to hillockWhy was thatSo that they should not see me or I see themJust as a forestbred deer on seeing human beings flees from grove to grove from thicket to thicket from hollow to hollow from hillock to hillock so too when I saw a cowherd or a shepherd Such was my seclusionI would go on all fours to the cowpens when the cattle had gone out and the cowherd had left them and I would feed on the dung of the young suckling calvesAs long as my own excrement and urine lasted I fed on my own excrement and urineSuch was my great distortion in feedingI would plunge into some aweinspiring grove and dwell there  a grove so aweinspiring that normally it would make a mans hair stand up if he were not free from lustWhen those cold wintry nights came during the eightdays interval of frost I would dwell by night in the open and by day in the groveIn the last month of the hot season I would dwell by day in the open and by night in the groveAnd there came to me spontaneously this stanza never heard beforeI would make my bed in a charnel ground with the bones of the dead for a pillowAnd cowherd boys came up and spat on me urinated on me threw dirt at me and poked sticks into my earsYet I do not recall that I ever aroused an evil mind against themSuch was my abiding in equanimitySariputta there are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through food They say Let us live on kolafruits and they eat kolafruits they eat kolafruit powder they drink kolafruit water and they make many kinds of kolafruit concoctionsNow I recall having eaten a single kolafruit a daySariputta you may think that the kolafruit was bigger at that time yet you should not regard it so the kolafruit was then at most the same size as nowThrough feeding on a single kolafruit a day my body reached a state of extreme emaciationBecause of eating so little my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stemsBecause of eating so little my backside became like a camels hoofBecause of eating so little the projections on my spine stood forth like corded beadsBecause of eating so little my ribs jutted out as gaunt as the crazy rafters of an old roofless barnBecause of eating so little the gleam of my eyes sank far down in their sockets looking like a gleam of water which has sunk far down in a deep wellBecause of eating so little my scalp shrivelled and withered as a green bitter gourd shrivels and withers in the wind and sunBecause of eating so little my belly skin adhered to my backbone thus if I touched my belly skin I encountered my backbone and if I touched my backbone I encountered my belly skinBecause of eating so little if I tried to ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands the hair rotted at its roots fell from my body as I rubbedSariputta there are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through food They say Let us live on beans Let us live on sesamum Let us live on rice and they eat rice they eat rice powder they drink rice water and they make various kinds of rice concoctionsNow I recall having eaten a single rice grain a daySariputta you may think that the rice grain was bigger at that time yet you should not regard it so the rice grain was then at most the same size as nowThrough feeding on a single rice grain a day my body reached a state of extreme emaciationBecause of eating so little the hair rotted at its roots fell from my body as I rubbedYet Sariputta by such conduct by such practice by such performance of austerities I did not attain any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesWhy was thatBecause I did not attain that noble wisdom which when attained is noble and emancipating and leads the one who practices in accordance with it to the complete destruction of sufferingSariputta there are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through the round of rebirths But it is impossible to find a realm in the round that I have not already passed through in this long journey except for the gods of the Pure Abodes and had I passed through the round as a god in the Pure Abodes I would never have returned to this worldThere are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through rebirth But it is impossible to find a kind of rebirth that I have not been reborn in already in this long journey except for the gods of the Pure AbodesThere are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through abode But it is impossible to find a kind of abode that I have not already dwelt in except for the gods of the Pure AbodesThere are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through sacrifice But it is impossible to find a kind of sacrifice that has not already been offered up by me in this long journey when I was either a headanointed noble king or a welltodobrahmanThere are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through fireworship But it is impossible to find a kind of fire that has not already been worshipped by me in this long journey when I was either a headanointed noble king or a welltodo brahmanSariputta there are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this As long as this good man is still young a blackhaired young man endowed with the blessing of youth in the prime of life so long is he perfect in his lucid wisdomBut when this good man is old aged burdened with years advanced in life and come to the last stage being eighty ninety or a hundred years old then the lucidity of his wisdom is lost But it should not be regarded soI am now old aged burdened with years advanced in life and come to the last stage my years have turned eightyNow suppose that I had four disciples with a hundred years lifespan perfect in mindfulness retentiveness memory and lucidity of wisdomJust as a skilled archer trained practiced and tested could easily shoot a light arrow across the shadow of a palm tree suppose that they were even to that extent perfect in mindfulness retentiveness memory and lucidity of wisdomSuppose that they continuously asked me about the four foundations of mindfulness and that I answered them when asked and that they remembered each answer of mine and never asked a subsidiary question or paused except to eat drink consume food taste urinate defecate and rest in order to remove sleepiness and tirednessStill the Tathagatas exposition of the Dhamma his explanations of factors of the Dhamma and his replies to questions would not yet come to an end but meanwhile those four disciples of mine with their hundred years lifespan would have died at the end of those hundred yearsSariputta even if you have to carry me about on a bed still there will be no change in the lucidity of the Tathagatas wisdomRightly speaking were it to be said of anyone A being not subject to delusion has appeared in the world for the welfare and happiness of many out of compassion for the world for the good welfare and happiness of gods and humans it is of me indeed that rightly speaking this should be saidNow on that occasion the Venerable Nagasamala was standing behind the Blessed One fanning himThen he said to the Blessed One It is wonderful venerable sir it is marvellousAs I listened to this discourse on the Dhamma the hairs of my body stood upVenerable sir what is the name of this discourse on the DhammaAs to that Nagasamala you may remember this discourse on the Dhamma as The Hairraising Discourse That is what the Blessed One saidThe Venerable Nagasamala was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThe page numbers enclosed in square brackets in the above text are the page numbers of the Pali Text Society edition of the Pali textVbhSection explains this knowledge with reference to MN as the Buddhas knowledge of what is possible and what is impossible eg it is impossible that a person possessed of right view should regard any formations as permanent or as pleasurable or anything whatever as self while it is possible that a worldling will regard things in such an erroneous wayIt is impossible for a person possessed of right view to commit the five heinous crimes while it is possible for a worldling to commit such crimes etcetcThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIn the canonical formula for contemplation of the Buddha nine epithets of the Awakened One are mentionedOne of these likely to be overlooked is sattha devamanussanam teacher of gods and humans The present essay focuses on one aspect of this epithet the Buddhas role as teacher of the devas or godsIn the pages to follow we will carefully consider the instructions and techniques he used when teaching beings of divine statureIf we study these teachings we will gain deeper understanding of how we should purify our own minds and by studying the responses of the gods we can find models for our own behavior in relation to the Master and his teachingMany religious leaders consider themselves prophets whose authority stems from an Almighty God but as our epithet implies the Buddhas relationship to divinity was very differentHe instructed deities as well as humans on how to end all suffering by eradicating ignorance and other unwholesome statesThe gods came to the Buddha to request instruction and clarification to support his Sasana or Dispensation to praise his incomparable qualities and to pay homage at his feetDevas and brahmas are often mentioned throughout the Pali canonThey regularly manifest themselves on the human plane and participate in many episodes of the Buddhas careerSome of these higher beings are foolish some exceedingly wise some are barely distinguishable from welloff people others are extremely powerful longlived and magnificentThe multiple connections between the Buddha and beings of the higher planes can inspire meditators to develop the Noble Eightfold Path that leads to the end of sufferingThis essay will explore the Buddhas direct instructions to devas and how they can help human meditators practice the Dhamma how devas out of gratitude and faith honor the Buddha and support his Dispensation and the process of attaining liberation for devas brahmas and humansThe Buddhist universe consists of thirtyone planes of existenceEvery being lives on one or another of these planesAfter death all beings except the arahants will be reborn in a realm and under circumstances that accords with their kamma  their volitional actions of body speech and mind made in that existence or in any previous oneWe will often refer to this chart to indicate where in the cosmic hierarchy the deities we meet come fromThe lowest area is called the sensuous realm here sense experience predominatesNext comes the finematerial realm attained by practicing the finematerial absorptionsAbove that is the immaterial realm attained by practicing the immaterial absorptionsAlthough humans appear to be rather low on the scale many intelligent deities long for rebirth on the human planeWhyBecause the best opportunity to practice the Dhamma and attain liberation is right here on earthOn the lower four planes little progress can be made as suffering is gross and unrelenting and the opportunity to perform deeds of merit is rarely gainedThe very bliss of the higher planes beclouds the universal characteristics of all phenomena impermanence unsatisfactoriness and the lack of any lasting controlling selfAnd without fully comprehending these principles there is no motivation to develop the detachment from the world that is essential to liberationBefore examining the chart in detail a few notes on terminology are in orderWe will use the word deva to include deva devata and devaputta referred to in the Suttas as all three terms are almost synonymousAlthough deva is often used in the Pali texts to refer to all superhuman beings deva and brahma can generally be distinguishedDeva in its more limited sense refers to beings in the six planes immediately above the human one the sensuous heavensWhen deva refers specifically to these sensesphere beings the term brahma is used for those residing in the finematerial planes and immaterial planesIf in a particular discourse deva is used for a being who clearly fits into the category of brahmas we will call him a brahma if the deva is actually a sensesphere being we will retain deva For variety we occasionally use deity and god as translations for deva in all its sensesLet us now study some features of the chartThe lower beings and humans do not have fixed lifespans but higher beings doAs you go up the chart from the sixth plane to the thirtyfirst each successive group of deities lives longer than the group below itThe lifespans of devas are measured in multiple centuriesThe duration of a brahmas existence can only be expressed in aeonsThe Buddha defines these extremely long periods of time by analogyAn aeon is the length of time it would take to wear away a mountain of solid rock six miles high and six miles wide rubbing over it with a fine piece of muslin once every hundred yearsThe highest brahmas of the immaterial sphere live for aeonsAll beings  human subhuman devas and brahmas  dieAll except arahants are reborn in one or another of the thirtyone planesNo being lasts foreverArahants have eradicated all mental defilements and have thereby eliminated the causes for rebirth with its attendant sufferingThey are not reborn after deathInstead they attain Parinibbana the complete permanent cessation of every form of existenceFor all nonarahants death is immediately followed by rebirthThe plane of birth is determined by the kamma that becomes operative at the moment of deathThis could be any volition created in the present life or in any previous existenceEven the three lower kinds of noble ones must be rebornThey have effaced some of the mental defilements are assured of eventually attaining Nibbana and will never again be reborn in the lower planesNoble ones of the two lower kinds  streamenterers and oncereturners  can be reborn in the deva planesFor anyone who is not an ariya  and this includes most devas and brahmas  the destination of rebirth is uncertainIt may be on the same plane or on a higher one but most often it is on a lower planeRebirth is neither arbitrary nor controlled by a GodIt takes place strictly due to kamma the deeds we have performed and continue to perform all our livesBrahmas too die and are reborn and also suffer even though their lives are so extremely long that they may be deluded into believing they are permanentThe devas of the sensuous sphere are said to enjoy sense pleasures in far greater abundance than can be found in the human worldTheir bodies emit light and they have subtle sense organs similar to ours but far more powerful and acuteThat is why the supernormal powers of seeing various realms and hearing at great distances are referred to as deva vision and deva hearingOn the deva planes there are streamenterers and oncereturnersFor example Sakka king of the gods in the heaven of the Thirtythree became a streamenterer while discussing the Dhamma with the Buddha as we will see belowHowever only few among the devas have any understanding of the DhammaIn fact all that is needed to be reborn in these heavens is the meritorious kamma of generosity and good moralityMental development through meditation is not a prerequisite for rebirth on the higher sensuous planesThe finematerial brahmas have extremely subtle bodies of light their powers are great but not unlimitedA being is reborn among these brahmas by cultivating the appropriate jhana perfecting it and retaining it at the moment of deathJhanas are states of deep concentration that can be attained by unifying the mind through meditationThey are all wholesome states of a very lofty and sublime natureBut one can get stuck internally in any of the jhanas and thereby block ones progress towards awakeningThere are four finematerial jhanasThe beings in the brahma planes spend most of their time enjoying their respective jhanasBrahmas experience no ill will or hatred but only because they have suppressed it by their jhana not because they have uprooted it from their mental continuumThus when a brahma is eventually reborn as a deva or human being he or she can again be beset by hatredThe brahmas also are prone to conceit and belief in a permanent self as well as to attachment to the bliss of meditationFinematerial brahmas can interact with the human plane if they so choose but to appear to humans they must like the devas deliberately assume a grosser formLater we will meet a number of brahmas who converse with the BuddhaThe immaterial brahmas of the four highest planes have no material bodies whatsoeverThey consist entirely of mindThey attained this kind of birth by achieving and maintaining the immaterial jhanas four kinds of absorption taking nonmaterial objects and it is this kamma that became operative at their deathThese brahmas can have no contact with the human or deva planes for they have no physical bodies thus we will rarely mention themThey spend countless aeons in the perfect equanimity of meditation until their lifespan endsThen they are reborn in the same plane a higher immaterial plane or as devasAfter that they too can be reborn on any plane at allSo even existence without a body is not the way to permanently eliminate sufferingOnly practicing the Noble Eightfold Path can bring suffering to an endIn fact immaterial brahmas are in the unfortunate position of being unable to start on the pathThis is because one has to learn the Dhamma from the Buddha or one of his disciples to attain the first stage of awakening to become a streamentererThat is why the sage Asita called by the Buddhas father to examine the newborn Bodhisatta wept after predicting that Prince Siddhattha would become a BuddhaThe sage knew he was going to die before the prince attained BuddhahoodHe had cultivated these immaterial absorptions so he would have to be reborn in the immaterial realm and would thereby lose all contact with the human planeThis meant he would not be able to escape samsara under Gotama BuddhaHe was sorely distressed to realize that he would miss this rare opportunity to gain deliverance and would have to remain in the round of rebirth until another Buddha appears in the remote futureHe could see into the future and thus understood the precious opportunity a Buddha offers but he could neither postpone his death nor avoid rebirth into the immaterial realmThe Buddha teaches deities when they visit the human plane where he normally resides and sometimes too by visiting them on the higher planesOn some occasions devas and brahmas come to the Buddha for clarification of Dhamma problemsOn other occasions the Buddha becomes aware through his supernormal knowledge that a god needs some instruction to correct a wrong view or to goad him further on the path to awakeningThen the Buddha travels to the higher plane and gives the deity a personal discourseOnce a brahman admirer of the Buddha recounted as best as he could evidence of the greatness of the BuddhaHe was trying to convince other brahmans to meet the BuddhaHis proof included the fact that many thousands of deities have gone for refuge for life to the recluse GotamaDevas like humans develop faith in the Buddha by practicing his teachingsIn Chapter III we will see how grateful devas express this confidenceWhen devas come to visit the Buddha late at night their luminous bodies light up the monastery as they pay respects to the Exalted One and ask their questionsWe will start with a god who was agitated by fear arisen from his sensual desire and conclude with one who becomes a streamenterer during his conversation with the BuddhaSubrahma deva was not a very sophisticated god he delighted in sensuality like many other devas of the sensuous sphereHe had been playing in sport with his thousand nymphs when half of them suddenly vanishedSubrahma used his deva vision to find where they had gone and he saw that they had died and been reborn in a hell realmAnxious that he and his remaining nymphs might soon suffer the same fate he came to the Buddha looking for a way to end his fearThe Buddha does not offer simplistic shortterm solutions to the suffering beings go through when their loved ones die he did not console the devaInstead he told Subrahma that only by developing wholesome mental states through meditation and by giving up all attachments can anyone find securityThe deva and his remaining nymphs apparently comprehended these words as the commentary says that at the end of this discourse they all became streamenterersOne deva who came to visit the Buddha seemed to be already trying to practice the Dhamma for he was concerned about how beings can eliminate their internal and external bondageThe Buddha replied that to untie these knots of misery one must cultivate morality mindfulness concentration and insightHe added that the arahants are indeed freed from the twists and bonds of rebirthA second deva concerned with liberation spoke a verse which is partly praise of the Buddha and partly a request for teachingUsing various similes from the animal world this god showed his admiration and reverence for the Exalted OneIn the last line with all humility he posed the question that the Buddhas teachings are designed to answerThe Buddha treated this devas serious query directly and with a minimum of wordsHe replied that the way out of suffering is to cultivate detachment from the eye ear nose tongue body and mindThese two gods apparently had already prepared themselves for the Dhamma and did not need the kind of graduated discourse usually given to human beings which begins with the benefits of generosity and ethicsWe can contemplate and practice the Buddhas advice to the deities to cultivate the detachment and insight that lead to liberationOnce a group of six devas came to visit the Buddha at Savatthi while he was residing in Jetavana the monastery offered by AnathapindikaThe first deva spoke the following verseThe other five concurred and spoke verses that differed only in their point of emphasisOne said association with the good brings wisdom another that friends dry our tears another that wise friendship brings one a good reputation another that it leads to a happy rebirthThe last stated that a good friend is a source of blissThe Buddha approved their verses and then added one of his ownThe popular Mahamangala Sutta  the Great Discourse on Blessings  originated when a radiant deva approached the Blessed One at Jetavana and respectfully requested a teaching on the highest good Many gods and men wishing for wellbeing have pondered over those things that constitute blessingsTell us what is the highest blessing When gods cannot concur among themselves they go to the Fully SelfAwakened One the light of the triple world the source of all wisdomThe Buddha enumerated thirtyeight blessings among them rebirth in a good location supporting ones parents avoiding intoxicants hearing the Dhamma and knowing the Four Noble TruthsThis sutta to a deva is one of the select number of parittas suttas recited for protection from harm and is popular among Buddhists even to this dayA deva named Kamada had been trying to follow the Buddhas teachings but found the task too demandingHe sounds depressed as we human meditators feel when we cannot see any progress in our practice and lose sight of the longterm perspectiveDiscouraged Kamada complained to the Buddha about how difficult it is to practice the DhammaThe Buddha took a positive approachHe did not coddle or comfort the deva but praised those bhikkhus who leave the household life to work steadfastly towards the goalKamada remained disconsolate insisting on the difficulties It is hard to win this serene contentment Blessed One The Buddha repeated that some beings do it those who love to achieve the mastery of the heart whose minds both day and night love to meditate Meditation on the universal characteristics of change unsatisfactoriness and nonself is the way to ultimate contentment because it leads to detachment from all worldly concernsKamada however complained that it is hard to compose the mindThe Buddha agreed the task is not easy but added Yet that which is hard to compose they do compose it and calming their restless minds they attain the stages of awakeningThe path is impassable and uneven Blessed One the deva complainedHe seems to crave some magic to make everything easyBut that is not how the Buddhas teach they only show the way and we ourselves must put forth the energy to walk onLiberation takes consistent persistent diligent effortTo Kamada not yet a noble one training the mind seemed to be an endless taskOther devas had more sophisticated queriesOne deva for example asked the Buddha if an arahant could use words that refer to a selfThis deva realized that arahantship means the end of rebirth and suffering by uprooting mental defilements he knew that arahants have no belief in any self or soulBut he was puzzled to hear monks reputed to be arahants continuing to use such selfreferential expressionsThe Buddha replied that an arahant might say I always aware of the merely pragmatic value of common termsThe deva trying to grasp the Buddhas meaning asked whether an arahant would use such expressions because he is still prone to conceitThe Buddha made it clear that the arahant has no delusions about his true natureHe has uprooted all notions of self and removed all traces of pride and conceitOnce late at night a deva came into the Buddhas presence shedding bright light over the whole of JetavanaHe saluted the Lord stood to one side and asked How dear sir did you cross the flood This god knew that the Buddha had gone beyond samsaras deluge of misery and wanted to learn how he had achieved thisThe Buddha replied By not standing still friend and by not struggling I crossed the flood The deva perplexed by this paradox asked for clarificationTo clear up the analogy the Exalted One told him When I came to a standstill friend then I sank but when I struggled then I got swept awayIt is in this way friend that by not standing still and by not struggling I crossed the flood The metaphor describes balanced effortHe sank when he did not work hard enough but if he strained too hard he became agitated and got swept away When he discerned how to cross over with just the right balance between energy and calm he transcended the flood of suffering fully and permanentlyThis deva rejoiced that at long last he had met a real arahant a true holy manThe delighted deva had correctly perceived what set the Buddha apart from others he had transcended death rebirth and all suffering by eliminating all the mental impuritiesThe deva began with a modicum of faith in the Buddha and received personal instruction from himAs a result the commentary indicates he became a streamentererAfter the Buddha approved the devas verse he paid respects and departedOn a similar occasion a deva asked the Buddha to explain the causes of the downfall or moral decline of beingsIn reply the Buddha first gave a summary He who loves Dhamma progresses he who hates it declines Then he named ten specific dangers to avoid the company and teachings of the vicious excessive sleep and talk being irritable not supporting aged parents if one has the resources to do so lying to a monk or Dhamma teacher being stingy being conceited about birth wealth or community running around with many women drinking gambling and adultery and marrying a woman many years younger than oneselfThe Buddha concluded Reflecting thoroughly on those causes of downfall in the world the wise one endowed with insight enjoys bliss in a happy state Meditation on this negative subject makes wisdom grow through avoidance while encouraging insight and bringing pure happinessSakka king of the devas in the heaven of the Thirtythree played many roles in the Buddhas missionHe attended on the Bodhisatta at his final birth and at the Great Renunciation visited the Buddha under the Bodhi Tree and several times proclaimed his confidence in his unique qualitiesA discourse called Sakkas Questions took place after he had been a serious disciple of the Buddha for some timeThe sutta records a long audience he had with the Blessed One which culminated in his attainment of streamentryTheir conversation is an excellent example of the Buddha as teacher of devas and shows all beings how to work for NibbanaFor these reasons we will study Sakkas Questions in depth to see what message it has for us todayFrom his vantage point in the Tavatimsa plane Sakka was a keen observer of the behavior of humans and other beingsHe saw that while beings would like to live with each other peacefully they rarely succeedThus his opening question to the Buddha attempted to unravel this contradictionThe Buddha explained that two mental factors  jealousy and avarice  cause all this trouble from these two qualities almost all the aggression in the world arisesIn this way the Buddha began a stepbystep lesson in Buddhist psychology causes and conditions govern everything that happens in the universeSakka next asked about the origin of jealousy and avariceBehind jealousy and avarice the Buddha said lie liking and disliking and the source of both liking and disliking is desireAs this is such a basic problem Sakka wanted to understand even more deeply the causes of desireThe Buddha told him that desire is triggered by thinkingAlthough he did not specify what sort of thinking he must have been referring to unsystematic mental activity the random thoughts in which the untrained mind indulgesWhen Sakka asked about the cause of thinking the Buddha said it is the tendency to mental proliferation This is what brings about random thinking which leads to desire which in turn culminates in like and dislikeThese in turn condition jealousy and avarice from which arise the conflicts in our daily livesSakka next shifted to a more directly practical issue How does one destroy this sequence that leads to so much misery He requested the Buddha to explain what should be done to eliminate this tendency to endless proliferation of mental activityThe Buddha replied that one should not blindly follow after every feeling that arises in the mindRather meditators should pursue a feeling  whether it be a pleasant painful or neutral one  only if doing so contributes to the growth of wholesome qualitiesIf we are alert to our reactions and see that pursuing a feeling strengthens unwholesome tendencies then we should relinquish that feelingWe will not get carried away by desire for more enjoyable feelings or by aversion towards pain and unhappinessSakka once again was very appreciative of the Buddhas words and he next asked more specifically about the practice of bhikkhusThe deva knew that monks practice the Dhamma to the highest degree in the purest formAs a god he could not become a monk but he wanted to discover how monks acquire the restraint required by the monastic disciplinary codeThe Buddha replied that the good bhikkhu pursues only bodily conduct conversation and goals which are conducive to the growth of wholesome qualities to the attainment of NibbanaHe rigorously restrains himself from everything detrimental to these aimsSakka had one more question about mind training How do bhikkhus control their senses Again the Buddha spoke of avoiding whatever leads to evil while cultivating the positive this time referring to all kinds of objects  forms sounds odors tastes tactile objects and ideasThis is a basic Dhamma theme always avoid unwholesome actions while one works to create wholesome kammaSakka wanted to take full advantage of his lengthy audience with the Blessed One so he embarked on another series of queriesThese deal with the variety of religious teachers he had seen in the worldEven a deva can be confused by the range of doctrines taught by holy peopleHe genuinely sought to learn if these teachers all taught the same thing and if they are all liberatedHow often do we hear today All paths lead to the same goal or All spiritual teachings are the same beneath their superficial differences But the Buddha the Fully SelfAwakened One replied negatively to both of Sakkas questionsHe explained that spiritual teachers do not all teach the same thing because they have different perceptions of the truthFrom this it logically follows that they cannot all be fully liberatedProclaiming where true liberation lies the Buddha instructed Sakka that only those who are liberated by the destruction of craving are fully proficient freed from the bonds perfect in the holy life When evaluating spiritual teachers bear in mind that liberation means destroying desireSakka approved of the Buddhas statement and remarked that passion pulls beings to repeated rebirth in happy or unhappy circumstancesSakka was so at ease with his Teacher that he then related a story which shows an unexpected aspect of deityhuman relationshipsLong ago he had gone to various human ascetics for advice on these matters with utterly unilluminating resultsNone of the yogis that Sakka had hoped to learn from had told him anythingIn fact as soon as they realized he was the king of the devas one and all decided to become his disciplesIronically Sakka found himself in the awkward position of having to tell them what little Dhamma he understood at the timeThey had no teachings to give himSakka had been delighted with this whole conversationHe declared that it had given him a unique happiness and satisfaction conducive to dispassion detachment cessation peace higher knowledge enlightenment Nibbana This was the direction he had longed to travel literally for agesHe had at last made substantial progress with the guidance of the Blessed OneInviting Sakka to delve further into his mental processes the Buddha then asked him what thoughts contribute to this great satisfactionIn his final reply Sakka declared he was joyful because he foresaw six facts about his future As king of the devas he had gained fresh potency of life At the end of this life he would mindfully choose where to be reborn in a human or higher realmIn that future life too he would follow the BuddhaDhamma with wisdom clear comprehension and mindfulnessHe might attain arahantship in that existenceBut if not he would become a nonreturner and after dying there be reborn in the highest Pure AbodeFinally Sakka knew that that existence would be his last before it ended he would become an arahantThe king of the devas then spoke a verse in gratitude to the BuddhaThe sutta then indicates that Sakka gained the stainless vision of the Dhamma by which he became a streamentererAll his uncertainties about the path to final awakening had been dispelled by the Buddhas masterly replies to his questions and his own past merits bore their proper fruitThere is another discourse with Sakka as questionerIt is set later on at the monastery built by the woman lay devotee Visakha for the Buddha in SavatthiThis time Sakka asked the Buddha How in brief is a bhikkhu liberated by the destruction of craving one who is foremost among gods and humansIn reply the Buddha summarized the sequence that leads a bhikkhu to liberationThe cycle of dependent origination explains that contact leads to feeling which in turn conditions craving and craving causes clinging which leads to rebirth and sufferingSo by contemplating feeling and by seeing it as impermanent unsatisfactory and nonself the bhikkhu gives up all craving and clingingThat is Nibbana here and nowDelighted Sakka paid respects to the Buddha and returned to the Tavatimsa deva planeIn several episodes the Buddha travels to higher planes to teach the beings dwelling thereWhile he generally visited the lower brahma planes for this purpose his most important course of instruction to the gods took place on the Tavatimsa deva planeThe Pali commentaries report that during the seventh rains retreat after his Enlightenment the Buddha spent three months in the Tavatimsa heaven teaching the entire Abhidhamma to his mother along with numerous other devas and brahmasThey had gathered there from the various deva planes of ten thousand world systems in order to listen to his exposition of this extremely precise philosophical psychologyOnly higher beings could have remained sitting in a single posture this long and continuity of attention is essential for properly grasping the AbhidhammaInfinite and immeasurable was the discourse which went on ceaselessly for three months with the velocity of a waterfallBut as the Buddha was a human being his body required normal foodThus everyday in the terrestrial forenoon he created an image of himself to continue preaching in Tavatimsa while in his natural body he came to earth to collect almsfood and partake of a mealVenerable Sariputta met him daily at the Anotatta Lake and there the Buddha summarized for him what he had taught the deities the previous daySariputta gradually passed all this material on to his own group of five hundred bhikkhu pupils elaborating and organizing it to make it easier to comprehendThe Buddha gave this profound teaching in a higher plane as it demanded superhuman attentivenessHis chief student there was his mother who had died a few days after his birth and was reborn in the Tusita devaworldBy teaching her the most subtle aspects of the Dhamma the seven sections of the Abhidhamma Pitaka the Buddha expressed his gratitude to his mother for having carried him in her womb and bringing him into this worldThe stories of a Buddha going to teach a brahma take place on the plane of Maha Brahma the third of the finematerial planesMany people worship Maha Brahma as the supreme and eternal creator God but for the Buddha he is merely a powerful deity still caught within the cycle of repeated existenceIn point of fact Maha Brahma is a role or office filled by different individuals at different periodsThe Buddha has directly seen the origins of Maha Brahma and understands what it requires to be reborn in his worldIn the Brahmajala Sutta the Buddha describes how a supposed Creator God came to believe himself omnipotent and how others came to rely on his sovereigntyHis description was based not on speculation or hearsay but on his own direct knowledgeThe Buddha explains that when our world system disintegrates as it regularly does after extremely long periods of time the lower sixteen planes are all destroyedBeings disappear from all planes below the seventeenth the plane of the Abhassara godsWhatever beings cannot be born on the seventeenth or a higher brahma plane then must take birth on the lower planes in other remote world systemsEventually the world starts to reformThen a solitary being passes away from the Abhassara plane and takes rebirth on the plane of Maha BrahmaA palace created by his kamma awaits him there There he dwells mindmade feeding on rapture selfluminous moving through the air abiding in gloryAnd he continues thus for a long long time After ages pass he becomes lonely and longs for other beings to join himIt just so happens that shortly after the brahma starts craving for company other beings from the Abhassara plane who have exhausted their lifespans there pass away and are reborn in the palace of Brahma in companionship with himBecause these beings seemed to arise in accordance with the first brahmas wish he becomes convinced that he is the almighty God I am the Great Brahma the Vanquisher the Lord the Maker and Creator the Supreme Being The other brahmas seeing that he was already present when they took birth in his world accept his claim and revere him as their creatorEventually this misconception of a Creator God spreads to the human planeOne of the other brahmas passes away and is reborn hereHe develops concentration and learns to recollect his previous life with Maha Brahma but none of his lives before thatRecollecting that existence he recalls that Maha Brahma was considered the father of all that are and are to be permanent stable eternal As he is unable to remember further back he believes this to be absolute truth and propounds a theistic doctrine of an omnipotent Creator GodThe Venerable Ledi Sayadaw a highly renowned Myanmar scholarmonk of the first part of this century gave a careful analysis of the powers of Maha Brahma in his Niyama DipaniHe states that although Maha Brahma can perform all sorts of transformations he cannot actually create independent creatures change the kammic law of cause and effect or keep anyone from growing old or dyingBrahma can use his special powers to transport a man to the brahma plane for a short visit but he cannot ensure that someone will be reborn thereThis story of a former Buddhas encounter with brahmas was recounted by Gotama Buddha to his disciples as followsBuddha Sikhin took his chief disciple Abhibhu along on a visit to a brahma world where he told him to give a discourse to the brahma his ministers and his retinueVenerable Abhibhu then instructed enlightened incited and inspired the audience with a talk on DhammaBut the great brahma and his cohorts did not appreciate what they heardInstead of paying careful heed to the chief disciples words they felt insulted that a disciple should preach in the presence of the MasterIn their pride they considered themselves worthy of the direct attention of the Buddha himselfSikhin of course knew the brahmas unwholesome thoughtsWithout addressing them directly he urged Abhibhu to continue and agitate them exceedingly in order to force them to acknowledge that they were not allpowerful permanent or superior to this arahantAbhibhu followed his masters instructions by working supernormal feats while continuing his discourseOnly rarely does a Buddha himself perform supernormal acts or permit one of his disciples to do so in the human planeBut in a brahma world where deeds that seem impossible to us are the norm these tactics are appropriateAt times Abhibhu made his body invisible while speaking to the brahmas at times half visible at times fully visibleThis masterful performance did humble those brahmasThey became more receptive and realizing the monk was no ordinary human being they exclaimed This is a marvellous thing the great magic power and might of the recluseAbhibhu then remarked to the Lord that while speaking in a normal voice in the Brahma world he could make the beings in the surrounding thousand realms hear what he saidThe Buddha deeming this relevant to the occasion urged him to show his prowessBy projecting and broadcasting his speech the disciple strove further to stimulate a sense of urgency in the brahmas so they would realize the need to stop the cycle of birth and deathAlthough the lives of brahmas are full of the bliss of jhana they remain subject to continual subtle change to death and rebirth and to sufferingAbhibhu declaimedThen Buddha Sikhin and his chief disciple left that brahma realmThey had done everything they could to make the brahmas see their own limitations and encourage them to practice the DhammaA brahma known as Baka once reflected privately that he and his plane of existence were everlastingHe thought that there could be no higher plane of rebirth and was convinced he had overcome sufferingThe Buddha discerned his deepseated wrong view and decided to pay him a visitWhen he appeared in that brahma world Baka Brahma welcomed him formally but immediately announcedThe Buddha however contradicted him pointing out that every one of his claims was wrongJust then Mara the Evil One joined the conversationMaras task is to prevent beings from being won over to the Dhamma to keep them trapped in the cycle of birth and death his own personal domainTaking possession of one of the brahmas attendants Mara urged the Buddha with a display of sympathy to accept this brahma as God the creator of all beingsHe told the Buddha that recluses of the past who delighted in things of this life and who lauded Brahma won happy births afterwards while those who rejected Brahma had to endure terrible punishmentThe Exalted One let him have his say and then called his numberAll beings subject to craving  humans subhumans devas or brahmas  are said to be in Maras power because they can all be moved by defilements and must drift along in the current of birth and deathBut the Buddha and the arahants have permanently and completely escaped Maras ken and power for they have eliminated all defilementsThey have exhausted the fuel of rebirth and thus have vanquished the Lord of DeathBaka Brahma next speaks up on his own behalfHe reminds the Buddha of his opening statement on permanenceHe warns him that it is futile to seek an escape beyond his own realm then he cajoles and threatens him in the same breath If you will hold to earth beings gods you will be close to me within my domain for me to work my will upon and punish The Buddha agrees that if he clung to earth he would remain under the control of Maha Brahma but he adds I understand your reach and your sway to extend thus Baka the Brahma has this much power this much might this much influence The Buddha points out that beyond the thousandfold world system over which Baka reigns there are planes of existence of which he is totally unaware and beyond all conditioned phenomena there is a reality that transcends even the allness of the all  a consciousness without manifestation boundless luminous on all sides  to which Baka has no accessDemonstrating his superiority in knowledge and power the Buddha uses his psychic powers to humble Baka and his entire assemblyBy the end of the discourse these once haughty beings marvel at the might of the recluse Gotama Though living in a generation that delights in being he has extirpated being together with its rootOnce an unnamed brahma gave rise to the deluded thought No recluse is powerful enough to reach my realm The Buddha read his mind and proved him wrong by simply appearing before him and sitting at ease in the air above his head while radiating flames from his body in a dramatic display of supernormal powersFour great arahant disciples  Mahamoggallana Kassapa Kappina and Anuruddha  independently realized what had happened and decided to join their Master on this brahma planeEach disciple sat in the air respectfully below the Buddha  but above the brahma  in one of the cardinal directions shedding fire around himselfA short dialogue in verse took place between Mahamoggallana the Buddhas second chief disciple and the brahmaAccording to the commentary to this story the brahma gave up his belief in his own superiority when he observed the magnificence of the Buddha and the arahantsWhen the Buddha preached the Dhamma to him he was established in the fruit of streamentry and stopped thinking of himself as permanentWhen this brahma saw his own impermanence clearly and distinctly for himself his former tenacious opinion that his world and life were immortal was uprootedMany aeons of preparation the brahmas quick intellect the Buddhas perfect timing and the support of the four arahants bore fruit in the deity becoming a streamentererAfter the Buddha and his arahants left and returned to Jetavana the great brahma wanted to learn more about the powers of bhikkhusHe sent a member of his retinue to ask Mahamoggallana whether there are even more bhikkhus who can perform such featsMoggallana repliedNot only do large numbers of bhikkhus have such special powers and the ability to know other peoples minds but there are numerous fully purified arahant disciples of the Buddha as wellThe emissary was glad to hear this answer as was the brahma when he received the reportOnce a bhikkhu with psychic powers visited the various celestial realms seeking an answer to the question Where do the great elements  earth water fire and air  cease without remainder An exhaustive inquiry led him from one realm to the next until he finally came to Maha BrahmaThe first three times the monk asked his question Brahma replied evasively Monk I am Brahma Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the Allseeing Exasperated the bhikkhu demanded a decent reply Friend I did not ask if you are Brahma I asked you where the four great elements cease without remainderAt this point Maha Brahma took the monk by the arm led him aside and told him The brahmas of my entourage believe there is nothing Maha Brahma does not see there is nothing he does not know there is nothing he is unaware ofThat is why I did not speak in front of them Admitting his ignorance he advised the monk to return to his Master the Awakened One who rephrased the question and gave the appropriate answerIn this discourse we have more evidence that a Buddha is far beyond Maha Brahma in power teaching skill and understanding and much of the proof is volunteered by the Great Brahma himselfWe have observed devas and brahmas approach the Buddha and ask him questions and we have followed the Buddha on his journeys to finematerial planes to uproot the delusions of brahmasThe Buddha also instructs gods indirectly when they overhear him teaching humansIn such situations devas with the requisite supporting conditions from previous lives can attain awakening along with the human auditorsA number of suttas conclude with a statement that the discourse was applauded by many devas and brahmas who attained one or more of the stages of awakening while listening inOne example is a discourse the Buddha gave to his son RahulaThe Buddha had been instructing Rahula gradually from the time he was ordained as a novice at seven years of ageThe training became more profound as he grew in years and powers of discretionBy the time Rahula was twentyone the Buddha decided it was time to lead him towards arahantshipSo one day after the Blessed One had finished his meal he told the young monk to come along with him to the Blind Mens Grove near Savatthi for the afternoonRahula agreed and followedBut they were not alone for the text tells us that many thousands of deities followed the Blessed One thinking Today the Blessed One will lead the Venerable Rahula further to the destruction of the taints The commentary says that these gods had been companions of Rahulas during a previous life in which he first made the aspiration to attain arahantship as the son of a BuddhaThe Buddha sat down at the root of a tree and Rahula also took a seatThe Buddha asked Rahula if each sense organ each sense object each kind of sense consciousness and each kind of contact is permanent or impermanentRahula stated that they are all impermanentWe can deduce that the devas invisibly present were listening and simultaneously meditating on the appropriate answersThe Buddha asked Is what is impermanent pleasant or suffering Rahula acknowledged that anything that is impermanent must be unsatisfactory or sufferingThen the Teacher queried Is what is impermanent suffering and subject to change fit to be regarded thus This is mine this I am this is my self No came the replyThe invisible audience too must have drawn the same conclusionNext the Buddha asked Rahula if the feeling perception mental formations and consciousness that arise through the contact of the six sense organs with their objects are permanent or notThese are the four mental aggregates that  along with material form  constitute a beingRahula again said that they are impermanentHe must have deduced that since the contact between the sense organs and their objects changes every instant the aggregates that derive from them must also be transitoryAnd again he recognized that whatever is impermanent is unsatisfactoryHe also understood that it is untenable to consider anything impermanent and unsatisfactory as I mine or myself as the concept of control is at the heart of our ideas of I and mineThe Buddha then concluded that once one understands these facts fully and sees how all these things are causally connected one becomes disenchanted with all conditioned thingsThat is he attains full awakening arahantship and is no longer subject to rebirthAs Rahula listened to his fathers words his mind was released from the taints through nonclingingBy fully penetrating the discourse he had become an arahant fully liberated from sufferingAll the deva and brahma spectators listening to the discourse attained the paths and fruits And in those many thousands of deities there arose the spotless immaculate vision of the Dhamma All that is subject to arising is subject to cessation Some of them according to the commentary became streamenterers some oncereturners some nonreturners and some arahantsThis variety was due to the differences in their prior preparation and present effort at the time of the suttaEven though this discourse was geared to a young monk while the Buddha spoke higher beings developed their own insight through hearing it and purified their mindsEveryone who has even glimpsed the magnificence of the Dhamma feels tremendous esteem for the BuddhaDeities realize that he had dedicated innumerable lifetimes to perfecting himself so that he could teach others the way beyond sufferingBecause of their devotion to the Exalted One devas gratefully come down to the human plane  though the earth is said to be repulsive to their refined senses  to express their homage and affirm their devotion to the Supreme TeacherThis is the reciprocal aspect of the Buddha as teacher of devas his deva and brahma disciples acknowledge their debt to their incomparable masterThey venerate him for his extraordinary purity and unique capacity to train othersThese Dhamma beneficiaries from the higher planes rejoice and offer profound homage to the Buddha because they see over a broader temporal range than is perceptible to ordinary humans how he offers beings the way out of the misery of samsaraWe will look at several examples of how the gods paid respect to the Buddha finishing with the Great OccasionNot only do these incidents help illuminate the relationship between gods and the Buddha but they can also serve as sustenance for our own Buddhanussati meditation on the qualities of the BuddhaThis kind of contemplation creates wholesome kamma by increasing our confidence in the Teacher and prepares the mind for deeper concentration and insightOnce Pañcasikha a celestial musician messenger and attendant on the deva planes appeared before the BuddhaHe reported that Sakka king of the gods of the Thirtythree especially honored the following qualities of the Buddha and his teachingThe doctrine he teaches is well proclaimed by the Blessed One visible here and now immediately effective inviting inspection onward leading to be experienced by the wise for themselvesHe distinguishes and proclaims what is good and what is badHe explains the path to NibbanaHe has taught beings to become learners and arahantsGifts to the Buddha are wellgiven and are accepted by him without any conceitHe practices what he teaches and teaches what he practicesThere are absolutely no contradictions between his verbal and physical actionsThe Lord has gone beyond all doubt and accomplished his aim in regard to the goal and the supreme holy lifePañcasikha reported that when Sakka had said all this the gods of the realm of the Thirtythree were delightedSakka then concluded by telling them to cultivate the wish May this Blessed Lord continue to live long free from sickness as that would benefit devas and humansWhat Sakka recommends is a simple form of meditation on universal loveHis audience must have been a group with mixed potential for Dhamma comprehension and he showed them a simple way to create wholesome mental kammaSince they all agreed that the Buddha was a very great being they were happy to listen to his praises from SakkaThis induced them to wish him good health so that he could teach more beings the way to NibbanaSakka is often shown leading his fellow devas in some Dhamma activityHere he praises human beings who became noble ones and took rebirth on the plane of the Thirtythree where they outshine the other gods in fame and splendorFor Sakka and his cohorts the great renown and beauty of the new devas confirm the value of the Buddhas teachingsThey are glad and therefore honor the Buddha and the DhammaThis verse comes at the beginning of a complex sutta which makes a number of interesting points about godsVenAnanda had asked the Buddha where many deceased disciples of the Magadha area had been rebornBefore answering the Buddha directed his mind to find their plane of rebirthWhile he was investigating in this way a deva came to him and announced that he was the former King Bimbisara a streamentererAs a man he had been a devoted lay disciple for many years and had now been reborn among the Four Great KingsThis deva related to the Buddha a long incident from the past that began with Sakkas remarks about newly arrived devasThe episode provided the answer to Anandas original questionAfter Sakka finished speaking the gods noticed that an unusually brilliant light shone on the assemblyThen its source Brahma Sanankumara approached the gatheringThe former Bimbisara explained that whenever a brahma descends to a deva plane he assumes a grosser form because his natural appearance is not such as to be perceptible to their eyes Brahma Sanankumara then gave the devas a Dhamma talk in which he surveyed the central teachings of the BuddhaHe began by praising the Blessed Ones compassionSanankumara concluded his discourse with words of great homage for the Buddha and the DhammaHe said that if one were to praise the Dhamma as well proclaimed etc and then to add Open are the doors of the Deathless one would be speaking in accordance with the highest truthIn the final portion of Brahma Sanankumaras speech he numbered the streamenterers and oncereturners who had recently been born in the deva planesBut he did not venture to comment on the number of worldlings who had acquired meritSanankumara appears in several other suttas where he always reveres the Buddha and the noble SanghaOne of his stanzas in which he extols the Buddha is quoted several times in the Pali canonIn the next story a brahma intervenes to help a human being receive the DhammaBahiya Daruciriya was a nonBuddhist asceticThe brahma a nonreturner from the Pure Abodes had been one of Bahiyas companions at the time of the previous Buddha Kassapa when they were members of a group of monks who had made a determined effort to win arahantshipBahiya had then failed in the attempt and was now reborn at the time of Gotama BuddhaBahiya had lived as a recluse for many years and he was respected by the multitude as a saint even to such a degree that Bahiya himself almost came to believe thisBut one day out of compassion for him his old friend in the Pure Abodes appeared to him in a visible body and shocked him out of his complacency You Bahiya are neither an arahant nor have you entered the path to arahantshipYou do not follow the practice whereby you could be an arahant or enter the path to arahantshipThis had the desired effect and Bahiya begged his benefactor Then in the world including the devas who are arahants or have entered the path to arahantship His desire for release from the world was so sincere that he had the humility to admit his limitations and ask for a teacher to show him the true path to holinessThe brahma replied that a Buddha had arisen in the world and was living at Savatthi There the Lord now lives who is the arahant the Fully Enlightened OneThat Lord Bahiya is indeed an arahant and he teaches the Dhamma for the realization of arahantship As a nonreturner since the time of the previous Buddha the brahma knew precisely what Bahiya needed and he spoke the succinct truth about Buddha Gotama and his teachingThanks to the intervention and the guidance of his lofty benefactor Bahiya Daruciriya was directed to the Blessed One whose brief and cryptic discourse had such a powerful impact that Bahiya achieved arahantship right on the spotAfter his death the Buddha declared Bahiya the foremost bhikkhu with respect to quickness of understandingOnce a devata a goddess named Kokanada visited the Blessed One at Vesali and recited verses in his praiseAlthough this was apparently her first direct encounter with the Buddha Kokanada understood a great deal about kamma and rebirthShe saw that people are reborn in lower realms because they lack insight and disparage the DhammaShe also perceived that humans can attain deva or brahma births by discerning the Four Noble Truths suffering its cause its cessation and the Noble Eightfold Path leading to its cessationHer knowledge of Dhamma does not seem to go beyond thisThe Mahasamaya Sutta or Discourse on the Great Assembly is the most stunning illustration of higher beings coming to the human plane expressly to pay respects to the Buddha along with the arahantsThis mighty gathering took place when the Lord returned to the land of his ancestors near KapilavatthuFive hundred recently ordained bhikkhus from the Sakyan and Koliyan clans came to him to declare their attainment of arahantshipDevas from many thousands of world systems approached to observe the occasionFour brahmas from the Pure Abodes noticing that most of the other devas had gathered in the Great Wood to see the Buddha and arahants decided to visit tooSo they assumed grosser form appeared before the Buddha saluted him and stood respectfully to one sideThe first one announced why they had comeAlthough Sangha can refer either to the community of monks or to all noble disciples the adjective unconquered implies that the brahmas were admiring the arahant monks led by the BuddhaThe second brahma saidThe third used more similes to describe the achievement of arahantsThe last one spoke these linesThis brahma knew that anyone who has genuine faith in the Buddha will not create kamma that could lead to a lower plane of existenceThat is how taking refuge in the Buddha assures us of a deva birth not some magical power of hisThe Buddha then told the monks that devas and brahmas from the surrounding world systems come frequently to see the Tathagata and the SanghaIt is not Gotama the Sakyan prince that they honor but Gotama the Buddha and the community of noble onesThe Buddha indicates that this is a general ruleWise deities used to come to pay obeisance to past Buddhas and will do the same for future ones tooThen so the monks could learn their identities the Buddha announced the names of the groups of devas and brahmas as they presented themselves before himThe list included earthbound devas the Four Great Kings with their retinues asuras Sakka residents of the Tusita and Yama planes occupants of the sun and moon denizens of the two highest deva planes and Maha Brahma shining bright with all his train The Buddha related that the devas were sayingThis discourse illustrates another aspect of the relationship between the Buddha the Supreme Teacher and heavenly beingsSome of them only yearn for an audience so they can express their confidence in him acclaiming him in publicAt pivotal moments in the Buddhas career deities often played supporting rolesWe read of devas showing respect at these turning points helping him to overcome obstacles and frequently proclaiming his feats far and wideAt the moment of the Bodhisattas final conception the gods rejoicedThey knew that such a special being was arising after the long darkness of ignorance that set in when the Buddha Kassapas Dispensation disappearedAfter having perfected all the paramis every Bodhisatta is born on the Tusita deva plane in his next to last existenceThere he waits until all the requisite conditions on earth are ripe for the rekindling of the DhammaThen the Bodhisatta passes away and enters his mothers womb and after ten months he is bornThe attainment of Buddhahood requires a human existence with its characteristic combination of suffering and pleasureFrom the Venerable Ananda the Buddhas personal attendant we learn about the Tathagatas wonderful and marvellous qualities which he himself had heard directly from the BuddhaThe conception of a Buddhatobe in his final body causes unusual physical phenomena in various realmsIn fact certain natural laws govern the major events in the careers of all Buddhas past present and future It is the rule monks that when a Bodhisatta descends from Tusita into his mothers womb such a light appears and all these special phenomena occurThe devas protect the Bodhisattas foetus inside his mother so he can grow perfectlyThey shelter the mother so she is at peace free from sensual desire and relaxed enabling the baby to develop in ideal conditionsThe description of his final birth in this discourse shows how important the devas are to this unique babyQueen Mahamaya gave birth standing under a tree in the woods near the village of LumbiniThe recluse Asita who was associated with the court of the Bodhisattas father witnessed these heavenly celebrationsAsita was visiting the deva worlds at the time so he asked them Why are you all so happy and joyful Ive never seen such excitement as this The devas explained to himSome of these devas were probably ariyas themselves and others would have been aware of the infants future destinyThey rejoiced that the way to the end of suffering would soon be expounded and Asita stirred by their revelation went to see the newborn child with his own eyesAfter living a refined life as a prince for many years the Bodhisatta gradually became dissatisfied with this tedious round of hollow sense pleasuresHis paramis built up for aeons came to the fore ripe for the attainment of BuddhahoodHe knew he had to find the way to release from suffering so on the very night his wife gave birth to their only child he renounced the home life to become a recluseOver the next six years he mastered the stages of concentration under various gurus and tormented his flesh with the most severe ascetic practicesDeities observed his progress from the deva planes and occasionally intervenedFor example when the Bodhisatta considered abstaining from all food deities came and offered to infuse heavenly food through the pores of his skin but the Bodhisatta refusedThe gods observing the Great Being would not let him kill himself through voluntary starvation but he on his part would not allow himself to speak untruth even by implication thus he would not accept their offerAlthough the Bodhisatta undertook long grueling fasts he still did not come any closer to what he really sought the way to uproot all the causes of suffering and so end rebirth once and for allAfter the Bodhisatta spent six years pursuing ascetic practices to their limit he finally set out alone to discover another method to fulfill his aimHe had realized that selftorture was not the solution so he started to consume normal food againHe walked to the place now known as Bodh Gaya in Bihar IndiaThere he began to meditate under a tree using a method he recalled from a spontaneous childhood experience of meditationHe was determined either to attain full liberation then and there or else to die in the attemptAccording to tradition as the Bodhisatta struggled against Mara beneath the Bodhi Tree when Mara challenged his right to attain awakening he asked the earth to witness how he had perfected himself for so long to reach BuddhahoodMany devas and brahmas joined the battle vouching for his completed paramisThereupon Mara along with his evil troops was routed and fled the sceneThis calling the earth to witness is memorialized in innumerable paintings and statues the Bodhisatta seated crosslegged in meditation posture touches the ground by his knee with his right hand a gesture intended to draw forth its testimonyIn the eighth week following the awakening while the newly enlightened Buddha was still near the Bodhi Tree he hesitated to teach the Dhamma apprehensive that it would be too profound for human comprehensionBrahma Sahampati then became aware of what was going on in the Buddhas mindThis brahma according to the commentaries had become a nonreturner under a previous Buddha and resided in one of the Pure AbodesDistressed at the Buddhas hesitancy he thought The world will be lost utterly perish since the mind of the Tathagata Arahant Supreme Buddha inclines to inaction and not towards preaching the Dhamma So he appeared before the Buddha respectfully stooped with his right knee to the ground paid homage and appealed to him to teachThe Buddha then gazed out upon the world with his eye of a Buddha and having seen that there are beings with little dust in their eyes who would be capable of understanding the truth he announced Open for them are the doors to the Deathless  a gift that has come down to us through the centuriesBrahma Sahampati was gratified and joyously thought Now I am one who has given an opening for the Buddha to teach the Dhamma to beings The Brahma then bowed to the Buddha and vanishedOne might wonder why the Buddha who had prepared himself for numerous lifetimes just to teach the Dhamma to other beings needed the prompting of Brahma Sahampati to set out on his missionThe commentary offers two explanations only after he had attained Buddhahood could the Buddha fully comprehend the actual scope of the defilements saturating the minds of beings and the profundity of the Dhamma and he wanted a brahma to request him to teach so the numerous followers of Maha Brahma would be inclined to listen to the DhammaNow that he was committed to transmit the Dhamma the Lord had to find his first studentsHe determined that the five ascetics who had assisted him in his struggle for the last few years would be the appropriate auditorsAware that the group was staying at Isipatana a royal deer reserve not far from Varanasi he made his way there in stagesWhen the ascetics first caught sight of him in the distance they decided not to greet him for they believed he had reverted to a comfortable life and had abandoned the search for truthHowever as the Buddha approached his unique demeanour dispelled this assumption and they listened keenly when he spokeHe taught them the Middle Way between the extremes of asceticism and immersion in sense pleasures the path which he himself had followed when he abandoned futile austeritiesThe Buddha next explained the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold PathWhile he spoke devas and brahmas paid close attention and at the conclusion they sounded their applause upwards from the lowest plane of the earthbound devas through each of the six sensesphere deva planes even up through the BrahmaworldUnder the impact of this momentous event the entire tenthousandfold world system shook and reverberated and a brilliant light appeared far superior to that of all the devas and brahmas matched only by wisdom illuminating the TruthThe gods were messengers conveying this wonderful news throughout the universeDevas came to the Buddha several times when he was physically unwellOnce the renegade monk Devadatta who wanted to take over the Sangha by force hurled a massive boulder at the BuddhaThe stone splintered before it hit the Lord but a small fragment lodged in his foot causing severe painSo for some time the Buddha lay down mindful and discerning observing the painful sensationsThen a large group of devas came to see the Teacher anxious for his welfareImpressed by the perfect equanimity he displayed despite the wound they spoke in turn praising him as a bull elephant a lion a thoroughbred a bull an ox for his ability to patiently endure painful bodily feelings  racking sharp piercing harrowing disagreeable  mindful and clearly comprehending without becoming distressedA few months before the Parinibbana the Buddha spent the rains retreat near Vesali where he suffered from dysenteryAccording to the Dhammapada Commentary Sakka king of the devas found out the Blessed One was ill and came to nurse himThe Buddha told him not to bother as there were many monks to handle this task but Sakka stayed on and looked after the Buddhas physical needs until he had recoveredSome monks were surprised to see the great deva doing such menial choresThe Buddha explained to them that Sakka was so devoted to the Tathagata because he had gained streamentry by learning the Dhamma from himThe Buddha then pointed out that it is always good to associate with the wise to be in their presence and learn from the example of their actions as well as from their verbal teachingsDevas and brahmas were active at several phases of the Maha Parinibbana  the Buddhas final passing away at Kusinara  as recorded in the Maha Parinibbana SuttantaThis event was not just the demise of a greatly revered being but it also represented the personal consummation of his teachingsIt was the utter permanent cessation of the aggregates of the one who discovered and taught the way to the end of sufferingA short while before the Buddha attained final Nibbana he lay down to rest between two saltreesThey began flowering profusely out of seasonAfter some time the Buddha told the monk who had been fanning him to go awayThen the Venerable Ananda his devoted attendant asked him why he had dismissed that monkThe Buddha repliedThe indomitable Ananda who had permission to ask the Buddha any question next wanted to know what kinds of devas were around themThe Buddha said he saw lower devas who are weeping and tearing their hair in distress moaning All too soon the Blessed Lord is passing away all too soon the WellFarer is passing away all too soon the Eye of the World is disappearing But there were devas free from craving who endured this patiently sayingAll compounded things are impermanent  what is the use of thisAfter passing through the successive jhanas the Buddha finally expired attaining Parinibbana the immutable cessation of rebirthAt that moment the earth quaked as it does whenever Buddhas pass awayBrahma Sahampati who had entreated the Buddha to teach fortyfive years earlier spoke a verse as a short eulogySakka repeated a verse of the Buddhas on the theme of impermanenceWhile Sahampati used conventional speech adoring the deceased Lord Sakka spoke in impersonal and universal termsHis verse makes an excellent theme for meditation and is often chanted at Buddhist funeralsAll the compounded things which make up everyone and everything in all the world come into being and perishOnly when they cease utterly never to rearise can there be the perfect bliss NibbanaThese stanzas by the renowned brahma and the king of the devas show how the beings on the higher planes applied their insight into impermanence and suffering even to the Parinibbana of their Lord and MasterAfter they had honored the Buddhas body for a full week the Mallas of Kusinara decided it was time for the funeralThey began to prepare for the cremation but could not lift the body and carry it out the southern gate of the cityPuzzled they asked the Venerable Anuruddha what was wrongThis great elder renowned for his divine eye told the devotees that the devas had their own ideas of how to arrange the funeralThe deities he said planned first to pay homage to the Lords body with heavenly dance and song and then take it in procession through the city of Kusinara to the cremation siteThe devas intended the cremation to be at the Mallas shrine known as MakutaBandhanaThe Mallas were happy to change their plans and proceeded unhindered to arrange the funeral as the devas wishedOut of respect the gods participated in all phases of the funerary proceedingsIt is said that even the sewers and rubbishheaps of Kusinara were covered kneehigh with coral tree flowersAnd the devas as well as the Mallas honored the Lords body with divine and human dancing and songThey transported the body to the MakutaBandhana shrine and placed it thereThey wrapt it many times in layers of finest cloth built the pyre of scented wood and placed the bier bearing the Buddhas body on topBut when the men tried to light the fire it would not igniteAgain the reason lay with the devasAnuruddha explained that the devas would not allow the pyre to be lit until the Venerable Maha Kassapa arrived for the cremationOnce Maha Kassapa and his group of bhikkhus had arrived and paid their last respects to the Exalted Ones body the pyre blazed up spontaneously burning until almost nothing remained behindHuman beings devas and brahmas are the broad categories of beings in the happy realms of existence The human world is marked by a pervasive admixture of happiness and sufferingThis dual nature is the main reason why Buddhas are born hereThe uneven quality of human life enables us to realize the unreliable nature of happiness and inspires in us a sense of urgency about the need to win deliverance from sufferingUnlike the beings in the lower planes few humans are overwhelmed by unmitigated and excruciating painWe do of course experience physical pain and mental stress but such experience is generally intermittentFor the most part our suffering is of a more subtle characterWe can observe that every pleasure brings along some measure of dissatisfactionOur contentment is unsteady and secured with difficultyWe must struggle to satisfy our needs and desires but become anxious the moment we succeedEven when we are relatively happy we are beset by a deep subtle kind of sufferingThis suffering which lies below the threshold of painful feeling stems from the momentary vanishing of all the conditioned formations of body and mindIn spite of our pain human beings with an inclination for the Dhamma can make the effort to live by the Five Precepts of moralityWe can find the energy to train our minds towards the concentration and insight required for awakeningIn contrast devas see far less of the evident kinds of misery in their daily existenceSome brahmas meet no gross suffering except when they look down at beings on lower planesMany devas instantly obtain whatever sense object they wish forBrahmas dwell in sublime bliss and equanimityIn the finematerial and immaterial spheres ill will is suppressed and without it there is no mental unhappinessIt is difficult for deities to appreciate that everything changes and to recognize that their present pleasure and bliss do not last foreverLike Baka Brahma many imagine that they are eternalThe subtler forms of suffering tend to escape them as wellWithout help from a Buddha or one of his disciples they do not understand that the impersonal conditions that will terminate their felicity are already in operationMany of the higher beings as we have seen have no idea that they will die that their worlds and lives are in flux that they are not fully in control but are decaying at every instantSo in spite of their excellent concentration and present opulence they are even at a disadvantage compared to human beings who are driven by pain and frustration to seek the path to deliveranceHow then can such beings be induced to meditateWhy should they become concerned with suffering and its cessationWe have indicated the answers to those questions in preceding chaptersThis is the job of the Buddha as teacher of the godsSome devas long to be reborn as human beings because they are aware of the greater possibility of comprehending impermanence suffering and nonself on the human planeThere is no real illness on the deva planesWhen a deva faces death his aura begins to fade and dirt appears on his clothes for the first timeWhen the gods see these indications of impending death they tell their friendThe Buddha then explained the devas concept of a good birth and of what is good to gainThe last sentence refers to a streamentererOnly streamenterers have such steadfast confidence in the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaThey will definitely attain final awakening and release and until then will never be reborn on a plane below the human oneTo become an ariya is the greatest achievement for any being lost in the round of rebirthOnly by entering the stream to awakening can beings proceed to eliminate all the causes of sufferingThe Buddha explained that the devas view a human existence as an excellent opportunity for growth in morality giving faith and understandingWith compassionate concern for their dying cohort they sayThe devas urge their friend to become a morally upright human beingHe should give up everything unwholesome be generous and once established in faith and meritorious deeds help spread the Buddhas messageNot only do wise gods long for human birth to practice the Dhamma they also rejoice when they observe people establishing themselves in the way to the cessation of sufferingSuch deities are convinced that human beings like these are greater than themselvesIn spite of all the magnificent sights appealing perfumes and tastes melodious music and other sensual pleasures they have at their beck and call these devas understand the unsatisfactory nature of existence sufficiently to value the effort to put an end to samsaric wanderingIn the sutta preceding the one quoted above the Buddha spoke of joyous utterances devas give forth in three situations when a man is preparing to ordain as a bhikkhu when a person is engaged in cultivating the requisites of enlightenment and when someone attains the goal utterly destroying the mental defilementsWhenever devas notice people engaged in the first two deeds they rejoice saying A noble disciple is doing battle with Mara When the devas see that someone on the human plane has become fully awakened they declare A noble disciple has won the battleHe was in the forefront of the fight and now dwells victorious They commend and extol the arahant in verseThe Buddha has explained in many ways that liberation is infinitely more valuable than any state of existenceEven blissful lives in the deva and brahma planes invariably include subtle suffering end in death and are followed by uncertain rebirthIn a discourse called Reappearance according to ones Aspiration he saidThe Buddha repeated the same statement in regard to every happy plane as far as the highest realm of existenceThe good kamma generated by positive mental qualities conjoined with the aspiration for a particular birth can bring about rebirth on that planeSo by cultivating these traits one can be reborn in any of the six deva planesWith the support of the requisite jhana one can take birth in any of the finematerial or immaterial planesIf additionally one has destroyed the five lower fetters and become a nonreturner one can be reborn spontaneously in the Pure AbodesThe supreme aim however is arahantshipIf one has purified ones mind totally of greed hate and delusion one would experience the destruction of the taints Hence the discourse culminates with a monk aspiring for arahantshipThat bhikkhus demise is parinibbana the end of all possible forms of suffering foreverAlthough devas and brahmas have very long lives pervaded by inconceivable bliss they are not inherently greater than human beingsAs we have seen they are all subject to repeated becomingA deva may well be reborn on one of the lower planesBrahmas can fall to a ghostly or hellish existence after one intermediate life as a deva or humanThe Buddha states that even lives lasting many aeons in the highest formless planes can end in lower birthsTherefore such lives provide no security but only temporary remission of the underlying disease and if they are not dedicated to progress towards Nibbana their value is virtually nilOne who has understood the noble Dhamma will look upon such modes of existence with revulsion and dispassionOnly by becoming an ariya can one be sure that one faces no more lower rebirths and is headed for the complete cessation of samsaraTo become a streamenterer requires three thingsOne has to develop confidence in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha relinquish any idea that rituals lead to liberation and most important eliminate the deepseated view I am real and lasting that characterizes all worldlingsBy uprooting that deluded view noble ones remove their tendency to create the heavy bad kamma that leads to birth in the realms of woeSometimes lay people not yet ripe enough to desire liberation asked the Buddha how to be successful in their mundane endeavors or how to be reborn on a celestial plane after deathThe Master would reply with a discourse suited to their limited ability and inclinationHe would tell them to give generously and live a moral lifeHe would specifically urge them to observe the Five Precepts without a breach and to undertake the Eight Precepts on special occasionsGenerating such good kamma is the way to general wellbeing now and after deathThese basic steps form the starting point of the gradual training that leads all the way to arahantshipThe Dhamma is consistent from start to finishWhen the Buddha describes the entire course of a bhikkhus training from leaving home to arahantship he devotes considerable attention to the jhanas the highest form of concentrationOne who can keep the mind absorbed on a single object can apply this capacity for attention to insight the wisdom section of the pathOne skilled in jhana can easily discern the impermanence unsatisfactoriness and selfless nature of the aggregates for extended periodsThe jhanas also create strong wholesome kamma as they are all associated with some form of wisdomIndividuals who practice the jhanas but do not reflect on them with insight may think the jhanas permanently efface their unwholesome tendenciesThe Buddha found however that mental defilements are only suppressed  perhaps for a very long time  by these meditative statesSuch absorptions bring bliss and peace here and now generate wholesome kamma and may bring rebirth in a plane of the brahma worldHowever they do not uproot the latent defilements and thus cannot cut off the root causes of samsaraFor this one needs insightwisdom the discernment of the three universal marks of impermanence suffering and nonselfLet us human beings apply ourselves wholeheartedly and take up the unique opportunity given by our present birthIn the round of samsara it is extremely rare to rise above the realms of woe where the way out of suffering cannot be followed and a human birth is even more favorable to awakening than birth in the realm of the godsDevas envy us our place ostensibly so low on the cosmic scale and wish to be reborn as humansThe Buddha Sasana still thrives the Dhamma is available in full there are excellent teachers who are true disciples of the Master and we are on the best plane for strivingFinal awakening does not bring eternal life in some heaven as many religions promiseNibbana means letting go of everything  relinquishing every state of being anywhere in the cosmosIt is our attachments and cravings rooted in ignorance that keep us revolving in samsaras miseryWisdom shows how all existence is bound up with suffering and thereby illuminates the futility of all craving for beingThen all old kamma is burnt up and no new fuel for birth is createdThe process of birth and death just stops once and for allThis is not the end of an existing being as no such being ever wasIt is only the end of a process of the flux of physical and mental phenomena arising and vanishing due to complex networks of causes and conditionsThere is no controlling or enduring self of any sort at any timeWhat the Buddha taught deities he taught people what he taught people he taught devas and brahmas just the universal fact of suffering and the way to the cessation of suffering  morality concentration and wisdomIn some cases my quotations from

SocietyBuddhist Publication SocietyWisdom PublicationsThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe theme of this study Buddhist ceremonies and rituals may not appeal to the selfstyled Buddhist purist who wishes to restrict the designation Buddhism exclusively to the teachings of the Buddhist scriptures which he usually interprets in a narrowly intellectualist mannerThe fact remains however that the practices and observances to be described here justly claim an integral place within the stream of living Buddhism as practiced by its adherentsBecause these practices form an intimate part of the religious life for the vast majority of devout Buddhist followers they cannot be lightly dismissed as mere secondary appendages of a pristine canonical BuddhismIt has been an inevitable phenomenon in the history of religion that whenever a religion was newly introduced to a culture its adherents assimilated it and adapted it in ways that harmonized with their own social and cultural needsIn the case of Buddhism this has happened in every country to which it spread and Sri Lanka is no exceptionThe core doctrines of Buddhism such as the Four Noble Truths the Noble Eightfold Path dependent arising etc often proved too abstruse and elevated for the ordinary populace to apply to their own religious livesTo satisfy their devotional and emotional needs they required a system of outward acts communally shared by which they could express their devotion to the ideals represented by the Dhamma and absorb these ideals into the texture of their daily experienceThis was how the great tradition of canonical Buddhism came to be complemented by the small tradition of popular Buddhism consisting of the rituals and ceremonies discussed in this bookletThe purpose of the present study is to highlight this often neglected face of popular BuddhismThough the study focuses on Buddhism as practiced in Sri Lanka the same basic round of rituals and ceremonies with minor variations can be found in the other countries following Theravada Buddhism such as Burma and ThailandI also hope that this survey will demonstrate that the expression of Buddhist piety in devotional forms is a necessity if Buddhism is to survive at the popular level as a vital and vibrant force in the daily life of its adherentsThus the votaries of a pristine pure Buddhism posited on the basis of the canonical texts should not ignore or devalue this aspect of Buddhism as an alien encroachment on the Buddhas original doctrineRather they should come to recognize the devotional manifestation of Buddhism as an essential feature of the tradition needed to mediate between its exalted ideals and the everyday concerns of the vast majority of its followersAGSKariyawasamSri Lanka is generally regarded as the home of the pure Theravada form of Buddhism which is based on the Pali canonThis school of Buddhism emphasizes the Four Noble Truths as the framework of Buddhist doctrine and the Noble Eightfold Path as the direct route to Nibbana the final goal of the TeachingHowever side by side with this austere intellectually sophisticated Buddhism of the texts we find in Sri Lanka a warm current of devotional Buddhism practiced by the general Buddhist populace who may have only a hazy idea of the Buddhist doctrineThus in practical life the gap between the great tradition of canonical Buddhism and the average persons world of everyday experience is bridged by a complex round of ceremonies rituals and devotional practices that are hardly visible within the canonical texts themselvesWhile the specific forms of ritual and ceremony in Sri Lankan popular Buddhism doubtlessly evolved over the centuries it seems likely that this devotional approach to the Dhamma has its roots in lay Buddhist practice even during the time of the Buddha himselfDevotion being the intimate inner side of religious worship it must have had a place in early BuddhismFor Buddhism devotion does not mean submitting oneself to the will of a God or taking refuge in an external Saviour but an ardent feeling of love and affection directed towards the Teacher who shows the way to freedom from sufferingSuch an attitude inspires the devotee to follow the Masters teaching faithfully and earnestly through all the hurdles that lie along the way to NibbanaThe Buddha often stressed the importance of saddha faith or confidence in him as the Perfect Teacher and in his Teaching as the vehicle to liberation from the cycle of rebirthUnshakeable confidence in the Triple Gem  the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha  is a mark of the noble disciple while the Buddha once stated that those who have sufficient confidence in him sufficient affection for him are bound for heavenMany verses of the Theragatha and Therigatha poems of the ancient monks and nuns convey feelings of deep devotion and a high level of emotional elationAlthough the canonical texts do not indicate that this devotional sensibility had yet come to expression in fully formed rituals it seems plausible that simple ritualistic observances giving vent to feelings of devotion had already begun to take shape even during the Buddhas lifetimeCertainly they would have done so shortly after the Parinibbana as is amply demonstrated by the funeral rites themselves according to the testimony of the Mahaparinibbana SuttaThe Buddha also encouraged a devotional attitude when he recommended pilgrimages to the four places that can inspire a faithful devotee the places where he was born attained Enlightenment preached the first sermon and attained ParinibbanaThe Buddha did discourage the wrong kind of emotional attachment to himself as evidenced by the case of Vakkali Thera who was reprimanded for his obsession with the beauty of the Buddhas physical presence his was a case of misplaced devotionRitualistic observances also pose a danger that they might be misapprehended as ends in themselves instead of being employed as means for channelling the devotional emotions into the correct pathIt is when they are wrongly practiced that they become impediments rather than aids to the spiritual lifeIt is to warn against this that the Buddha has categorized them under the term silabbataparamasa as one of the ten fetters and one of the four types of clingingCorrectly observed as means and not as ends ritualistic practices can serve to generate wholesome states of mind while certain other rituals collectively performed can serve as a means of strengthening the social solidarity among those who share the same spiritual idealsThus ceremonies and rituals as external acts which complement inward contemplative exercises cannot be called alien to or incompatible with canonical BuddhismTo the contrary they are an integral part of the living tradition of all schools of Buddhism including the TheravadaA ritual may be defined here as an outward act performed regularly and consistently in a context that confers upon it a religious significance not immediately evident in the act itselfA composite unity consisting of a number of subordinate ritualistic acts may be called a ceremonySuch observances have become inseparable from all organized religionsAnd owing to the fear awe and respect that characterize mans religious psychology such acts assume a solemnity and a sanctity of their ownRitual acts undertaken and performed by the Buddhists of Sri Lanka may be broadly classified under three headsActs performed for the acquisition of merit calculated to provide a basis for achieving Nibbana release from the cycle of becoming such acts of merit are at the same time expected to offer semitemporal rewards of comfort and happiness here and in the heavenly worlds in future livesThese supplementary forms of religious activity have arisen out of a natural need to augment the more austere way followed by the worldrenouncing disciplesActs directed towards securing worldly prosperity and averting calamities through disease and unseen forces of evil eg pirit chanting bodhipuja etcThose rituals that have been adopted from folk religionHence these are mainly semireligious in character like the tovil ceremoniesThey derive their power and authority primarily through the superhuman power of the Buddha and also through the hosts of spirits who are as it were commanded by invoking the power of the Buddha or of the Three Refuges  the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha  as a wholeAlmost all the religious activities that have a ceremonial and a ritualistic significance are regarded as acts for the acquisition of meritIn this sense all the religious activities of lay Buddhism can be explained as being oriented towards that endAccordingly the first two types of rituals basically have a meritgenerating character and thereby receive religious sanctionFor instance the idea of acquisition of merit through a religious act and its transference to the deities and soliciting their help has the scriptural sanction of the Mahaparinibbana Sutta itselfHere the Buddha says that wise men when residing in a particular area first offer alms to religious recluses and then transfer the merits to the deities of the area who help them in returnThis seems to indicate the early beginning of adoring vatthudevata or local deities in BuddhismMerit earned by the performance of a wholesome act is regarded as a sure way of obtaining a better life in the futureThe performance of these is also a means of expiation in the sense that the meritorious deeds have the effect of countering and hindering the operation of unwholesome kamma previously acquired and inheritedThus the range of merit is very wideFor the ordinary householder Nibbana is a goal to be achieved through a gradual process of evolution extending over many lives and therefore until he achieves that sublime state at some future date he continues to perform these acts in order to lead a happy lifeAll meritgenerating rituals are performed mainly with this end in viewBuddhism lacks any ceremony or ritual of initiation or admission like the upanayana in Hinduism or baptism in ChristianityThe traditional method of becoming a Buddhist is to repeat the formula of the Three Refuges and the Five Precepts when they are formally administered by a Buddhist monkThe formula of refuge is as followsThis avowal of confidence in the Triple Gem is repeated for a second time and a third timeNext the convert repeats in the following manner the Five Precepts which are meant to regulate his moral lifeAdinnadana veramani sikkhapadam samadiyamiI undertake the precept to abstain from taking things not givenKamesu micchacara veramani sikkhapadam samadiyamiI undertake the precept to abstain from sexual misconductMusavada veramani sikkhapadam samadiyamiI undertake the precept to abstain from false speechSuramerayamajjapamadatthana veramani sikkhapadam samadiyamiI undertake the precept to abstain from taking distilled and fermented liquors that cause intoxication and heedlessnessBy this method a hitherto nonBuddhist lay person becomes a lay disciple of the BuddhaIt has to be noted here that what is meant by taking refuge in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha is the placing of confidence in the attainments of the Buddha as a Teacher and in the efficacy of the Dhamma as a reliable means to liberationThe term Sangha here refers to the Ariya Sangha comprising the four pairs of noble ones ie the four practicing for the fruits and the four established in the fruitsIn this ceremony of initiation there is no recognition of salvation through the grace of a god or saviour as in theistic religionsOne goes for refuge as a way of expressing ones determination to follow the Buddhas path to liberation but one must also realize that the task of walking the path is ones own responsibilityWhile this is the method of formal admission of a new entrant into Buddhism there are also certain ritualistic practices observed when a child is born to Buddhist parentsThe babys first outing would be to a templeWhen the baby is fit to be taken out of doors the parents would select an auspicious day or a fullmoon day and take the child to the nearest templeThey would first place the child on the floor of the shrine room or in front of a statue of the Buddha for the purpose of obtaining the blessings of the Triple GemThis is a common sight at the Dalada Maligawa  the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic  in KandyAt the time of the daily religious ceremony of the temple one can observe how mothers hand over their babies to an officiating layman inside the shrine room who in turn keeps it for a few seconds on the floor near the Relic Chamber and hands it back to the motherThe mother accepts the child and gives a small fee to the kapuva for the service renderedThis practice too could be described as a ritual of initiationFor the adherent of Buddhism the ritual of worship is essentially a respectful recognition of the greatness of the Buddha as a spiritual teacherThe ritual also implies an expression of gratitude to the Buddha for having discovered and revealed to humankind the path leading out of the mass of worldly sufferingBoth these factors in combination make this ritual an expression of devotion as wellThe most common daily ritual of the Buddhist is that of personal worship which many devout Buddhists perform daily in their homesOn the communal level the ritual is observed on the poya days at a temple or a monasteryA distinction may be made between simple respectful salutation and the ritualistic worship accompanied by offerings of increasing complexity including food drink and clothingThe former type is only an expression of respect and reverence as when a person clasps his hands in the gesture of worship in front of a religious symbol and recites a simple phrase like the wellknown Namo tassa formula nowadays the term sadhu has become quite popular with the Sinhala Buddhists for this purposeIn the ritualistic form of worship the articles of offering are first respectfully placed on the altar in front of a statue of the Buddha or a dagaba or any other place of religious significance where such worship is performedNext the devotee clasps his hands in the gesture of worship and solemnly recites various stanzas and formulas thereby making the offerings formally validEvery act of Buddhist worship begins with the wellknown formula of homage to the Buddha Namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammasambuddhassa which is repeated thriceThis is followed by the Refuge formula and the Five Precepts given earlierThe next step is paying homage to the Three Gems in three separate formulas which recount nine virtues of the Buddha six virtues of the Dhamma and nine virtues of the SanghaThese formulas are extracted from the Pali Nikayas and have become the standard formulas with which the Three Gems are worshippedThe physical posture adopted by the devotees when performing these acts of worship may vary according to the solemnity of the occasion or the degree of the devotion of the worshipperIn the most respectful form of worship eg when worshipping a dagaba in which the relics  a bone hair bowl etc of the Buddha  are enshrined one touches the ground with five parts of the bodyThe two postures of squatting and kneeling are also popularThe crosslegged posture and the standing position are also sometimes adoptedWhatever be the posture taken it should be accompanied with hands clasped together in adorationOf the many articles of offering used at present in this kind of worship in Sri Lanka flowers have become the most important and popularThey constitute the minimum requirement at any form of Buddhist worshipOne can observe how the devotees arrange the flowers in various patterns on the altarThe color smell and quality of the flowers are taken into account when selecting them for offeringBefore being offered the flowers are bathed with filtered waterSometimes they are arranged in a tray and offeredA flowers blooming upon contact with light is regarded as symbolic of the attainment of Enlightenment hence flowers become quite a fitting article for offering to the Buddha the Enlightened OneAs was mentioned earlier an essential part of the ritual of offering flowers is the recital of the following Pali stanza whereby the offering is made validThis mass of flowers endowed with color fragrance and quality I offer at the lotuslike feet of the King of SagesI worship the Buddha with these flowers by the merit of this may I attain freedomEven as these flowers do fade so does my body come to destructionIt is of interest to note that this stanza incorporates the Buddhist idea of the impermanence of all phenomenaMeritacquisition is also regarded as contributing towards the attainment of Nibbanic freedomAnother popular offering of much importance is that of lighted lamps usually of coconut oilAs the Buddha is regarded as the dispeller of the darkness of ignorance when lighted lamps are offered in his name this metaphorical contrast between the light of knowledge and the darkness of ignorance is taken as the theoretical basis for the ritualThis kind of symbolism being too deep for the vast majority of ordinary people their motive for this ritual is usually the desire to acquire merit or to avert the evil influence of a bad planetary conjunctionHowever it is the former idea that is implied in the traditional stanza used by the Buddhists of Sri Lanka for this offeringWith this lamp lit with camphor that dispels all darkness I worship the Perfectly Enlightened One who is a lamp unto the three worlds and is the dispeller of darknessThe epithets tilokadipa and tamonuda as applied to the Buddha are significant in this contextThe stanza itself seems to testify to the popularity of the offering of camphor in early timesBut nowadays even when coconut oil has replaced camphor the stanza has survived without changeThe offering of lighted lamps had been a popular ritual even in ancient timesThe Bodhitree and the dagaba are the two main objects or places where the ritual is usually performedThe offering of lamps is one of the main aspects of the worship of the BodhitreeAs it was under a Bodhitree that the Buddha attained Enlightenment it is quite natural that lamps be lit under that tree not only in memory of the great event but also as a ritual whereby the devotee could expect to obtain a ray of that light of wisdom attained by the Great SageThus the entire ritual becomes a spiritual exercise the merits of which are transferred to all other beings gods humans and spiritsDagabas constitute another place where this popular offering is madeConsequently along with the floweraltar the lampstand too has become a necessary adjunct of the dagabasOne can also see that the Bodhitree in most temples is surrounded by a platform built of brick or stone in which niches are made to hold lighted oil lampsThe niches are meant to shelter the lamps from wind and rainIn any Buddhist temple there are many other places where lamps can be lit in that waySometimes special lampstands are constructed for the purposeOf special significance is the lamp called the dolosmahepahana sometimes found in Buddhist temples and devalayasIt is called thus because it is expected to keep burning allyear roundSpecial light offerings are also made on auspicious occasionsOn fullmoon days when devotees flock to the temples lamps are lit in large numbers for it is the custom among the Sri Lankan Buddhists invariably to take flowers and coconut oil on their visits to the temple as two indispensable articles of worshipThere are also occasions when devotees light and offer a particular large number of lamps for special purposes such as redeeming a vow or on special occasions like Vesak DayMany Buddhists perform the ritual of light offering to counter evil planetary influencesIn order to obtain maximum results from the ritual the devotees make it a point to purify themselves completely before attending the ceremony by bathing and wearing fresh clean clothesCoconut oil used as an illuminant is specially prepared for the purpose and taken separately from the coconut oil used for household purposesWicks are prepared from a clean white fresh clothSometimes the inhabitants of an entire village cooperate in holding a massscale lamp offeringFor instance they may offer lighted lamps in memory of the elements of the Dhamma comprising the Buddhas TeachingThis important Buddhist ritual was practiced even in ancient Sri LankaKing Dutugemunu is recorded to have lit one thousand lamps with ghee as the illuminant and with white wicks burning perpetually in twelve sacred places in AnuradhapuraKing Vasabha is also said to have lit one thousand oil lamps at Cetiyapabbata Thuparama Mahathupa and the BodhitreeToday this ritual has become so popular and elaborate that the annual Vesak festival commemorating the birth Enlightenment and Parinibbana of the Buddha has become more or less a festival of lightsVesak lanterns of various kinds and shapes are lit in Buddhist homes on this dayPandals well illuminated with multicolored electric bulbs depicting various scenes from the Masters life and from the Jataka stories also constitute a type of light offering to the BuddhaYet another aspect of the ritual of light offering is the burning of camphor near the object of worship like dagabas Buddha statues etcCamphor gives out a fragrant smell as it burns and is also regarded as having a very pure flame although its smoke has a strong blackening effectCamphorburners have been found in ancient temples showing that this was an ancient practiceThe offering of food and drink is still another aspect of the ritual of worshipWhen food is offered to the Buddha in a religious place it is usually done in front of a BuddhaimageIf it is the morning meal that is offered it would be something suitable for breakfast usually milkriceIf it is lunch it would be the usual riceandcurry meal and is invariably offered before noonAt the Dalada Maligawa in Kandy and the Sri Mahabodhi in Anuradhapura these rituals are performed regularly and with meticulous care and also somewhat elaborately accompanied by other subsidiary rituals like the beating of drumsIt is an important part of this ritual that whatever food is offered in this manner should be separately prepared with special care and should not be tasted before the offeringThe stanza that is popularly used for the offering of food runs as followsO Lord accept with favor this food which has been ritualistically preparedReceive it O Noble One out of compassionAs regards the offering of drinks and beverages it is customary to offer these prepared from fruitjuicesUnlike the solid foods these may be offered in the afternoon in keeping with the meal habits of the Buddhist monksOffering of incense generally consists of joss sticks these being the most easily availableOtherwise this offering is made by putting certain kinds of sweetsmelling powders or incense into glowing charcoal so that it smokes wellA kind of resin known locally as sambrani is the variety generally usedThe chew of betel is yet another item of offeringThis is mostly for consumption after meals and consists of betel leaves arecanut and certain other items like cloves nutmeg cardamons etcwhich give a pleasant smell and a pungent taste when chewedFor every kind of offering there are separate stanzas like the one quoted earlier for foodThese stanzas are composed in Pali which is supposed to be the language in which the Buddha preached his doctrineWhen visiting the temple the object of worship that ranks first is the dagaba enshrining the bonerelics of the BuddhaThere are three categories of worshipful objects bodily relics consisting of the bones collected after cremation those articles the Buddha used eg the almsbowl Bodhitree etc and those memorials that have been erected on his account as a mark of remembrance eg images paintings etcThe devotee is expected to worship these in due order reciting the appropriate stanzas and making at least an offering of a few flowersAn important aspect of the worship of the dagaba and the Bodhitree is the custom of circumambulation as a mark of respectUsually three rounds are done always keeping the object of worship to the right side and with the hands clasped together in adorationAs regards dagaba worship in Sri Lanka the local Buddhists have a separate stanza for worshipping each of the sixteen sacred places hallowed by the Lord Buddha on his three visits to the islandThere is also a popular stanza that covers in a general manner all the three categories of worshipful objects mentioned aboveForever do I worship all the dagabas situated all over all the bodily relics the Mahabodhi and BuddhaimagesThe worship of the dagaba or stupa is an important meritacquiring act of devotional Buddhism in Sri Lanka as also in other Buddhist landsThe first such dagaba to be constructed after the official introduction of Buddhism into the country by the arahant Mahinda was the Thuparama at Anuradhapura which enshrines the collarbone of the BuddhaIt was constructed by the first Buddhist ruler of Sri Lanka King Devanampiya Tissa in the rd century BSince then dagabas have become so popular among the local Buddhists that almost every village temple has a dagaba as an indispensable featureA special ritual connected with the dagaba is the enshrining of relics which is done with much ceremony at a specially selected astrologically auspicious moment called nakataA similar ritual is that of pinnaclesetting which is the concluding stage in the construction of a dagabaIt should be mentioned here that scriptural sanction for dagaba worship is found in the words of the Buddha himself in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta where he has enumerated four categories of individuals worthy of dagabasThese are the Tathagata a Paccekabuddha a disciple of the Tathagata and a universal monarchThe worship and offerings made to the Buddhas body after his passing away may also be cited as an instance in this connectionThe most important item that comes within the uddesika kind of sacred object is the Buddhaimage which is found in every temple in its imagehouseIn addition to the central image or images the inside walls of the temple  and sometimes the ceiling as well  are covered with paintings depicting events from the Buddhas life as well as from his past lives as a Bodhisatta recorded in the Jataka storiesAn important ceremony associated with the Buddhaimage is the ritual of painting its eyes which is performed with much care on an auspicious occasion as the last item of its constructionUntil this is done the image is not considered an adequate representation of the BuddhaCollective worship of the Buddha is generally performed in a public place of worship so that anyone who wishes may participate in a temple before the shrine room at a dagaba a Bodhitree or any other such placeThe devotees stand in a row in front of the place of worship and pass the items of offering from hand to hand towards the shrine room dagaba or the BodhitreeThese offerings usually consist of bowls or vases of flowers incense joss sticks beverages fruit drinks medicinal items oillamps etcHere no distinction of age position or sex is observedAll participate in a common act of meritA bhikkhu or a number of bhikkhus may sometimes head the lineThe commonest of the Buddhapujas is the one performed in the evening around pm known as the gilampasa Buddhapuja or the Buddhaoffering consisting of medicaments and beveragesIf the Buddhapuja is done in the morning it would be one consisting of milkrice or any other item of food suitable for breakfastThe midday food also may be offered in this mannerThe midday meal is offered to the Buddha when lay people bring food to the monastery to offer as alms to the bhikkhusFirst under the guidance of a bhikkhu they perform the offering to the Buddha who is represented symbolically by relics and an image thereafter the food is offered to the resident bhikkhusIt is the established tradition that in whatever circumstances alms are offered to the bhikkhus the first portions are offered to the Buddha beforehandThe variations in the kinds of food offered are in keeping with the meal habits of the Buddha and his monkdisciples who refrain from taking solid food and milkfoods after middayOnce the offerings are placed in the appropriate place lamps lit and incense burnt stanzas are recited for each kind of offering made so that the offerings become validThis is done by a bhikkhu who first administers the Refuges and Precepts and then recites the relevant stanzas aloud while the other participants with their hands clasped in adoration repeat them in chorus after the bhikkhuSometimes this kind of public Buddhapuja is accompanied by drumming and horns called hevisipuja or offering of music which usually accompanies many Buddhist functionsAs the final item of the programme one of the participating bhikkhus delivers a short sermon explaining the significance of the occasionIt may also be mentioned here that this kind of public puja is performed as a general act of meritacquisition on religiously important days such as the fullmoon days or in remembrance of important dead personagesIn the latter case the ritual is held on the death anniversary of the person concernedIt is believed that the dead person can partake of the merits transferred to him from his new existence and thereby obtain relief from any unfortunate realm in which he might have been bornIf the ritual is performed for such a purpose the participating monk would specially mention this fact and transfer the merits earnedWhatever be the purpose for which the ceremony is held the concluding part is marked by certain features which are of further interestOne is the usual practice of the transference of merit to all beings including gods and spirits by reciting the appropriate stanzasAnother is the general aspiration that the participants make to the effect that by the merits earned from the ritual they may not be born into the company of foolish and unworthy friends but into the company of wise and virtuous men until they attain NibbanaThey also do not fail to add the final attainment of Nibbana to this listYet another popular aspiration which has a greater social significance is the followingThe ritual is concluded by asking for pardon for whatever lapses may have occurred inadvertentlyO Lord Tathagata of extensive wisdom may you excuse me for whatever transgressions might have been done by me through body speech or mind due to negligenceSometimes a similar request is made to the Dhamma and the Sangha as wellHowever as the idea of pardoning ones sins is foreign to Buddhism this kind of request would be meaningful only if the devotee does so with full understanding as an expiatory act as a means of selfreformation for the Buddha unlike the God of theistic religions cannot forgive sinsAnother kind of Buddhapuja is the one regularly done in temples and Buddhist devalayasIt is the daily offering of food and drink made to the Buddha by the temple authoritiesAt the Dalada Maligawa in Kandy and the Sri Mahabodhi at Anuradhapura offerings of this kind are made on a solemn and grand scaleThese two places assume this significance because they are the two most deeply venerated sacred places for the Buddhists of Sri LankaThe breakfast noon meal and the evening drinks are all offered regularly at fixed hours accompanied by drumming and horn playingOften the public also make their own offeringsAnother important Buddhist ritual is the honoring of the Buddha with what appears to be a relic of the musical performance held in order to revere and pay homage to the sacred memory of the MasterThe historical beginning of this form of worship can be traced as far back as the time of the BuddhaA passage in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta records that after his passing away while the body of the Buddha was lying in state for seven days at Kusinara in the capital of the Mallas complete musical performances inclusive of dance song and orchestration were held in his honorThis undoubtedly was an unreserved expression by the lay patrons of their deep veneration for the MasterOf this kind of offering all that seems to have survived is drumming and some light dancing engaged in by the drummers themselves to the drumbeat and hornsIn Sri Lanka the ritual is performed by the professionals belonging to the drummer caste and as an offering it is popularly known as sabdapuja or the offering of soundThis orchestration is collectively called hevisi and usually consists of two drums a twindrum with one face for each and turned upwards and a hornlike instrument called horanava referred to earlierDrumming of this type with a bigger number of drummers is an essential part of Buddhist processions as wellThis kind of drumming also takes place at other Buddhist ceremonies such as pirit chanting and almsgiving to be described belowAt important temples where offerings of food are made to the Buddha and the deities at meal times drumming is performed to coincide with the offering and continues until the ritual of offering is overThis kind of regular service is known as tevavaThe ritual may also be held on Poya days especially the fullmoon day in temples as a special offering to the BuddhaAn important point to be noted in this pujava is that while the other kinds of offering are made by the worshipper himself in this case he hires professionals to make the offering on his behalfBut in big temples like the Dalada Maligawa at Kandy payments in money are not usually made as the drummers have the hereditary right to the tenure of the temple lands in return for which these services are performedThe veneration of the Bodhitree has been a popular and a widespread ritual in Sri Lanka from the time a sapling of the original Bodhitree at Buddhagaya was brought from India by the Theri Sanghamitta and planted at Anuradhapura during the reign of King Devanampiya Tissa in the third century BSince then a Bodhitree has become a necessary feature of every Buddhist temple in the islandThe ritualistic worship of trees as abodes of tree deities was widely prevalent in ancient India even before the advent of BuddhismThis is exemplified by the wellknown case of Sujatas offering of milkrice to the Bodhisatta who was seated under a banyan tree on the eve of his Enlightenment in the belief that he was the deity living in that treeBy making offerings to these deities inhabiting trees the devotees expect various forms of help from themThe practice was prevalent in preBuddhist Sri Lanka as wellAccording to the Mahavamsa King Pandukabhaya fixed a banyan tree near the western gate of Anuradhapura as the abode of Vessavana the god of wealth and the regent of the North as well as the king of the yakkhasThe same king set apart a palmyra palm as the abode of vyadhadeva the god of the huntAfter the introduction of the Bodhitree this cult took a new turnWhile the old practice was not totally abandoned pride of place was accorded to the worship of the pipal tree which had become sacred to the Buddhists as the tree under which Gotama Buddha attained EnlightenmentThus there is a difference between the worship of the Bodhitree and that of other treesTo the Buddhists the Bodhitree became a sacred object belonging to the paribhogika group of the threefold division of sacred monuments while the ordinary veneration of trees which also exists sidebyside with the former in Sri Lanka is based on the belief already mentioned ie that there are spirits inhabiting these trees and that they can help people in exchange for offeringsThe Buddhists also have come to believe that powerful Buddhist deities inhabit even the Bodhitrees that receive worship in the purely Buddhist senseHence it becomes clear that the reverence shown to a tree is not addressed to the tree itselfHowever it also has to be noted that the Bodhitree received veneration in India even before it assumed this Buddhist significance this practice must have been based on the general principle of tree worship mentioned aboveOnce the tree assumed Buddhist significance its sanctity became particularized while the deities inhabiting it also became associated with Buddhism in some formAt the same time the tree became a symbol representing the Buddha as wellThis symbolism was confirmed by the Buddha himself when he recommended the planting of the Ananda Bodhitree at Jetavana for worship and offerings during his absenceFurther the place where the Buddha attained Enlightenment is mentioned by the Buddha as one of the four places of pilgrimage that should cause serene joy in the minds of the faithfulAs Ananda Coomaraswamy points out every Buddhist temple and monastery in India once had its Bodhitree and flower altar as is now the case in Sri LankaKing Devanampiya Tissa the first Buddhist king of Sri Lanka is said to have bestowed the whole country upon the Bodhitree and held a magnificent festival after planting it with great ceremonyThe entire country was decorated for the occasionThe Mahavamsa refers to similar ceremonies held by his successors as wellIt is said that the rulers of Sri Lanka performed ceremonies in the trees honor in every twelfth year of their reignKing Dutugemunu performed such a ceremony at a cost of pieces of moneyKing Bhatika Abhaya held a ceremony of watering the sacred tree which seems to have been one of many such special pujasOther kings too according to the Mahavamsa expressed their devotion to the Bodhitree in various waysIt is recorded that forty Bodhisaplings that grew from the seeds of the original Bodhitree at Anuradhapura were planted at various places in the island during the time of Devanampiya Tissa himselfThe local Buddhists saw to it that every monastery in the island had its own Bodhitree and today the tree has become a familiar sight all derived most probably from the original tree at Anuradhapura through seedsHowever it may be added here that the notion that all the Bodhitrees in the island are derived from the original tree is only an assumptionThe existence of the tree prior to its introduction by the Theri Sanghamitta cannot be proved or disprovedThe ceremony of worshipping this sacred tree first begun by King Devanampiya Tissa and followed by his successors with unflagging interest has continued up to the present dayThe ceremony is still as popular and meaningful as at the beginningIt is natural that this should be so for the veneration of the tree fulfills the emotional and devotional needs of the pious heart in the same way as does the veneration of the Buddhaimage and to a lesser extent of the dagabaMoreover its association with deities dedicated to the cause of Buddhism who can also aid pious worshippers in their mundane affairs contributes to the popularity and vitality of BodhiworshipThe main center of devotion in Sri Lanka today is of course the ancient tree at Anuradhapura which in addition to its religious significance has a historical importance as wellAs the oldest historical tree in the world it has survived for over years even when the city of Anuradhapura was devastated by foreign enemiesToday it is one of the most sacred and popular places of pilgrimage in the islandThe tree itself is very well guarded the most recent protection being a goldplated railing around the baseOrdinarily pilgrims are not allowed to go near the foot of the tree in the upper terraceThey have to worship and make their offerings on altars provided on the lower terrace so that no damage is done to the tree by the multitude that throng thereThe place is closely guarded by those entrusted with its upkeep and protection while the daily rituals of cleaning the place watering the tree making offerings etc are performed by bhikkhus and laymen entrusted with the workThe performance of these rituals is regarded as of great merit and they are performed on a lesser scale at other important Bodhitrees in the island as wellThus this tree today receives worship and respect as a symbol of the Buddha himself a tradition which as stated earlier could be traced back to the Ananda Bodhitree at Jetavana of the Buddhas own timeThe Vibhanga Commentary says that the bhikkhu who enters the courtyard of the Bodhitree should venerate the tree behaving with all humility as if he were in the presence of the BuddhaThus one of the main items of the daily ritual at the Anuradhapura Bodhitree is the offering of alms as if unto the Buddha himselfA special ritual held annually at the shrine of the Anuradhapura tree is the hanging of gold ornaments on the treePious devotees offer valuables money and various other articles during the performance of this ritualAnother popular ritual connected with the Bodhitree is the lighting of coconutoil lamps as an offering especially to avert the evil influence of inauspicious planetary conjunctionsWhen a person passes through a troublesome period in life he may get his horoscope read by an astrologer in order to discover whether he is under bad planetary influencesIf so one of the recommendations would invariably be a bodhipuja one important item of which would be the lighting of a specific number of coconutoil lamps around a Bodhitree in a templeThe other aspects of this ritual consist of the offering of flowers milkrice fruits betel medicinal oils camphor and coinsThese coins are washed in saffron water and separated for offering in this mannerThe offering of coins as an act of meritacquisition has assumed ritualistic significance with the Buddhists of the islandEvery temple has a charity box into which the devotees drop a few coins as a contribution for the maintenance of the monks and the monasteryOfferings at devalayas should inevitably be accompanied by such a giftAt many wayside shrines there is provision for the offering of panduru and travelers en route in the hope of a safe and successful journey rarely fail to make their contributionWhile the coins are put into the charity box all the other offerings would be arranged methodically on an altar near the tree and the appropriate stanzas that make the offering valid are recitedAnother part of the ritual is the hanging of flags on the branches of the tree in the expectation of getting ones wishes fulfilledBathing the tree with scented water is also a necessary part of the ritualSo is the burning of incense camphor etcOnce all these offerings have been completed the performers would circumambulate the tree once or thrice reciting an appropriate stanzaThe commonest of such stanzas is as followsI worship this Bodhitree seated under which the Teacher attained omniscience by overcoming all enemical forcesI too worship this great Bodhitree which was honored by the Leader of the WorldMy homage to thee O King BodhiThe ritual is concluded by the usual transference of merit to the deities that protect the Buddhas DispensationIn their religious observances the Sri Lankan Buddhists have adopted from Indian tradition the use of the lunar calendarThe four phases of the moon are the prenewmoon day when the moon is totally invisible the halfmoon of the waxing fortnight the full moon and the halfmoon of the waning fortnightOwing to the moons fullness of size as well as its effulgence the fullmoon day is treated as the most auspicious of the four phasesHence the most important religious observances are held on fullmoon days and the lesser ones in conjunction with the other phasesIn the Buddhist calendar the full moon as the acme of the waxing process is regarded as the culmination of the month and accordingly the period between two full moons is one lunar monthThe religious observance days are called poya daysThe Sinhala term poya is derived from the Pali and Sanskrit form uposatha primarily signifying fast day Fasting on this day was a preBuddhist practice among the religious sects of ancient IndiaWhile the monks use the monthly moonless day and the fullmoon day for their confessional ritual and communal recitation of the code of discipline the lay devotees observe the day by visiting temples for worship and also by taking upon themselves the observance of the Eight PreceptsA practicing Buddhist observes the poya day by visiting a temple for the rituals of worship and often by undertaking the Eight PreceptsThe Eight Precepts include the Five Precepts with the third changed to abstinence from unchastity and the following three additional rulesto abstain from dancing singing music and improper shows and from ornamenting the body with garlands scents unguents etcto abstain from the use of high and luxurious beds and seatsIf one decides to observe the Eight Precepts one would wake up early bathe and clad oneself in clean white garments and go to the nearest templeThe incumbent monk administers the precepts to the entire group assembled for the purposeThereafter they would spend the day according to a set timetable which would include sermons pujas periods of meditation and Dhamma discussionsAt meditation centers there will be more periods of meditation and fewer sermons and pujasThe observance of the Eight Precepts is a ritualistic practice of moral discipline quite popular among the Sinhala BuddhistsWhile the Five Precepts serve as the moral base for ordinary people the Eight Precepts point to a higher level of training aimed at advancement along the path of liberationThe popular practice is to observe them on fullmoon days and among a few devout lay Buddhists on the other phases of the moon as wellThe poya observance which is as old as Buddhism itself has been followed by the Sinhala Buddhists up to the present day even after the Christian calendar came to be used for secular mattersOwing to its significance in the religious life of the local Buddhists all the fullmoon days have been declared public holidays by the governmentAnother noteworthy fact about this day is that every fullmoon poya has assumed some ritualistic significance in one way or otherThe first and the foremost of the poya holy days is the fullmoon day of Vesak commemorating the birth Enlightenment and passing away of the BuddhaThe significance of Vesak is further heightened for the Sinhala Buddhists as Sri Lankan tradition holds that it was on the Vesak Poya Day in the eighth year after his Enlightenment that the Buddha paid his third visit to Sri Lanka journeying to Kelaniya on the invitation of the Naga King ManiakkhikaConsequently Kelaniya has become a very popular place of worship and pilgrimage the center of worship there being the celebrated dagaba enshrining the gemset throne offered to the Buddha by the NagasAn annual procession is held there to commemorate the eventBoth in importance and in temporal sequence the next significant poya is the fullmoon of Poson which is specially noteworthy to the Sri Lankan Buddhists as the day on which Emperor Asokas son the arahant Mahinda officially introduced Buddhism to the island in the rd century BAccordingly in addition to the normal ritualistic observances undertaken on a poya day on Poson day devotees flock to Anuradhapura the ancient capital city of the country for it was there that arahant Mahinda converted the then ruler King Devanampiya Tissa and his court to Buddhism thereby setting in motion a series of events that finally made Sri Lanka the home of Theravada BuddhismEven today on Poson Poya Anuradhapura becomes the center of Buddhist activityMihintale the spot where the momentous encounter between the Elder and the King took place accordingly receives the reverential attention of the devoteesThe two rituals of pilgrimage and the observance of the Eight Precepts are combined hereProcessions commemorative of the event referred to as Mihundu Peraheras are held in various parts of the countryThe next poya is Esala which commemorates several significant events in the history of BuddhismThe most prominent of these is the Buddhas preaching of his First Sermon the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta to the five ascetics at the Deer Park near Benares thereby inaugurating his public ministryThe other noteworthy events connected with this day include the conception of the Bodhisatta in the womb of Queen Maya his Great Renunciation the performance of the Twin Miracle and his preaching the Abhidhamma for the first time in the Tavatimsa heavenAn additional factor that enhances the value of this poya to Sri Lanka is the first local ordination of a Sri Lankan when Prince Arittha the nephew of the king entered the Order at Anuradhapura under arahant Mahinda following the introduction of BuddhismOn this day there also took place the laying of the foundation for the celebrated dagaba the Mahathupa or the Ruwanvelisaya and also its enshrinement of relics by King DutugemunuIt is owing to the combination of all these events that the Sinhala Buddhists fittingly observe the day ceremonially by holding Esala festivals throughout the island giving pride of place to the internationally famous Kandy Esala PeraheraThe term perahera primarily meaning procession signifies a popular Buddhist ceremony replete with many rituals commencing and culminating respectively with the kapplanting and the watercutting ceremoniesThese two ceremonies are respectively the introductory and the concluding rites of the annual Esala festivals held in July and August in various parts of the islandThey are essentially connected with the Buddhist deities either to invite their blessings or to give thanks to them for favors receivedDuring this period every year such religious festivals are held in almost all the religious centers of Sri Lanka where there are abodes dedicated to various Buddhist deitiesHowever the festival par excellence of this category is the Kandy Esala Perahera which is connected with the Temple of the Tooth and the abodes of the four Buddhist deities Vishnu Kataragama Natha and the Goddess PattiniThe main feature of all these festivals held during this period is the elaborate procession held on the lines of the Kandy Esala PeraheraBoth the kapplanting and watercutting ceremonies are performed by the lay officiating priests of the devalaya concerned who are traditionally the experts regarding the details of their performanceThese details are generally regarded as secret and are not divulged to the profane publicThe preliminary rite of kapplanting consists of planting a shaft usually fashioned from a felled young jak tree which must have borne no fruitWhen cut this tree exudes a white sap which is regarded as a symbol of prosperityEven felling the tree is done with several attendant rituals at an auspicious time the trunk is divided into four one for each of the devalayas where it is carried with drums and attendanceOn the day of the new moon at an auspicious hour the kaps thus prepared are set up in the ground in a special place decorated with leaves flowers and fruitsFor five nights small processions are conducted within the devalaya precincts around the consecrated kapsSometimes benedictory stanzas are chanted by monksThis rite of kap is a kind of vow that the Esala festival consisting mainly of the perahera will be held it is also an invitation to the deities to be present during the festival providing the necessary protection for its successful performanceIn this sense it is this ritual that inaugurates the festivalThe watercutting ceremony which is the concluding ritual of the Esala festival is performed in the early hours of the day following the final peraheraThe officiating laypriest proceeds on a caparisoned elephant to a selected place along a river bankHe would either go to a selected spot in the river by boat or wade through the water to a particular spot and after drawing a magic circle on the water with the sword he carries he cuts the water and fills the vessel he carried there with water from that spotBefore doing so he empties the water that he took in this same manner the previous yearHe then returns to the devalaya and the vessel of water is kept there until the following yearThe ritual is repeated annually in an identical mannerThis is believed to be a rainmaking ceremony of sympathetic magic which type of ritual is quite common in agrarian societies the world overThe Buddhists seem to have adopted this to suit their purposesThe annual Esala Perahera in Kandy held in honor of the Sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha is the most colorful traditional procession in the countryIt is the prototype of the other peraheras held elsewhere in the island in such places as Kataragama Aluthnuwara Lankatilaka Bellanwila Devinuwara etcThe Kandy Perahera is itself the latest expression of the annual festival in honor of the Tooth Relic that has been held with state patronage from the time the relic was brought to Sri Lanka from India in the th century AAlthough periodically there have been intermittent breaks due to unsettled political conditions the festival was never neglected intentionallyThis had been so even during colonial timesRespected as the palladium of Sinhala royalty the Relic had been accommodated in different parts of the country depending on the change of the capital cityUltimately it came to stay in Kandy which was the last royal seat of the Sinhala peopleEsala Poya assumes prominence for yet another ritual of the Sri Lankan BuddhistsThis is the annual rains retreat of the monks Vassa which commences on the day following the Esala full moonOn the next poya day Nikini those monks who failed to commence the normal Vassa on the day following Esala Poya are allowed to enter the late VassaThe poya that follows Nikini is Binara which assumes solemnity as marking the inauguration of the Order of Bhikkhunis with the ordination of Queen Mahapajapati and her retinueNext follows the Vap Poya which concludes the final month of the threemonth rains retreatDuring the following month kathina robes are offered to the monks who have duly completed the VassaThe high esteem in which this ritual is held by the Sinhala Buddhists may be gauged from the fact that the month is popularly referred to as the month of robesThe November full moon called Il signifies the terminal point for the kathina ritualIt is also the day for commemorating such events as the despatch of the first sixty disciples by the Buddha on missionary work the prospective Buddha Metteyya being declared a sure Buddhatobe by Gotama Buddha and the passing away of the arahant Sariputta the Buddhas foremost discipleThe Unduwap Poya that follows in December is of great moment to Sri Lanka as commemorating two memorable events connected with the visit of Theri Sanghamitta sister of arahant Mahinda from India in the third century BThe first of these events was the arrival at Anuradhapura of a sapling of the sacred Bodhitree at Buddhagaya brought to Sri Lanka by SanghamittaThe planting of this tree is the origin of the Bodhipuja in the countryThe other memorable event commemorated by this poya is the establishment of the Order of Nuns in Sri Lanka by the Theri Sanghamitta when she ordained Queen Anula and her entourage of women at AnuradhapuraRecords indicate that the Bhikkhuni Sangha thus established flourished during the Anuradhapura period but disappeared after the decline of that kingdomHistorical records are silent as to the reasons for its extinction but they do report how the Sinhala Bhikkhuni Sangha helped in the establishment of the Order of Nuns in ChinaIn the th century a group of Sinhala nuns headed by the Bhikkhuni Devasara went to China to confer higher ordination there and the Bhikkhuni Sangha thus established survives there to this dayThe Sinhala Buddhists commemorate this poya day with peraheras observance of the Eight Precepts and meetingsThe day is designated Sanghamitta DayNowadays the dasasil matas take an active part in initiating these commemorative functionsNext follows the Durutu Poya when the Sinhala Buddhists commemorate the first visit of the Buddha to the islandAccording to the Mahavamsa nine months after his Enlightenment the Buddha visited present Mahiyangana in the Badulla District where stands the dagaba by that name enshrining the Buddhas hair relics and the collar boneThe Buddhists remember the event by holding an annual peraheraThis muchvenerated dagaba is also of consequence as the first edifice of this type to be constructed here originating the ritual of dagaba worship in Sri LankaThe poya that follows Navam Poya celebrates the Buddhas appointment of the two arahants Sariputta and Moggallana as his two chief disciplesIt also marks the Buddhas decision to attain Parinibbana in three months timeThe Medin Poya in March is hallowed by the Buddhas first visit to his parental home after his Enlightenment during which he ordained the princes Rahula Nanda and many others as monksThe month that follows is called Bak which corresponds to AprilIn this month it is not the fullmoon day but the newmoon day that invites attention as signalizing the Buddhas second visit to Sri Lanka when he visited Nagadipa on the day preceding the newmoon day in the fifth year after his EnlightenmentThe above brief account of the twelve poya days demonstrates how the poya day has become intimately connected with the life of the Buddha and consequently with the principal events of early Buddhist historyThe Sri Lankan Buddhists quite accustomed as they are to commemorate such events with rituals and ceremonies in full measure have maintained these traditions up to the presentPirit is a collective term designating a set of protective chants or runes sanctioned by the Buddha for the use of both laymen and bhikkhusPiritchanting is a very popular ceremony among the Buddhists of Sri LankaAs the term itself implies it means a safety rune the ceremonial recital of which is regarded as capable of warding off all forms of evil and danger including disease the evil influence of the planets evil spirits etcThese may be real dangers to the safety of persons and property as well as superstitiously believedin calamitiesIn addition to this curative and positive aspect pirit is also chanted for the attainment of general successIn the domestic and social life of the Sri Lankan Buddhist no important function can be considered complete without this ceremonyHowever the ceremony may vary from the simple to the highly elaborate depending on the occasion and the status of the sponsorThe essence of the pirit ceremony consists in the ritualistic chanting of certain Pali texts selected from the canonical scripturesThese extracts are found collected and arranged in a particular order in the Book of Parittas or PiritPota known in Pali as CatubhanavaraIt contains extracts including such suttas as the Ratana Mangala Metta Atanatiya etcThe use of protective spells  variously known as paritta rakkha mantra dharani kavaca etc against various dangers has been a common practice among the Indians from very early timesThe Buddha himself is said to have adopted the practice on several occasionsThe public recitation of the Ratana Sutta at Vesali is the best known instanceThe Khandha Paritta Atanatiya Sutta and the Metta Sutta are some parittas that have received the sanction of the Buddha himselfAs the parittas generally embody statements of truth as taught in Buddhism their recitation is regarded as an asseveration of truth whereby evil can be avertedThe Ratana Sutta is a good example of this kind of parittaIt draws its power by wishing the listeners safety after affirming the excellent qualities of the Three Gems of Buddhism  the Buddha Dhamma and the SanghaThe power of virtue contained in the Mangala Sutta and the power of loving kindness contained in the Metta Sutta are two other aspects that make pirit effectiveThe power of the sound waves resulting from the sonorous and rhythmic recitation and also from particular combinations of certain letters and syllables also play a part in exercising this beneficial influenceThe vibrating sound waves produced by the sonorous and mellifluous chanting adds to the effect of the truths enunciatedThe ceremonial recitation with various ritualistic observances and with the presence of the Triple Gem in the form of the relic casket representing the Buddha the PiritPota representing the Dhamma and the reciting bhikkhus representing the Sangha are additional factors that are regarded as increasing the efficacy of pirit chantingAmong the laity of Burma and of Sri Lanka the book of parittas is more widely known than any other Pali bookAny Buddhist educated or not knows what it is and holds it in honor and respectEven in ancient times the blessings of the pirit ceremony were sought in times of national calamities just as in Vesali at the time of the BuddhaKing Upatissa Sena II and Kassapa V are three such Sinhala monarchs who had the ceremony performed under such circumstancesThe incorporation of the item called dorakadaasna as shall be seen shows that it is a ritual that has gradually been elaborated in course of timeThe simplest form of the pirit ceremony is held when what is called the mahapirita  the Mangala Ratana and Metta Suttas and a few benedictory stanzas  is chanted by a few monks usually three or four three times with a break in betweenThe three times may consist of the morning and evening of one day and the morning of the following day or the evening of one day and the following morning and eveningThe monks are conducted to the particular household and the chanting takes place in any room of the house according to choiceThe monks sit around a table on which a clean white cloth is spread and flowers and puffed rice are strewnA pot of filtered water is also placed in the center of the table and one end of a ball of threestranded thread is twisted around itThe thread then passes through the hands of the reciting monks and is next held by the person or the persons on whose behalf the chanting is being doneThese would be seated on a mat on the ground in front of the reciting monksThe water in the pot designated piritwater and the sacred thread become sanctified through the chanting and are used thereafter as a protection against evilThe thread is used by tying a piece around the arm or the wrist and the water by drinking it or sprinkling it according to requirementsIn the simplest form the ceremony is called varupirita or velpirita as the ceremony is confined only to a portion of the day and only the mahapirita is chantedBut the fullfledged pirit ceremony is a much more elaborate ritualThis also has two main forms  one lasting for one whole night and the other for one week or even longerThe former is the more usual form as a domestic ceremony while the latter is held on special occasions especially for public purposesWhatever the form may be when this kind of chanting is undertaken a special pavilion called the pirit mandapaya is constructed for the purposeIf the ceremony is to be performed in a private home this pavilion is put up in a central room of the houseGenerally it would measure about twelve by twelve feet and is gaily decorated with tissue paper tinsel etcIts roof is covered with a white canopy from which are hung small cuttings of arecanut flowers betel twigs tender twigs of the ironwood tree etcTwo water pots on which opened coconut racemes are kept are placed on either side of the entranceTwo lighted coconutoil lamps are also placed upon the coconut racemesIn the center of the pavilion is a table on which a clean white cloth is spreadUpon it are strewn puffed rice broken rice white mustard jasmine buds and panic grassThese five varieties known as ladapasmal are regarded as having a sanctifying and purifying power in combination and are hence used for ritualistic purposes at Buddhist ceremoniesIn the center of the table is the filtered water pot around which the threestranded sacred thread is twistedThis thread is drawn round the interior of the pavilion and when the chanting commences it is held by the chanting monks and given over to be held by the person or persons for whose benefit the ceremony is heldA palmleaf copy of the PiritPota regarded as more sanctified than the printed one occupies a significant place on the table representing the Dhamma the second member of the Buddhist TrinityConsequently while the printed copy is used for the legibility of its script the palmleaf copy is regarded as indispensable on the tableThe other important item that is brought inside the pavilion is the casket containing the bonerelics of the Buddha representing the BuddhaThis is placed on a separate decorated table on a side within the pavilionIn the seating arrangement for the monks two chairs centrally placed near the table are referred to as yugaasana or seats for the duel During a greater part of the allnight recital two monks occupying these two seats continue the chanting taking it in relays instead of the full assemblyA post called indrakhila or rajagaha is planted securely and fastened between these twin chairsThis post resembling a mace in more ways than one is attractively decorated and serves as a symbol of authority and protection for the officiating monksThis is generally erected only when the ceremony lasts for a week or longerEven when the ceremony is held in a private home the temple is inevitably connected with every stage of the ritualThe temple authorities are responsible for assigning the required number of monksOn the evening of the day on which the chanting takes place a few members from the particular household go to the temple in order to conduct the monksThe monks would come in a procession in single file in order of seniority attended by drummingAt the head of the procession is carried the relic casket borne on the head of a layman under an umbrella or a canopyThe beating of drums continues throughoutAs the monks enter the home a layman washes their feet while another wipes themThey walk to the pavilion on a carpet of white cloth and take their seats around the tableThe relic casket PiritPota and the bhikkhus thus come together representing the Triple Gem the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha respectivelyBefore the commencement of the ceremony proper the usual time of which is around pm the monks are welcomed and requested to perform the ceremony by being offered a tray in which betel leaves arecanut cardamons nutmeg etc are nicely arranged the ingredients being those taken for the chew of betelThis invitation is usually extended by the chief householder if it is in a private homeOtherwise some leading lay devotee would do itOne of the senior monks present would accept the invitation on behalf of the entire Sangha and in order to make the invitation formally valid he would get the lay devotee to repeat after him the following Pali stanza requesting the monks to begin the ceremonyPlease recite the noble pirit for the avoidance of all misfortune for the attainment of all success and for the destruction of all sufferingNext he would explain the significance of the occasion in a short addressThis is followed by ceremonial drumming as a ritualistic preamble to the ceremony serving both as an invitation to the gods and an offering of soundThe monks too commence the chanting by reciting a stanza that invites all the divine beings of the universe to the ceremonyMay the divine beings of the entire universe come here to hear the good doctrine of the King of Sages that confers both heavenly happiness and the freedom of NibbanaFrom the commencement of the chanting until its conclusion the following morning the pavilion is not vacatedThe mahapirita with which the chanting begins is chanted in a rhythmic manner by all the monks numbering about ten or twelve seated in order of seniorityThe rest of the discourses are chanted by two or four monksThe ceremony is concluded the following morning with the recital once again of the mahapirita at which ceremonial drumming takes place once moreThis drumming is also performed at the recital of important discourses like the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta and the Atanatiya SuttaOnce the chanting is concluded convenient lengths of the thread sanctified by the chanting are snapped off and tied around the wrists or the arms of those assembledA little of the sanctified water is given to everyone for drinkingWhen the ceremony continues for several days the chanting must continue night and day without a breakWhen the set of suttas constituting pirit is completed chanting is recommenced from the beginning and in this manner they are recited over and over again until the session is concludedBoth to begin and to end the session the mahapirita is recited in chorus by all the monks on each day at sunrise and sunsetAn important ceremony connected with the sevenday pirit ceremony is known as dorakadaasna which seems to have entered the pirit ceremony during the Kandyan periodThe theme of this ritual is to invite all the deities residing in the vicinity and request them to partake of the merits derived from the pirit ceremony and to help dispel all evil and bring about prosperity to everybodyThis ritual involves several stages commencing from the morning of the last day of the pirit ceremony ie the seventh day if it is a sevenday ceremonyThe first stage is the preparation of the message to be taken to the neighbouring temple where the abodes of the gods are also foundFor this purpose several palm leaves on which the message is to be written are brought to the chanting pavilion in a ceremonial procession and handed over to a monk who has been previously selected to write the messageNext this particular monk writes down the auspicious time for the messenger of the gods to set out to the devalaya and reads it aloud to be sanctioned by the assembled monksOnce this is done another monk also previously selected reads aloud a text written in a highly ornate stilted style enumerating the temples and devalayas at which the deities are requested to be present at the pirit chanting that eveningThis text is called the viharaasnaUntil these preliminaries are gone through the other monks keep holding the sacred threadAfter this the monk who was appointed to write the message begins to write it while the other monks retireThe message contains the invitation  which is a command from the Sangha and hence not to be turned down  addressed to all the deities residing at the religious places enumerated in the viharaasna to come and partake of the merits of the weeks pirit chantingThe message is prepared in quadruplicateThese are then hung on a pole and handed over to a young boy specially selected for the task and richly attired as befits a messenger of the godsMounted on a caparisoned elephant and escorted by men with swords he carries the message in a procession to the devalayaThis procession is called the devadutaperahera the procession of the gods messenger and has many features like dancers drummers maskdancers stiltwalkers etcAt the devalaya the bhikkhus and the devadutaya first go near a Buddhastatue and pay homage after which they proceed to the building where the statues of the gods are and chant the Metta SuttaThe gods concerned are usually Vishnu and KataragamaThis is followed by ceremonial drumming as an invitation to the gods and next a monk reads out the message aloudThe four messages are given to the lay officiating priest of the devalaya to be hung in the four cardinal directions inside the devalayaThese are meant for the Regents of the Four Quarters  Datarattha Viruda Virupakkha and Vessavana  who are requested to come to the ceremony with their assembliesThe procession now returnsUntil the monks arrive for the pirit chanting the devadutaya is kept confined and guardedOnce the monks arrive and take their seats inside the pavilion a dialogue takes place between the devadutaya and a monk the purpose of which is to reveal to the assembled gathering that the task of the messenger which was to invite the gods to partake of the merits has been done and that all the gods have arrivedThe devadutaya makes this statement standing and guarded by the swordsmen at the entrance to the chanting pavilion within which the monks have taken their seatsIt is this statement of the devadutaya which thus comes to be called the dorakadaasna meaning the message read at the threshold The gist of this statement written in the same kind of stilted language as the viharaasna referred to earlier is that all the gods invited have arrived for the pirit ceremony so that they may dispel all misfortune and bring about prosperity to allAfter the dorakadaasna another monk standing within the pavilion reads out a similar text called the anusasanaasna wherein all the gods assembled are requested to rejoice in the merits of the entire ceremonyThis monk holds in his hand a roundhandled fan made of the talipot leaf elaborately decorated a symbol of authority and high ecclesiastical positionThese three ritualistic texts mentioned in the foregoing account were all composed during the Kandyan period when ceremonies and rituals especially those connected with the gods became more popular than during the earlier periodsIt is also worth noting that this ceremony of dorakadaasna has in addition to its religious and ritualistic significance considerable dramatic and theatrical value as well for the whole event from the preliminaries of the morning to the grand finale of the anusasana in the evening contains much impersonation mime and dialogueIn this connection we may note that as early as the time of Buddhaghosa there were Buddhist rituals with such theatrical features as is shown by the exorcist ritual of reading the Atanatiya Sutta described in the Digha Nikaya CommentaryThe recital of the Jayamangala Gatha a set of eight benedictory stanzas extolling the virtues of the Buddha may also be cited as a popular custom partly related to the chanting of piritThis is usually done on important occasions like a marriage ceremony when setting out on an important journey or when inaugurating any venture of significanceThis custom is inevitably observed at what is called the Poruva ceremony when after a couple to be married ascends a small decorated platform they are blessed for future prosperityThe recital is usually done by an elderly person who for the occasion assumes the position of an officiating priestAt public functions a bevy of young girls clad in white uniforms also do the recitalThe contents of the stanzas recited clearly show that the ritual is intended to bring happiness and prosperity to the persons concerned or the successful completion of the projectAccordingly these verses have come to be called the stanzas of success and prosperity Jayamangala Gatha and have become quite popular among all sections of the BuddhistsWhile the origin of these stanzas is shrouded in mystery it can be stated with certainty that they were composed in Sri Lanka by a devoted Buddhist poetThe earliest available reference to them is during the Kandyan period when they are given in a list of subjects that a monk should studyThis shows that they had become well established during the th and th centuries hence they must have been composed at least a century earlierThese stanzas are regarded as efficacious because they relate eight occasions each based on a beautiful story when the Buddha triumphed over his powerful opponentsThe chanting of what is called setpirit by a few bhikkhus at the inauguration of new ventures or at receptions and farewells to important public personages has also become quite commonThe chanting usually consists of a sutta like the Mangala Ratana or Metta Sutta and a few benedictory stanzasSetpirit is broadcast by the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation every morning as the first item of its programmeThe ceremony of piritchanting is very often accompanied by another important ceremony that of almsgivingIt is generally known as sanghikadana meaning the alms given to the community of monks Such a ceremonial almsgiving is often preceded by an allnight pirit ceremonyEven otherwise this ceremony too is usually performed on important occasions in the same way as the pirit ceremony associated with such events as housewarming setting out on a long journey a marriage birth or death anniversaries and so forthAt least four monks who have obtained higher ordination must participate for the dana to become valid as a fullfledged sanghikadanaSuch danas were held even during the Buddhas time the Buddha himself participating in very many of themOf the many items of offering that dana or the act of generosity could include food is usually regarded as the most important and the formal meal offering accordingly is done with much ceremony and ritualThe monks are conducted from the temple in procession with drumming as in the case of piritA layman leads the procession with the relic casket representing the Buddha borne on his head under an umbrella or canopyAs they approach the particular household they are received by the hostAs the monks step into the house one person washes their feet while another wipes themThis part of the ceremony is the same as in the case of the pirit ceremonyThe monks are then conducted to the cushioned seats arranged on the floor against the wallAlms are first offered to the Buddha in a separate bowl and are placed on a separate table on which the relic casket containing a bonerelic of the Buddha has been setAll the items of food are served in plates and placed on mats or low tables before the seated monksA senior monk administers the Three Refuges and the Five Precepts to the assembled gathering as this has become the established custom with which any Buddhist function commencesAfter he has given a short address on the significance of the occasion the food is formally presented by getting the chief householder to repeat a Pali statement imam bhikkham saparikkharam bhikkhusanghassa demaNext the food is served and once the monks have finished eating the other requisites referred to in the statement quoted are also offeredThe most important item among these offerings is what is traditionally known as the eight monastic requisites the almsbowl three robes belt razor waterstrainer and sewing needleThis offering is regarded as especially meritoriousAs it is an expensive item and therefore difficult to offer to all the monks generally one atapirikara is offered to the chief monk and other items such as books towels pillowcases umbrellas etc are presented to the other monksOnce this is over another monk administers what is called punnanumodana or thanksgiving wherein all those who were connected with the ceremony are requested to partake of the merits for their future goodThe participants are also called upon to transfer the merits they have thus acquired for the wellbeing of their dead kinsmen and friends as well as for the sustenance of beings in the deva worlds ie the deities who are expected to protect the donors out of gratitudeThe relic casket and the monks are conducted back to the temple in the same manner as they were brought and the proceedings are concludedA related ritual that cannot be ignored as regards the ceremony of almsgiving is the custom of getting the neighbours and friends also to serve into the almsbowl that is offered to the BuddhaOn the morning of the day on which the almsgiving takes place a separate bowl is kept on a table for this purposeThis is called the Buddhapattare or the Buddhas almsbowlAlms served into it are regarded as offered to the Buddha himselfThe neighbours would come with plates of rice prepared in their homes and serve into itThis rice is also taken when the bowl of food is prepared for offering to the Buddha near the relic casket at the time of the dana proper the purpose here being to get the neighbours and outsiders also to participate in this meritmaking ceremonyAmong Buddhists death is regarded as an occasion of major religious significance both for the deceased and for the survivorsFor the deceased it marks the moment when the transition begins to a new mode of existence within the round of rebirthsWhen death occurs all the kammic forces that the dead person accumulated during the course of his or her lifetime become activated and set about determining the next rebirthFor the living death is a powerful reminder of the Buddhas teaching on impermanence it also provides an opportunity to assist the deceased person as he or she fares on to the new existenceBoth aspects of death  the message of impermanence and the opportunity to help the departed loved one  find expression in the Buddhist funeral rites of Sri LankaNaturally the monastic Sangha plays a prominent role in the funeral proceedingsOne of the most important parts of the funeral rites is the ritual called offering of cloth on behalf of the deadThis is done prior to the cremation or the burial of the bodyMonks are assembled in the home of the dead person or in the cemeteryThe proceedings begin with the administration of the Five Precepts to the assembled crowd by one of the monksThis is followed by the recitation in chorus of the wellknown stanzaNext follows this ritual which consists of the offering of a length of new white cloth to the monksThe cloth called a pamsukula  literally a dustheap cloth  is intended to be cut into pieces and then stitched into a robeAfter offering it the close relatives of the deceased sit together on a mat assume a reverential posture and together they pour water from a vessel into a cup placed within a plate until the cup overflowsWhile the water is being poured the monks intone in unison the following stanzas extracted from the Tirokuddha Sutta of the KhuddakapathaThe context shows that the pouring of water in this manner is a ritualistic act belonging to the field of sympathetic magic symbolizing the beneficial inheritance of the merit transferred by the living to the dead as a kind of dakkhina or offeringThe entire ritual is hence an act of grace whereby merit is transferred to the departed so that they may find relief from any unhappy realm wherein they might have been bornAnother funeral rite is matakabana or preaching for the benefit of the dead The usual practice is to conduct a monk to the house of the dead person generally on the third day after the funeral and to request him to preach a sermon suited to the occasionAccordingly he preaches a suitable sermon for about an hours duration to the assembled audience which inevitably consists of the deceaseds relatives and the neighbours of the householdAt the end of the sermon the monk gets the relatives to recite the necessary stanzas to transfer to the deceased the merits acquired by organizing the eventFollowing this a gift is offered to the monk and the invitees are also served with refreshmentsThree months from the date of death it is customary to hold an almsgiving in memory of the deceased and thence to repeat it annuallyAs in the case of the rituals mentioned earlier here too the purpose is to impart merit to the deceasedHence it is called the offering in the name of the deadThe basis of the practice is the belief that if the dead relative has been reborn in an unhappy existence he or she would expect his or her living relatives to transfer merit in this manner as these departed spirits or petas are incapable of performing any meritorious deed on their ownEven their hunger and thirst which is perpetual subside only in this mannerHence they are referred to as living on what is given by othersThis custom can be traced to the Buddhas own time when King Bimbisara was harassed by a group of his departed kinsmen reborn as petas because the king had failed to give alms to the Buddha in their nameOnce this was fulfilled as requested by the Buddha the petas became happy and ceased to give any more troubleThis was the occasion on which the Buddha preached the Tirokuddha Sutta referred to earlier which further says that once these rites are performed these contented spirits bless the donors in returnThese rites it may be mentioned here resemble the sraddha ceremonies of the Hindus in some waysAnd it is also significant that according to the Buddha himself only the dead relatives who have been reborn as petas are capable of receiving this benefitThe Vassa a threemonth rains retreat was instituted by the Buddha himself and was made obligatory for all fully ordained bhikkhus the details are laid down in the Mahavagga of the Vinaya PitakaThe retreat extends over a period corresponding to the North Indian rainy season from the day following the full moon of July until the fullmoon day of October those who cannot enter the regular Vassa are permitted to observe the retreat for three months beginning with the day following the August full moonFrom the time Buddhism was introduced to Sri Lanka by the arahant Mahinda the observance of Vassa  Vas in Sinhala  has been one of the mainstays of monastic life in the islandDuring the Vas the monks are expected to dwell permanently in their temples and suspend all travelingIf unavoidable circumstances necessitate traveling they are allowed to leave their residences on the promise that they will return within a weekOn the first day of the retreat the monks have to formally declare that they will dwell in that manner in the selected monastery or dwellingThe Vassa is also a time for the lay Buddhists to express their devotion to the cause of Buddhism by supporting the Sangha with special diligence which task they regard as a potent source of meritIt is customary for prominent persons to invite monks to spend the Vas with them in dwellings specially prepared for the purposeIn this latter case the host would go and invite the monk or monks formallyIf the monks accept the invitation the hosts would prepare a special temporary dwelling in a suitable place with a refectory and a shrine roomOn the first day of the Vas they would go with drummers and dancers to the monastery where the invitees reside and conduct them thence in processionThe hosts would assume responsibility for providing all the needs of the monk or monks during this period and they attend to this work quite willingly as they regard it as highly meritoriousIf no special construction is put up the lay supporters would invite the monks to observe the retreat in the temple itselfAt the close of the Vas season the monks have to perform the pavarana ceremonyAt this ceremony held in place of the Patimokkha recitation each monk invites his fellows to point out to him any faults he has committed during the Vas periodOn any day following the day of pavarana in the period terminating with the next fullmoon day the kathina ceremony is heldDifferent monasteries will hold the kathina on different days within this month though any given monastery may hold only one kathina ceremonyThe main event in this ceremony is the offering of the special robe known as the kathinacivara to the Sangha who in turn present it to one monk who has observed the retreatThe laity traditionally offer unsewn cloth to the monksBefore the offering takes place the robe is generally taken with drumming etc around the village in the early hours of the morningOnce the robe is given to the Sangha certain monks are selected to do the cutting sewing and dying of the robe  all in a single dayPublic contributions are very often solicited to buy the robe if it is not a personal offeringThis ceremony which is performed with keen interest and devotion has today become an important occasion of great social and religious significance for the Buddhist laityThis seems to have been so even in historical times when many Sinhala kings made this offering with much interest and devotionThere is deep ritualistic significance in the two stages of monastic ordination called pabbajja and upsampadaThe former is the initial admission into the homeless life as a novice or samanera which can be granted to any male over the age of seven or eight provided certain conditions are satisfiedThe ritual proper consists in shaving the hair and beard donning the dyed robes whose color ranges from yellow to brown and then taking from the selected preceptor the Three Refuges in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha and the Ten Precepts abstinence from destroying life theft unchastity lying fermented liquor spirits and strong drinks which cause intoxication and heedlessness eating solid food after midday dancing singing music and improper shows etc adorning and beautifying the person by the use of garlands scents and unguents using high and luxurious beds and seats and receiving gold and silver ie moneyThe ceremony is performed on an auspicious day at the monastery where the ordination is soughtThus the postulant becomes a noviceThe full or higher ordination is more formal and difficultThe higher ordination ceremony should be conducted in a prescribed and duly consecrated chapter house without which the ritual is not validIf the candidate possesses the necessary qualifications like knowledge and intelligence and he is above twenty years of age he may formally apply for admission and appear before a chapter of bhikkhusBefore admission he is made to put away the yellow robes and wear the clothes of a householder and face an interview at which he would be thoroughly examined as to his fitness for admissionIf he successfully passes the test he is led aside reclothed in mendicant robes and called backBearing his almsbowl he once again appears before the Sangha and goes through certain formalities after which if all the monks agree he is declared admittedThis refers to the ritual of confession performed by the monks on the newmoon and the fullmoon days when the Disciplinary Code the Patimokkha is recitedThis is a set of rules to be observed by the members of the Buddhist OrderWhen each of the seven sections of the rules is recited amidst the assembled Order if any among those present has infringed any of those rules he should confess and undergo any punishment prescribedSilence implies absence of guiltBali is the ceremony wherein the presiding deities of the planets are invoked and placated in order to ward off their evil influencesThe belief in the good and evil influence of the planets according to the time and place of ones birth is quite widespread in Sri LankaThe first thing done at the birth of a child is to cast the horoscope which has to be consulted subsequently at all the important events of his or her lifeWhen a calamity like a serious illness comes upon such a person the horoscope would inevitably be consulted and if the person is under a bad planetary influence the astrologer would recommend some kind of propitiatory ritualThis could be a minor one like the limecutting ritual or a major one like a bali ceremony depending on the seriousness of the caseIf it is a bali ceremony he might also recommend the specific kind of bali suitable for the occasionThe term bali signifies both the ritual in general and also the clay representations of the planetary deities which are made in relief on frameworks of bamboo and painted in appropriate colorsThe ritual consists of dancing and drumming in front of the bali figures by the bali artist who continuously recites propitiatory stanzas calling for protection and redressThe patient sits by the side of the bali figuresThe bali artist is helped by a number of assistants working under himThe knowledge and art of performing the ritual are handed down in traditional familiesThe retentive power of these artists is remarkable for they can continue to recite the appropriate formulas and verses from memory for daysThe bali ceremony is a mixture of Buddhism and folk religionThis cult of the planets and the allied deities has become an important element in the popular living Buddhism of the islandThe origins of this type of bali ritual have to be traced to the Kotte Period of the th and th centuries when it was introduced into the island from South India by some Hindu brahmans from that regionHowever mainly owing to the efforts of the celebrated Buddhist monk of the period VenVidagama Maitreya Thera this ritual was recast with a Buddhist significance both in form and content in that all the verses and formulas used in the ritual are those extolling the virtues of the Triple Gem  the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha  and of the Buddhist deitiesIt is these spiritual qualities that are invoked to bring redressThe entire ritual is thus made subservient to BuddhismThe ceremony begins after paying homage to the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaEven during the course of the ceremony this homage is paid at important juncturesThe majority of the stanzas recited as benedictory verses by the artist extol the virtues of the Triple Gem or refer to the Buddhas previous existences as a BodhisattaThe verbal part of the entire ritual consists mainly of the recitation of these verses and the pronouncement of the blessing By the power of those virtues let the evil influence of the planets disappear It is believed that this kind of pronouncement of blessings becomes effective only if they are made at such an elaborate ceremony like baliAs in the case of the pirit ceremony described earlier the spiritual qualities of the Buddha are regarded as superior to any worldly powers like those of the planets and stars as in the present instance and consequently the ceremonial and ritualistic pronouncement of those qualities is believed to counteract those evil forcesThose propitiatory recitations also include the panegyrics praising those planetary deitiesThe preparation for the bali ceremony takes a day or twoPlantain stems tender coconut leaves coconut and arecanut racemes powdered resin limes betel torches made by wrapping clean rags around dry reeds coconut oil flowers of different colors and burnt offerings are among the main items neededPlastic clay and reeds will be needed in large quantities to cast the bali figuresLifesize images of the planetary deities are moulded from these and painted beautifully in bright colorsEach planetary deity has its own dress colors diagram support weapon etcIt is the nine planets that are generally propitiated the sun moon Mars Mercury Jupiter Venus Saturn and Rahu and Ketu the ascending and the descending nodes of the moon respectivelyWhen everything is ready with the bali figures propped up leaning against a wall and the patient seated by a side facing the figures the chief bali artist starts the proceedings by taking the Five Precepts and reciting a few benedictory stanzas while the drummers start drummingThis takes place in the eveningAfter these preliminaries it is more or less customary for the chief artist to retire to the side while one or two of his assistants would appear on the scene to perform the more vigorous part of the ritual consisting mainly of dancing and recitingThe dancing artist wears an attractive and colorful dress consisting of white tights a red jacket adorned with white beads anklets pads of jingling bells around his calves and an elaborate headdressIn one hand he takes a pandama or lighted torch adequately fed with coconut oilWhile reciting formulas and dancing to the beat of the drum he throws handfuls of powdered resin into the burning pandama setting up flares of flames which are regarded as very powerful in driving away the invisible evil spiritsIn addition to the virtues of the Triple Gem his recitation would also include legends and anecdotes taken from the Buddhas and Bodhisattas livesSometimes references to previous Buddhas are also madePlanetary deities are eulogized and requested to stop troubling the patientCoconutoil lamps an incense burner water pots with fullblown coconut racemes are among the items inevitably found on the sceneOfferings done on altars made of plantain trunks and tender coconut leaves will also be foundA number of such altars called pidenitatu may be set up these are for the departed kinsmen of the family who are expected to stop harassing the living after receiving these offerings which generally consist of rice seven selected curries cooked together burnt offerings colored flowers betel leaves five kinds of seeds etcA live cock with its legs tied together so that it cannot run about is placed in a corner as an offering to the evil spiritsThis is a kind of scapegoat for all the evil influences of the patient are supposed to be transferred to this bird which is released on the following morningThe ceremonies actually end early in the morning when the artists carry the clay images and the altars of offerings or pidenitatu and leave them at the crossroads that the evil spirits who give trouble are believed to frequentTovil or devildancing is another ritualistic healing ceremony that primarily belongs to folk religionAs in the case of the bali ceremony here too many Buddhist elements have crept in and it has become a ceremony purporting to fulfill at the popular level the socioreligious needs of the simple rural BuddhistsTovil is essentially a demonic ritual mainly exorcistic in character and hence a healing ceremonyIn its exorcist form it is meant to curb and drive away any one or several of the innumerable hosts of malevolent spirits known as yakkhas who are capable of bringing about pathological states of body and mindPetas or departed spirits of the malevolent type referred to as malayakku or malapeta are also brought under the exorcist power of tovilWhile some of these could be subdued by the chanting of pirit there are some for whom methods of a more drastic type have to be adoptedThe most popular of such methods is the tovil ceremonyAs was pointed out earlier in relation to rituals in general tovil is also an important aspect of folk religion that has been adopted by the Sinhala BuddhistsIn the case of tovil too religious sanction is conferred on folkreligious elements that have crept into normative Buddhism supplementing as it were whatever is lacking in it to satisfy the religious needs of the massesThe Buddha is the chief of living beings who include the yakkhas and other related nonhuman beings that figure in tovilAlthough they have the power to make their victims ill in various ways  such as by possession gaze etc they have to leave them once propitiatory offerings of food drink etc are made to themEven the mere mention of the Buddhas virtues is enough to frighten themMoreover the chief of the yakkhas Vessavana is one of the four regents of the universe and as such a devoted follower of the BuddhaThe ordinary yakkhas that trouble human beings have to obey his commandsThus in all rituals connected with tovil it is in the name of the Buddha and Vessavana that the yakkhas are commanded to obey the orders of the exorcistAnd in the rich folklore that deals with tovil there are many anecdotes that connect every ritual or character with some Buddha of the past or with some Buddhist deityIt is of interest to find a purely Buddhist form of an exorcist ritual that has been practiced by the Buddhists of Sri Lanka from very early timesThis is the recital of the Atanatiya Sutta in order to exorcise an evil spirit that has taken possession of a personThe commentary to the sutta dating at least as far back as the time of Buddhaghosa or even earlier gives a detailed description of how and when to recite itAccording to this description first the Metta Dhajagga and Ratana Suttas should be recitedIf the spirit does not leave by such recital the Atanatiya Sutta is to be recitedThe bhikkhu who performs the recital should not eat meat or preparations of flourHe should not live in a cemetery lest the evil spirits get an opportunity to harass himFrom the monastery to the patients house he should be conducted under an armed guardThe recitation of the paritta should not be done in the openThoughts of love for the patient should be foremost in the reciters mindDuring the recital too he should be under armed guardIf the spirit still refuses to leave the patient should be taken to the monastery and the recital performed in the courtyard of the dagabaMany preliminary rites are recommended before such a recitalThese include getting the patient to offer a seat to the bhikkhu who is to recite the paritta the offering of flowers and lamps to the dagaba and the recitation by the bhikkhu of a set of benedictory stanzas called mangalagathaA full assembly of the deities should also be summonedThe person possessed should be questioned as to his name by which is implied the identity of the spirit who has taken possession of himOnce the name is given the spirit but visibly the patient should be addressed by that nameIt should be told that the merits of offering incense flowers alms etcare all transferred to him and that the mangalagatha just referred to have been recited in order to appease him and that he should therefore leave the patient in deference to the SanghaIf the spirit still refuses to leave the deities should be informed of his obstinacy and the Atanatiya Paritta should be recited after declaring that as the spirit does not obey them they are carrying out the order of the BuddhaIt is significant that this is a purely Buddhist ritual of considerable antiquity performed on lines similar to those in tovilBut the difference between the two should also be notedWhen tovil is performed to cure a person possessed by a spirit the spirit is ordered to leave the patient after accepting the offering of food and drinkBut in the case of the Atanatiya ritual it is the merits earned by making offerings to the Buddha that are transferred to the spiritAnother significant difference is that the Atanatiya recital in keeping with its purely Buddhist spirit is much milder and more restrained than its tovil counterpartThe latter however is much more colorful and theatrical owing to its complex and essentially secular characterFrom the purely curative aspect too there is another attractive feature in tovil when the spirit leaves the patient it does so leaving a sign of its departure like breaking a branch of a tree making a sound like a hoot etcIt is perhaps because of these attractive features that tovil has become more popular in the island replacing the truly Buddhist ceremony of the Atanatiya recitalNowadays in Sri Lanka tovil has become the most popular form of cure adopted for spirit possession as well as other pathological conditions consequent on thisWhen a person is ill and medical treatment does not respond the suspicion arises that it is due to some influence of an evil spiritThe person to be consulted in such a case is the exorcist known as kattadiya or yakadura or yaddessa who would discover and identify the particular evil spirit causing the disease and perform the appropriate tovilThere are also certain forms of tovil performed as pregnancy rituals and others as means of eradicating various forms of evil influences like the evil eye evil mouth etcThe devildancers start their ceremony by first worshipping the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha as in the case of the bali ceremonyThe yakkhas  who constitute one of the main classes of malevolent spirits placated in devildancing  are believed to become satisfied with the offerings made by people through tovil and cease harassing themThe yakkhas like Riri Sanni Kalukumaraya Suniyan Mahasohon Maru etcare some of the main spirits placatedThere are eighteen main yakkhas in this category each representing a particular kind of illness and in tovil these demons are represented by the devildancers themselves who wear their specific masks and other apparel in keeping with the traditional forms ascribed to these spiritsIt is believed that by dancing chanting and acting the part of the demons after assuming their likenesses through masks and other paraphernalia the demons possessing the patient would leave himThe sound waves created by the drumbeat and the chanting of stanzas accompanied by rhythmic dancing in keeping with these sounds are all performed to a set pattern traditionally laid downThe collective effect of the ceremony is believed to cure the patients illnessThus this dancing in tovil is a therapeutic ritualThe impersonation of the demon by the dancer is regarded as tantamount to the actual presence of the demon who becomes placated through offerings recitations chanting miming etcWhen the spirits are threatened and asked to leave the patient they are asked to do so under the command and in the name of the BuddhaThe ceremony known as ratayakuma is performed to make barren women conceive or for the prenatal care of pregnant women and to ensure the safe delivery of childrenOne of the episodes mimetically performed by the exorcist in this ceremony shows how barren women according to a Buddhist legend preserved among the Sinhala people offer cloths to the past Buddha Dipankara the fourth in the line of twentyeight Buddhas accepted by Theravada Buddhists they obtain children through the merits of the actAmong the rituals specially connected with women may be mentioned those devildancing ceremonies that invoke the yakkha called Kalukumaraya in SinhalaHe is very often associated with another group of yakkhas called ratayakku whose leader is a female named RiddibisavaAnother pregnancy ritual that deserves mention here is the one known as kalastabimaWhen the first signs of pregnancy appear in a woman a new clay pot is filled with certain ingredients and kept apart with the solemn promise that once the child is safely delivered a tovil will be performedThe ritual known as hatadiya in the tovil ceremony called suniyamkapima signifies the seven steps the Bodhisatta Siddhattha is said to have taken just after he was bornTwo important facts that emerge from this brief description of tovil is the theatrical value present in these rituals and the way in which religious sanction has been obtained for their adoption by the BuddhistsThe large number of rituals and ceremonies connected with the goddess Pattini also come under Buddhist practicesThis goddess believed to be of South Indian origin has become the most popular female deity of the Sinhala BuddhistsWhile Hindu goddesses like Lakshmi Sarasvati and Kali are also worshipped by the Buddhists only Pattini has separate abodes among the BuddhistsThe most important of the rituals connected with Pattini is the gammaduwa which is an allpurpose ceremonyAs this ceremony is usually held after the harvest by offering the first portion of paddy harvested this is also a ceremony of firstfruit offeringsA gammaduwa has many interludes dramatized mainly from rich legendary lore about the goddess PattiniKohombakankariya or the ritual of the god Kohomba is a ceremony similar to the gammaduwa but performed more as an expiatory ritualTwo other ceremonies of this type are panmadu and punamaduAll these are different forms of the same type of ritual with slight differencesThey are generally referred to as devolmadu or occasions for the propitiation of the godsThe general purpose of such devolmadu is the attainment of immunity from disease and evil influences and the achievement of success especially agricultural for the entire villageA point that is sociologically important is that as they are big communal gatherings they also fulfill the social needs of the village folkAs they are performed in public places to bless the community as a whole and turn out to be social gettogethers they bear a corporate characterWhen it is decided that such a ceremony should be held all the village folk would forget their differences and work together to make it a successFurther while it mainly serves as a ritual to propitiate the deities it is a form of entertainment as wellServing as it does the socioreligious needs of the masses it becomes a big social event for the entire villageGarademons yaka  are a group of demons twelve in number whose female aspects are called the Giri goddessesTheir chief is called Dalaraja who is represented as having three hooded cobras over his head earornaments two protruding tusks and a torch in each handWhen referred to in the singular as garayaka it is he that is intended and when performing the ritual it is the mask pertaining to him that is generally used as representing the groupThese demons are not inimical to humans but are regarded as removing various kinds of uncleanliness and evil influencesAccordingly it is customary among the Sinhala Buddhists to perform the ritual called garayaknatuma at the end of religious ceremonies like annual peraheras tovil ceremonies etcThis is to ward off what is called vasdos in the terminology of the folk religion the effects of evileye evil mouth evil thoughts etcThe malicious influences of these evil forces have to be eliminated before the participants return to their normal activitiesAnd for this it is these demons that have to be propitiatedAccordingly they are invited to come and take away their prey promising not to harm the participants thereafterA dancer impersonates the garayaka by wearing the appropriate mask just referred to and in the dialogue that takes place between him and another dancer he promises to comply with the request if certain things are given to himThese include drinks food sweets and moneyThese items are given and he departs in peaceThe ceremony is held annually at the Vishnu Devalaya in Kandy after the annual Esala PeraheraIt goes on for one week from the last day of the Perahera and is referred to as valiyaknatumaBesides the ceremonies and rituals like pirit sanghikadana kathina etc that can be traced in their origin to the time of the Buddha himself there is another popular practice resorted to by the average Sri Lankan Buddhist which cannot be traced to early Buddhism so easilyThis is devaworship the worship of deities in what are popularly called devalayas or abodes dedicated to these deitiesThis practice cannot be described as totally unBuddhistic yet at the same time it does not fall into the category of folk religious practices like bali and tovil adopted by popular BuddhismThe word deva meaning god or deity in this context signifies various classes of superhuman beings who in some respects are superior to ordinary human beings through their birth in a higher planeAs such they are capable of helping human beings in times of difficultyThere is also another class of such superior beings who were originally extraordinary human beingsAfter their death they have been raised to the level of gods and are worshipped and supplicated as capable of helping in times of needThese are the gods by convention or glorified human heroes like the Minneriya Deviyo who was glorified in this manner in recognition of his construction of the great Minneriya Tank at Polonnaruwa or God Vibhishana one of the four guardian deities of Sri LankaBoth these categories of deities are however subject to the samsaric laws pertaining to birth and deathThus it is seen that devaworship is based on the theory that a superior being can help an inferior being when the latter needs such helpIn addition to their role as helpers in need an additional duty ascribed to the devas is the safeguarding of the Buddhasasana ie the Buddhist religionThis also has its origin in the story of the Buddha himself when the four divine regents of the universe mounted guard over him and helped on various occasions of the Bodhisattas life from his conception onwardsThe benevolence of the deities is also extended to the protection of the faithful followers of the Buddhas teachings as exemplified by Sakka the good Samaritan in many Buddhist storiesIn Sri Lanka there are four deities regarded as the guardians of the Buddhasasana in the island Vishnu Saman Kataragama and VibhishanaAlthough Vishnu is originally a Hindu god the Buddhists have taken him over as a Buddhist deity referring to him also by the localized designation UppalavannaAnd so are Siva specially under the name Isvara and Ganesha under the name Ganapati or the more popular appellation GanadeviyoIn the devalaworship the devotees make offerings to these deities and solicit their help for special purposes especially in their daytoday problemsA noteworthy feature in this practice is the presence of a mediator between the deity and the devotee a priest called kapurala or kapumahattaya or simply kapuva the equivalent of the Hindu pusariThis figure has been copied from South Indian Hindu practices for even in North India the devotees appeal directly to these higher powers without the help of such an intermediaryBy devala offering is meant the offering of food and drink as well as gifts of cloth coins gold and silver often accompanied by eulogies addressed to the particular resident deity and recited by the kapuralaIn many Buddhist temples in Sri Lanka there are devalayas dedicated to various deitiesDevalaworship of this type is a ritual that has gained popularity among the local Buddhists since the Polonnaruwa periodIn the present day it has acquired a vital place in the religious life of the Buddhist massesThis is one of the aspects by which the great tradition of Nikaya Buddhism has been supplemented by popular elementsThis shows that if Buddhism is to prevail as a living force among all classes of its adherents it has to make provision for the popular demands related to the daytoday life of the common populaceIt is customary for many Sri Lankan Buddhists to visit a devalaya of one of the deities and make a vow that if the problem at hand is solved they will make an offering to the deity concernedOfferings are made even without such a special requestWhatever the case may be this practice has become a ritual of propitiation through the kapuralasThe main duties of the kapuralas are to look after the devalayas in their charge to perform the prescribed rituals and to offer in the inner shrine the offerings brought by devoteesThe kapurala is given a fee for his servicesOnce the ritual is over a part of the offerings is given back to the devotee for him to take home and partake of as having a sacramental valueThe offerings normally consist of milkrice coconuts betel camphor josssticks fruits along with flowers garlands flags etcAll these are arranged in an orderly manner in a basket or tray and handed over respectfully to the kapurala who takes it inside and offers it at the statue of the main deity inside the inner roomThe devotees wait outside with clasped hands while the kapurala makes his pleadings on their behalfThe statement he recites called yatikava in Sinhala is a panegyric of the deity concerned and it constitutes a humble and respectful request to bring succour to the devotee in his particular predicamentAfter this the kapurala emerges from the inner shrine room and blesses the devotees by using his thumb to place on their forehead a mark of a paste made from saffron sandalwood and other ingredientsThis mark the symbol of sanctification is known as the tilakaThis form of ritualistic propitiation of deities is a clear adaptation of the Hindu system where the very same method is followed though more elaboratelyKataragamaDevalayas dedicated to the different deities are scattered all over the islandGod Kataragama in southern Sri Lanka is by far the most popular as he is considered to be the most powerful deity capable of granting the requests of the worshipperIt is for this reason that he has acquired territorial rights throughout the islandDevalayas dedicated to him are found in many places in the island some of which are maintained by the HindusGaneshaThe elephantshaped god Ganesha regarded as the god of wisdom and the remover of obstacles is also very popular among the Buddhists under the names Ganapati or GanadeviyoHe is worshipped as the chief of obstacles because it is believed that he is responsible for creating and removing obstraclesHe does this through troops of inferior deities or demigods considered as attendants of Siva present almost everywhere who are under his commandIt is in this sense that he is called Ganapati which is the epithet popular among the BuddhistsThe devalayas dedicated to him are mostly run by the HindusThe Buddhists worship him either through his statues found in many Buddhists temples or by visiting the Hindu kovils dedicated to himAs the god of wisdom and of learning he is propitiated at the time a child first reads the alphabetAs the chief of obstacles as their creator as well as remover the Hindus begin their devalaritual by making the first offering to himAnother popular aspect of his worship in some parts of Sri Lanka can be observed along the main roads especially in the NorthCentral Province where his statue is placed near trees and propitiated by travelers so that they may have a safe journeyThe propitiation usually consists of breaking a coconut in his name offering a coin etcNathaNatha is purely a Buddhist god apparently the local counterpart of the allcompassionate Mahayana Bodhisattva AvalokitesvaraHe is referred to in Sri Lanka by the abbreviated form NathaHis cult as that of Natha had become quite popular during the Kotte period while references to him are found as early as the th and th centuries as shown by archaelogical evidenceThe center of the cult was Totagamuwa near Hikkaduwa in the Galle DistrictTwo of the more ancient devalayas dedicated to this deity are found at Kandy and at VagiriyaThe premises of the Kandy devalaya opposite the Temple of the Tooth are considered especially lucky and sacred for the important royal rites like choosing a name for the king putting on the royal sword etc were held thereIt was Nathas allpervading compassion that seems to have been appealed to by the local devoteesVishnuThe important Hindu god Vishnu has also assumed a special Buddhist significance in the islandHe is identified with the god Uppalavanna of the Mahavamsa to whom Sakka the king of the gods is said to have entrusted the guardianship of Sri Lanka at the request of the Buddha before his passing awayThis god is said to have arrived in the island to fulfill this missionThe name Uppalavanna means the color of the blue waterlily As Vishnu is of the same color Uppalavanna became identified with Vishnu and in the wake of the Mahavamsa tradition he became as Vishnu the protector of the Buddhasasana in Sri LankaThe calculated omission of the name Vishnu in the Mahavamsa in this connection may be viewed as an attempt at total localization of the divinity with a view to harmonize him with the cultural fabric of the islandHis main shrine is at Devinuwara at the southern tip of the island where an annual Esala festival is held in his honorIf the identification is correct his cult can be traced to the earliest phase of the history of the island and has been popular up to the present dayPattiniGoddess Pattini referred to above is prominent as the most popular female Buddhist divinity she has her devalayas scattered throughout the countryHer cult goes back at least to the second century AThe then ruler King Gajabahu is said to have introduced the worship of this divinity into the island from South IndiaThe legend about her life is told in the Tamil poem SilappadikaramAccording to the myths current in the island about her she had seven incarnations being born seven times from water the tusk of an elephant a flower a rock a fire cloth and a mangoHence she is designated as satpattini sat meaning sevenThere are colorful stories woven around these birthsThe story about her unswerving fidelity to her fickle husband Kovalan in her birth as Kannagi is quite popular among the local Buddhists as attested by the existence of many Sinhala literary works dealing with the storyHer favors are sought especially at times of pestilences like chicken pox measles etcand also by women who desire childrenIt is customary for the Sri Lankan Buddhists to visit her devalaya and worship her with offerings after recovery from infectious diseasesThe banishment of evil influences and the attainment of prosperity in general and good harvests are other purposes behind the ceremonies performed in her honorShe also plays an important part in the ceremonies connected with the offering of first fruitsDevalayas dedicated to her are found in many parts of the island the one at Navagamuwa about fifteen miles from Colombo on the old Avissavella Road being the most importantThe sanctity of this place seems to go back to the time of King GajabahuSakkaSakka the king of the gods has been an important figure in the Buddhist affairs of Sri LankaTradition connects him with the Buddha himself in connection with the landing of Vijaya and his followers in the island in the th century BOn this occasion at the Buddhas request Sakka is said to have entrusted Vishnu with the guardianship of Buddhism in the islandIt was Sakka too who sought arahant Mahinda and requested him to come over to the island when the time became opportune for its conversionSamanAnother important deity in the island is Mahasumana Sumana or Saman the guardian or the presiding deity of Sri Pada mountain or Sumanakuta which the Buddhists treat as sacred on account of its bearing the impression of the Buddhas left foot which he left on his third visit to the islandGod Saman is recorded as having met the Buddha on the latters first visit to the island when he visited Mahiyangana to drive away the yakkhasSaman became a streamentrant after listening to the Buddha who gave him a handful of hairs with which he erected the dagaba at MahiyanganaHe is regarded as the chief deity of the area surrounding the sacred mountain as well as of the hillcountry in generalAccordingly his main shrine is at Ratnapura where an annual festival is held in his honorVibhishanaAnother deity somewhat similar to Saman is Vibhishana who is regarded as the brother of the prehistoric King Ravana of Sri LankaHis main shrine is at Kelaniya as a part of the famous Buddhist temple thereDadimundaAnother deity who likewise came into prominence during the Kandyan period is Dadimunda who according to the prevalent tradition landed at Dondra in South Sri Lanka from South IndiaHe proceeded to Alutnuvara in the Kegalla District taking up permanent residence there in a temple which he himself got constructedThis is the chief shrine of this deity and here too an annual festival is heldHe is regarded as a general of Vishnu and accordingly at the main Vishnu shrines in the island he also has his shrine on a sideAnother interesting tradition says that he was the only deity who did not run away in fear at the time of Bodhisatta Siddhatthas struggle with MaraWhile all the other deities took flight in fright he alone remained fearless as the Bodhisattas only guardianHe is portrayed in the attire of a Kandyan chief with his special attribute a walking stickHis Kandyan dress symbolizes his suzerainty over the Kandyan areaHuniyan DeviyoThe patron deity of the sorcerers in Sri Lanka is Huniyan or Suniyan who has been promoted from the status of a demon to that of a deityHe is also regarded as the deity presiding over a village area bounded by its boundaries in which role he is designated as gambharadeviyoIn many of the composite devalayas he too has his shrine the one at Lunava about seven miles from Colombo close to the Galle Road near the Lunava railway station being his chief devalayaBesides these deities so far enumerated there are many other minor figures who are too numerous to be mentioned hereWhat is important is that in the case of all these deities the method of propitiation and worship is the same as explained earlier and every such deity is in charge of a particular aspect of lifeAnd all of them are faithful Buddhists extending their respective powers not only to the Buddhasasana but also to those who follow it faithfullyAs Buddhists none of these is regarded as superior or even remotely equal to the BuddhaThey all are followers of the Buddha who has transcended the round of rebirth while they are still within samsara hoping to achieve release from it by following the Buddhas TeachingThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseBuddhism originated with an Indian prince known as the Buddha who taught in Northeast India in the fifth century BTwo centuries later with the support of the Emperor Asoka Buddhism spread over the greater part of India and from there traveled the full breadth of the Asian continentIn several tidal waves of missionary zeal it rose up from its Indian homeland and inundated other regions offering the peoples among whom it took root a solid foundation of faith and wisdom upon which to build their lives and a source of inspiration towards which to direct their hopesAt different points in history Buddhism has commanded followings in countries as diverse geographically ethnically and culturally as Afghanistan and Japan Siberia and Cambodia Korea and Sri Lanka yet all have looked towards the same Indian sage as their masterThough for historical reasons Buddhism eventually disappeared from India by about the twelfth century before it vanished it had profoundly transformed HinduismIn our own time Indian thinkers as different as Swami Vivekananda Tagore Gandhi and Nehru have looked upon the Buddha as a modelIn the twentieth century too while Buddhism has lost much of its following in the East it has begun to have a growing impact on an increasing number of people in the West and in its own quiet way it is sending down firm roots in several countries of the Western hemisphereIn the course of its long history Buddhism has assumed a wide variety of formsBecause of its peaceful nondogmatic character it has always adapted easily to the preexistent cultures and religious practices of the people among whom it has spread becoming in turn the fountainhead of a new culture and world viewSo successful has Buddhism been in integrating itself with a countrys indigenous culture that it is often difficult for us to discern the common thread that binds the different forms of Buddhism together as branches of the same religionThe outer surfaces differ so greatly from the gentle ceremonial Theravada Buddhism of Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia to the contemplative and devotional practices of Far Eastern Mahayana Buddhism to the mysterious ritualism of Tibetan Vajrayana BuddhismYet though the outer faces of these Buddhist schools may differ drastically they all remain rooted in a common source the life and teaching of the man known to us as the BuddhaSurprisingly though the Buddha stands so far back from us in time further back than all the later teachers who rose to eminence in the river of Buddhist history it is still his voice that speaks to us most directly in a language we can immediately understand in words images and ideas to which we can immediately respondIf we place side by side the texts of the Chandogya Upanishad and the Buddhas Discourse on the Four Noble Truths which are separated in time by perhaps only a hundred years the former seems to come from a cultural and spiritual milieu so remote we can hardly comprehend it while the latter sounds almost as if it had been spoken last week in Bombay London or New YorkIn attitude and perspective the Buddha comes so close to us it is hard to believe he is separated from us by a gulf of some yearsThat the Buddhas teaching should remain perennially relevant throughout the changing eras of human history that his message should be undimmed by the sheer passage of time is already implicit in the title by which he is most commonly knownFor the word Buddha as is widely known is not a proper name but an honorific title meaning the Enlightened One the Awakened One This title is given to him because he has woken up from the deep sleep of ignorance in which the rest of the world is absorbed because he has penetrated the deepest truths about the human condition and because he proclaims those truths with the aim of awakening others and enabling them to share his realizationDespite the shifting scenarios of history over twentyfive centuries despite the change in world views and modes of thought from one epoch to the next the basic truths of human life do not changeThey remain constant and are recognizable to those mature enough to reflect on them and intelligent enough to understand themFor this reason even today in our age of jet travel computer technology and genetic engineering it is perfectly fitting that the One who has Awakened should speak to us in words that are just as powerful just as cogent just as illuminating as they were when they were first proclaimed long ago in the towns and villages of Northeast IndiaAlthough we cannot determine with absolute precision the dates of the Buddhas life many scholars agree that he lived from approximately to BC a growing number of scholars follow a different chronology which places the dates about eighty years laterAs is natural with a spiritual leader who has made such a powerful impact on human civilization the account of his life that has come down to us has been embroidered with myth and legend which serve to bring before the minds eye the loftiness of his spiritual statureNevertheless in the oldest source on the Buddhas life the Sutta Pitaka of the Pali Canon we find a number of texts from which we can construct a fairly realistic picture of his careerWhat is striking about the picture given by these texts is that it shows the Buddhas life as a series of lessons which embody and convey the essential points of his teachingThus in his own life the person and the message merge together in an indissoluble unionThe future master was born into the Sakyan clan in a small republic nestled in the Himalayan foothills in a region which at present lies in southern NepalHis given name was Siddhattha and his family name GotamaLegend holds that he was the son of a powerful monarch but in actuality the Sakyan state was an oligarchic republic so his father was probably the chief of the ruling council of eldersBy the Buddhas time the Sakyan state had become a tributary of the powerful state of Kosala which corresponds to presentday Uttar PradeshEven the oldest suttas tell us that the infants birth was attended by various wondersSoon afterwards a sage named Asita came to visit the baby and recognizing on his body the marks of future greatness he bowed down to the child in homageAs a royal youth Prince Siddhattha was raised in luxuryHis father had built for him three palaces one for each season of the year and there he enjoyed himself in the company of his friendsAt the age of sixteen he married his cousin a beautiful princess named Yasodhara and lived a contented life in the Sakyan capital Kapilavatthu during this time he was probably trained in the martial arts and the skills of statecraftAs the years passed however when he reached his late twenties the prince became increasingly introspectiveWhat troubled him were the great burning issues we ordinarily take for granted  the questions concerning the purpose and meaning of our livesIs the purpose of our existence the enjoyment of sensual pleasures the achievement of wealth and status the exercise of powerOr is there something beyond these more real and fulfillingThese must have been the questions that rippled across his mind for we find his own reflections recorded for us in a discourse called The Noble QuestMonks before my enlightenment being myself subject to birth aging sickness and death to sorrow and defilement I sought what was subject to birth aging sickness and death to sorrow and defilementThen I considered thus Why being subject to birth to defilement should I seek what is subject to birth and defilementSuppose that being myself subject to birth having understood the danger in what is subject to birth I seek the unborn the supreme security from bondage NibbanaSuppose that being myself subject to aging sickness and death to sorrow and defilement I seek the unaging unailing deathless sorrowless and undefiled state the supreme security from bondage NibbanaThus at the age of in the prime of life with his parents weeping he cut off his hair and beard put on the saffron robes of a mendicant and entered upon the homeless life of renunciationThe developed Buddha biography adds that he left the palace on the very day that his wife gave birth to their only child the boy RahulaHaving left behind his home and family the Bodhisatta or seeker of enlightenment headed south for Magadha in whose environs small groups of seekers were quietly pursuing their quest for spiritual illumination usually under the guidance of a guruAt the time northern India could boast of a number of accomplished masters famous for their philosophical systems and achievements in meditationPrince Siddhattha sought out two of the most eminent Alara Kalama and Uddaka RamaputtaFrom them he learned systems of meditation which from the descriptions in the texts seem to have been forerunners of Raja YogaThe Bodhisatta mastered their teachings and systems of meditation but though he reached exalted levels of concentration he found these teachings insufficient for they did not lead to the goal he was seeking perfect enlightenment and the realization of Nibbana release from the sufferings of sentient existenceHaving left his teachers the Bodhisatta adopted a different path one that was popular in ancient India and still has followers today the path of asceticism of selfmortification pursued in the conviction that liberation is to be won by afflicting the body with pain beyond its normal levels of enduranceFor six years the Bodhisatta followed this method with unyielding determinationHe fasted for days on end until his body looked like a skeleton cloaked in skin he exposed himself to the heat of the midday sun and the cold of the night he subjected his flesh to such torments that he came almost to the door of deathYet he found that despite his persistence and sincerity these austerities were futileLater he would say that he took the path of selfmortification further than all other ascetics yet it led not to higher wisdom and enlightenment but only to physical weakness and the deterioration of his mental facultiesJust then he thought of another path to enlightenment one which balanced proper care of the body with sustained contemplation and deep investigationHe would later call this path the middle way because it avoids the extremes of sensual indulgence and selfmortificationHe had experienced both extremes the former as a prince and the latter as an ascetic and he knew they were ultimately dead endsTo follow the middle way however he realized he would first have to regain his strengthThus he gave up his practice of austerities and resumed taking nutritious foodAt the time five other ascetics had been living in attendance on the Bodhisatta hoping that when he attained enlightenment he would serve as their guideBut when they saw him partake of substantial meals they became disgusted with him and left him thinking the princely ascetic had given up his exertion and reverted to a life of luxuryNow he was alone and complete solitude allowed him to pursue his quest undisturbedOne day when his physical strength had returned he approached a lovely spot in Uruvela by the bank of the Nerañjara RiverHere he prepared a seat of straw beneath an asvattha tree and sat down crosslegged making a firm resolution that he would never rise up from that seat until he had won his goalAs night descended he entered into deeper and deeper stages of meditation until his mind was perfectly calm and composedThen the records tell us in the first watch of the night he directed his concentrated mind to the recollection of his previous livesGradually there unfolded before his inner vision his experiences in many past births even during many cosmic aeons in the middle watch of the night he developed the divine eye by which he could see beings passing away and taking rebirth in accordance with their karma their deeds and in the last watch of the night he penetrated the deepest truths of existence the most basic laws of reality and thereby removed from his mind the subtlest veils of ignoranceWhen dawn broke the figure sitting beneath the tree was no longer a Bodhisatta a seeker of enlightenment but a Buddha a Perfectly Enlightened One one who had attained the Deathless in this very life itselfFor several weeks the newly awakened Buddha remained in the vicinity of the Bodhi Tree contemplating from different angles the Dhamma the truth he had discoveredThen he came to a new crossroad in his spiritual career Was he to teach to try to share his realization with others or should he instead remain quietly in the forest enjoying the bliss of liberation aloneAt first his mind inclined to keeping quiet for he thought the truth he had realized was just too deep for others to understand too difficult to express in words and he was concerned he would just weary himself trying to convey his realization to othersBut now the texts introduce a dramatic element into the storyJust at the moment the Buddha decided to remain silent a high deity named Brahma Sahampati the Lord of a Thousand Worlds realized that if the Master remained silent the world would be lost deprived of the stainless path to deliverance from sufferingTherefore he descended to earth bowed down low before the Enlightened One and humbly pleaded with him to teach the Dhamma for the sake of those with little dust in their eyesThe Buddha then gazed out upon the world with his profound visionHe saw that people are like lotuses in a pond at different stages of growth and he understood that just as some lotuses close to the surface of the water need only the suns rays to rise above the surface and fully blossom so there are some people who need only to hear the noble teaching to win enlightenment and gain perfect liberation of mindWhen he saw this his heart was stirred by deep compassion and he decided to go back into the world and to teach the Dhamma to those who were ready to listenThe first ones he approached were his former companions the five ascetics who had deserted him a few months earlier and were now dwelling in a deer park at Sarnath near BenaresHe explained to them the truths he had discovered and on hearing his discourse they gained insight into the Dhamma becoming his first disciplesIn the months ahead his following grew by leaps and bounds as both householders and ascetics heard the liberating message gave up their former creeds and declared themselves disciples of the Enlightened OneEach year even into his old age he would wander among the villages towns and cities of the Ganges plain teaching all who would lend an ear he would rest only for the three months of the rainy season and then resume his wanderings which took him from present Delhi even as far east as BengalHe established a Sangha an order of monks and nuns for which he laid down an intricate body of rules and regulations this order still remains alive today perhaps the worlds oldest continuous institutionHe also attracted many lay followers who became devoted supporters of the Master and his SanghaAfter an active ministry of fortyfive years at the ripe age of eighty the Buddha headed for the northern town of KusinaraThere surrounded by many disciples he passed away into the Nibbana element with no remainder of conditioned existence severing forever his bondage to the round of rebirthsI said earlier that each of the major events in the Buddhas life gives us a specific object lesson in his teachingNow I want to draw out the lessons suggested by these eventsFirst the Bodhisattas awakening to the harsh realities of human existence  his discovery of our bondage to old age illness and death  teaches us the importance of deep reflection and critical thinkingHis awakening reflects back to us the somnambulance in which we usually live mired in our pleasures and petty concerns oblivious to the great affair staring us in the face at every moment of our livesHis awakening reminds us that we ourselves must emerge from the comfortable but dangerous cocoon of ignorance in which we have settled down that we must break away from our thoughtless infatuation with our youth health and vitality that we must rise to a new level of mature understanding which will enable us to triumph in our inevitable encounter with the Lord of DeathThe Bodhisattas departure from the palace his great renunciation teaches us a lesson in valuesIt shows us that from among the wide range of values which we can draw upon to give order to our lives the quest for enlightenment and liberation should reign supremeThis goal ranks far above the pleasure wealth and power to which we ordinarily give priority even above the call of social duty and mundane responsibilitiesThis does not mean of course that everyone who wants to follow the Buddhas path must be ready to leave behind home and family and adopt the lifestyle of a monk or nunThe Buddhas community of disciples included many householders as well as monks devout laymen and laywomen who attained high levels of awakening while living active lives within the worldBut the Buddhas example does show us that we must all order our values according to a scale which gives the highest place to the most worthy goal to that which is also the most real of all realities Nibbana and we should never allow the claims of mundane obligations to pull us away from pursuing our aspirationNext the Bodhisattas six years of struggle shows us that the quest for the highest goal is a strenuous undertaking that calls for deep dedication and unrelenting effortFortunately for us the Bodhisatta found that the practice of selfmortification is a fruitless exercise and thus we need not follow him in this directionBut his uncompromising pursuit of truth underscores the degree of effort that the quest for enlightenment requires and those who seek such a goal in full earnestness must be ready to submit to a difficult and demanding course of trainingThe Buddhas enlightenment teaches us that ultimate wisdom and deliverance from suffering is a real potential inherent in human beings one we can realize for ourselves without the aid or grace of an external saviorHis enlightenment also highlights the ideal of sensible moderation the middle way which has characterized Buddhism throughout its long historyThe quest for truth may be a difficult undertaking one which makes harsh demands on us but it does not ask us to subject ourselves to penance and selfpunishmentFinal victory is to be won not by tormenting the body but by developing the mind and this takes place through a course of training that balances care for the body with the cultivation of our higher spiritual facultiesThe decision the Buddha made after his enlightenment brings home another lesson to usAt this critical juncture when he was faced with the choice of either keeping his enlightenment to himself or taking up the challenge of teaching others the mandate of compassion prevailed in his heartLeaving behind the quietude of the forest he took upon himself the burden of guiding errant humanity along the path to liberationThis choice has had a tremendous impact on the subsequent development of Buddhism for throughout its long history the spirit of compassion has been the heartbeat of the Buddhas dispensation its innermost animating spiritIt was the Buddhas compassionate example that motivated Buddhist monks and nuns to travel across seas mountains and deserts at the risk of their lives to share the blessings of the Dhamma with those still lost in darknessIt is this example that inspires many Buddhists today in a wide variety of ways even when they can express their compassion only in humble acts of kindness and tender concern for those less fortunate than themselvesFinally the Buddhas passing away his attainment of final Nibbana teaches us once again that everything conditioned must perish that all formations are impermanent that even the greatest of spiritual masters is no exception to the very law he so often proclaimedHis passing away also teaches us that the highest bliss and peace comes only by relinquishing all through the stilling of all conditioned thingsFor this is the final entrance way to the attainment of the unconditioned the Deathless NibbanaTo ask why the Buddhas teaching proved so attractive and gained such a large following among all sectors of Northeast Indian society is to raise a question which is also relevant to us todayFor we live at a time when Buddhism is exerting a strong appeal upon an increasing number of people especially among those whose level of education and capacity for reflection has made them indifferent to the claims of revealed religionI believe the remarkable success of Buddhism as well as its contemporary appeal can be understood principally in terms of two factors one the aim of the teaching and the other its methodological featuresUnlike the socalled revealed religions which rest upon faith in unverifiable doctrines the Buddha formulated his teaching in a way that directly addresses the critical problem at the heart of human existence  the problem of suffering  and he promises that those who follow his teaching to its end will realize here and now the highest happiness and peaceAll other concerns apart from this such as theological dogmas metaphysical subtleties rituals and rules of worship the Buddha waves aside as irrelevant to the task at hand the unraveling of the problem of sufferingThis pragmatic thrust of the Dhamma is clearly illustrated by an incident related in the textsOnce a monk named Malunkyaputta was pondering the great metaphysical questions  whether the world is eternal or noneternal infinite or finite etc and he felt unhappy because the Buddha had refused to answer themSo one day Malunkyaputta went to the Master and told him Either you answer these questions for me or I leave the orderThe Buddha then told Malunkyaputta that the spiritual life did not depend on any answers to these questions which were mere distractions from the real challenge of following the pathHe then compared the metaphysician to a man struck by a poisoned arrowWhen his relatives bring a surgeon the man tells him  I wont let you remove the arrow until you let me know the name of the man who struck me the type of bow he used the material from which the arrow was made and the kind of poison he used That man would die the Buddha said before the arrow was removed and so too the metaphysician struck with the arrow of suffering will die without ever finding the path to freedomNot only does the Buddha make suffering and release from suffering the focus of his teaching but he deals with the problem of suffering in a way that reveals an extraordinary degree of psychological insightLike a psychoanalyst the Buddha traces suffering to its roots within our minds to our craving and clinging and he holds that the cure the solution to the problem of suffering must also be achieved within our mindsTo gain freedom from suffering it is futile to pray to the gods to worship holy objects to attach ourselves to rituals and ceremoniesSince suffering arises from our own mental defilements we have to purify our minds of these defilements from our greed hatred and ignorance and this requires profound inner honestyWhile other religions lead us outward  towards ideas of a deity who determines our fate or to lofty philosophical abstractions like the idea of a universal self or a nondual reality in which all opposites are resolved  the Buddha leads us back to ourselves always keeping his teaching attuned to the hard facts of experienceHe places the mind at the forefront of his analysis and says that it is the mind which fashions our actions the mind which shapes our destiny the mind which leads us towards misery or happinessThe beginning point of the teaching is the ordinary mind in bondage and subject to suffering the end point is the enlightened mind completely purified and liberated from sufferingThe whole teaching unfolds between these two points taking the most direct routeSelfrelianceThis discussion of the aim of the Buddhas teaching leads us to the teachings characteristic featuresOne of its most attractive features closely related to its psychological orientation is its emphasis on selfrelianceFor the Buddha the key to liberation is mental purity and correct understanding and for this reason he rejects the notion that we can gain salvation by leaning on any external authorityHe says By oneself is evil done by oneself is one defiledBy oneself is evil left undone by oneself is one purifiedPurity and defilement depend on oneself no one can purify anotherThis stress on human effort on our capacity to liberate ourselves is a distinctive feature of early Buddhism and offers a remarkable affirmation of the human potentialThe Buddha does not claim any divine status for himself nor does he assert that he is an agent of human salvationHe claims to be not a personal savior but a guide and teacher You yourselves must strive the Buddha only points the wayThose who meditate and practice the path are freed from the bonds of deathThroughout his ministry he urged his disciples to be islands to yourselves be refuges to yourselves without looking to any external refuge Even on his deathbed he gave his followers this last piece of advice All conditioned things are subject to decayAttain the goal by diligenceExperiential EmphasisSince wisdom or insight is the chief instrument of enlightenment the Buddha always asked his disciples to follow him on the basis of their own understanding not from obedience or unquestioning trustHe calls his Dhamma ehipassiko which means Come and see for yourself He invites inquirers to investigate his teaching to examine it in the light of their own reason and intelligence and to gain confirmation of its truth for themselvesThe Dhamma is said to be paccattam veditabbo viññuhi to be personally understood by the wise and this requires intelligence and sustained inquiryOnce the Buddha arrived at the town of a people called the Kalamas who had been visited by many other asceticsEach visiting teacher would praise his own doctrine to the sky and tear down the views of his rivals and this left the Kalamas utterly confusedSo when the Buddha arrived they came to him explained their dilemma and asked if he could offer some guidanceThe Buddha did not praise his own teaching and attack his rivalsRather he told themIt is right for you to doubt doubt has arisen in you about dubious mattersCome Kalamas do not rely on oral tradition or on the lineage of teachers or on holy scriptures or on abstract logicDo not place blind trust in impressive personalities or in venerated gurus but examine the issue for yourselvesWhen you know for yourselves that something is unwholesome and harmful then you should reject itAnd when you know for yourselves that something is wholesome and beneficial then you should accept it and put it into practiceUniversalityBecause the Buddhas teaching deals with the most universal of all human problems the problem of suffering he made his teaching a universal message one which was addressed to all human beings solely by reason of their humanityAt the time the Buddha appeared on the Indian scene the higher religious teachings recorded in the Vedas were reserved for the brahmans a privileged elite who performed sacrifices and rituals for othersOrdinary people were told to perform their duties in a spirit of humility in the hope that they might win a more fortunate rebirth and thus gain access to the sacred teachingsBut the Buddha placed no restrictions on the people to whom he taught the DhammaHe held that what made a person noble was his personal character and conduct not his family and caste statusThus he opened the doors of liberation to people of all social classesBrahmans kings and princes merchants farmers workers even outcasts  all were welcome to hear the Dhamma without discrimination and many from the lower classes attained the highest stage of enlightenmentWithin the wider Indian society the Buddha did not attempt to abolish the caste system which it seems had not yet developed into the complex oppressive system it became several centuries laterHowever he flatly rejected the orthodox brahman view that a persons class status was an indication of his intrinsic worthWithin the Sangha the monastic order he completely disregarded all distinctions of social class declaringJust as the waters of the four great rivers flow into the ocean and become known simply as the water of the ocean so when people of all four social classes go forth as monks in my teaching they give up their social status and become known simply as disciples of the BuddhaAs part of his universalist project the Buddha also threw open the doors of his teaching to womenAmong the followers of Brahmanism sacred teachings were the province of menWomen were to perform their domestic chores dutifully to care for their husbands and inlaws and to bear children preferably sonsThey were excluded from performing the Vedic rituals and even the teachings of the Upanishads were with rare exceptions the prerogative of menThe Buddha in contrast taught the Dhamma freely to both men and womenAt first he hesitated to establish an order of nuns since this would have been a radical step in his age but once he agreed to create the order of nuns women from all walks of life  princesses housewives daughters of good family servant women even former prostitutes  went forth into homelessness and attained the highest goalA Code of EthicsOne aspect of the Buddhas universalism deserves special mention this is his conception of a universal code of ethicsIt would be too extreme to say that the Buddha was the first religious teacher to formulate a moral code for moral codes of different kinds had been laid down from the dawn of civilizationBut it might not be farfetched to say that the Buddha was one of the very first teachers to separate out true moral principles from the complex fabric of social norms and communal customs with which they were generally interwovenWith astute sophistication of thought the Buddha provides for us an abstract principle to use as a guideline in determining the basic precepts of moralityThis is the rule of using oneself as a standard for deciding how to treat othersFrom this abstract principle he derives the four main precepts of his moral code to abstain from killing from stealing from sexual misconduct and from lyingIn the interest of personal welfare and communal harmony he adds a fifth to abstain from intoxicantsTogether these give us the Five Precepts the basic moral code of BuddhismThe Buddha however did not regard morality merely as a set of rules based on reasoningHe taught that there is a universal law which connects our conduct with our personal destinies ensuring that moral justice ultimately prevails in the worldThis is the law of karma and its fruit which holds that our intentional actions determine the type of rebirth we take and the diverse experiences we undergo in the course of our livesThis law is utterly impersonal in its operationIt gives no one preferential treatment it recognizes no VIPs or favorites but works with absolute uniformity towards allThose who violate the laws of morality  whether they be high class or low class rich or poor  acquire unwholesome karma and must suffer the consequences a bad rebirth and future miseryThose who adhere to the moral rules who engage in virtuous conduct acquire wholesome karma leading to future benefits a good rebirth a happy life and progress on the way to final liberationIn conformity with the psychological orientation of his teaching the Buddha gave special attention to the subjective springs of moralityHe traces immoral behavior to three mental factors called the three unwholesome roots  greed hatred and delusion and he traces ethical behavior to their opposites the three wholesome roots  nongreed or generosity nonhate or kindness and nondelusion or wisdomHe also directs us to a more refined interior level of ethical purity to be achieved by developing in meditation four lofty attitudes called the divine abodesThese are lovingkindness the wish for the happiness and welfare of all beings compassion the wish that all afflicted with suffering be freed from their suffering altruistic joy rejoicing in the happiness and success of others and equanimity impartiality of mindThese four attitudes are to be developed universally towards all beings without distinctions or discriminationBefore I close there is one further feature of the Buddhas method that I want to mentionThis is what might be called his skill in means Through his deep meditative attainments and his enlightened wisdom the Buddha had the special ability to discover the precise way to teach the people who came to him for guidanceHe could read deep into the hidden recesses of a persons heart perceive that persons aptitudes and interests and frame his teaching in the exact way needed to transform that person and lead him or her on to the path of freedomThe texts abound in many examples of this supreme pedagogic skill of the BuddhaHere I will relate just two famous instancesThe first is the case of Angulimala a serial killer who lived in the forests of Kosala outside the capital SavatthiAngulimala repeatedly attacked travelers killed them and cut off their fingers which he wove into a necklace that he wore around his neckHe had killed hundreds of people and was feared throughout the kingdomHe was wanted dead or alive but no one had the courage to pursue himThe Buddha saw however with his supernormal vision that Angulimala had another side to his character as terrible as he was he had the hidden potential to become an arahant a saintThus one day all alone he headed out for the forest where Angulimala was dwellingWhen Angulimala saw him he thought Ah now I will kill this ascetic and cut off his finger for my necklace He started to run after him with his knife poised in the airBut no matter how fast he ran he could not reach himFor the Buddha while walking along slowly had performed a feat of psychic power such that Angulimala running with all his might could not catch up with himAngulimala ran and ran but could not gain an inchHe then called out Stop ascetic stop The Buddha replied I have stopped Angulimala you stop tooThis statement had a deep impact on the criminal an impact which struck down to the depths of his heartHe realized that the ascetic before him was the famous teacher the Enlightened One and he knew the Buddha had come to him out of compassion to save him from his terrible deedsHe threw away his knife bowed down at the Masters feet and asked to be accepted as a monkThe Buddha admitted him into the order and after a short time Angulimala became an arahant perfectly wise and deeply compassionateThe second story concerns the woman KisagotamiShe was a poor woman who had married into a wealthy family but she did not bear children and was thus scorned by her inlawsThis made her very miserableBut after some time she conceived and gave birth to a son who became for her the source of boundless joyNow that she had brought forth an heir to their wealth everyone else in her husbands family too accepted herBut a few months after his birth the child died and Kisagotami became distraughtShe refused to believe the boy was dead but convinced herself he was only illThus she went around everywhere asking people to give her medicine for her sonThe townsfolk ridiculed her and abused her calling her a mad woman until she finally came into the presence of the BuddhaWhen she asked him for medicine he did not give her an eloquent sermon on impermanenceHe told her that he could indeed make some medicine for her son but first she would have to bring him one ingredient mustard seeds from a home where no one had ever diedQuite optimistic she went from house to house asking for mustard seedsAt each door people readily gave her seeds but when she asked the donor whether anyone in that home had ever died she was told Here a father has died here a mother here a wife here a husband a brother a sister and so onShe thus came to see that death is the universal fate of all living beings not a unique calamity that befell her own sonSo she returned to the Buddha aware now of the universal law of impermanenceWhen the Master saw her coming he asked her Did you bring the mustard seeds Gotami And she replied Done sir is this business of the mustard seedsGrant me a refuge The Buddha had her ordained as a nun and after some time she realized the highest goal and became one of the most eminent nuns in the Bhikkhuni Sangha or Order of NunsTo sum up the Buddhas mission was to establish a path to spiritual perfection to full enlightenment and Nibbana liberation from sufferingHe did this by propounding a teaching that acknowledged our capacity for attaining spiritual perfection yet which also remained fully respectful of the intelligence and autonomy of human beingsHis approach was psychological in orientation nondogmatic pragmatic and open to investigationHe emphasized selfeffort moral rectitude and personal responsibility and he proclaimed his message universally holding that the potential for spiritual growth and even for the highest enlightenment was accessible to anyone who makes the appropriate effortIt is these factors that give to the ancient teaching of the Buddha such a distinctly modern flavor making it so relevant to us in these times of shifting ideas and changing valuesThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseMyanmar or Burma as the nation has been known throughout history is one of the major countries following Theravada BuddhismIn recent years Myanmar has attained special eminence as the host for the Sixth Buddhist Council held in Yangon between and and as the source from which two of the major systems of Vipassana meditation have emanated out into the greater world the tradition springing from the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw of Thathana Yeiktha and that springing from Sayagyi U Ba Khin of the International Meditation CentreThis booklet is intended to offer a short history of Buddhism in Myanmar from its origins through the countrys loss of independence to Great Britain in the late nineteenth centuryI have not dealt with more recent history as this has already been well documentedTo write an account of the development of a religion in any country is a delicate and demanding undertaking and one will never be quite satisfied with the resultThis booklet does not pretend to be an academic work shedding new light on the subjectIt is designed rather to provide the interested nonacademic reader with a brief overview of the subjectThe booklet has been written for the Buddhist Publication Society to complete its series of Wheel titles on the history of the Sasana in the main Theravada Buddhist countriesThe material has been sifted and organised from the point of view of a practicing BuddhistInevitably it thus involves some degree of personal interpretationI have given importance to sources that would be accorded much less weight in a strictly academic treatment of the subject as I feel that in this case the oral tradition may well be more reliable than modern historians would normally admitOne of the objectives of the narrative is to show that the Buddhas Teaching did not make a lasting impression on Myanmar immediately upon first arrivalThe Sasana had to be reintroduced or purified again and again from the outside until Myanmar had matured to the point of becoming one of the main shrines where the Theravada Buddhist teachings are preservedThe religion did not develop in MyanmarRather the Myanmar people developed through the religion until the Theravada faith became embedded in their culture and Pali Buddhism became second nature to themI dedicate this work to my teachers Mother Sayamagyi and Sayagyi U Chit TinThere are four dominant ethnic groups in the recorded history of Myanmar the Mon the Pyu the Myanmar and the ShanUncertainty surrounds the origins of the Mon but it is clear that at least linguistically they are related to the KhmerWhat is known is that they settled in the south of Myanmar and Thailand while the Khmer made northern Thailand Laos and Cambodia their homeThese two peoples were probably the first migrants to the region apart from Indian merchants who established trading colonies along the coastThe Mon with their distinct language and culture competed for centuries with the MyanmarHowever today their influence and language is limited to remote areas of the southThe Pyu like the Myanmar are a people of TibetoBurman origin with a distinct culture and languageThey lived in the area around Prome long before the Myanmar pushed into the plains of Myanmar from the northTheir language was closely related to the language of the Myanmar and was later absorbed by itTheir script was in use until about the fourteenth century but was then lostThe Myanmar people began to colonise the plains of Myanmar only towards the middle of the first millennium ADThey came from the mountainous northern regions and may well have originated in the Central Asian plainsAfter the Myanmar the Shan flooded in from the North finally conquering the entire region of Myanmar and ThailandThe Thai people are descended from Shan tribesThe northeast region of modern Myanmar is still inhabited predominantly by Shan tribesIn the sixth century BC most of what we now know as Myanmar Thailand Laos and Cambodia was sparsely populatedWhile migrants from the east coast of India had formed trading colonies along the coast of the Gulf of Martaban these coastal areas of Myanmar and Thailand were also home to the MonBy this time the Khmer probably controlled Laos Cambodia and northern Thailand while Upper Myanmar may already have been occupied to some extent by Myanmar tribesAs these early settlers did not use lasting materials for construction our knowledge of their civilization remains scantWe do know however that their way of life was very simple  as it remains today in rural areas  probably requiring only wooden huts with palmleaf roofs for habitationWe can assume that they were not organised into units larger than village communities and that they did not possess a written languageTheir religion must have been some form of nature worship or animism still found today among the more remote tribes of the regionThere were also more highly developed communities of Indian origin in the form of trading settlements located along the entire coast from Bengal to BorneoIn Myanmar they were located in Thaton Pegu Yangon and MraukU in Arakan also probably along the Tenasserim and Arakan coastsThese settlers had mainly migrated from Orissa on the northeastern coast of the Indian subcontinent and also from the Deccan in the southeastIn migrating to these areas they had also brought their own culture and religion with themInitially the contact between the Hindu traders and the Mon peasants must have been limitedHowever the Indian settlements their culture and traditions were eventually absorbed into the Mon cultureGEHarvey in his History of Burma relates a Mon legend which refers to the Mon fighting Hindu strangers who had come back to reconquer the country that had formerly belonged to themThis Mon tale confirms the theory that Indian people had formed the first communities in the region but that these were eventually replaced by the Mon with the development of their own civilizationAs well as the Indian trading settlements there were also some Pyu settlements particularly in the area of Prome where a flourishing civilization later developedAlso it is assumed that some degree of migration from India to the region of Tagaung and Mogok in Upper Myanmar had taken place through Assam and later through Manipur but the hinterland was of course much less attractive to traders than the coastal regions with their easy access by seaA tradition of Myanmar says that Tagaung was founded by Abhiraja a prince of the Sakyans who had migrated to Upper Myanmar from Nepal in the ninth century BThe city was subsequently conquered by the Chinese in approximately BC and Pagan and Prome were founded by refugees fleeing southwardIn fact some historians believe that like the Myanmar the Sakyans were a Mongolian rather than an IndoAryan race and that the Buddhas clansmen were derived from Mongolian stockThe source of information for many of the events related forthwith is the SasanavamsaThe Sasanavamsa is a chronicle written in Pali by a bhikkhu Pannasami for the Fifth Buddhist Council held in Mandalay inAs the Sasanavamsa is a recent compilation many events mentioned therein may be doubtedHowever as it draws on both written records some of which are no longer available and on the oral tradition of Myanmar information can be included in this account with the understanding that it is open to verificationThere are many instances in the history of Southeast Asian tribes in which a conquering people incorporates into its own traditions not only the civilization of the conquered but also their clan gods royal lineage and thereby their historyThis fact would explain the visits of the Buddha to Thaton and Shwesettaw in the Mon and Myanmar oral tradition and the belief of the Arakanese that the Buddha visited their king and left behind an image of himself for them to worshipModern historiography will of course dismiss these stories as fabrications made out of national pride as the Myanmar had not even arrived in the region at the time of the BuddhaHowever it is possible that the Myanmar and Arakanese integrated into their own lore the oral historical tradition of their Indian predecessorsThis does not prove that the visits really took place but it seems a more palatable explanation of the existence of these accounts than simply putting them down to historical afterthought of a Buddhist people eager to connect itself with the origins of their religionThe Sasanavamsa mentions several visits of the Buddha to Myanmar and one other important event the arrival of the hair relics in Ukkala soon after the Buddhas enlightenmentTapussa and Bhallika two merchants from Ukkala were traveling through the region of Uruvela and were directed to the Buddha by their family godThe Buddha had just come out of seven weeks of meditation after his awakening and was sitting under a tree feeling the need for foodTapussa and Bhallika made an offering of rice cake and honey to the Buddha and took the two refuges the refuge in the Buddha and the refuge in the DhammaAs they were about to depart they asked the Buddha for an object to worship in his stead and he gave them eight hairs from his headAfter the two returned from their journey they enshrined the three hairs in a stupa which is now the great Shwedagon Pagoda in YangonIt is believed in Myanmar that the hill upon which the Shwedagon Pagoda stands was not haphazardly chosen by Tapussa and Bhallika but was in fact the site where the three Buddhas preceding the Buddha Gotama in this world cycle themselves deposited relicsBuddha Kakusandha is said to have left his staff on the Theinguttara Hill the Buddha Konagamana his water filter and Buddha Kassapa a part of his robeBecause of this the Buddha requested Tapussa and Bhallika to enshrine his relics in this locationTapussa and Bhallika traveled far and wide in order to find the hill on which they could balance a tree without its touching the ground either with the roots or with the crownEventually they found the exact spot not far from their home in Lower Myanmar where they enshrined the holy relics in a traditional mound or stupaThe original stupa is said to have been feet highToday the Shwedagon pagoda has grown to over feetThe Myanmar oral tradition speaks of four visits of the Buddha to the regionWhile these visits were of utmost significance in their own right they are also important in having established places of pilgrimage up to the present dayPunna a merchant from Sunaparanta went to Savatthi on business and there heard a discourse of the BuddhaHaving won faith in the Buddha and the Teachings he took ordination as a bhikkhuAfter sometime he asked the Buddha to teach him a short lesson so that he could return to Sunaparanta and strive for arahatshipThe Buddha warned him that the people of Sunaparanta were fierce and violent but Punna replied that he would not allow anger to arise even if they should kill himIn the Punnovada Sutta the Buddha instructed him not to be enticed by that which is pleasant and Punna returned and attained arahatship in his countryHe won over many disciples and built a monastery of red sandalwood for the BuddhaHe then sent flowers as an invitation to the Buddha and the Buddha came accompanied by five hundred arahats spent the night in the monastery and left again before dawnSakka the king of the thirtythree devas living in the Tavatimsa plane provided five hundred palanquins for the bhikkhus accompanying the Buddha on the journey to SunaparantaBut only of the palanquins were occupiedOne of them remained empty until the ascetic Saccabandha who lived on the Saccabandha mountain in central Myanmar joined the Buddha and the bhikkhus accompanying himOn the way to Sunaparanta the Buddha stopped in order to teach the ascetic SaccabandhaWhen Saccabanda attained arahatship he then joined the Buddha and completed the total of bhikkhus who usually traveled with the MasterOn the return journey the Buddha stopped at the river Nammada close to the Saccabandha mountainHere the Blessed One was invited by the Naga king Nammada to visit and preach to the Nagas later accepting food from themThe tradition of Myanmar relates that he left behind a footprint for veneration near this river which would last as long as the SasanaAnother footprint was left in the rock of the Saccabandha mountainThese footprints still visible today were worshipped by the Mon Pyu and Myanmar kings alike and have remained among the holiest places of pilgrimage in MyanmarIn the fifteenth century after the decimation of the population through the Siamese campaigns knowledge of the footprints was lostThen in the year King Thalun sent learned bhikkhus to the region fortuitously they were able to relocate the Buddhas footprintsSince then Shwesettaw the place where the footprints are found has once again become an important place of pilgrimage in MyanmarAnd in the dry season thousands of devout Buddhists travel there to pay respectsCandrasuriya the king of Dhannavati on hearing that a Buddha had arisen in India desired to go there to learn the DhammaThe Buddha aware of his intention said to Ananda The king will have to pass through forests dangerous to travelers wide rivers will impede his journey he must cross a sea full of monstersIt will be an act of charity if we go to his dominion so that he may pay homage without risking his lifeSo the Buddha went there and was received with great pomp by King Candrasuriya and his peopleThe Buddha then taught the five and eight precepts and instructed the king in the ten kingly duties namely universal beneficence daily paying homage the showing of mercy taxes of not more than a tenth part of the produce justice punishment without anger the support of his subjects as the earth supports them the employment of prudent commanders the taking of good counsel and the avoidance of prideThe Buddha remained for a week and on preparing for his departure the king requested that he leave an image of himself so that they could worship him even in his absenceThe Buddha consented to this and Sakka the king of the gods himself formed the image with the metals collected by the king and his peopleIt was completed in one week and when the Buddha breathed onto it the people exclaimed that now there were indeed two Buddhas so alike was the image to the great sageThen the Buddha made a prophesy addressing the image I shall pass into Nibbana in my eightieth year but you will live for five thousand years which I have foreseen as the duration of my TeachingThe Mahamuni image remained in its original location until when King Bodawpaya conquered Arakan and had the image transported to Mandalay where a special shrine the Arakan pagoda was built to enshrine the threemeter imageTo have this image in his capital greatly added to his prestige as a Buddhist king as it was one of the most sacred objects in the regionThe king himself went out of his city to meet the approaching image with great devotion and through the long colonnades leading to the pagoda there used to come daily from the Myanmar palace so long as a king reigned there sumptuous offerings borne in stately procession marshalled by a minister and shaded by the white umbrellaThe Third Buddhist Council was held in the reign of Emperor Asoka in the year BC in order to purify the Sangha to reassert orthodox teaching and to refute heresyBut the work of the Council did not stop thereWith the support of Emperor Asoka experienced teachers were sent to border regions in order to spread the teachings of the BuddhaThis dispersal of missionaries is recorded in the Mahavamsa a Sinhalese chronicle on the history of BuddhismAccording to the Sasanavamsa the above mentioned regions are the following Kasmira and Gandhara is the right bank of the Indus river south of Kabul Mahisamandala is Andhra Vanavasa is the region around Prome Aparantaka is west of the upper Irrawaddy Maharattha is Thailand Yona the country of the Shan tribes and Suvannabhumi is ThatonThe Sasanavamsa mentions five places in Southeast Asia where Asokas missionaries taught the Buddhas doctrine and through their teaching many gained insight and took refuge in the Triple GemThere are two interesting features mentioned in the textFirst in order to ordain nuns bhikkhunis other bhikkhunis had to be present and secondly the Brahmajala Sutta was preached in ThatonThe Sasanavamsa goes on to describe sixty thousand women ordaining in AparantaIt states that women could not have been ordained without the presence of bhikkhunis as in Sri Lanka where women could only be ordained after Mahindas sister Sanghamitta had followed her brother thereIn this case the author surmises that bhikkhunis must have followed Dhammarakkhita to Aparanta at a later stageThe Brahmajala Sutta which the arahats Sona and Uttara preached in Thaton deals in detail with the different schools of philosophical and religious thought prevalent in India at the time of the BuddhaThe fact that Sona and Uttara chose this Sutta to convert the inhabitants of Suvannabhumi indicates that they were facing a wellinformed public familiar with the views of Brahmanism that were refuted by the Buddha in this discourseThere can be no doubt that only Indian colonisers not the Mon would have been able to follow an analysis of Indian philosophy as profound as the Brahmajala SuttaWhile there is no conclusive archaeological proof that Buddhism continued to be practiced in southern Myanmar after the missions of the Third Council the Sasanavamsa refers to an unbroken lineage of teachers passing on the Dhamma to their disciplesIn a third century AD inscription by a South Indian king in Nagarjunakonda the land of the Cilatas is mentioned in a list of countries visited by a group of bhikkhusHistorians believe the Cilatas or Kiratas to be identical to the Mon populations of Lower MyanmarThe inscription states that the bhikkhus sent to the Cilata country converted the population there to BuddhismIn the same inscription missions to other countries such as Sri Lanka are mentionedIt is generally believed that most of these countries had received earlier Buddhist missionaries sent by Buddhist kings but as civilization in these lands was relatively undeveloped teachings as profound as the Buddhas had probably become distorted by local religions or possibly been completely lostIt is possible that these missions did not so much reestablish Buddhism but rather purify the type of Buddhism practiced thereSouthern India was then the guardian of the Theravada faith and obviously remained in contact with countries that had been converted in earlier times but were unable to preserve the purity of the religionAs has been already mentioned the first datable archaeological finds of the Mon civilization stem from the Mon kingdom of Dvaravati in the South of ThailandThey consist of a Roman oil lamp and a bronze statue of the Buddha which are believed to be no later than the first or second century ADIn discussing the Mon Theravada Buddhist civilization we cannot remain in Myanmar onlyFor only by studying the entire sphere of influence of the Mon in this period can a comprehensive picture be constructedThis sphere includes large parts of present day ThailandIn fact the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Yuan Chwang who traveled to India in about AD describes a single Mon country stretching from Prome to Chenla in the east and including the Irrawaddy and Sittang deltasHe calls the country Dvaravati but the annals of the court of China of the same period mention Dvaravati as a vassal of ThatonWe can therefore safely conclude that the Mon of the region formed a fairly homogenous group in which the distribution of power was obviously not always evident to the outsiderLower Myanmar was also inhabited by another ethnic group the Pyu who were probably closely related to the modern MyanmarThey had their capital at Sri Ksetra and were also followers of the Theravada Buddhist faithChinese travelers reports of the midthird century AD refer to the kingdom of LinYang where Buddha was venerated by all and where several thousand monks or bhikkhus livedAs LinYang was to the west of Kamboja and could not be reached by sea we can infer that the Chinese travelers must have been referring to the ancient kingdom of PromeThis is all the more likely as archaeological finds prove that only about one century later Pali Buddhist texts including Abhidhamma texts were studied by the PyuThe earliest highly developed urban settlement of the Pyu was Beikthano near PromeHowever its importance dwindled towards the sixth century when Sri Ksetra became the center of Pyu civilizationA major monastery built in the fourth century has been unearthed at BeikthanoThe building constructed in brick with a stupa and shrine located nearby is identical to the Buddhist monasteries of Nagarjunakonda the great Buddhist center of southern IndiaIt is situated near a stupa and a shrine a design which is identical to the one used in South IndiaBricks had been used by the Pyus since the second century AD for the construction of pillared halls which formed the temples of their original religionInterestingly the Pyu bricks have always been of the exact dimensions as those used at the time of Emperor Asoka in IndiaBut the brick laying techniques used in the monastery in Beikthano were far inferior to the ones used in their southern Indian counterpartsFor such a major edifice as the monastery at Beikthano to have been constructed the religion must have been well established at least among the ruling classHow long it took for Buddhism to become influential in Pyu society is difficult to determine but some historians assume that the first contacts with Asokan religious centers in India took place in the second century ADThis would allow for a period of development of two hundred years until the first important shrine was builtDespite the Indian architectural influence the inferior brick laying techniques found in Beikthano indicate that indigenous architects and artisans rather than imported craftsmen or Indian colonisers were employed in the construction of monasteries and other important buildingsIt should of course not be forgotten that the Pyu possessed an architecture of their own and a highly developed urban culture that had evolved quite independently of Indian influencesTheravada Buddhism found a fertile ground in this highly developed civilizationIt is probable that the Pyu civilization was more advanced than that of the MonThe Pyu sites found around Prome are the earliest urban sites in Southeast Asia found to dateThe urban developments and datable monuments in Thailand and Cambodia are only from the seventh centuryOlder artifacts may have been found in Thailand but they were not products of indigenous people and do not prove the existence of a developed civilizationThe information we have of the state of the religion in the Mon and Pyu societies during the first four centuries AD is very limitedHowever by the fifth century with the development of religious activity in the region information becomes more substantiveThe historical tradition of Myanmar gives the credit for this religious resurgence to a wellknown Buddhist scholar Acariya BuddhaghosaAcariya Buddhaghosa was the greatest commentator on the Pali Buddhist texts whose Visuddhimagga and commentaries to the canon are regarded as authoritative by Theravada scholarsThe chronicles of Myanmar firmly maintain that Buddhaghosa was of Mon origin and a native of ThatonThey state that his return from Sri Lanka with the Pali scriptures the commentaries and grammatical works gave a fresh impetus to the religionHowever modern historians do not accept that Buddhaghosa was from Myanmar while some even doubt his existenceDespite this contention Eliot in his Hinduism and Buddhism gives more weight to circumstantial evidence and writesThe Sinhalese chronicles especially the Mahavamsa place Buddhaghosa in the first half of the fifth centuryAlthough he spent most of his active working life in Sri Lanka he is also credited with imbuing new life into Theravada Buddhism in South India and developing such important centers as Kancipura and Uragapuram that were closely connected with Prome and ThatonProof of this connection can be found in archeological finds in the environs of Prome which include Pali literature inscribed in the Kadambe script on gold and stone platesThis script was used in the fifth and sixth century in southern IndiaAll in all Myanmar has a valid case for claiming some connection with BuddhaghosaIt is of course impossible to prove that he was born there or even visited there but his influence undoubtedly led to great religious activity in the kingdoms of Lower MyanmarFrom the fifth century until the conquest of Lower Myanmar by Pagan there is a continuous record of Buddhism flourishing in the Mon and Pyu kingdomsThe Mon kingdoms are mentioned in travel reports of several Chinese Buddhist pilgrims and also in the annals of the Chinese courtIn the fifth century Thaton and Pegu are mentioned in the Buddhist commentarial literature for the first timeThey were now firmly established on the map as Buddhist centers of learningDespite this Buddhism was not without rivals in the regionThis is shown by the following event some chronicles of Myanmar mentionA king of Pago Tissa by name had abandoned the worship of the Buddha and instead practiced Brahmanical worshipHe persecuted the Buddhists and destroyed Buddha images or cast them into ditchesA pious Buddhist girl the daughter of a merchant restored the images then washed and worshipped themThe king could not tolerate such defiance of course and had the girl dragged before himHe tried to have her executed in several ways but she seemed impossible to killElephants would not trample herwhile the fire of her pyre would not burn herEventually the king intrigued by these events asked the girl to perform a miracleHe stated that if she was able to make a Buddha image produce seven new images and then make all eight statues fly into heaven she would be set freeThe girl spoke an act of truth and the eight Buddha statues flew up into the skyThe king was then converted to Buddhism and elevated the girl to the position of chief queenUntil now archaeological finds of Mon ruins in Myanmar are meager but at Pong Tuk in southern Thailand a Mon city dating from the second half of the first millennium AD has been unearthedHere excavations have revealed the foundations of several buildingsOne contained the remains of a platform and fragments of columns similar to the Buddhist vihara at Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka another with a square foundation of round stones seems to have been a stupaStatues of Indian origin from the Gupta period were also found at the siteThe Theravada Buddhist culture of the Mon flourished in both Dvaravati and ThatonHowever the Mon civilization in Thailand did not survive the onslaught of the Khmer in the eleventh century who were worshipping Hindu godsIn Myanmar the Mon kingdom was conquered by PaganThe Myanmar were eager to accept the Mon culture and especially their religion while the Khmer as Hindus at best tolerated itThe Pyu culture of this period is well documented because of archaeological finds at Muanggan a small village close to the ancient ruins of HmawzaThere two perfectly preserved inscribed gold plates were foundThese inscriptions reveal three texts the verses spoken by Assaji to Sariputta a list of categories of the Abhidhamma and the formula of worship of Buddha Dhamma and SanghaAt the same site a book with twenty leaves of gold protected with golden covers was discoveredIt contained texts such as the paticcasamuppada the vipassanananas and various other excerpts from the Abhidhamma and the other two baskets of the Buddhist scripturesThe scripts in all these documents are identical to scripts used in parts of southern India and can be dated from the third to the sixth century ADIn addition to these golden plates a number of sculptures and reliefs were found in HmawzaThey depict either the Buddha or scenes from his life for example the birth of the Buddha and the taming of the wild elephant NalagiriThe sculpture is similar in style to that of Amaravati a center of Buddhist learning in South IndiaThere were also unearthed remains of Brahman temples and sites of Mahayana worship of east Indian origin hence it would appear that several faiths of which the Theravada was the strongest coexisted in Sri Ksetra the then capital of the PyuThe script used by the Pyu is indicative of major links with Buddhist kingdoms in South India rather than with Sri LankaAnd it can be surmised that the bhikkhus of the Deccan and other regions of southern India were the teachers of both the Mon and the Pyu in religious matters as well as in the arts and sciencesThe inscriptions show how highly developed scholarship of the Pali Buddhist texts must have been in Lower Myanmar even in these early daysLearning had gone well beyond the basics into the world of Abhidhamma studiesPali was obviously well known as a language of learning but unfortunately no original texts composed in Sri Ksetra or Thaton have come down to usInterestingly some of the texts inscribed on these gold plates are not identical to the same canonical texts as they are known todayTherefore the Tipitaka known to the Pyu must have been replaced by a version preserved in a country that had no close contact with the PyuThis could well have been Sri Lanka as this country came to play an important role in the history of Buddhism in Myanmar through the friendship between the conqueror of Lower Myanmar Anawratha and the king who drove the Hindus from Sri Lanka VijayabahuThe finds on the site of the ancient Pyu capital confirm the reports of the Chinese pilgrims and also the Tang imperial chronicles of China which state They dislike taking lifeThey know how to make astronomical calculationsThey are Buddhists and have a hundred monasteries with brick of glass embellished with gold and silver vermilion gay colours and red kino At seven years of age the people cut their hair and enter a monastery if at the age of twenty they have not grasped the doctrine they return to the lay stateBoth Buddhist cultures in the south of Myanmar the Mon and the Pyu were swept away in the eleventh century by armies of the Myanmar who had found a unifying force in their leader the founder of Pagan and champion of Buddhism AnawrathaPagan is believed to have been founded in the years  AD by the Myanmar who had already established themselves as rice growers in the region around Kyauksai near MandalayAnawratha began to unite the region by subjugating one chieftain after another and was successful in giving the Myanmar a sense of belonging to a larger community a nationThe crucial event in the history of Myanmar is not so much the founding of the city of Pagan and the building of its walls and moat but more Pagans acceptance of Theravada Buddhism in the eleventh centuryThe religion was brought to the Myanmar by a Mon bhikkhu named Shin ArahanThe religion prevailing among the Myanmar before and during the early reign of Anawratha was some form of Mahayana Buddhism which had probably found its way into the region from the Pala kingdom in BengalThis is apparent from bronze statues depicting Bodhisattas and especially the Lokanatha a Bodhisatta believed in Bengal to reign in the period between the demise of the Buddha Gotama and the advent of the Buddha MetteyyaAnawratha continued to cast terracotta votive tablets with the image of Lokanatha even after he embraced the Theravada doctrineIn India Buddhism had split into numerous schools some of which differed fundamentally from the teachings of Pali Buddhism which is also called Theravada BuddhismThe Ari the monks or priests of this Mahayana Buddhist form of worship are described in later chronicles of Myanmar as the most shameless bogus ascetics imaginableThey are said to have sold absolution from sin and to have oppressed the people in various ways with their tyrannyTheir tantric Buddhism included as an important element the worship of Nagas which was probably an ancient indigenous traditionAt this time the beginning of the eleventh century the Buddhist religion among the Mon in Suvannabhumi was on the decline as people were disturbed by robbers and raiders by plagues and by adversaries of the religionThese most probably came from the Hindu Khmer kingdom in Cambodia and the north of ThailandThe Khmer were endeavoring to add Thaton and the other Mon kingdoms of the south to their expanding empireShin Arahan must have feared that bhikkhus would not be able to continue to maintain their religious practice and the study of the scriptures under these circumstancesHe went therefore upcountry where a new strong people were developing prosperous and secure from enemiesIt is interesting to note that in this same period Buddhism was under attack in other places as wellThe Colas a Hindu dynasty strongly opposed to Buddhism arose in southern India one of the last strongholds of Theravada BuddhismThey were able to expand their rule to include most of Sri Lanka between andThe great Mon city Dvaravati a Theravada center in southern Thailand fell to the Khmer the masters of the whole of Thailand who were Shaivaite HindusIn the north of India Muslim armies were trying to destroy what little was left of Buddhism thereIn this perilous period writes Professor Luce Buddhism was saved only by such valiant fighters as Vijayabahu in Sri Lanka and AnawrathaShin Arahan arrived in the vicinity of Pagan and was discovered in his forest dwelling by a hunterThe hunter who had never before seen such a strange creature with a shaven head and a yellow robe thought he was some kind of spirit and took him to the king AnawrathaShin Arahan naturally sat down on the throne as it was the highest seat and the king thought This man is peaceful in this man there is the essential thingHe is sitting down on the best seat surely he must be the best being The king asked the visitor to tell him where he came from and was told that he came from the place where the Order lived and that the Buddha was his teacherThen Shin Arahan gave the king the teaching on mindfulness teaching him the same doctrine Nigrodha had given Emperor Asoka when he was convertedShin Arahan then told the monarch that the Buddha had passed into Parinibbana but that his teaching the Dhamma enshrined in the Tipitaka and the twofold Sangha consisting of those who possessed absolute knowledge and those who possessed conventional knowledge remainedThe king must have felt that he had found what had been missing in his life and a genuine alternative to the superficial teachings of the Ari monksHe built a monastery for Shin Arahan and according to some sources stopped all worship of the Ari monksTradition has it that he had them dressed in white and even forced them to serve as soldiers in his armyThe Ari tradition continued for a long time however and its condemnation is a feature of much later times and not as far as contemporary evidence shows of the Pagan eraThe Sasanavamsa gives an alternate version of Anawrathas conversion according to which Shin Arahan had originally come from Sri Lanka to study the Dhamma in Dvaravati and Thaton and was on his way to Sri Ksetra in search of a text when he was taken to Anawratha by a hunterThe king asked him Who are you  O King I am a disciple of Gotama  Of what kind are the Three Jewels  O King the Buddha should be regarded as Mahosadha the wise his doctrine as Ummagga his order as the Videhan armyThis version is interesting in that Anawratha is portrayed as being a Buddhist with knowledge of Jataka stories such as the Mahosadha Jataka referred to above even before meeting Shin ArahanThis assumption that he was no stranger to Buddhism is supported by the fact that earlier kings had been followers of Buddhism in varying degreesCaw Rahan who died about years before Anawrathas accession is said to have built a Sima and five Pagodas and Kyaung Pyu Min built the white monastery outside PaganKyaung Pyu Min is believed to have been Anawrathas fatherThrough Shin Arahan Anawratha had now found the religion he had been yearning for and he decided to set out and procure the scriptures and holy relics of this religionFor he wished his kingdom to be secured on the original teachings of the BuddhaHe tried to find the scriptures and relics of his new religion in different quartersIn his enthusiasm he did not limit his quest to Thaton but also searched among the Khmer in Angkor and in Tali the capital of the Nanchao a kingdom in modern day Yunnan in China where a tooth of the Buddha was enshrinedBut everywhere he was refusedHe then went to Thaton where his teacher Shin Arahan had come from to request a copy of the scripturesAccording to the tradition of Myanmar Anawrathas request was refused and unable to endure another refusal he set out with his army in the year to conquer Thaton and acquire the Tipitaka by forceBefore conquering Thaton however he had to subjugate Sri Ksetra the Pyu capitalFrom there he took the relics enshrined in King Dwattabaungs Bawbawgyi Pagoda to PaganSome think that the aim of his campaign was mainly to add the prosperous Indian colonies of Lower Myanmar to his possessions while others think he may have actually been called to Thaton to defend it against the marauding KhmerWhatever the immediate cause of his campaign in the lower country we know for certain that he returned with the king of Thaton and his court with Mon artists and scholars and above all with Thatons bhikkhus and their holy books the TipitakaSuvannabhumi and its Mon population were now in the hands of the Myanmar and the Mon culture and religion were accepted and assimilated in the emergent Pagan with fervorInitially the fervor must have been restricted to the king and possibly his immediate entourage yet even they continued to propitiate their traditional gods for worldly gain as the new religion was considered a higher practiceTheravada Buddhism does not provide much in the way of rites and rituals but a royal court cannot do without themSo the traditional propitiation of the Nagas continued to be used for court ceremonials and remained part of the popular religion while the bhikkhus were accorded the greatest respect and their master the Buddha Gotama was honored with the erection of pagodas and shrinesThere were contacts between the new kings of Myanmar and Sri Lanka that are recorded not only in the chronicles of the two countries but also in stone inscriptions in South IndiaAs the Hindu Colas had ruled Sri Lanka for more than half a century Buddhism had been weakened and King Vijayabahu who had driven out the Vaishnavite Colas wanted to reestablish his religionSo in he requested King Anawratha of Myanmar who had assisted him financially in his war against the Colas to send bhikkhus to reintroduce the pure ordination into his countryIt is interesting to note that the Culavamsa refers to Anawratha as the king of Ramanna which was Lower Myanmar also called SuvannabhumiHe was approached as the conqueror and master of Thaton a respected Theravada center rather than as the king of Pagan a new and unknown countryThe bhikkhus who traveled to Sri Lanka brought the Sinhalese Tipitaka back with them and established a link between the two countries which was to last for centuriesAnawratha is mentioned in the Myanmar Mon Khmer Thai and Sinhalese chronicles as a great champion of Buddhism because he developed Pagan into a major regional power and laid the foundation for its gloryHe did not however build many of the temples for which Pagan is now so famous as the great age of temple building started only after his reignIt is important to realize that his interest was not restricted only to PaganHe built pagodas wherever his campaigns took him and adorned them with illustrations from the Jatakas and the life of the BuddhaSome maintain that he used only Jatakas as themes for the adornment of his religious buildings because that was all he possessed of the TipitakaSuch a conclusion is negative and quite superficialAfter all during Asokas time Jatakas and scenes from the life of the Buddha were used for illustrations in Bharut and Sanchi the great stupas near BombayWe cannot therefore deduce that the builders of Bharut and Sanchi were acquainted only with the JatakasThese edifying stories which teach the fundamentals of Buddhism so skillfully are singularly suited to educate an illiterate people beset by superstitions through the vivid visual means of the stone reliefs depicting these storiesIt is almost unthinkable that the Mon Sangha who taught Anawratha had no knowledge of at least all of the VinayaOtherwise they would not have been able to reestablish a valid ordination of bhikkhus in Sri LankaAnawratha left behind innumerable clay tablets adorned with images of the Buddha the kings name and some Pali and Sanskrit versesA typical aspiration on these tablets was By me King Anawratha this mould of Sugata has been madeThrough this may I obtain the path to Nibbana when Metteyya is awakened Anawratha aspired to become a disciple of the Buddha Metteyya unlike many later kings of Myanmar who aspired to BuddhahoodIs this an indication that this warrior had remained a modest man in spite of his empire buildingAnawratha was succeeded by a number of kings of varying significance to Buddhism in MyanmarHis successors inherited a relatively stable and prosperous kingdom and consequently were able to embark on the huge temple building projects for which their reigns are still rememberedThis is the time when kings such as Kyanzitta and others built pagodas libraries monasteries and ordination hallsThese kings must have possessed coffers full of riches collected from their extensive kingdom which they lavished on the religion of the BuddhaTheir palaces were probably built of wood as was the last palace of the Myanmar dynastyThough the palaces must have reflected the wealth and power of the rulers the more durable brick was not deemed necessary for such worldly buildingsThis is similar to views still found in rural areas of Myanmar todayThe only structure adorned to any extent in a village is the monastery and the buildings attached to it such as the rest houseThe villagers are very modest with regard to their private houses and even consider it improper to decorate themTheir monastery however is given every decoration affordableKyanzitta who had been Anawrathas commanderinchief and had succeeded Anawrathas son to the throne consolidated Theravada Buddhisms predominance in PaganIn his reign such important shrines as the Shwezigon Pagoda the Nanda Nagayon and Myinkaba Kubyaukgyi temples were builtWith the three latter temples Kyanzitta introduced a new style of religious buildingThe traditional stupa or dagoba found in India and Sri Lanka is a solid mound in which relics or other holy objects are enshrinedThe area of worship is situated around them and is usually marked by ornate stone railingsIn the new style of building however the solid mound had been hollowed out and could be enteredThe central shrine was surrounded by halls which housed stone reliefs depicting scenes from the Buddhas life and Jataka storiesKyanzittas aim was the conversion of his people to the new faithWhereas Anawratha had been busy expanding his empire and bringing relics and the holy scriptures to Pagan Kyanzittas mission was to consolidate this enterpriseEnormous religious structures such as the Nanda Temple attracted the populace and the interiors of the temples allowed the bhikkhus to instruct the inquisitive in the kings faithProfessor Luce writesKyanzittas efforts for the advancement of Buddhism were not limited to his own countryFor in one of his many inscriptions he also mentions that he sent craftsmen to Bodhgaya to repair the Mahabodhi temple which had been destroyed by a foreign kingThe upkeep of the Mahabodhi temple became a tradition with the kings of Myanmar who continued to send missions to Bodhgaya to repair the temple and also to donate temple slaves and land to the holiest shrine of BuddhismKyanzitta also initiated an extensive review and purification of the Tipitaka by the bhikkhusThis was the first occasion in Myanmars history when the task of a Buddhist Sangayana or Synod comparing the Sinhalese and Suvannabhumis Tipitaka was undertakenIt is possible and even probable that this huge editing work was carried out along with visiting Sinhalese bhikkhusBy nature of Myanmars geographical position external influences swept in predominantly from northern India and therefore tantric Buddhism dominant especially in Bengal remained strongHowever Kyanzitta succeeded in firmly establishing the Pali Tipitaka by asking the bhikkhus to compare the ancient Mon Tipitaka with the texts obtained from the Mahavihara in Sri LankaIn this way he also made it clear that confirmation of orthodoxy was to be sought in Sri Lanka and not in any other Buddhist countryThough Mahayana practices were tolerated in his reign they were not officially regarded as the pure religionIt is characteristic of Pagan that these two branches of Buddhism coexisted  the religion of the Theras which was accepted as the highest religion  and the tantric practices which included the worship of spirits or nats and gave more immediate satisfactionPagodas are often adorned with figures of all types of deities but the deities are normally shown in an attitude of reverence towards the pagoda a symbol of the BuddhaThe ancient gods were not banished but had to submit to the peerless BuddhaTradition attributes to King Anawratha the observation Men will not come for the sake of the new faithLet them come for their old gods and gradually they will be won overAn approach such as this whether it was Anawrathas or Kyanzittas would suggest that the practice of the old religion of the Ari monks was allowed to continue and that the conversion of the country was gentle and peaceful as befits the religion of the BuddhaAlthough later Myanmar chronicles refer to the Ari monks as a debased group of charlatans who were totally rooted out by Anawratha this is far from the truthA powerful movement of priests who incorporated magic practices in their teachings continued to exist throughout the Pagan period and though they may have respected the basic rules of the Vinaya and donned the yellow robe their support was rooted in the old animistic beliefs of the MyanmarIt should not be forgotten that the Myanmar first started to settle in the area of Kyauksai in the sixth century AD and that the man in the field was in no way ready for such highly developed a religion as Theravada BuddhismThe transition had to be gradual and the process that started remains still incomplete in the minds of many people especially in the more remote areas of the hill countryThe example of Kyanzittas son Rajakumar however shows how even in those early days the teachings of the Buddha were understood and practiced not only by the bhikkhus but also by lay people and members of the royal courtRajakumars conduct is proof of his fathers ability to establish men in the Dhamma and survives as a monument just as the Ananda temple doesRajakumar was Kyanzittas only son and his rightful heirDue to political misadventures Kyanzitta was separated from his wife and therefore not aware of the birth of his son for seven yearsWhen his daughter gave birth to his grandson he anointed him as future king immediately after his birthRajakumar grew up in the shadow of his nephew the crown prince but neither during his fathers reign nor after his death did he ever try to usurp the throne through intrigue or by forceHe was a minister zealous in the affairs of state prudent and wiseHe was also a scholar of the Tipitaka and instrumental in its review vigorously supporting his father in his objective to establish BuddhismBut he is best known for his devotion to his father in his last years when his health was failingIn order to restore the kings health he built five pagodas which to this day are called MinoChanda The Welfare of the Old King When the king was on his deathbedRajakumars nephew was King Alaungsithu who continued the tradition of his dynasty of glorifying the Buddhas religion by building a vast temple the Sabbannu Temple probably the largest monument in PaganDuring his many travels and campaigns he built pagodas and temples throughout MyanmarThe faith that Shin Arahan had inspired in Anawratha and his successors continued to inspire AlaungsithuShin Arahan who had seen kings come and go and the flowering of the religion he brought to Pagan is believed to have died during the reign of King Alaungsithu in aboutAfter the death of Alaungsithu Pagan was thrown into turmoil by violent struggles for the throneSeveral kings reigned for short periods and spent most of their time and resources in power strugglesOne even succeeded in alienating the great king of Sri Lanka Parakramabahu by mistreating his emissaries and breaking the agreements between the two countriesEventually Parakramabahu invaded Myanmar devastating towns and villages and killing the kingThe new king Narapati blessed the country with a period of peace and prosperityThis conducive atmosphere was to allow outstanding scholarship and learning to arise in PaganKyawswa was a king under whom scholarship was encouraged even more undoubtedly because the king himself spent most of his time in scholarly pursuits including memorizing passages of the TipitakaHe had relinquished most of his worldly duties to his son in order to dedicate more time to the study of the scripturesTwo grammatical works the Saddabindu and the Paramatthabindu are ascribed to himIt would appear that his palace was a place of great culture and learning as his ministers and his daughter are credited with scholarly works as wellDuring the twelfth century a sect of forest dwellers also thrivedThey were called arannaka in Pali and were identical with the previously mentioned Ari of the later chroniclers of MyanmarThis was a monastic movement that only used the yellow robes and the respect due to them in order to follow their own ideasThey indulged in business transactions and owned vast stretches of landThey gave feasts and indulged in the consumption of liquor and though they pretended to be practicing the teachings of the Buddha their practices were probably of a tantric natureIt would appear that they had a considerable amount of influence at the royal court and one of the main exponents of the movement was even given the title of royal teacherSuperstition and magic were gaining dominance once again and Anawrathas and Kyanzittas empire was slowly sliding into decadenceThe last king of Pagan Narathihapate whom the Myanmar know by the name Tayoupyemin repeatedly refused to pay symbolic tribute to the Mongol emperors in Peking who in had conquered neighbouring YunnanHe even went so far as to execute ambassadors of the Chinese emperor and their retinue for their lack of deference to the kingHe became so bold and blinded by ignorance that he attacked a vassal state of the MongolsThe emperor in Peking was finally forced to send a punitive expedition which defeated the Pagan army north of PaganThe news of this defeat caused the king and his court to flee to PatheinAs the imperial court in Peking was not interested in adding Pagan to its possessions the Yunnan expedition did not remain in the environsWhen the king was later murdered and the whole empire fell into disarray the Yunnani generals returned looting PaganThe territories were divided amongst Shan chiefs who paid tribute to the MongolsGEHarvey honors the kings of Pagan with the following wordsThe contact with Sri Lanka was very important for the growth of the religion in PaganAs was shown previously it started with the friendship of Anawratha and Vijayabahu both of whom fought for Buddhism Anawratha to establish a new kingdom Vijayabahu to wrench an old one from the clutches of the Hindu invadersThey supported each other in their struggles and then together reestablished the Theravada doctrine in their respective countries Anawratha sending bhikkhus to Sri Lanka to revive the Sangha while Vijayabahu reciprocated by sending the sacred textsThe continued contact between the two countries was beneficial to both many a reform movement purifying the religion in one country spread to the other as wellBhikkhus visiting from one country were led to look at their own traditions critically and to reappraise their practice of the Dhamma as preserved in the Pali textsAfter the fall of the main Buddhist centers in southern India centers which had been the main allies of the Mon Theravadins in the south Sri Lanka was the only ally in the struggle for the survival of the Theravada traditionLeading bhikkhus of Pagan undertook the long and difficult journey to Sri Lanka in order to visit the holy temples and study the scriptures as they had been preserved by the Sinhalese SanghaShin Arahans successor as the kings teacher left the royal court for Sri Lanka returning to Pagan only to dieHe was succeeded by a Mon bhikkhu Uttarajiva who led a pilgrimage to Sri Lanka inThis was to cause the first upheaval in the Sangha of PaganUttarajiva traveled to Sri Lanka accompanied by Chapada a novice who remained behind on the island in order to study the scriptures in the Mahavihara the orthodox monastery of Sri Lanka and the guardian of the Theravada traditionAfter ten years he returned to Pagan accompanied by four elders who had studied with himThe Kalyani inscription written about three hundred years later relates that Chapada considered the tradition of the Myanmar bhikkhus impureHe had consequently taken four bhikkhus with him because he needed a chapter of at least five theras in order to ordain new bhikkhusIt is possible that the Myanmar bhikkhus who seemed to have formed a group separate from the Mon bhikkhus had paid more attention to their traditional worship than was beneficial for their practice of the DhammaIt is also possible that there was an element of nationalist rivalry between the Mon bhikkhus and the Myanmar bhikkhusAs he showed a penchant for the reform movement the Myanmar king Narapati seems to have accepted the superiority of the Mon bhikkhus though he did not neglect the other bhikkhusChapada and his companions refused to accept the ordination of the Myanmar bhikkhus as legitimate in accordance with VinayaThey established their own ordination following which the Myanmar bhikkhus sent a delegation to Sri Lanka to receive the Mahavihara ordination for themselvesAfter Chapadas death the reform movement soon split into two factions and eventually each of the four remaining bhikkhus went his own way one of them leaving the order altogetherThus in the town of Arimaddana there were four schools Because the first of these to come was the school of the Elder Arahan from Sudhamma it was called the first school while the others because they came later were called the later schoolsIt is surprising how quickly a relatively simple people absorbed the great civilization that arrived in their midst so suddenlyEven before the conquest of Thaton Pagan possessed some ornate religious buildings which is indicative of the presence of artists and craftsmenIt is quite likely however that these were Indians from Bengal and the neighbouring statesThe type of Buddhism that had come to Pagan from India was an esoteric religion as some old legends indicateIt was the jealously guarded domain of a group of priests who made no attempt to instruct the people but were happy if their superiority remained unquestioned by a superstitious populaceThe advent of Theravada Buddhism with its openness and its aim to spread understanding must have been quite revolutionary in Pagan and obviously the people were eager to acquire the knowledge offered to them by the bhikkhusMabel Bode says in her Pali Literature of BurmaThe principal works of the Pagan period still extant are Pali grammarsThe most famous of these is the Saddaniti which Aggavamsa completed inUttarajiva gave a copy of this work to the bhikkhus of the Mahavihara in Sri Lanka and it was received with enthusiastic admiration and declared superior to any work of the kind written by Sinhalese scholars The Saddaniti is still used to teach grammar in the monasteries in Myanmar and has been printed many timesBLaw regards it as one of the three principal Pali grammars along with the grammars by Kaccayana and MoggallanaKRNorman says The greatest of extant Pali grammars is the Saddaniti written by Aggavamsa from Arimaddana in Burma Aggavamsa was also known as the teacher of King Narapatisithu and was given the title AggapanditaUnfortunately no other works by this author are known todayThe second famous author of Pagan was Saddhammajotipala who has been previously mentioned under his clan name of ChapadaHe was a disciple of Uttarajiva and is credited with a great number of works but in the case of some it is doubtful whether he actually composed them himself or merely introduced them from Sri LankaHis works deal not only with grammar but also with questions of monastic discipline and the Abhidhamma which in later centuries was to become a favorite subject of Myanmar scholarsHis work on Kaccayanas grammar the Suttaniddesa formed the foundation of his fameHowever his specialty would appear to have been the study of Abhidhamma as no less than four noted works of his on the subject attained fame Samkhepavannana Namacaradipani Matikatthadipani and PatthanagananayaAccording to the Pitakathamain a history of Buddhism in Myanmar he also devoted a commentary to the Visuddhimagga by Buddhaghosa called the VisuddhimaggaganthiThere are no written records that refer to meditation being practiced in Myanmar before this centuryHowever his interest in the Visuddhimagga is indicative of an interest in meditation if only in the theory rather than in the practiceAnother scholar of Pagan Vimalabuddhi also wrote a commentary concerning Abhidhamma the Abhidhammatthasangahatika in addition to another important grammatical work the Nyasa a commentary on Kaccayanas grammarOther grammatical works of some importance were written but none acquired the standing of Aggavamsas SaddanitiHowever a rather peculiar work worth mentioning is the Ekakkharakosa by SaddhammakittiIt is a work on Pali lexicography enumerating words of one letterAfter Narathihapate had fled Pagan in fear of the Mongol army he was never able to reestablish his authority even though the Mongols supported the Pagan dynastyThe Mongol court in Peking preferred a united neighbouring country under a single ruler but in spite of its efforts Myanmar was divided into several principalities mainly under Shan tribal leadersThese selfstyled princelings paid tribute to the Chinese Mongol court and were nominally its subjectsThe Shan at this time still nomadic tribes in the north broke into an already destabilized Myanmar like a tidal waveThey penetrated the entire region as far as the Mon country and established themselves as rulers in many towns and citiesThe intrigues fratricidal wars and murders that make up the history of their courts are innumerableA division of the country into Upper and Lower Myanmar is somewhat arbitrary as after the fall of Pagan the two regions were composed of many competing principalitiesHowever there were the two principle kingdoms of Ava in Upper Myanmar and Pago in Lower MyanmarHostilities between these two prevailed as well as with the neighbouring smaller states including the Shan fiefs of Chiang Mai and Ayutthaya in ThailandIntrigues within and between courts were rifeSometimes these claimed victims only within the circle of the powerful and mighty and sometimes whole towns were looted and destroyed and their population massacred or carried off into slaveryBut in spite of politically unsettled conditions the Sangha survived because the new rulers initially somewhat barbaric soon accepted the religion of their subjectsJust as the Myanmar had adopted the religion and culture of the more refined Mon so the Shan submitted to the sophisticated civilization of the peoples they subjugatedThe Shan initially established their capital at Pinya in Upper Myanmar to the north of Pagan and transferred it to Ava inAva was to remain the capital of Upper Myanmar until the eighteenth centuryThe Sasanavamsa praises Thihathu the youngest of three Shan brothers who wrested power from the Pagan dynasty in Upper Myanmar as a Buddhist king who built monasteries and pagodasHe had a bhikkhu as his teacher and supported thousands of bhikkhus in his capital Pinya and later AvaHowever Pagan remained the cultural and religious capital of the region for the whole of the fourteenth centuryScholarly works were composed in its monasteries throughout this period whereas no such works are known to have been written in the new centers of powerThe works of this period of scholarship were mostly concerned with Pali grammarTwo generations later a descendant of Thihathu secured himself a place in religious history as a great patron of scholarshipAs in the courts of some previous kings his court was also devoted to scholarly learning and not only bhikkhus but also the palace officials produced treatises on religious subjects and the Pali languageAlthough the political situation remained unsettled in Upper Myanmar throughout the fifteenth century in the main this affected only those in power and their usurpersConsequently the Sangha appears to have flourished while the traditional devotion to the support of the Sangha through gifts of the four requisites remained unchangedThe royal court followed by the leading families made great donations of monasteries land and revenue to the bhikkhusIn approximately two Mahatheras from Sri Lanka settled in AvaHere they joined a group of famous scholars of whom Ariyavamsa was the most outstandingThe Sasanavamsa tells us of his great wisdom and humility in an anecdoteThe elder Ariyavamsa had studied the books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka but felt he had not gained real understandingEventually he came to a bhikkhu in Sagaing who kept his mouth always filled with water in order not to have to engage in meaningless chatterAriyavamsa did not talk to the Elder Waterbearer as this bhikkhu was known in the Myanmar language but simply performed the duties of a disciple to his teacher for two daysOn the third day the Venerable Waterbearer spat out the water and asked Ariyavamsa why he was serving himWhen Ariyavamsa told him that he wanted to learn from him the Venerable Waterbearer taught him the Abhidhammatthavibhavanitika a subcommentary on the AbhidhammatthasangahaAfter two days Ariyavamsa grasped the meaning and his teacher asked him to write a commentary on this book in order to help others to gain understandingDuring the composition of his first work Ariyavamsa submitted his writings to the assembled bhikkhus on every Uposatha day reading out what he had composed and asking his brethren to correct any mistakes they foundOn one occasion a visiting bhikkhu twice made a sound of disapproval during the readingAriyavamsa carefully noted the passages where the sound of disapproval had occurredOn reflecting on them in the evening he found one error of grammar where he had used the wrong gender and also a repetition an error of styleHe approached the bhikkhu who had made the sounds during the reading and out of gratitude for the correction gave him his own outer robeAriyavamsa composed several works in Pali works on the Abhidhamma on grammatical subjects and a study of the JatakasBut his very important contribution to Buddhism in Myanmar was the fact that all his writing was in the Myanmar vernacularHe was probably the first bhikkhu to write treatises on religious subjects in the local idiom thus making the religion accessible to a greater number of peopleThe work by Ariyavamsa still known today is a commentary on the anutika of the AbhidhammaTowards the end of the fifteenth century a bhikkhu by the name of Silavamsa composed several epic poems in PaliThey were of course of a religious nature dealing with subjects such as the life of the Buddha or Jataka storiesThis genre was later very popular in the Myanmar language and there are many poems relating Jataka stories which were sung by bards throughout the country until recentlyIn the Sasanavamsa however Pannasami disapproves of bhikkhus writing or reciting poetry as he considers it to be in breach of the Vinaya rulesHe says that because of this Silavamsas name was excluded from the Theraparampara a listing of eminent bhikkhus of Myanmar by ancient chroniclersThe Mon civilization in Lower Myanmar flourished after Pagans importance waned once again reliving the era of glory that it had experienced prior to Anawrathas conquestWareru the Shan ruler who had established himself in Martaban in was soon converted to BuddhismHe was a Shan peddler who had astutely wrested power from a son of the last king of Pagan a son who had revolted against his father and founded an independent kingdomUnder Warerus rule scholarship in the Mon monasteries flourished and a code of law was compiled which still forms the foundation of the legal literature of MyanmarThe Mon bhikkhus based this code on ancient Hindu codes of law which had found their way into Mon tradition through Indian colonisers and merchantsAt the beginning of the fourteenth century two respected Mon theras named Buddhavamsa and Mahanaga revived the tradition of their countryman Chapada in making a pilgrimage to Sri LankaThere they accepted new ordination in the Mahavihara monastery the guardian of Sinhalese orthodoxyThe bhikkhus of the Mahavihara asked those ordained in other countries to revert to the laystate before being reordained as novices and full bhikkhus as it was considered of the utmost importance that the ordination be handed down in an unbroken tradition from the time of the BuddhaThis was especially significant in Myanmar where there were some reservations about the continuity of the traditionBy disrobing a bhikkhu forgoes the seniority he has acquired through the years spent in robes and in this case he also states that he considers his former ordination invalidOne can imagine that such a step is not taken lightly but only after careful considerationKing Dhammazedi takes a special place in the history of the religion in MyanmarHe unified the Sangha in the Mon country and purified the order of the bhikkhusHe recorded his great service to the country in the Kalyani inscription which will be quoted belowDhammazedi was a bhikkhu of Mon origin who taught one of the queens at the royal palace in AvaThis lady Shin Sawbu was the daughter of the king of PagoShe had been queen to several unfortunate kings of Upper Mynamar and had beeen conveyed into the hands of the subsequent kings along with the throneShe had become disenchanted with the life of a queen and desired to return to her native landDhammazedi and a fellow Mon bhikkhu helped her to escape and brought her back to PagoEventually she became queen of Pago but after reigning only a few years she wished to retire and do works of meritShe found that the only people worthy of the throne of Pago were her teachers the two bhikkhusShe let fate decide which would be the future king by concealing miniature imitations of the regalia in one of the two bowls in which she offered them their daily alms foodShe handed the throne over to Dhammazedi who had received the fateful bowl and spent the rest of her life at Dagon building the terrace around the Shwedagon Pagoda and gilding the sacred moundThe Shwedagon became what it is today chiefly thanks to Shin Sawbus munificenceDhammazedi assumed government in Pago after leaving the Order of the bhikkhusHe moved the capital closer to the Swemawdaw Pagoda and built several pagodas and shrinesHis name is also connected with a collection of wise judgments and the translation of Warerus Code of Law into the vernacularIn Dhammazedi sent a mission to Bodhgaya to repair the temple and make plans and drawings of itDhammazedi had received his education in monasteries of Ava which adhered to the Sihala SanghaThe Sihala Sangha was the faction of the Sangha of Myanmar that accepted only the Mahavihara of Sri Lanka as the ultimate authority in religious questionsKing Dhammazedi knew from direct experience the state of the Sangha in Lower Myanmar and was determined to improve itHaving lived as a bhikkhu for so many years he was also singularly qualified to change the Sangha for the betterHe chose twentytwo senior bhikkhus to lead the reform movement and informed themAt the beginning of the chosen bhikkhus with their twentytwo disciples embarked on the journey to Sri LankaThey sailed in two ships one taking about two months while the other needed six full months to arrive on the shore of the Buddhist islandThey received the upasampada ordination at the Mahavihara from th to th JulyThe return journey of the fortyfour Mon bhikkhus was not so smooth howeverOne group arrived home in August while the other group took three years to return to Pago and ten of the bhikkhus died en routeFollowing their return Dhammazedi had a pure ordination hall consecrated and made the following proclamationIn order to confer the bhikkhu ordination outside the middle country a chapter of five bhikkhus is needed one of whom must be qualified to serve as preceptor and another as teacherThe latter two must have spent at least ten years in robes as fully ordained bhikkhusSo if Dhammazedi wanted to have local bhikkhus ordained in the new ordination it was necessary to find two senior bhikkhusSince those returning from Sri Lanka had been ordained for a period of only three years they could not act as preceptor or teacherLocal bhikkhus who had not received the ordination of the Mahavihara in Sri Lanka were unacceptable as otherwise the ordination would again have been invalidated by one who was not of pure descentFortunately the two theras who had undertaken a pilgrimage to Sri Lanka at the beginning of the century and had received the Sinhalese ordination at that time were still aliveAs a result one was able to act as preceptor and the other as teacher of the newly ordained bhikkhusThe stage was now set for the reformation and unification of the Mon Order of bhikkhus and soon the reordination of almost the entire Order of bhikkhus beganThe Kalyani inscription records the number of ordinations in hundreds of ordination halls newly constructed for the purposeIt is interesting to note how forcefully the king reformed the Order through royal decrees that would hardly be tolerated todayHe declared that all bhikkhus who were for example practicing medicine or other arts and crafts or who even slightly infringed on the Vinaya rules would be expelledThe king as a layman however did not have the power to defrock a bhikkhu who had not broken one of the four Parajika rulesDhammazedi circumvented this by threatening to punish with royal penalties the mother father relatives and lay supporters of bhikkhus whose behavior was not in accordance with the rules of the VinayaIt goes without saying that a king who could allow himself to take such drastic measures in regard to the Sangha must have had the support of a broad section of the Order and also the peopleAfter years spent in robes he was keenly aware of the problems of monastic life and because of this even senior bhikkhus respected and accepted his councilWe can assume that all his actions to reform the Order were firstly discussed with his bhikkhu teachers and then implemented with their blessingsThere being no such thing as a Buddhist Church with a central authority the Sangha has little possibility to regulate itselfOnly the committed support of a worldly power can protect the Order of bhikkhus from those who take advantage of the respect that is given to the yellow robeDhammazedis support for the religion was so great that his fame spread well beyond the borders of Myanmar and bhikkhus from neighbouring countries such as Thailand came to his realm to receive ordination thereThough the reform movement did not spread to Upper Myanmar and cause the same mass ordinations there it did not remain without influence in the kingdom of Ava and other principalities and many bhikkhus came to the Mon bhikkhus to receive the Kalyani ordinationThe beginning of the sixteenth century was one of the most difficult periods for Buddhism in Upper MyanmarWhile the religious fervor of Dhammazedi still lived on in the kingdom of Pago in Ava Shan rulers were endeavoring to bring about the destruction of the SanghaA Shan king named Thohanbwa was particularly wellknown for his barbarityHe destroyed pagodas and monasteries and robbed their treasuresAlthough he was a king he was uneducated and ignorantHence fearing the influence of the bhikkhus and suspicious of their moves he brought about the massacre of thousandsUnder these terror regimes of the Shan rulers the Myanmar did not feel safeMany including learned bhikkhus fled to Toungoo the stronghold of the Myanmar race in the southDespite the anarchy prevailing some respected treatises on Pali grammar were written in Upper Myanmar in these yearsBetter times however lay ahead for Buddhism in the Golden LandTwo successive kings of Myanmar origin from Toungoo would unite the country and fulfill the duties of Buddhist kingsThe wars fought by these two kings King Tabinshwehti and King Bayinnaung were long in duration and exceedingly cruelThey succeeded in gaining control of the Mon kingdom in Lower Myanmar and the kingdom of AvaThey conquered all of what is today Myanmar including the Shan states as far east as Chiang Mai and made incursions into lower Thailand and Yunnan where some kings paid tribute to the Myanmar courtBayinnaung deferred to the Mon as far as culture and religion were concerned and dressed in Mon styleUnder his royal patronage the Mon Sangha produced scholarly works on grammar and the Abhidhamma and also helped with the collection and standardisation of a code of law based on the old Mon code compiled during Warerus reignBayinnaung not only unified the country politically but also made Buddhist principles the standard for his entire dominionHe forbade the sacrificial slaughter of animals a custom still practiced by the Shan chiefs the worshippers of certain spirits and the followers of some other religionsHe built pagodas and monasteries in all the newly conquered lands and installed learned bhikkhus in order to convert the often uncivilized inhabitants to gentler waysThe main religious building of his reign is the Mahazedi Pagoda a majestic monument to the Buddha in the capital PagoHe also crowned the main pagodas in Myanmar with the jewels of his own crown a custom practiced by many rulers of the countryHe continued in the tradition of Dhammazedi in supporting the Sihala Sangha and in sponsoring the ordination of many bhikkhus in the Kalyani Ordination Hall near PagoIt is said that he built as many monasteries as there were years in his lifeIt remains a mystery how a king who had such deep devotion to the religion of the Buddha and who was so generous towards it could spend his life fighting campaign after campaign to expand his realmHe caused bloodshed and suffering in the conquered regions and at home people starved because farmers were drafted into the armyHowever this may be Bayinnaung seems to have been able to reconcile fighting expansionist wars with being a pious BuddhistAfter King Bayinnaung Pago rapidly lost its significanceBayinnaungs son persecuted the Mon and consequently reignited racial tensions that would plague Myanmar for centuriesLater Pago was to fall into the hands of a Portuguese adventurer who pillaged the pagodas and monasteriesEventually the whole of Lower Myanmar already depopulated by the incessant campaigns of Bayinnaung and his successors was pillaged by all the surrounding kings and princelingsThe country was devastated and people starvedThe Sasanavamsa records one major problem of the Vinaya during the sixteenth centuryAt the beginning of the century the bhikkhus of Toungoo were divided over whether or not bhikkhus could partake of the juice of the toddy palm which was generally used to prepare fermented drinkThe dispute was settled by a respected thera who decided that toddy juice was permissible only if it was freshly harvestedWhat motivated the royal court probably remained largely a mystery to the ordinary citizens except when they were pressed into service in the kings armyThere was little sense of collective responsibility as it is cultivated in todays democraciesEveryone looked after himself and his immediate circle and governments were sometimes more of a scourge than a protectionKings did not always provide a visible administration beyond appointing governors at whose mercy local people wereThese governors often endeavored to establish independence as soon as they perceived inherent weaknesses in their mastersMany accumulated great wealth for themselvesThere was however one element in the policy of rulers which with a few exceptions remained fairly stable throughout Myanmar historyMost kings supported Buddhism and the Sangha provided a framework of continuity as no other entity couldRay writesThe best insurance of a peaceful life in Myanmar was to become a bhikkhu as they were not drafted into armies or enslaved by conquerors and as long as the lay people had food to eat they were also fedThe bhikkhus not only provided a link between the people and those in power they often played a role in the affairs of stateThis is illustrated by an event which occurred in the middle of the seventeenth century and is related by the SasanavamsaThe king Ukkamsika popularly known as King Thalun was a devoted Buddhist and thanks to him learning flourished in MyanmarThe kings son however tried to dethrone his father and Thalun taken by surprise had to flee accompanied only by two companionsComing upon a river the only vessel in sight was the boat of a samaneraThe samanera agreed to take them onboard as passengers and they ended up in the samaneras monastery where they revealed their true identities and asked for protection from their persecutorsThey were referred to another monastery where lived a bhikkhu wise in worldly affairsFollowing his advice the bhikkhus formed a living wall around the monastery and as no Buddhist will attack a man in robes the rebels who had come to kill the king had to withdrawAnother example of the beneficial influence of the Sangha is their appeal for clemency to King BayinnaungBhikkhus often tried to stay executions in accordance with the principles of metta and karuna and sometimes their efforts achieved successDuring one of Bayinnaungs Thai campaigns the peasantry around Pago revolted and razed the royal city to the groundBayinnaung after hurrying back from Ayutthaya captured several thousand rebels and was ready to burn them aliveIt was the custom then to burn deserters from the army alive and obviously rebellion was considered to be a crime of similar gravityThe bhikkhus of all races intervened on behalf of the poor wretches and were able to save all from the pyre except for seventy ring leaders the most serious offendersThere are several instances in Myanmar history when bhikkhus also mediated between contending kings or princes and helped to avoid bloodshedThis was often the case when cities were besieged and both parties realised that they could not winThe king who was besieged would normally take the initiative and send his bhikkhus to the king in attackOften the bhikkhus were authorized to negotiate on behalf of the monarchAn armistice agreed by or in the presence of bhikkhus was more likely to be honored than a promise given without their blessingsTherefore if the two parties were sincere in their offers to negotiate they usually requested bhikkhus to be mediators and judgesThe seventeenth century was a period of dynamic growth in the history of Buddhism in MyanmarMany outstanding developments took place and principal among these were the numerous translations of texts into the Myanmar language and the great increase in the study of the AbhidhammaIt is quite possible that the two developments were interconnectedIn the first half of the century Manirathana Thera translated the following texts into the Myanmar language Atthasalini Sammohavinodani Kankhavitarani Abhidhammatthavibhavini SankhepavannanaOf these five only the Kankhavitarani Buddhaghosas commentary on the Patimokkha is not concerned with AbhidhammaIn the second half of the century Aggadhammalankara translated Kaccayanas Pali grammar the Abhidhammatthasangaha Matika Dhatukatha Yamaka and the Patthana into the Myanmar tongueLater the Nettippakarana was also translatedIt cannot be a coincidence that nine out of twelve translated works were texts of the Abhidhamma or its commentariesThe reason for these translations must have been a developing interest in the psychology of Buddhism among the Buddhist followers who could not themselves read PaliWhether these were only bhikkhus or whether lay people were also interested in exploring the scriptures for themselves is difficult to determine nowHowever what is known is that almost every boy and many of the girls attended monastic schools whose curriculum was probably established by this period if not earlierIncluded in the curriculum were studies of the Mangala Sutta Metta Sutta Ratana Sutta and the other parittas as well as basic literacy which included some PaliIn addition a number of the Abhidhamma texts had to be committed to memoryThe intention behind these translations and commentaries in the Myanmar language was obviously to make the words of the Buddha accessible to a wider audience who would then not be solely dependent on the authority of the Pali scholarsIn the later half of the century the bhikkhu Devacakkhobhasa designed a system for the study and teaching of the Patthana the last book of the Abhidhamma which in Myanmar is believed to be the highest teaching of the BuddhaThe king at the time of Devacakkhobhasa was so impressed by the bhikkhus proficiency in these higher teachings and by his system of instruction that he ordered the Patthana to be studied in all the monasteries of MyanmarIt is not unreasonable to assume that the king himself studied these teachingsOtherwise he would hardly have been in a position to appreciate them and make them compulsory reading for the Myanmar bhikkhusThis emphasis on Abhidhamma in general and the Patthana in particular has survived in Myanmar to the present dayThe movement therefore that began in the seventeenth century is still of great significance for Buddhism thereThe Patthana for instance is ubiquitous in MyanmarThe twentyfour conditions of the Patthana can be found printed on the fans of the bhikkhus on calendars and on postersIn some monasteries the bhikkhus are woken every morning by twentyfour strokes on a hollow tree trunk while the bhikkhu striking the tree trunk has to recite the twentyfour conditions as he does soEven little children learn to recite the twentyfour conditions along with the suttas of protectionAs the Patthana is the highest and most difficult teaching of the Buddha it is believed that it will be the first to be lostIn order to slow the decline of the Sasana many people of Myanmar bhikkhus and lay people alike memorize the Patthana and recite it dailyIn Pagan the Jataka stories and the history of the Buddhas life were the main subjects of religious studyIn later centuries Pali grammar and the study of the Vinaya were foremost on the agendaDhammazedis reform movement drew the attention back to the foundations of all monastic life the code of conduct for the bhikkhus as laid down by the Buddha himselfThough stricter observation of the Vinaya would have to be reemphasised in the future its foundation was firm enough to insure that progressive reform movements would be instigated within the Sangha and not be dependent on external impetusHow far a bhikkhu was allowed to stray from the ideal had been defined in strictures that had become integral to the SanghaBased on this foundation of sila the Sangha was now free to give increased attention to higher teachingsThe age of the Abhidhamma had dawnedThe Abhidhamma remained no longer the domain of a chosen few but began to be studied by manyThe wealth of translations from the Abhidhamma would suggest that in the seventeenth century it had become so popular that it may have been taught even to lay peopleThe Myanmar language had developed and had been enriched with Pali terms so that it could convey the difficult concepts of Abhidhammacivilization had matured to an extent never seen beforeMyanmar was ready to study the analysis of mind and matter as taught by the BuddhaThe stage was being set for the widespread practice of insight meditation in later timesIn the succession of rulers of the eighteenth century some were strong and despotic while others were ineffective and withdrawnSome tried to expand their power and fought wars while others appeared satisfied with existing conditionsThere were several wars with Thailand and the population of Myanmar had to bear the deprivations that war invariably brings not only to the conquered but also to the country where the conquering armies are leviedAfter a war between the Mon and the Myanmar in which the Mon initially attacked and then conquered Ava itself the Myanmar king Alaungpaya who believed himself a Bodhisatta crushed Mon resistance once and for allAfter Pago had fallen into his hands in Lower Myanmar was devastated and many of the Mon survivors fled to Thailand or were deported as slavesLike Bayinnaung Alaungpaya established a Myanmar empire at the same time decimating the population of the country by drafting the peasantry into the army for campaigns against Ayutthaya and other countriesThe Sasanavamsa does not comment on the atrocity of warWar is perceived as it is cruel and pitiless  but it is the affair of rulers not of bhikkhusThe manner in which rulers conduct their affairs is entirely their responsibilityPannasami probably took very seriously the Buddhas injunction that a member of the Sangha should not talk about rulers and royal affairsThe Sasanavamsa pays much attention to a controversy which raged in monastic circles throughout the eighteenth centuryAt the beginning of the century some bhikkhus began to wear their robes outside the monasteries as they were worn within them that is covering only one shoulderEven when going on their daily alms round they failed to drape the robe in the traditional wayWhen challenged as to the orthodoxy of this practice they produced various interpretations and opinions but could not validate their practice through the authority of the scripturesDifferent kings endorsed one or other of the two opinions and bhikkhus of the orthodox school even died for their conviction when a king had outlawed the covering of both shouldersThe most interesting aspect of this historical period of the religion is not so much the actual controversy as the power the king had in religious affairsThe kings of Myanmar were not normally expert in the Vinaya and yet they took the final decision in matters of monastic discipline after due consultation with the leaders of the SanghaIn the more than one hundred years that this controversy prevailed different kings supported the orthodoxy of either viewThis shows that this system is not entirely satisfactoryHowever the right view which was in accordance with the Vinaya did eventually triumph due to the persistence of the majority of the SanghaOnly the worldly power was in a position to regulate the Sangha into which undesirable elements entered repeatedlyTo keep the Order pure it had to be always under careful scrutiny and bogus ascetics had to be removedThe kings of Myanmar in cooperation with the Sangharajas and the other senior bhikkhus had established a system of supervision of the bhikkhus by royal officialsIn every township the kings representatives were responsible for ensuring that the bhikkhus adhered scrupulously to the rules of the VinayaBhikkhus who transgressed were taken before religious courts and punished according to the code of disciplineThe controversy concerning the correct manner of wearing the robes came up for arbitration for the last time under Bodawpaya the fifth son of AlaungpayaHe decided in favor of orthodoxy and thenceforth all bhikkhus had to cover both shoulders on the daily alms roundThis ruling created one unified sect throughout Myanmar under the leadership of a council of senior bhikkhus appointed by the kingThese were called the Thudhamma Sayadaws and the Thudhamma sect has survived in Myanmar down to the present dayBodawpaya appointed a chapter of eight eminent bhikkhus as Sangharajas leaders of the Sangha and charged them with the duty to safeguard the purity of the Order of bhikkhusAs a direct result of the discipline and stability created by the work of these senior bhikkhus the Sangha prospered and consequently scholarship flourished under Bodawpayas reignThe name of the Mahasangharaja Nanabhivamsa is especially noteworthy in this respectNanabhivamsa was an eminently learned bhikkhu who had proven his wisdom even as a young manOnly five years after his ordination as a bhikkhu he had completed a commentary on the NettippakaranaEight years after full ordination at the age of twentyeight he became Sangharaja and then Mahasangharaja the title conferred by the king on the highest bhikkhu in his realmSoon after this he wrote his well respected new subcommentary on the Digha Nikaya the SadhujjanavilasiniAt the request of the king he wrote a commentary on Buddhaghosas Jatakatthakatha and several other treatisesThe king was so devoted to the head of the Sangha that he dedicated a very magnificent five storied monastery to him and later many other monasteries as wellAccording to the Sasanavamsa Nanabhivamsa was not only a scholar but also practiced the ascetic practices sitting always aloneHe divided his time between the various monasteries under his tutelage and was an indefatigable teacher of the scripturesScholarship flourished in the reign of King Bodawpaya and Myanmar was able for the first time to return thanks to Sri Lanka for nurturing the religion in the Golden LandThe bhikkhu ordination preserved in Myanmar was reintroduced to Sri Lanka where the Sasana had been interferred with by an unwise kingIn the later half of the eighteenth century the upasampada ordination in Sri Lanka was barred to all except the members of the landed aristocracyThis was a result of royal decree probably issued with the support of at least a section of the SanghaHowever this was a flagrant defilement of the letter and the spirit of the Buddhas instructionsThe conferring of the upasampada ordination is dependent only upon such conditions as the candidate being a man free from government service free of debt free of contagious diseases and upon his having his parents consent etcMembers of the lower castes had now only the possibility of becoming novices a condition that created dissatisfactionA sizeable section of ordained bhikkhus also disapproved of the royal order but were in no position to defy it within the countryThe only recourse for those of the lower castes desiring the higher ordination was therefore to travel to other Buddhist countries to ordainAt first missions were sent to Thailand where Dhammazedis reforms lived on through the ordination conferred to Thai bhikkhus in Pago and through the scores of Mon bhikkhus who had found refuge in Thailand from the Myanmar armiesAt the beginning of the nineteenth century however Sinhalese bhikkhus began traveling to Myanmar to find the pure ordination thereThe fame of the then Mahasangharaja of Myanmar Nanabhivamsa influenced their choiceScholarship had developed in all fields Pali grammar the Vinaya the Suttanta and the AbhidhammaMyanmar had after a long period of development become the custodian of BuddhismThe first delegation from Sri Lanka arrived in and was welcomed with a magnificent reception by King Bodawpaya himselfNanabhivamsa the wise Sangharaja ordained the samaneras as bhikkhus and instructed them for some time in the scripturesOn returning to Sri Lanka they were accompanied by five Myanmar bhikkhus and a letter from Nanabhivamsa to the Sinhalese SangharajaFive bhikkhus form a full chapter and apparently the Myanmar bhikkhus were permitted to ordain bhikkhus without class distinctionEven today Sri Lanka possesses three schools the Amarapura Nikaya the Siyama Nikaya and the Ramanna NikayaThe Amarapura Nikaya was so called because King Bodawpaya had established his capital in Amarapura and the bhikkhus had received their ordination thereThe Ramanna Nikaya was presumably founded by bhikkhus who had received ordination from Mon bhikkhus in the tradition of the Dhammazedi reforms and who had fled to southern Thailand from the wrath of the Myanmar kingsBoth these schools were allowed to ordain bhikkhus without discriminating against the lower classesOnly the Siyama Sangha continued to follow the royal command and ordained only novices of the higher castes as bhikkhusMissions from Sri Lanka continued to travel to Amarapura to consult with its senior theras and they were all given royal patronage and sent back with gifts of the Pali scriptures and commentarial textsAlthough King Bodawpaya would appear to have been a pious and devout king his relationship with the Sangha was somewhat problematicHe supported it at times and even used it to extend his own glory but at times he seemed almost jealous of the respect the bhikkhus received from the peopleHe realised that the bhikkhus were not respected out of fear but were held in genuine esteem and affection by his subjectsHis jealousy became apparent on different occasionsAt one time he declared that from then on the bhikkhus were no longer to be addressed by the traditional title Hpoungyi meaning The One of Great Merit This form of address was to be reserved for the kingThen again he tried to confiscate land and other goods given to the Sangha and to pagodas by previous generationsWhen the Sangharajas could not answer his questions to his satisfaction he invited the Muslim clergy for a meal to test their faithHe had heard that they were so strict in the observance of their discipline that they would rather die than eat porkUnfortunately for them they did not display great heroism as they all ate the pork offered to them by the kingBodawpaya is also reputed to have been beset by a form of megalomaniaHe wanted to force the Sangha to confirm officially that he was the Bodhisatta of the next Buddha to come in this world cycle the Buddha MetteyyaOn this issue however the Sangha was not to be bent even in the face of royal wrathThe bhikkhus refused and the king was finally forced to accept defeatAnother expression of his inflated selfesteem was the Mingun Pagoda near SagaingIt was to be by far the biggest temple ever builtScores of slaves and laborers worked on its construction until funds were depletedHowever it was never completed and remains today as a huge shapeless square of millions of bricksTo his credit King Bodawpaya imposed the morality of the Five Precepts in his whole realm and had offenders executed immediatelyCapital punishment was prescribed for selling and drinking alcohol killing larger animals such as buffaloes spreading heretical views and the smoking of opiumBodawpaya ruled the country with an iron fist and brought offending lay people as well as bhikkhus to heelHis successors were benevolent but possibly they could be so only because of the fear his rule had instilled in the populaceBodawpayas successor Bagyidaw was the first of the Myanmar kings to lose territory to the white invaders coming from the WestThe Myanmar court was so out of touch with the modern world that it still believed Myanmar to be the center of the world and her army virtually invincibleHence the king was not unduly disturbed when the British raj governing the Indian subcontinent declared war on the Kingdom of Ava inIt came to a battle near the coast in which the Myanmar general Mahabandhula achieved little or nothing against modern British armsThe Indian colonial government occupied all of the Myanmar coast as far south as Tenasserim in and forced the treaty of Yandabo on King BagyidawIn the treaty he was forced to accept the new borders established by the Indian government and pay compensation to the invaders for the annexation of the coast of Lower MyanmarHowever Bagyidaw made a very important contribution to the development of the Sangha and to the literature of Myanmar in generalHis predecessor Bodawpaya had united the Sangha by resolving the dispute relating to the draping of the robe over one or two shouldersBagyidaw saw the necessity of creating stability for the SanghaHe felt that this could be achieved to some extent by bestowing on it a sense of its own historyHe commissioned a work on the history of the religion starting from the time of the Buddha which was to show an unbroken succession of the pure tradition from teacher to pupilIts purpose was to praise the diligent theras and expose the shameless onesThis work the Thathanalingayakyan was composed at the kings request by the exbhikkhu Mahadhammathingyan a leading member of the committee appointed by King Bagyidaw to compile the famous Hmannanyazawin The Glasspalace Chronicle a secular history of MyanmarThe Thathanawuntha lingayakyan was completed in and in it was printed in the form of a modern book for the first time in YangonPannasami based his Sasanavamsa on this workAbout forty percent of the Sasanavamsa is straight translation from the original work about forty percent summaries and paraphrasing of the latter and only some twenty percent Pannasamis own workPannasami states in his introduction to the Sasanavamsa that his treatise is based on the works of the ancientsThe concept of mental property or copyright had not been born and there was no moral need to refer the reader to sources except to give authority to a statementThe only references that would lend authority to a treatise would be the scriptures their commentaries and subcommentaries but not a work as recent as the ThathanawunthalingayakyanThe preface to the original work in Myanmar explains the reason for its compilationThe kings representative had many times pleaded with the author to write a history of the succession of religious teachers so that the people would not become hereticalApparently the king felt that the lack of a work recording the history of the pure religion in its entirety left scope for wrong views to ariseBut with an authoritative record of the lineage of teachers bhikkhus could not call on views of shameless bhikkhus of the past anymore in order to support their heresiesThis is exactly what had happened again and again through the centuries and especially in the robedraping disputeThe ekamsikas the oneshoulderdrapers had repeatedly dug out obscure teachers in order to support their point of viewThis was to be made impossible once and for allWhether this has been successful is difficult to ascertain without a detailed study of the developments in the Sangha since the publication of this workHowever the fact that the original Myanmar chronicle was revised and translated into Pali for the Fifth Buddhist Council indicates that it was by this time considered a useful tool to put the kings authority behind a welldefined orthodox lineage thus making it easy to refute heresy by referring to the historical teachersKing Bagyidaw never overcame his shock over the loss of part of his realmHe was declared insane and was removed from the throne by TharawaddyMin King Mindons fatherIn the reign of TharrawaddyMin another mission from Sri Lanka visited Myanmar and was received by the Sangharaja NeyyadhammabhivamsaNeyyadhamma instructed the two bhikkhus and the accompanying novice in the teachings and conferred the bhikkhu ordination on the noviceHe is known for his critical emendation of the text of the Saddhammapajjotika and its translation into MyanmarHe was also the teacher of the later Sangharaja Pannasami the compiler of the Sasanavamsa and one of the most influential theras at the time of King MindonNeyyadhamma showed the need for a recension of at least some of the Pali texts by editing the SaddhammapajjotikaHis disciple Pannasami was to preside over the recension of the entire Tipitaka as Sangharaja under King MindonTharrawaddyMin was himself deposed because of insanity by his son PaganMin the brother of MindonMinPaganMin appointed Pannajotabhidhaja as his SangharajaIn his tenure scholarship received encouragement as the Sangharaja himself wrote a commentary and its subcommentary in Myanmar on the Anguttara NikayaOther works of the time all in the vernacular are a translation of the Saddhammavilasini and commentaries on the Samyutta Nikaya and the Digha NikayaThis is also the time when the author of the Sasanavamsa appearsHe started his scholarly career with the translation into Myanmar of a commentary on the SaddatthabhedacintaHis next work was a comparison of the existing versions of the Abhidhanappadipika and the translation of his emended textIn accord with the preeminence Myanmar had achieved in the Theravada Buddhist world the kings of the country became less fierce and wars were fewerThe successors of Bodawpaya seem to have shown a genuine interest in religion as well as in improving the administration of the countryUpper Myanmar moved into a period of peace which meant improved conditions for the bhikkhusThe first half of the nineteenth century saw the translation of many Pali texts into the Myanmar languageAlmost the whole of the Suttanta was now available in the vernacular and many commentaries and subcommentaries on Suttanta Abhidhamma and the Vinaya were composed in itThis not only made it easier for bhikkhus with limited linguistic skills to study the texts but also made them readily accessible to the laityThat people in a peaceful country have more time for the study of religion is obvious and soon Myanmar would see the first Buddhist texts printed on modern printing pressesThis made it possible for a great number of people to acquire texts relatively cheaply without having to pay a scribe to copy them laboriously onto palm leavesPolitically PaganMin was no luckier than Bagyidaw as he lost the provinces of Pathein and Yangon to the British who were ever ready to create some pretext for warSo in the Kingdom of Ava lost access to the sea and became increasingly dependent on the colonial powerLike his father PaganMin was overthrown in a palace revoltAlthough not a leader of the uprising his brother Mindon was placed on the throneHe did not execute the deposed king as was usually the case after a revolt but allowed him to end his days in dignityThe occupation by the British forces was of utmost significance for the Sangha as the British administration did not grant the traditional protection afforded it by a Buddhist rulerIn accordance with the colonial policy established in India that the colonial government should be strictly secular the new lords refused to take on the role of a Buddhist monarch and accept responsibility for the enforcing of the bhikkhus disciplineWithout this Buddhism in Lower Myanmar soon suffered and offending bhikkhus went unpunishedThe colonial administration would recognise its mistake only much later when it was too late and when they were not able to establish control in the Sangha any longerEven today King Mindons reign is surrounded by the mystique of a golden era in the minds of the Myanmar peopleNo war occurred during the twentyfive years of his tenure and the king himself is said to have been of gentle disposition and adverse to violenceHe even declared a dislike for capital punishment which was customarily inflicted by sovereigns for the slightest disobedience or even disagreementHe was not only held in esteem by his subjects but even praised by a British envoyThe colonisers comments on the Myanmar and their kings were usually dictated by a parochial narrowmindedness and a simplistic view that was only widened by contact with the conqueredTherefore General Fytches words describing King Mindon are all the more impressive Doubtless one of the most enlightened monarchs that has ever sat on the Burmese throneHe is polished in his manner has considerable knowledge of the affairs of state and the history and the statistics of his own and other countriesIn personal character he is amiable and kind and according to his light religiousKing Mindon transferred the capital from Ava to Mandalay the last royal capital before the British annexation of the whole of Myanmar inIn the early years of his reign Mindon strove to improve monastic disciplineAlthough a system of official investigation of complaints relating to bhikkhus misdemeanours existed each king had to take his own initiative in reestablishing order in the SanghaMindon found that the attitude of many members of the Sangha to their code of conduct was exceedingly laxHe therefore wanted all bhikkhus of his dominions to take a vow of obedience to the Vinaya rules in front of a Buddha imageHe consulted the Sangharaja who convened an assembly of mahatheras the Thudhamma CouncilAs opinions regarding the vow differed the primates disciple Pannasami had to deliver a religious address in support of the kings viewsHe reasoned that vows were also taken by the bhikkhus at the time of ordination and that if the king sincerely desired to improve the discipline in the Order he should be supportedAll agreed and the vow was prescribedThe greatest challenge King Mindon had to face as a Buddhist monarch was undoubtedly his duty to look after the spiritual welfare of his subjects not only in his own dominions but also in the parts of Myanmar occupied by the BritishMoreover he and many of the leading sayadaws of his court were increasingly aware that the British were only waiting for an occasion to annex the whole of MyanmarMindons army clearly would not be able to stand up to the might of the Indian colonial governmentTherefore it was not only important to support religious activities in the occupied territories but it was also essential to prepare the religion for the time when it would have to survive without the support of a Buddhist monarchThe British had made it clear at the outset that they would not take over the traditional role of the Myanmar kings that of protector of the SasanaThe new masters religion Christianity rapidly gained influence through the missionary schoolsThe schools were popular because their education provided much assistance in securing a job and favor with the colonisersChristian religious education was a compulsory part of their curriculumAfter the conquest of Lower Myanmar many bhikkhus had fled north in order to remain within the jurisdiction of the Myanmar kingsMany monasteries in British Myanmar were left without an incumbent and whole villages were therefore bereft of the opportunity to receive religious and general educationKing Mindon aware of this situation tried to convince bhikkhus to return to Lower Myanmar in order to serve their peopleThe kings efforts proved successful and many bhikkhus returned to their places of originBut soon it became clear that without the kings ecclesiastic officials to control the discipline of the Sangha many bhikkhus developed a careless attitude towards their code of disciplineThe Okpo Sayadaw from Okpo between Yangon and Pago had stopped many bhikkhus on their way to Upper Myanmar when the movements of bhikkhus out of the conquered territories was at its peak aroundHe assembled the bhikkhus around himself teaching that the Sangha needed no protection from the secular power if it observed the rules of the Vinaya strictlyHis monastery was the birth place of a movement of strict monastic disciplineHe also emphasised that mental volition was what really mattered in the religion of the Buddha and that acts of worship done with an impure intention were worthlessHe obviously felt that much of the Buddhist practice had become a ritual and that the essence had been lostIn addition to this however his movement also challenged the authority of the kings Council of Sayadaws the leaders of the unified Thudhamma sect when he declared their ordination was invalid due to a technicalityAs a result he took the higher ordination anew together with his followersThe Okpo Sayadaw was not the only critic of the Thudhamma sayadawsIn Upper Myanmar the Ngettwin Sayadaw criticized many religious practices and maintained that a radical reassesment of religious teachings was necessaryThe Ngettwin Sayadaw was also a source of inspiration for the Okpo Sayadaw and other reformersHe had been the teacher of Mindons chief queen and had also advised the king on many occasionsInterestingly he was a driving force in a movement in Upper Myanmar that wanted to return to the fundamentals of the religion but more radically than the Okpo SayadawThe Ngettwin Sayadaw together with many other bhikkhus left the royal city and went to live in the forest near SagaingHe started to preach that meditation was essential for all bhikkhus and he required an aspirant to novicehood to prove that he had practiced meditation before he would ordain himAll the bhikkhus around him had to spend a period of the day in meditation and he emphasised that meditation was of much greater importance than learningHe advised lay people to stop making offerings of flowers fruits and candles to Buddha images but to meditate regularly on the Uposatha daysOf course his instructions that offerings to Buddha images were fruitless and merely dirtied the places of worship caused considerable unhappiness with the traditional Thudhamma Council and presumably with many ordinary peopleHowever the Ngettwin Sayadaw never strove to form a different sect by holding a separate ordination as did the Okpo SayadawHis reforms were within the community and within a Buddhist society that was presided over by a kingThe Okpo Sayadaw had no place for royalty in his view of the world and did not hesitate to confront the system that was still alive though obviously doomedTwo other important sayadaws of King Mindons reign deserve mention the Shwegyin Sayadaw and the Thingazar SayadawThe Shwegyin Sayadawalso tried to reform the Sangha and his movement is still very much alive and highly respected in Myanmar todayHe had studied under the Okpo Sayadaw but when he returned to his native Shwegyin near Shwebo in Upper Myanmar he avoided controversy in never rebelling against the Thudhamma CouncilHe introduced two new rules for his bhikkhus that they must not chew betel and consume tobacco after noonHe also maintained that the Sangha must regulate itself without help from the authority but he never doubted the validity of the traditional ordination ceremonyThe Thingazar Sayadaw was one of the most popular of the great sayadaws of his timeHe was also part of the movement to return to the basics of the teachings and greatly emphasised the importance of practice as opposed to mere scholarshipThough he was greatly honored by the king and made a member of the Thudhamma Council he preferred spending long periods in solitude in the forestIn the numerous monasteries built for him by the royal family and the nobility of the country he insisted on the practice of the purest of conduct in accordance with the VinayaHowever he did not involve himself in disputes with the extreme reformers or the Thudhamma councilHe became very popular through the humorous tales he told in sermons preached in his frequent travels up and down the countryKing Mindon had no easy taskOne section of the Sangha was pressing for far reaching reforms yet it was the kings duty to maintain a certain continuity of the traditional ways for the benefit of the people in generalWhat complicated the situation was the fact that the Sangha of Lower Myanmar felt more and more independent of the Buddhist monarch and his Thudhamma council of senior mahatherasThis is illustrated graphically by the Okpo Sayadaws declaration that the Sangha needed no regulation by the worldly powerThis view gained popularity also in Upper MyanmarLuckily King Mindons devotion to Buddhism was genuine and he was not deterred by the difficulties confronting himHe was determined not to allow the Sangha to split into factions that were openly opposing each otherThis he achieved to some extent through careful diplomacy and through the calling of a great Synod a Sangayana in the royal city of MandalayThe Sangayana or Buddhist Council is the most important function of the Buddhist religionThe first Sangayana was held during the first Rains Retreat after the Parinibbana of the Buddha the texts to be regarded as authentic were determined at this timeThere had been three more Sangayanas since according to the Theravada traditionThe council convened by the great Emperor Asoka whose missionaries brought Buddhism to Myanmar probably provided the most inspiration for MindonThe Fourth Council the one prior to Mindons council was held in Sri Lanka in the first century BC at the Aluvihara near Matale for the purpose of writing down the Tipitaka which up to that time had been passed on orallyKing Mindon himself presided over the Fifth Buddhist Council during which all the canonical texts were recited and the correct form was established from among any variant readingsThe task took more than three years to accomplish from toWhen the bhikkhus had completed their great project the king had all of the Buddhist scriptures the Tipitaka engraved on marble slabsThe slabs were then housed each in a separate small pagoda about three meters high with a roof to protect the inscriptions from the elementsThe small shrines were built around a central pagoda the Kuthodaw Pagoda the Pagoda of the Noble MeritTo commemorate the great council King Mindon crowned the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon with a new Hti or spireThe Fifth Buddhist Council and the crowning of the Shwedagon Pagoda reminded all the people of Myanmar of the importance of their religion as well as of the fact that the king and the Thudhamma Council of senior monks were still the guardians of the SasanaThe authority of the Thudhamma Council was greatly enhanced also in Lower Myanmar through the synodAlthough the British had not allowed King Mindon to attend the raising of the new spire onto the Shwedagon the crowning was a symbol of the religious unity of Myanmar which persisted in spite of the British occupationThe religion was also later to become the rallying point for the Myanmar nationalists who fought for independence from the colonisersKing Mindons reign produced a number of scholarly works as well as translations from the PaliNeyyadhamma the royal preceptor himself wrote a subcommentary on the Majjhima Nikaya which had been translated by one of his disciples under his guidanceA commentary in Myanmar on the Pali Jatakas was composed by Medhavivamsa and the compiler of the Sasanavamsa Pannasami put his name to a great number of worksOne of the queens of King Mindon requested Pannasami to write the Silakatha and the UpayakathaHis teacher asked him to compose the Voharatthabheda Vivadavinicchaya NagarajuppattikathaHe also wrote a commentary on Aggavamsas SaddanitiWhether all these works were composed by Pannasami or whether they were composed under his supervision and control is difficult to assessIt is interesting to note that a majority of his works were composed in Pali which was no doubt an attempt to encourage bhikkhus not to forgo Pali scholarship now that Myanmar translations were readily availableThe calling of a great Buddhist council to purify the scriptures was part of this movement towards the revival of the study of the original textsDuring King Mindons reign bhikkhus from Sri Lanka came to Mandalay on several occasions to solve difficult questions of Vinaya and to receive the bhikkhu ordination in MyanmarAfter Mindons death in his son Thibaw ascended the throneHe was weak and of feeble intellect and his reign was shortIn he lost his kingdom to the British empire and was exiled to IndiaWith the complete annexation of Myanmar by the British a historical era came to an endTheravada Buddhism developed in Myanmar over more than two millenniaThe visits of the Buddha were the first brief illuminations in a country that was shrouded in darknessThe worship of the Buddha that is thought to have resulted from these visits and from the arrival of the hair relics may have been merely part of a nature religionThe pure religion could not endure for long in a country which was yet on the brink of civilizationLater however the teachings of the Buddha were brought repeatedly to those lands by various peopleThe visits of the Arahats sent out after Emperor Asokas council are historically more acceptable than the visits of the BuddhaTheir teachings were understood and perpetuated possibly in Indian settlements along the coast and later in communities of people from central Asia such as the PyuThrough their contact with India these cultural centers of the Pyu and Mon could remain in contact with BuddhismAt first the important centers of Theravada Buddhism were in northern India and later in South India and then Sri LankaThrough repeated contact with orthodox bhikkhus abroad the understanding of Buddhism grew ever stronger in the minds of the people of MyanmarThe religion was distorted dozens of times through ignorance and carelessness but someone always appeared to correct the teachings with the help of the mainstays of the Sasana abroadGradually the role was reversed instead of traveling abroad for advice the bhikkhus of Myanmar became the guardians of Theravada Buddhist teaching and their authority was respected by allEventually when Theravada Buddhism had long been lost to India and its future was uncertain in Sri Lanka it found a secure home in Southeast Asia especially in MyanmarThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe Pali word metta is a multisignificant term meaning lovingkindness friendliness goodwill benevolence fellowship amity concord inoffensiveness and nonviolenceThe Pali commentators define metta as the strong wish for the welfare and happiness of othersEssentially metta is an altruistic attitude of love and friendliness as distinguished from mere amiability based on selfinterestThrough metta one refuses to be offensive and renounces bitterness resentment and animosity of every kind developing instead a mind of friendliness accommodativeness and benevolence which seeks the wellbeing and happiness of othersTrue metta is devoid of selfinterestIt evokes within a warmhearted feeling of fellowship sympathy and love which grows boundless with practice and overcomes all social religious racial political and economic barriersMetta is indeed a universal unselfish and allembracing loveMetta makes one a pure font of wellbeing and safety for othersJust as a mother gives her own life to protect her child so metta only gives and never wants anything in returnTo promote ones own interest is a primordial motivation of human natureWhen this urge is transformed into the desire to promote the interest and happiness of others not only is the basic urge of selfseeking overcome but the mind becomes universal by identifying its own interest with the interest of allBy making this change one also promotes ones own wellbeing in the best possible mannerMetta is the protective and immensely patient attitude of a mother who forbears all difficulties for the sake of her child and ever protects it despite its misbehaviorMetta is also the attitude of a friend who wants to give one the best to further ones wellbeingIf these qualities of metta are sufficiently cultivated through mettabhavana  the meditation on universal love  the result is the acquisition of a tremendous inner power which preserves protects and heals both oneself and othersApart from its higher implications today metta is a pragmatic necessityIn a world menaced by all kinds of destructiveness metta in deed word and thought is the only constructive means to bring concord peace and mutual understandingIndeed metta is the supreme means for it forms the fundamental tenet of all the higher religions as well as the basis for all benevolent activities intended to promote human wellbeingThe present booklet aims at exploring various facets of metta both in theory and in practiceThe examination of the doctrinal and ethical side of metta will proceed through a study of the popular Karaniya Metta Sutta the Buddhas Hymn of Universal Love In connection with this theme we will also look at several other short texts dealing with mettaThe explanation of mettabhavana the meditation on universal love will give the practical directions for developing this type of contemplation as set forth in the main meditation texts of the Theravada Buddhist tradition the Visuddhimagga the Vimuttimagga and the PatisambhidamaggaThe historical background which led the Buddha to expound the Karaniya Metta Sutta is explained in the commentary written by Acariya Buddhaghosa who received it from an unbroken line of Elders going back to the days of the Buddha himselfIt is told that five hundred monks received instructions from the Buddha in the particular techniques of meditation suitable to their individual temperamentsThey then went to the foothills of the Himalayas to spend the four months of the rains retreat by living a life of withdrawal and intensive meditationIn those days a month or two before the rains retreat started monks from all parts of the country would assemble wherever the Buddha lived in order to receive direct instruction from the Supreme MasterThen they would go back to their monasteries forest dwellings or hermitages to make a vigorous attempt at spiritual liberationThis was how these five hundred monks went to the Buddha who was staying at Savatthi in Jetas Grove in the monastery built by AnathapindikaAfter receiving instructions they went in search of a suitable place and in the course of their wandering they soon found a beautiful hillock at the foothills of the HimalayasThis according to the commentary appeared like a glittering blue quartz crystal it was embellished with a cool dense green forest grove and a stretch of ground strewn with sand resembling a pearl net or a silver sheet and was furnished with a clean spring of cool water The bhikkhus were captivated by the sightThere were a few villages nearby and also a small markettown ideal as almsresortThe monks spent a night in that idyllic grove and the next morning went to the markettown for almsThe residents there were overjoyed to see the monks since rarely did a community of monks come to spend the retreat in that part of the HimalayasThese pious devotees fed the monks and begged them to stay on as their guests promising to build each a hut near the grove on the sandy stretch so that they could spend their days and nights plunged in meditation under the ancient boughs of the majestic treesThe bhikkhus agreed and the devotees of the area soon built little huts in the fringe of the forest and provided each hut with a wooden cot a stool and pots of water for drinking and washingAfter the monks had settled down contentedly in these huts each one selected a tree to meditate under by day and by nightNow it is said that these great trees were inhabited by treedeities who had a celestial mansion built appropriately using the trees as the baseThese deities out of reverence for the meditating monks stood aside with their familiesVirtue was revered by all particularly so by deities and when the monks sat under the trees the deities who were householders did not like to remain above themThe deities had thought that the monks would remain only for a night or two and gladly bore the inconvenienceBut when day after day passed and the monks still kept occupying the bases of the trees the deities wondered when they would go awayThey were like dispossessed villagers whose houses had been commandeered by the officials of visiting royalty and they kept watching anxiously from a distance wondering when they would get their houses backThese dispossessed deities discussed the situation among themselves and decided to frighten the monks away by showing them terrifying objects by making dreadful noises and by creating a sickening stenchAccordingly they materialized all these terrifying conditions and afflicted the monksThe monks soon grew pale and could no longer concentrate on their subjects of meditationAs the deities continued to harass them they lost even their basic mindfulness and their brains seemed to become smothered by the oppressing visions noise and stenchWhen the monks assembled to wait upon the seniormost Elder of the group each one recounted his experiencesThe Elder suggested Let us go brethren to the Blessed One and place our problem before himThere are two kinds of rains retreat  the early and the lateThough we will be breaking the early one by leaving this place we can always take upon ourselves the late one after meeting the Lord The monks agreed and they set out at once it is said without even informing the devoteesBy stages they arrived at Savatthi went to the Blessed One prostrated at his feet and related their frightful experiences pathetically requesting another placeThe Buddha through his supernormal power scanned the whole of India but finding no place except the same spot where they could achieve spiritual liberation told them Monks go back to the same spotIt is only by striving there that you will effect the destruction of inner taintsFear notIf you want to be free from the harassment caused by the deities learn this suttaIt will be a theme for meditation as well as a formula for protectionThen the Master recited the Karaniya Metta Sutta  the Hymn of Universal Love  which the monks learned by rote in the presence of the LordThen they went back to the same placeAs the monks neared their forest dwellings reciting the Metta Sutta thinking and meditating on the underlying meaning the hearts of the deities became so charged with warm feelings of goodwill that they materialized themselves in human form and received the monks with great pietyThey took their bowls conducted them to their rooms caused water and food to be supplied and then resuming their normal form invited them to occupy the bases of the trees and meditate without any hesitation or fearFurther during the three months of the rains residence the deities not only looked after the monks in every way but made sure that the place was completely free from any noiseEnjoying perfect silence by the end of the rainy season all the monks attained to the pinnacle of spiritual perfectionEvery one of the five hundred monks had become an arahantIndeed such is the power intrinsic in the Metta SuttaWhoever with firm faith will recite the sutta invoking the protection of the deities and meditating on metta will not only safeguard himself in every way but will also protect all those around him and will make spiritual progress that can be actually verifiedNo harm can ever befall a person who follows the path of mettaThe Metta Sutta consists of three parts each of which focuses on a distinct aspect of mettaThe first part covers that aspect which requires a thorough and systematic application of lovingkindness in ones daytoday conductThe second part expresses lovingkindness as a distinct technique of meditation or culture of mind leading to samadhi  higher consciousness induced by absorptionAnd the third part underlines a total commitment to the philosophy of universal love and its personal social and empirical extensions  lovingkindness through all bodily verbal and mental activitiesMetta has been identified as that specific factor which ripens the accumulated merit acquired by the ten ways for the acquisition of merit such as the practice of generosity virtue etcAgain it is metta which brings to maturity the ten exalted spiritual qualities known as perfectionsThe practice of metta thus can be likened to bringing into being a great tree from the time the seed is sown to the time the tree is heavily laden with luscious fruits and sends forth its sweet odor far and wide attracting myriads of creatures to it to enjoy its tasty and nutritious bountyThe sprouting of the seed and the growth of the plant are as it were brought about by the first part of the suttaIn the second part the tree robust and developed is fully covered with fragrant and beautiful flowers riveting all eyes upon itAs a pattern of behavior the first aspect of metta makes ones life grow like a tree useful generous and nobleMetta as meditation effects that spiritual efflorescence whereby ones entire life becomes a source of joy for allThe third part envisages in this imagery the fruition of that process of spiritual development whereby one brings about an allembracing application of spiritual love which can powerfully condition society as a whole and lead one to the heights of transcendental realizationThe human mind is like a mine holding an inexhaustible storehouse of spiritual power and insightThis immense inner potential of merit can be fully exploited only by the practice of metta as is clear from the description of metta as that maturing force which ripens the dormant meritsIn the Mangala Sutta it is said that only after one has effected an elevating interpersonal relationship does one choose the right environment for the merits of the past to find fruitionThis finding of fruition is exactly what metta doesMere avoidance of wrong company and living in a cultured environment is not enough the mind must be cultivated by mettaHence the allusion to the fruition of past meritEthics in the Buddhist context is right conduct which brings happiness and peace of mind and never gives rise to remorse worry or restlessness of mindThis is the immediate psychological benefitRight conduct also leads to a happy rebirth enabling an aspirant to progress further on the onward path to spiritual liberationIt is also the basis for progress in Dhamma here and nowIn other words right speech right action and right livelihood of the Buddhas Noble Eightfold Path constitute right conduct in the best senseBuddhist ethics is twofold fulfillment of certain virtues and precepts of abstinenceCaritta as found in the Metta Sutta is as followsVaritta is covered by the next gathaCaritta and varitta are thus practiced through metta expressed in bodily and verbal action the resultant inner happiness and altruistic urge is reflected by the aspirants metta of mental action as found in the conclusion of the stanzaThe ethics of metta thus provides not only subjective wellbeing or the opportunity to progress in Dhamma here and now and to enjoy a happy rebirth in the future but it means the giving of fearlessness and security  abhayadana and khemadanaAn analysis of the behaviorpattern and traits commended by the Metta Sutta for meaningful interaction both with reference to persons individually and to society as a whole provides ample insight into the great implications of the sutta for mental healthAbility is not just mere efficiency or skill but means doing a thing well out of consideration for others so that one may not cause inconvenience to othersAs an able man can become very conceited the practitioner is advised to be honest and upright while being gentle in speech meek and not proud  indeed a perfect synthesis and an equilibrium of traitsHe who is contented is easy to support Frugality from consideration of others is a noble traitTo the extent that ones own needs are cut down as an example to others and as a means not to inconvenience them to that extent one shows refinementThe more gross and materialistic a person becomes the more his needs increaseThe yardstick to judge the mental health of a given society is thus the diminution of needs that is to say the element of satisfactionA materialistic and egocentric life is characterized not only by an increase in wants but also by restlessness showing itself in being overbusy and overactive and lacking in moderation and selfrestraintMetta which promotes the wellbeing of all naturally has to be built on such qualities of sober humanism as are reflected in having a few meaningful and select tasks which conduce to the maximum wellbeing of all concernedLiving a simple life as an expression of metta involves a reorientation of ones outlook and conduct even in our competitive pleasureseeking and possessionminded worldA man of simple living is gentle yet efficient and effective and has restraint over his sensefaculties being moderate frugal and controlledMental culture through meditation for such a person becomes natural and effortless hence the attribute tranquil in his sensesMetta in conduct includes the exercising of prudence that is to say practical wisdomIt is only a sagacious and wise person who can really practice metta in all its varied forms in daily life and through all modes of human relationshipSelfrighteousness arising from a sense of being better or more devout than others can be a masquerade of spiritual practiceTo be not brazen nor fawning on families thus is a pointer for the person of metta not to indulge in selfrighteousness of any formFurther the practitioner of metta is advised to refrain from any action even social conventions for which a wise man may reprove him as lacking in prudence or proprietyIt is not good enough that one should be good but one should also appear to be good in consideration not only of ones own wellbeing but also of others wellbeingAn exemplary life is to be lived for the benefit of all for the welfare of societyA person living thus now plunges into the cultivation of the allembracing mind of metta through definite techniques of meditation as envisaged in the remaining part of the suttaMetta is also called a paritta  a spiritual formula capable of safeguarding ones wellbeing protecting one against all dangers and rescuing one from mishaps and misfortunesWhen the monks could not stay and meditate in that beautiful forest provided with all facilities because the deities were hostile to them they had to leave the placeAnd when they were armed with the protection of the Metta Sutta which they recited and meditated upon throughout their journey by the time they reached the place the deities were full of friendly feelings and already waiting for themHostility had been turned into hospitalityThe protection of paritta works both subjectively and objectivelySubjectively as metta cleanses and strengthens the mind it also awakens the dormant potentials resulting in the spiritual transmutation of the personalityTransformed by metta the mind is no longer haunted by greed hatred lust jealousy and those other mindpolluting factors which are ones real enemy and source of misfortuneObjectively metta as a thoughtforce is capable of affecting any mind anywhere developed or undevelopedThe radiation of metta can not only calm a person or remove the darts of hate from within him but in some cases can even cure him of severe illnessIt is a common experience in Buddhist countries to see how people are cured from all sorts of diseases and freed from misfortunes through the recitation of parittaThus metta is a real healing powerIn this way does metta act as a paritta a healing formula affording safeguardsThe Pali commentaries explainby being inoffensive and thus avoids offensivenessby not torturing and thus avoids torturingby the nondestruction and thus avoids destructivenessby being nonvexing and thus avoids vexingby projecting the thought May all beings be friendly and not hostileby projecting the thought May all beings be happy and not unhappyby projecting the thought May all beings enjoy wellbeing and not be distressedIn these eight ways one loves all beings therefore it is called universal loveAnd since one conceives this quality it is of the mindAnd since this mind is free from all thoughts of illwill the aggregate of love mind and freedom is defined as universal love leading to freedom of mindFrom the above passage it will be seen that metta implies the outgrowing of negative traits by actively putting into practice the correlative positive virtuesIt is only when one actively practices nonharassment towards all beings that one can outgrow the tendency to harass othersSimilarly it is with the other qualities of inoffensiveness nontormenting nondestroying and nonvexing in deed word and thought that one can outgrow the negative traits of being offensive of tormenting others of destructiveness and of vexatiousnessOver and above such positive conduct and principled way of life one further cultivates the mind through that specific technique of meditation called mettabhavana which generates powerful thoughts of spiritualized love that grow boundless making consciousness itself infinite and universalThoughts that wish all beings to be friendly and never hostile happy and never unhappy to enjoy wellbeing and never be distressed imply not only sublimity and boundlessness but also utter freedom of mindHence the appropriateness of the expression universal love leading to freedom of mindAs for the meanings of the five aspects opposed by metta harassment is the desire to oppress or damage offensiveness is the tendency to hurt or injure torturing is a synonym of the sadistic tendency to torment subjecting others to pain or misery destructiveness is to put an end to or to finish the trait of the extremist and the iconoclast vexing is to tax trouble or cause others worry and strainEach of these tendencies is rooted in antipathy and malevolence and provides a contrast with metta both as a mode of conduct and as a psychological state or attitude of mindThe substitution of a negative trait by the opposed positive course implies a very developed and mature approach to lifeThe ability to remain nonharassing inoffensive nontorturing nondestructive and nonvexing means a very refined beautiful and loving mode of behavior in a world where interaction between human beings creates so much tension and miseryAccording to the Visuddhimagga metta is a solvent that melts not only ones own psychic pollutants of anger resentment and offensiveness but also those of othersSince it takes the approach of friendship even the hostile one turns into a friendMetta is characterized as that which promotes welfare Its function is to prefer wellbeing rather than illIt manifests as a force that removes annoyance and its proximate cause is the tendency to see the good side of things and beings and never the faultsMetta succeeds when it loves and it fails when it degenerates into worldly affectionIt will be clear from this analysis that only when one tends to see the good in people and prefers the welfare of others and accordingly is inoffensive and actively promotes wellbeing does metta function as a solventIt is said that the ultimate purpose of metta is to attain transcendental insight and if that is not possible it will at least effect a rebirth in the sublime sphere of the Brahma world apart from bringing inner peace and a healthy state of mind here and nowHence the Buddhas assurance in the Metta SuttaLove wards off illwill which is the most damaging of emotionsHence it is said For this is the escape from illwill friends that is to say the freedom of mind wrought by universal loveIn the practice of metta it is important to understand the emotions which nullify metta either by being similar or being dissimilarThe Visuddhimagga calls them the two enemies  the near and the remote Greed lust worldly affection sensuality  all these are said to be the near enemies because they are similar in tendenciesThe lustful also sees the good side or beauty and therefore gets involvedLove should be protected from it lest the masquerades of these emotions deceive the meditatorIllwill anger and hatred being dissimilar emotions therefore constitute the remote enemy The remote enemy can easily be distinguished so one need not be afraid of it but one should overcome it by projecting a higher force that of loveBut one has to be wary of the near enemy because it creates selfdeception which is the worst thing that can happen to an individualIt is said that metta begins only when there is zeal in the form of a desire to actHaving commenced through earnest effort it can be continued only when the five mental hindrances  sensual desire illwill sloth and torpor restlessness and worry and doubt  are put downMetta reaches consummation with the attainment of absorptionThere are various ways of practicing mettabhavana the meditation on universal loveThree of the principal methods will be explained hereThese instructions based on canonical and commentarial sources are intended to explain the practice of mettameditation in a clear simple and direct way so that anyone who is earnest about taking up the practice will have no doubts about how to proceedFor full instructions on the theory and practice of mettabhavana the reader is referred to the Visuddhimagga Chapter IXSit down in a comfortable posture in a quiet place  a shrine room a quiet room a park or any other place providing privacy and silenceKeeping the eyes closed repeat the word metta a few times and mentally conjure up its significance  love as the opposite of hatred resentment malevolence impatience pride and arrogance and as a profound feeling of good will sympathy and kindness promoting the happiness and wellbeing of othersNow visualize your own face in a happy and radiant moodEvery time you see your face in the mirror see yourself in a happy mood and put yourself in this mood during meditationA person in a happy mood cannot become angry or harbor negative thoughts and feelingsHaving visualized yourself in a happy frame of mind now charge yourself with the thought May I be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may I live happily As you suffuse yourself in this way with the positive thoughtforce of love you become like a filled vessel its contents ready to overflow in all directionsNext visualize your meditation teacher if living if not choose some other living teacher or revered personSee him in a happy frame of mind and project the thought May my teacher be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may he live happilyThen think of other people who are to be revered and who are also living  monks teachers parents and elders and intensely spread towards each one of them the thought of metta in the manner mentioned already May they be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may they live happilyThe visualization must be clear and the thoughtradiation must be willed wellIf the visualization is hurried or the wishing is performed in a perfunctory or mechanical way the practice will be of little avail for then it will be merely an intellectual pastime of thinking about mettaOne must clearly understand that to think about metta is one thing and to do metta to actively project the willforce of lovingkindness is quite anotherNote that only a living person is to be visualized not a dead oneThe reason for this is that the dead person having changed form will be out of the focus of mettaprojectionThe object of metta always is a living being and the thoughtforce will become ineffective if the object is not aliveHaving radiated thoughts of metta in the order already mentioned  oneself the meditation teacher and other revered persons  one should now visualize one by one ones dear ones beginning with the members of ones family suffusing each one with abundant rays of lovingkindnessCharity begins at home if one cannot love ones own people one will not be able to love othersWhile spreading metta towards ones own family members care should be taken to think of a very dear one like ones husband or wife at the end of this circleThe reason for this is that the intimacy between husband and wife introduces the element of worldly love which defiles mettaSpiritual love must be the same towards allSimilarly if one has had a temporary misunderstanding or quarrel with any family member or relative he or she should be visualized at a later stage to avoid recalling the unpleasant incidentsNext one should visualize neutral people people for whom one has neither like nor dislike such as ones neighbors colleagues in ones place of work bare acquaintances and so onHaving radiated loving thoughts on everyone in the neutral circle one should now visualize persons for whom one has dislike hostility or prejudice even those with whom one may have had a temporary misunderstandingAs one visualizes disliked persons to each one must mentally repeat I have no hostility towards himher may heshe also not have any hostility towards meMay heshe be happyThus as one visualizes the persons of the different circles one breaks the barrier caused by likes and dislikes attachment and hatredWhen one is able to regard an enemy without illwill and with the same amount of goodwill that one has for a very dear friend metta then acquires a sublime impartiality elevating the mind upward and outward as if in a spiral movement of everwidening circles until it becomes allembracingBy visualization is meant calling to mind or visualizing certain objects such as a person a certain area or a direction or a category of beingsIn other words it means imagining the people towards whom thoughts of love are to be projected or spreadFor instance you imagine your father and visualize his face in a very happy and radiant mood and project the thought towards the visualized image mentally saying May he be happyMay he be free from disease or troubleMay he enjoy good health You may use any thought which promotes his wellbeingBy radiation is meant as explained above the projection of certain thoughts promoting the wellbeing of those persons towards whom ones mind is directedA mettathought is a powerful thoughtforceIt can actually effect what has been willedFor wishing wellbeing is willing and thus is creative actionIn fact all that man has created in different fields is the result of what he has willed whether it is a city or a hydroelectric project a rocket going to the moon a weapon of destruction or an artistic or literary masterpieceRadiation of thoughts of metta too is the development of a willpower that can effect whatever is willedIt is not a rare experience to see diseases cured or misfortunes warded off even from a great distance by the application of the thoughtforce of mettaBut this thoughtforce has to be generated in a very specific and skillful way following a certain sequenceThe formula for radiating metta that is used here has come down from the ancient Patisambhidamagga May they be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may they live happilyThe commentarial explanation of these terms is highly significantFree from hostility means absence of hostility whether aroused on account of oneself or others or on account of oneself because of others or of others because of oneself or othersOnes anger towards oneself might take the form of selfpity remorse or a gripping sense of guiltIt can be conditioned by interaction with othersHostility combines anger and enmityFree from affliction means absence of pain or physical sufferingFree from distress means the absence of mental suffering anguish or anxiety which often follows upon hostility or bodily afflictionIt is only when one is free from hostility affliction and distress that one lives happily that is conducts oneself with ease and happinessThus all these terms are interconnectedBy order is meant visualizing objects one after the other by taking the path of least resistance in a graduated sequence which progressively widens the circle and therewith the mind itselfThe Visuddhimagga is emphatic about this orderAccording to Acariya Buddhaghosa one must start the meditation on metta by visualizing oneself and thereafter a person for whom one has reverence then ones dear ones then neutral people then hostile personsAs one radiates thoughts of love in this order the mind breaks all barriers between oneself a revered one a dear one a neutral one and a hostile oneEveryone comes to be looked upon equally with the eye of lovingkindnessIn the Visuddhimagga Acariya Buddhaghosa gives a very apt analogy for the breaking of the barriers Suppose bandits were to come to the meditator who is sitting in a place with a respected a dear a neutral and a hostile or wicked person and demand Friend we want one of you for the purpose of offering human sacrifice If the meditator were to think Let him take this one or that one he has not broken down the barriersAnd even if he were to think Let none of these be taken but let them take me even then he has not broken down the barriers since he seeks his own harm and metta meditation signifies the wellbeing of allBut when he does not see the need for anyone to be given to the bandits and impartially projects the thought of love towards all including the bandits it is then that he would break down the barriersThe first method of practicing meditation on metta employs the projection of loving thoughts to specific individuals in order of increasing remoteness from oneselfThe second method presents an impersonal mode of radiating metta which makes the mind truly allembracing as suggested by the Pali term mettacetovimutti the liberation of mind through universal love The unliberated mind is imprisoned within the walls of egocentricity greed hatred delusion jealousy and meannessAs long as the mind is in the grip of these defiling and limiting mental factors for so long it remains insular and fetteredBy breaking these bonds metta liberates the mind and the liberated mind naturally grows boundless and immeasurableJust as the earth cannot be rendered earthless even so the mind of metta cannot be limitedAfter completing the radiation of metta towards selected persons when the mind breaks the barriers existing between oneself and revered ones beloved ones friends neutral ones and hostile ones the meditator now embarks on the great voyage of impersonal radiation even as an oceanworthy ship voyages through the vast measureless ocean nevertheless retaining a route and a goal as wellThe technique is as followsImagine the people residing in your house as forming an aggregate then embrace all of them within your heart radiating the metta thoughts May all those dwelling in this house be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may they live happily Having visualized ones own house in this manner one must now visualize the next house and all its residents and then the next house and the next and so on until all the houses in that street are similarly covered by allembracing lovingkindnessNow the meditator should take up the next street and the next until the entire neighborhood or village is coveredThereafter extension by extension directionwise should be clearly visualized and spread with mettarays in abundant measureIn this way the entire town or the city is to be covered then the district and the entire state should be covered and radiated with thoughts of mettaNext one should visualize state after state starting with ones own state then the rest of the states in the different directions the east south west and northThus one should cover the whole of ones country geographically visualizing the people of this land regardless of class race sect or religionThink May everyone in this great land abide in peace and wellbeingMay there be no war no strife no misfortune no maladiesRadiant with friendliness and good fortune with compassion and wisdom may all those in this great country enjoy peace and plentyOne should now cover the entire continent country by country in the eastern southern western and northern directionsGeographically imagining each country and the people therein according to their looks one should radiate in abundant measure thoughts of metta May they be happyMay there be no strife and discordMay goodwill and understanding prevailMay peace be unto allThereafter one should take up all the continents  Africa Asia Australia Europe North and South America  visualizing country by country and people by people covering the entire globeImagine yourself at a particular point of the globe and then project powerful rays of metta enveloping one direction of the globe then another then another and so on until the whole globe is flooded and thoroughly enveloped with glowing thoughts of universal loveOne should now project into the vastness of space powerful beams of metta towards all beings living in other realms first in the four cardinal directions  east south west and north  then in the intermediary directions  northeast southeast southwest northwest  and then above and below covering all the ten directions with abundant and measureless thoughts of universal loveAccording to the cosmology of Buddhism there are numberless world systems inhabited by infinitely varied categories of beings in different stages of evolutionOur earth is only a speck in our worldsystem which again is a minute dot in the universe with its innumerable worldsystemsTowards all beings everywhere one should radiate thoughts of boundless loveThis is developed in the next method of practice the universalization of mettaThe universalization of metta is effected in these three specific modesAccording to the Patisambhidamagga the generalized radiation of metta is practiced in five ways the specified radiation in seven ways and the directional radiation in ten waysThese ten directional ways may be combined with the five categories of general radiation and with the seven categories of specified radiation as we will showIn each of these modes of practice any of the four phrases of the standard metta formula  May they be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may they live happily  may be used as the thought of radiationThus four types of thought applied to five seven and objects of metta amount to modes of radiationAny of these can be used as a vehicle for attaining absorption through the technique of mettabhavanaThe five ways of generalized radiation are as followsMay all those that breathe be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may they live happilyMay all creatures be free from hostility free from afflictionfree from distress may they live happilyMay all those with individual existence be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may they live happilyMay all those who are embodied be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may they live happilyThe seven ways of specified radiation are as followsMay all males be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may they live happilyMay all the Noble Ones be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may they live happilyMay all worldlings be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may they live happilyMay all gods be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may they live happilyMay all human beings be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may they live happilyMay all those in states of woe be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may they live happilyThe ten ways of directional radiation involve sending thoughts of metta to all beings in the ten directionsThis method in its basic form is applied to the class of beings the first of the five generalized objects of mettaBut it can be developed further by extending metta through each of the five ways of generalized radiation and the seven ways of specified radiation as we will seeMay all beings in the western direction be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may they live happilyMay all beings in the northern direction be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may they live happilyMay all beings in the southern direction be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may they live happilyMay all beings in the northeastern direction be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may they live happilyMay all beings in the southwestern direction be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may they live happilyMay all beings in the northwestern direction be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may they live happilyMay all beings in the southeastern direction be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may they live happilyMay all beings below be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may they live happilyMay all beings above be free from hostility free from affliction free from distress may they live happilyIn this technique of universalizing metta each of the five categories of generalized radiation refers to the total dimension of animate sentient or organic existence belonging to the three mundane spheres namely the kamaloka the sphere of sensory existence where desire is the primal motivation the rupaloka the realm of the radiant Brahma gods with subtle form and the arupaloka the realm of the formless beings with pure mental lifeWhether it is a being or that which breathes or a creature or that which has individual existence or that which is embodied  all refer to the totality of animate existence the distinction being that each term expresses comprehensively a certain aspect of life in its entiretyWhile visualizing each category one should keep in mind the specific aspect expressed by its designationIf one trains the mind in the manner of a mental drill after having exercised it with the first two methods the meaning of the five unspecified or generalized terms will become clearBy the time one has completed the two methods the consciousness will be sufficiently developed and allembracingAnd with such a consciousness when each of these universal concepts is grasped the universalization becomes effortlessIt may be pointed out that visualization of each of these is no longer of individual objects but of a concept which is total and allembracingThe radiation in this case becomes a flowing out of love in abundant measure towards the conceptualized mental object  all beings all creatures etcEach of the seven categories of specified radiation comprehends a part of the total range of life and in combination with the others expresses the wholeItthi refers to the female principle in general incorporating all females among the devas human beings animals demons spirits and denizens of hellPurisa means the male principle evident in all the spheres of existence and both itthi and purisa together comprehend the entiretyAgain from another angle the ariyas or the spiritually transformed seers and the anariyas or worldlings bound to the wheel of becoming comprehend the totalityAriyas are those who have entered the transcendental path they are to be found in the human world and the celestial worlds and therefore they constitute the tip of the pyramid of sentient existenceWorldlings are in all the spheres of existence and constitute the body of the pyramid from the base to the tip so to sayLikewise the three categories of deva manussa and vinipatika  gods human beings and those fallen into states of woe  comprehend the totality in terms of cosmological statusDevas the radiant celestial beings comprise the upper layer human beings the middle layer and vinipatikas the lower layer of the cosmological moundThe mental drill in terms of directional radiation the radiation of metta to the above twelve categories of beings in the ten directions makes the universalization of metta a most exhilarating experienceAs one mentally places oneself in a particular direction and then lets love flow out and envelop the entire region one literally transports the mind to the sublimest heights leading to samadhi concentrated absorption of the mindWhen one projects this total wish for others to dwell happily free from hostility affliction and distress not only does one elevate oneself to a level where true happiness prevails but one sets in motion powerful vibrations conducing to happiness cooling off enmity relieving affliction and distressIt will be seen therefore that universal love simultaneously infuses wellbeing and happiness and removes the mental and physical suffering caused by the mental pollutants of hostility enmity and angerOne sleeps happily one wakes happily one does not suffer bad dreams one is dear to human beings one is dear to nonhuman beings the gods protect one no fire or poison or weapon harms one ones mind gets quickly concentrated the expression of ones face is serene one dies unperturbed and even if one fails to attain higher states one will at least reach the state of the Brahma worldMonks when universal love leading to liberation of mind is ardently practiced developed unrelentingly resorted to used as ones vehicle made the foundation of ones life fully established well consolidated and perfected then these eleven blessings may be expectedMetta cetovimutti  universal love leading to liberation of mind  signifies the attainment of samadhi absorption based upon meditation on mettaSince metta liberates the mind from the bondage of hatred and anger selfishness greed and delusion it constitutes a state of liberationEvery time one practices metta for however short a period one enjoys a measure of freedom of mindMeasureless freedom of mind however is to be expected only when metta is fully developed into samadhiThe various applications of metta as indicated by the terms practiced developed etc signify a wellstructured force brought about not only by specific hours of meditation but also by converting all ones deeds words and thoughts into acts of mettaBy practiced is meant the ardent practice of metta not as a mere intellectual exercise but by committing oneself wholeheartedly to it and making it lifes guiding philosophy something which conditions ones attitudes outlook and conductBy developed is implied the various processes of inner culture and mental integration effected by the practice of meditation on universal loveSince meditation brings about unification of mind by integrating the various faculties it is called development of mindThe Buddha taught that the entire mental world is developed by the practice of meditation on universal love leading to minds liberation and the transformation of the personalityUnrelentingly resorted to emphasizes repeated practice of metta all through ones waking hours in deed word and thought and maintaining the tempo of mettaawareness throughoutRepeated action means generation of powerAll the five spiritual powers namely faith vigor mindfulness concentration and wisdom are exercised and cultivated by the repeated practice of mettaUsed as ones vehicle signifies a total commitment to the ideal of metta as the only valid method for the solution of interpersonal problems and as an instrument for spiritual growthWhen metta is the only mode of communication the only vehicle life automatically is a divine abiding as mentioned in the Metta SuttaMade the foundation of ones life is making metta the basis of ones existence in all respectsIt becomes the chief resort the haven the refuge of ones life making ones refuge in the Dhamma a realityFully established refers to a life that is firmly rooted in metta has anchorage in metta under all circumstancesWhen metta is effortlessly practiced not even by error does one violate the laws of universal loveWell consolidated means one is so habituated to metta that one remains effortlessly immersed in it both in meditation as well as in ones daytoday conductPerfected indicates a mode of completeness through total adherence and development leading to that fully integrated state in which one enjoys perfect wellbeing and spiritual felicity indicated by the passage detailing the eleven blessings of mettaThe benefits of metta are indeed great and comprehensiveFor a follower of the Buddha this is one supreme instrument that can be wielded with advantage everywhereThe subjective benefit of universal love is evident enoughThe enjoyment of wellbeing good health peace of mind radiant features and the affection and goodwill of all are indeed great blessings of life accruing from the practice of mettameditationBut what is even more wonderful is the impact which metta has on the environment and on other beings including animals and devas as the Pali scriptures and commentaries illustrate with a number of memorable storiesOnce the Buddha was returning from his almsround together with his retinue of monksAs they were nearing the prison in consideration of a handsome bribe from Devadatta the Buddhas evil and ambitious cousin the executioner let loose the fierce elephant Nalagiri which was used for the execution of criminalsAs the intoxicated elephant rushed towards the Buddha trumpeting fearfully the Buddha projected powerful thoughts of metta towards itVenerable Ananda the Buddhas attendant was so deeply concerned about the Buddhas safety that he ran in front of the Buddha to shield him but the Buddha asked him to stand aside since the projection of love itself was quite sufficientThe impact of the Buddhas mettaradiation was so immediate and overwhelming that by the time the animal neared the Buddha it was completely tamed as though a drunken wretch had suddenly become sober by the magical power of a spellThe tusker it is said bowed down in reverence in the way trained elephants do in a circusThe Visuddhimagga records the case of one landlord of Pataliputra Visakha by nameIt seems he had heard that the island of Sri Lanka was a veritable garden of Dhamma with its innumerable shrines and stupas adorning the isleAnd blessed with a favorable climate the people were highly righteous following the Teaching of the Buddha with great fervor and sincerityVisakha decided to visit Sri Lanka and spend the rest of his life there as a monkAccordingly he made over his great fortune to his wife and children and left home with a single gold coinHe stopped for some time at the port town of Tamralipi waiting for a ship and during that time engaged himself in business and made a thousand gold coinsEventually he reached Sri Lanka and went to the capital city of AnuradhapuraThere he went to the famous Mahavihara and asked the abbots permission to enter the SanghaAs he was led to the chapter house for the ordination ceremony the purse containing the thousand gold coins dropped out from under his beltWhen asked What is it he said I have a thousand gold coins sir When he was told that a monk cannot possess any money he said I dont want to possess it but I wanted to distribute it among all who come for this ceremony Accordingly he opened his purse and strewed the entire yard of the chapter house saying Let no one who has come to witness Visakhas ordination depart emptyhandedAfter spending five years with his teacher he now decided to go to the famous Cittalapabbata forest where a good number of monks with supernatural powers livedAccordingly he went to the junglemonastery of CittalapabbataOn his way he came to a fork in the road and stood wondering which way to turnSince he had been practicing mettameditation assiduously he found a certain deva living in the rock there holding out a hand pointing the road to himAfter reaching the Cittalapabbata junglemonastery he occupied one of the hutsHaving stayed there for four months as he was thinking of leaving the next morning he heard somebody weeping and when he asked Who is that the deva living in the manila tree at the end of the walkway said Venerable sir I am ManiliyaWhy are you weepingBecause you are thinking of going away from hereWhat good does my living here do youVenerable sir so long as you live here the devas and other nonhuman beings treat each other with kindnessWhen you are gone they will again start their wrangling and quarrelsWell if my living here makes all of you live at peace it is good And so he stayed on for another four monthsIt is said that when he again thought of going again the deity weptSo this Elder stayed on permanently and attained Nibbana thereSuch is the impact of mettabhavana on others even among invisible beingsThere is also the famous story of the cowIt seems that a cow was giving milk to her calf in a forestA hunter wanting to kill her flung a spear which when it struck her body bounced off like a palm leafSo mightily powerful is metta  lovingkindnessThis is not the case of one who has developed mettasamadhiIt is a simple case of the consciousness of love for the offspringIndeed the power of metta can never be told enoughThe commentaries to the Pali canon are replete with stories not only of monks but also of ordinary people who overcame various dangers including weapons and poison through the sheer strength of metta  selfless loveBut let not metta be mistaken as a mere sentimentIt is the power of the strongIf the leaders from different walks of life were to give metta a fair trial no principle or guideline to action would be found to possess greater efficiency or fruitfulness in all spheresIn everything man is the ultimate unitIf man decides to substitute metta as a policy of action for aggression and illwill the world will turn into a veritable abode of peaceFor it is only when man shall have peace within himself and boundless goodwill for others that peace in the world will become real and enduringVenAcharya Buddharakkhita is founder and president of the Maha Bodhi Society in Bangalore IndiaIn he was a member of the editorial board of the Sixth Buddhist Synod in

thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseWEBU SAYADAW There are duties towards the cetiya the Bodhi tree towards teachers parents wife and childrenIf we fulfill these we practice good conduct and this is moralityWhile we are fulfilling our duties is it not possible to practice mindfulness of breathing alsoIf we do not fulfill these duties can we say that our morality is completeIf our morality is not perfect can we expect to experience the happiness we aspire forIf we are not happy if our mind is not concentrated we cant attain insightwisdomToday is Uposatha dayAt dawn you all woke up with the thought Today is Uposatha day and you undertook to keep the eight preceptsHave you been mindful continuously since thenDISCIPLE No sir we haventS How much of this time have you spent being aware of the inbreath and outbreathD At times we are aware sir at times we are not sirS How long did your mind stay with the object and how much time did you lose As you remain silent I assume that you have been able to keep up your awareness all the timeD No sir we haventS In that case I have to ask you some more questionsHow many times does your mind dissolve in a flash of lightningD Billions and billions of times sirS So it arises and disintegrates billions of timesEvery time the mind arises it takes some object pleasant or unpleasant liked or dislikedIs there a time when this constant continuous stream of mental objects is cut off or interruptedD No sir the mind always takes an objectS Yes and these good and bad friends arise in your mind due to the skillful and unskillful deeds or kamma you have done in the pastNow if a pleasant object which we call a good friend enters the stream of consciousness what happensD Liking or greed arises sirS If liking arises is this good or badD It is bad sirS But if a bad friend an unpleasant mindobject arises what happens thenD Dislike or aversion arises sirS If we allow aversion or dislike to arise is this skillful or unskillfulD It is unskillful sirS So if we accept the agreeable mindobjects liking craving wanting and lust arise and we are creating unskillful acts which lead to the four lower planes of existenceBut if unpleasant thoughts or images arise and we take possession of them then worry grief suffering anger and aversion arise and these mental states lead to the lower planes tooNow at what time does no pleasant or unpleasant thought or image or sound or sight or taste or touch ariseD There is no such time sirThe mind always takes an objectS And all these objects arising in our minds are the results of the deeds you have done in the past in samsaraBe an object pleasant or unpleasant when it arises what do you normally doD We react unskillfully and create bad karma for ourselves sirS If a pleasant object arises in the mind liking craving wanting ariseThis craving what is it likeIs it not like a fireCraving is like a fireWhat about disliking aversion and hatredD That is also like a fire sirS So whatever arises we have to suffer the burning of fire dont weD Yes sirS But of course if greed and aversion have to arise let them ariseIf we are practicing the teachings of the Buddha can they affect usWhile we are practicing meditation on the breath greed and aversion dont get an opportunity to possess our mindsThe teachings of the Buddha resemble the great lake AnotattaIf the fires of greed or aversion or any other fires fall into this lake they are extinguished and we dont have to suffer their scorching heat any longerOnly if we know each arisal of the mind in the billions of times it arises in a splitsecond can we justly say that we have achieved real wisdom and insightMind and body arise billions of times in the wink of an eye and with it your good and bad friendsIf you are not watchful these good and bad deeds of yours will again be accumulated in you billions of timesNow who is responsible for the pleasant and unpleasant sensations that continuously arise in your bodyD We are responsible for them ourselves sirS The debts you have accumulated in the incalculably long period of samsara are with youIf you dont apply the Buddhas teachings and practice you will accumulate the same debts again and again billions of times in every splitsecondAre you able to count these debtsD No sir they are incalculableS Therefore you should apply this practice the Buddha taughtIf you dont accept what arises and disintegrates of its own accord then your accumulated debts will diminish and no new debts will be accumulatedIf you realize this arising and vanishing for yourselves then you dont make new debts and you get rid of the old onesThus you attain to the higher wisdomThis technique of being aware of inbreath and outbreath can be practiced anywhereYou can practice it while you are alone or in company while you are sitting walking standing or lying downWherever you are you can practice itNow do you have to spend money in order to practice this meditationD No sirS Do you have to take time off work to practiceD No sirS In that case what is so difficult about itWill this practice make you feel tiredD No sirS If you make great profit in your business and people ask you How much gold how much silver have you got will you tell themD No sirS And why notD One shouldnt tell others such things sirS Now which jewel is more precious gold and silver or the DhammaD The Dhamma is more precious sirS Then dont talk to others about your achievementsWhat is the time nowD Seven pm sirS How much time have you got left until sunriseD About ten hours sirS Do you think that you can practice meditation for that long without a breakWork hard to rid yourselves of your debtsThe efforts of the past and meritorious deeds performed in the past are giving their good resultsWEBU SAYADAW You have taken the preceptsNow that you have undertaken the practice of the perfection of morality fulfill itWhat you realize when you penetrate the Four Noble Truths is called Bodhi awakeningYou are born at a good time and in a good form of existenceNow then emulate the wise disciples of the Buddha and put forth effort as strong as theirs so that you may attain the awakening to which you aspiredThose who received the teachings from the Buddha himself worked ceaselessly in all four postures sitting standing lying down and walking  and thus attained enlightenmentThe human beings Devas and Brahmas who achieved their aspiration for awakening on just one occasion cannot be counted in hundreds thousands hundreds of thousands or millionsSometimes in one splitsecond an incalculably large number of beings achieved their aspirationsFrom the time the Buddha attained full awakening beings have been able to attain NibbanaBut it is not only during the lifetime of the Buddha that beings can attain NibbanaNibbana can be attained as long as the teachings of the Buddha are availableThe attainment of Nibbana is not bliss just for a brief momentIt will have lasting effects for the rest of the round of birth and death samsaraWhat the Buddha taught is the way out of sufferingYou dont have to know a vast amountIf you practice one technique properly with strong and steadfast effort you will come to know for yourselves that you are people of great strengthYou will not have to ask others about the teachings and you will not even have to tell others that you are practicingOnce you have established effort you will not only know what good teachers told you but you will clearly know for yourselves how the viriya iddhipada factor arises in a splitsecondYou do have the fortune of being able to follow the good advice of the Buddha as his disciples did in the pastWhen I increase effort then the viriya iddhipada factor will increase alsoAnd then what will happenI will think With just this much effort the viriya iddhipada factor has arisen to this extentBut my energy is not exhausted yetThere is still moreI shall increase my effort furtherAnd the will to increase effort will ariseAt this same instant effort increasesAs effort increases the viriya iddhipada factor becomes strongerWhen these factors have thus arisen to a very high standard then all your aspirations can be fulfilledDo not take restDo not take breaks or time offWork continuouslyIf you develop continuously you will become happier and happierIn this way the disciples of the Buddha became very happy never getting enough of this happinessDo you understandIf a king rules over a country does he say complacently This one country is sufficient for meDISCIPLE No sir he doesnt remain satisfiedSAYADAW And if he rules a whole continent and has become emperor is he satisfied thenD No sir he isntS If he isnt satisfied what will he doD He will try to acquire more and more territory sirS When a man is emperor over a continent he wants the whole worldWhen he gets the whole world he wants to become a universal monarchOnce he is a universal monarch will he say This is enough and be satisfiedD No sir he will not be satisfiedS All those who are perfect in their faith and have performed the highest form of generosity and demonstrated the greatest form of respect cant be satisfiedThey will practice meditation and will gradually attain the stages of absorptionOnce they are capable of entering into the states of Nibbana only this happiness will count for themNibbana is the highest and noblest form of happiness there isOne can never experience enough of the highest and noblest form of happiness it is saidAnd not only the direct disciples of the Buddha were able to achieve it if you put forth continuous effort to the same extent that the wise of old did you too will experience this highest happiness even nowThen you will know I experienced a happiness that doesnt last only for a moment or just for a lifetime but for the remainder of my time in the cycle of birth and deathAnd why did I attain this happinessBecause I was born into the right form of existence because I was born at the right time because I put forth strong effortAt any time when human beings Devas and Brahmas accepted and practiced the teachings they were successfulIn this context at any time means that whenever one undertakes this practice he obtains understandingThe time span in which the teachings of the Buddha are available is very important and special if you want to attain Nibbana you can at any timeEven now it is easyDont say This is not my cup of tea or This isnt suitable for me or I wont get anything out of this You do have noble aspirations and you can fulfill them nowSo if you say to yourselves I shall take up the practice right now dont you think you can get real understandingYou can get it practicing in a group or by yourselfSeek for yourselfTake up one of the techniques that the Buddha taught and practice it with onepointedness and strong effortEstablish awareness of the inbreath and outbreath and the spot where the air touches while breathing in and outWhen you are thus aware of the spot can there still be worry anxiety and fearCan there still be greed aversion and delusionAnd when you concentrate your mind in this way you revere the teachings dont youD Yes sirS You will understand that the degree you come out of suffering depends on how much effort you put in and on how strongly the viriya iddhipada factor arises out of this effortD We understand sirS There will be no more room for doubt because you have now practiced the technique and experienced it for yourselves and so you know itYou will think Even in such a short time I am able to come out of suffering immediately to such an extent but my strength is not yet exhausted And the will to exert still more effort arises and you will become happy with a happiness of which you will never tireNow tell meThere is such a thing as a universal monarch in the world isnt thereD Yes sir there isS When the time is right for a universal monarch to arise will no one notice this factD We dont know sirS About a hundred years before the universal monarch arises the good news goes around and a commotion arisesThen all set their hopes on the universal monarch and yearn for himThey are happy and when he is born they rejoiceWhat are the circumstances necessary for a universal monarch to ariseD Only when the jewel of the wheel arrives can someone become universal monarchS Yes before the universal monarch wheeljewel arises he is called an embryonic universal monarch but even then his authority wealth and power are considerableWill he say Let the universal wheeljewel not arise what I have got is quite enough for meD No sir he wontS And why notD Because he wants to become still greater through the arisal of the wheeljewelS So when will the wheeljewel comeD It will come at the right time sirS The wheeljewel arises due to the merit the embryonic universal monarch has accumulatedBut there are still duties for him and having understood these duties and keeping them in mind he has to fulfill themNow say there is an embryonic universal monarchHis merit is ripe but he doesnt fulfill the duties that are the final cause for his becoming a universal monarchWill the wheeljewel arise of its own accordD No sir it will not arise by itself I thinkHe will have to exercise himself furtherS Now lets say you were the embryonic universal monarch waiting for the wheeljewel to arise so that you will reign over the whole worldYou will still have to practice furtherYou have to keep preceptsBut would you say Well I dont need the wheeljewel anymoreI am quite satisfied with the riches and splendor I have attainedD No sirS You will not give up at this point because if you become a universal monarch you will be able to reign according to the Dhamma so that the whole world will be happyDo you think the people of your provinces will say to you O embryonic universal monarch you have got enough powerD No sir certainly notS So what will the people sayD Work hard and fulfill your duties they will say sirS And why thisD Because they want the wheeljewel to arise sirS Yes you see because of the power of the wheeljewel of the universal monarch all will experience many different types of happinessBut when one has become a universal monarch will this give him results for the rest of the cycle of birth and deathHow long can he be a universal monarchD Only as long as the wheeljewel is there sirS Yes even a universal monarch can be on his throne at best for one lifespanBut now the Buddhas teachings are availableIf all the good beings who have taken birth in a happy existence take up the practice of the Buddhas teachings they can attain even to awakening as they aspiredBut it is as with the embryonic universal monarch he doesnt become a universal monarch just enjoying the royal splendor that he has already achieved he will only become a universal ruler when he has fulfilled the duties and disciplines necessary to obtain the wheeljewelNow when do you want to attain NibbanaD Very soon sirS What does that meanD Now immediately sirS So you are going to obtain it right nowD If its possible sirS Well at the time you accept it you will reach itD One can get it only when the ten parami are completed sirS You still dont understandWe were talking about the embryonic universal monarch just nowHe attained that point because of his fulfilling the ten paramiThis fulfillment of the parami means that he can become a universal monarch for certainBut when will he become a universal monarchWhen he has fulfilled the practices and duties that cause the arising of the wheeljewelSo if he undertakes these the jewel will ariseNow dont you tell me you want NibbanaIf you practice now you will realize it nowWill you take up practicingBut then dont get up after some time and run awayIf you want to become a sovereign ruler what do you have to doYou have to master all the arts that are required of an accomplished prince and princessSo what do you think you have to master as sons and daughters of the BuddhaD We have to master morality concentration and wisdom sirS What do you have to do to become a kingYou have to study and practice the eighteen arts a king has to masterYou have to learn about warelephants strategy how to overcome enemies and so forthOnce you have learned all this what will you do when you encounter enemiesD Well attack them sirS There are enemies who obstruct our progress towards Nibbana and if we want to get there we have to fight themWill you fight them after having equipped yourselves with weaponsD Yes sirS You will have to sit for a long timeOnce the battle starts you will have to fight for realOnce you have deployed your troops in the battlefield you will have to go aheadOnly if you prevail will you become a kingD We shall fight sirS Good go aheadDont get up and run away even if time seems longIf you fight well you will become sovereign kingDuring the time of the Buddha people learned the teachings from the Buddha himselfThe Buddha simply taught how to defeat all forms of ignoranceDo you think that all those who listened to his words and then practiced accordingly repulsed ignoranceThey really refuted all forms of ignorance and therefore they were victoriousThey attained supreme happinessEstablish yourselves in effort and all your aspirations will be fulfilledYou are well equipped with weapons for the battle arent youD Yes sirS And you will fight wont youYour enemies do attack and they attack often and with full forceAre sloth torpor and laziness friends or foesWhat do you do when they comeI think it has been some time that you havent fought a battleD Quite some time sirS Tell me about the weapons you will have to use and how you have to fightD We have to fight for one hour every day sirS Only one hour a dayD We cant even always manage that much sirS Look hereIs this because the weapons are soft or because the warriors are softD We are soft sirS Are princes and princesses who want to become rulers soft tooD No sirThey cant be because soft princes are defeatedS But these princes here are they people with strength and fortitude or are they softD We are soft sirS As sons and daughters of the Buddha do you want to become sovereigns of Nibbana or do you want to remain princes and princessesD We all want to become rulers sirS So the weapon you have is good attackBut only if you hold the weapon properly will the enemy fear youI think you dont hold the weapon properlyD We do attack sir but our way of attack is weakOut of compassion give us a powerful weapon sirS I can only give you the weaponThis weapon will not do anything only if you take this weapon and make use of it can you winNo weapon is weak and you dont have just oneYou have a whole store of weaponsIf I were to enumerate them it would become a long listD Sir we fail because we have so many weaponsS No its because you dont fightYou have to fightDo you understandDont you want to become sovereign kingsDo you want to stay princes and princessesD We try hard sir but we never succeedS Yes yes but the weapon is fineYou dont understand because you dont fightYou are talking like mostYou meditate you put forth effort but in spite of that you sound as if there was no effortThere is so much energy in you but you dont use itYou do have energyIf you put all your stock of energy to use you will assuredly become real sons and daughters of the Buddha become kings by attaining NibbanaSons and daughters of the Buddha have the ability to accept instructions make effort and follow the teachings of the BuddhaAll who practice the teachings be they humans Devas or Brahmas can fulfill their different aspirations for NibbanaEven if you keep up the awareness of inbreath and outbreath throughout only one day you will understand muchYou may say that you have been meditating for so many years but have you really ever been able to keep your mind focused for a full dayD No sirS By one day I mean a day and a night twentyfour hoursNow do this practice the teachings of the Buddha to the full for one day and one nightIf you have done this once you will all be able to appreciate the value of just one single daySome of you may have been practicing for twenty or thirty years and some even longerBut just examine yourselvesHave you really having established yourselves in complete effort fulfilled one single day in practiceHave youD No sir we haventS And why have you never devoted yourselves fully for one whole dayYou do have the energy required dont youD Yes sirS You dont use the energy you have in the right placeYou waste it for no purposeAre you still going to shows and entertainmentsD Yes sirWe watch the pwe all night until dawn without sleepingS How many nights in a row do you do thisD About two or three nights sirS How many shows have you seen in allD I cant remember sirS You see there you have plenty of energyDay and nightThere your effort is strongNow how many times have you observed the Uposatha preceptsD Many times sirS I mean how many days have you observed the eight Uposatha precepts day and nightD We have observed them ever since we were children sirS How many days all togetherA day I call a day and a night twentyfour hoursDo you get a full day of Uposatha observances if you look at it like thisD No sir we dontWe observed them about half a day at a time sirS Have you fulfilled them to the utmost during the halfdayD We are unable to do that sirWe started this morning sir and shall keep it up until tomorrowS You do have the will to work but you dont usually use it for this noble purpose but rather to watch pweIf you die while watching a pwe where will you goD To the lower world sirS Do you want thatD No sirS Even if you dont want it it has great power over you doesnt itIf you were to really observe Uposatha with full effort for a whole day could you not then fulfill your aspirationsIf you keep up the practice for one Uposatha day you will understand you will come to know somethingThe real disciples of the Buddha take the precepts on Uposatha days and then they immediately take the object and firmly keep their attention fixed on itNow if your attention is so firmly fixed on an object can sloth torpor or laziness disturb youD No sir they cantS If your attention is firmly established on the inbreath and outbreath and the point of contact do we still hear other peoples conversationD No sirS What if someone speaks very loudlyD It doesnt disturb us sirS There is no wanting aversion or delusionIf our minds are thus purged of greed aversion and ignorance will there still be loneliness depression and lazinessD No sirS Are we still missing companyD No sirS Do we still want to know what others are sayingD No sirS If someone comes and invites us out are we excitedD No sirS We shall not jealously guard what we have gotGood people are not like thatWe share it with those with whom we live May they also get what I have got Now what will happen if all establish strong effort from sunrise to sunset without a breakThis is a long timespan from sunrise to sunsetBut will you feel it to be longD No sirS Today the time went so quicklyWe observed Uposatha and the time just flewAnd I really dont know why this day was so short And after sunset you will again establish awareness of the object and then day will break and you still continue with the awareness of the spot below the nose above the upper lip until it is lightWithout interruptionAnd you will wonder This night passed really quickly now it is day againThis is how they used to practice on Uposatha dayWhen the direct disciples of the Buddha undertook to practice for a day they practiced for twentyfour hoursAnd when day came they were still not satisfied and said In the long cycle of birth and death we have been doing all those other things for a long time but not this And they continued their work without waveringDo you have days like thisD Our days contain some interruptions sirS If someone keeps Uposatha and his mind wanders here and there  just anybody I dont mean you  so his mind flits around here and thereBut he is at a pagoda or under a holy Bodhi tree and say he dies at that momentWhat will happen to this worshiperD He will go to the lower worlds sirS How many lower planes are thereD There are four lower planes sirS What are theyD Hell the animal world the plane of the hungry ghosts and the demon worldS Now who wants to go to hell or the animal worldD I dont sirS What about the ghost world or the demon worldD I dont want to go there sirS If you take the precepts and then dont firmly put your mind to observing the teachings of the Buddha is that skilled or notD It is unskillful sirS If someone observes the Uposatha without keeping his mind focused where will he be reborn when he diesD In the lower planes of existence sirS Are you sureD Yes sir Im sureS If I talk about someone who doesnt keep his mind fixed on the object I am not talking about you people Im talking about that worshiperD Sir out of compassion show us the good road out of the lower worldsS Do you remember how you focused your mind as the Buddha taughtD Yes sir I rememberS So then let us keep the mind on the spotWhat do you thinkD Yes sirS But of course now you cant do a full day anymoreBut if you practice until it is light you will have done half a dayWhat do you thinkD We will keep our minds at the spot sirS What other things do you have to do tonightD There is nothing to do at night sirS You have eaten so you dont have to cook anymore and there is nothing else to doVery goodWill you stay here now that you have undertaken to keep UposathaWont you want to go awayD We shall do our best sirS If you say We shall do our best will there be no disturbances coming inWill no enemy attackOnly if you really mean it are the enemies afraidIf you are firm they runYou know about Mahakassapa dont youD Yes sir we have heard about himS He met the Buddha and then practiced what the Buddha taught in order to escape from sufferingThere are four bodily postures sitting standing walking and lying downWhich of these is prone to let in the enemyLaziness and sloth come in while lying down and they come to stay dont theyIf we indulge in laziness and sloth will we be able to develop in morality concentration and wisdomD No sir we wontS Laziness and torpor are our enemiesTherefore Mahakassapa rejected the one posture in which the enemy attacks and adopted the other three postures in which the enemy cant remain for longThere are thirteen ascetic practices and Mahakassapa practiced all thirteenOnly those among the disciples of the Buddha with the strongest determination practiced the sitters practice ie did not lie down for twentyfour hours a dayIf one takes up the sitters practice and makes the strong determination not to sleep this sloth and laziness cant overpower himThough these noble disciples of the Buddha neither lay down nor slept they lived long and were very healthyDo you fight warsD Yes sir we doS Now you are going to start your meditationWhat preparations do you have to makeD We have to spread out our matS If you spread out your mat before starting your meditation soon someone will come alongWho do you think that will beDo you think laziness and sleepiness will come your wayD If they come sir I shall lie down and sleepS What will you say to themD I wont say anything sirS You will say Ha now only you come Ive got the mat ready a long time ago And what are you going to do thenYou are going to lie down flat on your back and sleepIf you do this will you be able to fulfill your aspiration for NibbanaD No sirS If you practice without sleeping you are establishing full effort and are always keeping your attention firmly fixed on the object day and nightIf you practice in this way your morality your concentration and control over the mind and your insight and wisdom will become stronger and strongerThey will develop from moment to momentIf you watch at show all night you will feel tired in the morningBut if you practice the teachings of the Buddha all night you will experience happiness and joy without end and you will not feel sleepyDo you understandThis the Buddha taught  it is not my teachingIf you follow the teachings of the Buddha and dont rest until you have understood them completely you will really knowIf people tell you This shade is cool dont simply believe them but try it out for yourselvesIf you just repeat It is cool it is cool because others say so you dont really know about its coolness you merely talk about itIf someone just babbles along he doesnt show appreciationBut if someone speaks from experience then will he not be able to speak with deep appreciation and radiant happiness and loveSo pay attention and practiceIf you practice you will reach your goalNot just hundreds not thousands not ten thousands not hundreds of thousands  all who follow the teachings will master themWhen you start to meditate you still have to check Is everything arrangedIs there a place to sleep at night and to rest during the dayOnly when all this is in order will you meditate isnt it soIf you act in this way you nurture your enemy you call him a friend you love himOnce you recognize your enemy as such do you still associate with himD No sirS What do you do if he comesD We check him and defend ourselvesS How do you defend yourselvesWill you attack himWill you mount a full attackD We shall repulse him sirS How do you repulse himSoftly so that he doesnt get hurtD We shall ward him off immediately so that he cant ever come backS Yes carry onCut him off and throw him overboard so that he cant ever come backWell then what will you do when tiredness and laziness really ariseD I shall probably fall asleep sirS What about others in the audienceD I dont know sirS Will you recognize the enemy and destroy himD Just so sirS Very goodI shall give you a simileIf a man has fallen into a deep sleep and you wake him up he will wake up quicklyIf you try and wake up someone who pretends to sleep you will not be successfulWhy is this soD The more one works on him the more he pretends to be asleepS YesNow what about you are really fast asleep or do you pretend to sleepD I dont know sirS If you are really asleep you will simply get up when I wake you upWill you get upD Yes sirS Yes and after getting up you will go back to sleep I thinkBut Im not sure about thatI only think soD I shall work hard as you instruct me sirS Put forth effort and you will become perfectYou have all you needAll of you have acquired the elements of insight and renunciationBecause of this you now esteem the teachings of the Buddha you want to fulfill and practice themIf the accumulation of the perfection of renunciation is small your ears will be blocked to the teachings of the BuddhaFor instance if somebody tells you to come to this place you dont want to come because you are bored by thisBut now you are attracted by this teachingAll you need now is the same amount of effort that the noble disciples of the Buddha madeWhen you begin to practice you may worry If I sit for one or two hours I am aching and stiffHow can I possibly sit for a whole day and nightI think thats quite impossible Dont you worry like thisD No sir I dontS Though you may not worry now it will come upBut dont worry in this wayThe Buddha didnt teach sufferingHe taught the way leading to happinessYou may not believe this because you think your own thoughtsBut you have to work with full effort and without waveringNow when you meditate with full effort the viriya iddhipada factor will ariseYou will understand thisBut when you sit all of you feel some discomfort dont youD Yes sir we doS Even if you are aching and stiff there is a place where there is no painThere is sleepiness and there is also a place where there is no sleepinessWhat do you do when you are drowsyD I go to sleep sirS Do you ever get enough sleepD Yes sir I doS But you sleep every day and now want to sleep againSo you havent actually had enough yetIf you sleep every day you will never get enough sleepSo when you feel sleepy make an effort to reach the place where there is no sleepiness and then you will need no more sleepGet up and walk up and downKeep your attention at the spot where the air touches when you breathe in and outIf you keep it fixed on this spot with full effort at some time you will find the place of no sleepThere is no I shall not find it there is only a I havent got there yet You will get itIf you sleep and postpone meditation until you are rested you will wake up when it is light and there will be no time left to meditateI am just telling you what the Buddha taughtThere is nothing I knowAll the Buddha taught is trueAll of you have to make a living work toil and shoulder burdens dont youD Yes sirS So let us be simpleYou breathe dont youD Yes sir we doS So simply be aware of the inbreath the outbreath and the point below the nose where the air touchesIt goes in and out without interruption doesnt itD Yes sir thats rightS Only when your attention wanders away the continuity is brokenDont allow your attention to follow the breathYour attention should always remain with this small spotWhen you keep your attention there at the spot your respiration will become soft and subtleOnce it has become subtle you dont have to make it rough againThe Buddha didnt say that we should make the subtle roughWhen you feel the spot touching it with your finger your attention will not wander to other objectsCant you fix your attention firmly on the spot with the breathingD I can sirS Will greed aversion and delusion still arise when your attention is focused on the spotWhen you are well concentrated even for a short moment your mind is cleansed of greed aversion and delusion for that short momentCant you keep your attention fixed on the spot for a longer timespanD Yes sir I canS So make a strong effort and keep your attention thereIf you keep it there is there any drowsiness or laziness disturbing youD They dont come up sirS But what will happen if you reduce your effortD Laziness will come in sirS Sloth and laziness will come and your concentration will become weakThis is because youre at the beginning later it will improveIf you view this laziness as a friend not as an enemy you will get used to itThough it comes you will not get lazy anymoreWhen we feel sleepy we say This is goodNow I want to find the place where one doesnt feel sleepy quicklyThen there will an end to sleeping Work fix your attention firmly on the spot as I just instructed you and when your limbs ache know The only way out of this is to get to a place where there is no pain Now if the discomfort becomes very intense is it too difficult thenIt is not difficultDont worry about all thisSimply keep your attention on the spotPut it back on the spotDont allow it to go awayIf it runs away you will never get to the place I just told you aboutThough we cant avoid being offered food and having to eat it dont you think that we can keep our attention at the spot and eatDo you think you will pass comments like Too much salt too little salt about the food that your wife daughter granddaughter brought from homeD I wouldnt comment sirS Do you think you would even notice that the food has too much saltD No sirS WhyBecause you are aware of something far better so you dont notice their foodIf you get upset and angry about food even though you are observing the eight precepts and you die at that moment of anger where will you goD To the lower worlds sirS If you work with proper effort not just superficially will you even know whether the food tastes good or notD No sirS Keep your mind steadfastly focused on the spotYour daily work neednt sufferIt doesnt cost you anythingOthers wont know about itWill you practice the sitters practice tonightKeep your attention on the spot and you will find it very easyIf you feel drowsy of if you are aching say Good it has come early and then concentrate still harder on the spotIf you reach the goal before drowsiness and discomfort come up so much the betterIf these disturbances dont manifest dont stop working thinking If they dont even come up now there is no need to work to get to a place where they dont exist Just keep workingWill you undertake the sitters practiceOr will you when sleepiness and tiredness set in change to another postures and reduce your effortD We wont reduce our effort sirS All of you or just a few among youD All of us sirS So if you keep each other company so much the betterNow then undertake to carry out the sitters practiceMake it a firm vowYou may think It wasnt right that we just gave in to sleepiness in the past Well now you have undertaken the sitters practice and I think it is for the first timeD Yes sir the first timeS This is the weaponWith this weapon you can fight your battleWith this weapon you will be victoriousIf you fight with a pillow as a weapon you cannot winI shall tell you a story you probably already knowAt the time of the Buddha there was a rich lady who owned a big estateWhen she became old she distributed the inheritance amongst he childrenBut the children after receiving the money didnt care for their mother anymoreShe was not treated well in the houses of her sons and daughters and she was in distressWhen she was about eighty or ninety years old the neighbors had her ordained as a nun as they couldnt bear to see her poverty and sufferingWhen the nuns of her nunnery were invited for alms food to a house one day they all wentOnly Sona Theri our old woman had to stay back because she was too old to go alongBefore they left the nunnery they said to Sona Theri You are very old you cant come with usBut fill the water pots for drinking water and those for washing hands and feet so that everything is ready when we return and also prepare some hot waterBut this nun was very oldTo carry the water she had to use a small pot and as she was working away she got very tiredBut she didnt restShe forced herself to do what she had been ordered to doBecause she overworked herself she fell down between the water pots and couldnt lift herself up anymoreShe didnt pretend she was exhausted from carrying waterShe had been given the teachings of the BuddhaSo she thought Well I cant fill the pots anymoreThere is more water to be carried and I havent prepared any hot water yet eitherBut I cant even get upI will take up an object of meditation given by the Buddha And she started meditating as we didShe fixed her attention firmly on the spotShe focused her attention so that it stayed there whatever happenedThats allAnd as she was meditating with strong effort she did what had to be done and made an end to sufferingOf course she was full of the bliss of emancipationWhen the others came back they couldnt find herThey said Where could this old nun have gone and they looked all over the nunneryEventually they found her lying between the water pots and they all gathered around and abused herNow what about our ordersShe didnt fill the pots and theres no hot water eitherShe is so lazy that she just lies down and sleepsBut the old nun was absorbed in blissThe other nuns were worldlings of course and they stood there blaming herLook how lazy she isNo water pot is full no hot waterJust lying aroundYou too can talk like that cant youIts not pleasant talkBut this nun was an arahantShe had attained Arahatship along with the supernatural powersShe said All you desire will be doneThere will be water in the pots and there will be hot water too And after saying this she made a strong determination and the water pots were filled to the brim and the hot water was boiling overThis nun was very old and in exhaustion she fell down and could not get up againShe practiced as you are doing nowDo you hear thisHow long will it take you to reach the goal you who are healthy and strongD We shall work hardS Will you still say Oh we are old we cant practice anymoreSona Theri was eighty or ninety years old and she still carried water as she had been toldWhen she fell down in exhaustion she just meditatedThe disciples of the Buddha attained the goal because their power of effort was greatYou have the teachings the techniqueAll you need now is effortAnd why do you need effortBecause during meditation the enemies will come to disturb youKeep your attention on this small spotIf your limbs ache work that you reach the state where there is no achingWhen you are drowsy work that you reach the state where there is no drowsinessGood goodEstablish effort and meditate work to make an end to all sufferingWEBU SAYADAW Be perfect in the practice of moralityOnly if your practice is perfect will all your aspirations of the present time and of the future be fulfilled without exceptionBecause this is true the aspirations of the good people of the past who practiced and strove were fulfilled completelyYou too have to take up the practice of that morality that brought about their happinessWork hard and perfect yourselves in itBeing perfect in morality keep your mind straight and practice charity as it pleases you giving your possessions yourselves with sincerity to those who are worthyApproach and give your gifts and your respect to the peerless Buddha and his teachings keeping in mind your aspiration for awakening NibbanaThis type of aspiration is called right aspirationWhat you realize when you penetrate the Four Noble Truths is called Bodhi awakeningThere are different types of Bodhi Sammasambodhi Paccekabodhi and SavakabodhiThere are different types of Arahatship Aggasavaka Mahasavaka PakatisavakaYou have always to keep in mind your aspirations for Nibbana the highest goalAspirations thus formed are well formedAfter having perfected yourself according to your aspiration enter NibbanaThe noble persons who have attained Nibbana are innumerableWhy could they bring their various aspirations for Bodhi to fruitionBecause they had been born into the right form of existence at the right time and because they exerted proper effortWhen is the time when these aspirations can be brought to fruitionFrom the moment the Buddha attained awakening many human beings Devas and Brahmas came to the Buddha to pay respect and to show their devotionBut no human being no Deva and no Brahma was satisfied by merely being in the presence of the Buddha and having the opportunity to pay respectThe Buddha observed them through his minds eye and taught them the truth which he had penetrated through his own superknowledge his omniscienceAs soon as they received the instructions of the Buddha they began to practice to exert themselves with unwavering energy in all the four postures of the bodyThis effort that is continuous without break or pause and full of joy is called good effortWhen their effort was perfect and equal to the effort of the wise of old they arrived at their goal in due time and all the aspirations of their hearts came to an endBecause they had achieved this state they were exceedingly happy and blissfulWhat was the nature of their happiness their blissIt was not happiness or bliss that lasted for only a moment or a single life time it was that happiness that is so great that it is able to last for the remainder of samsaraEven if you are born in the human plane for only one life you are able to rise above the suffering of the cycle of birth and deathIn this way happiness and bliss come to youWhen one has attained this happiness when one has received the sign of bliss when one has reached the goal there is no jealous guarding of a secretNo one will want all human beings Devas and Brahmas to attain this bliss and happinessAs he knows for himself how to attain this happiness his acts of body speech and mind will always be in harmony with the cause of attaining NibbanaHe will act with joy as his baseHow could so many human beings Devas and Brahmas attain such high states of blissOnly because they knew that they were going to bring the aspirations of their heart to fruitionWhat are the things that support the Buddhas teachingsThey are the donation of shelter robes alms food and medicine for the monksHaving understood this they practiced itWith these four requisites the wise supported the teachings of the BuddhaWhile they supported the teachings of the Buddha by donating the four requisites many human beings Devas and Brahmas received the instructions of the BuddhaThey were endowed with the ability to understand and follow the instructions and they practiced with a joyful mind without taking rest like the wise of oldWhen they thus practiced they attained their goal without delayIn just one moment innumerable human beings Devas and Brahmas fulfilled the wish of their heartsThe energetic people saw this and supported the teachings of the Buddha and established them in a very short timeBut they didnt do only this this didnt satisfy them yetIn order to strengthen and make firm the teachings they would also meditateSo they were full of good volition and they were accordingly endowed with unwavering effort and faithSince the time of the Buddha there have been such noble people who supported and carried out the Buddhas teachings with supreme effort and ever since the days of the Buddha human beings Devas and Brahmas have been attaining NibbanaThe number of those who have reached the goal in just a short moment cant be reckoned let alone the number of all who have attained NibbanaNow the good time for all the various noble people has comeThis is so because the time when a Buddha and his teachings blossom is the good timeThe existences of human beings Devas and all the happy abodes are goodHaving been born into one of these people accepted the teachings and as you are doing now practiced with full effort and arrived at the goalAfter his awakening the Buddha first honored the city of Rajagaha with his presenceThe king of this great city Bimbisara came to the Buddha and because he received the teachings and followed them he attained the goalHe was full of blissHe wanted others to attain the same bliss and understanding the reason the cause of his happiness he donated the four requisitesHe did this so that his mother father grandmother and grandfather could fulfill their aspirations completelyThe Buddha out of his great compassion dwelt in the kings delightful gardenHumans Devas and Brahmas came to revere him there and with great compassion he taught them what he had realized himselfIn just one short moment innumerable humans Devas and Brahmas achieved their aspirationsAnd after this it went on and onThe good time for all the people with noble aspirations had comeThe time at which there is a Buddha or his teaching is the good timeHuman life the life as Deva or Brahma is a good lifeGood effort is called the effort that is established after one has received the teachingsAnd what are the Buddhas teachingsWhat is contained in the Tipitaka and is preached and explained by noble disciples out of lovingkindness and compassion are the Buddhas teachingsThey are very extensive profound and difficult to understandThough they are extensive profound and difficult to understand they really boil down to just one thing the way of escape from sufferingThey are expounded by the wise in short and in full as time permits and everyone has knowledge of them according to his capacityYou all have some understanding of the Tipitaka in accordance with your capabilitiesIf you were to talk about what you know it would never endBut you have to establish strong effort and focus your mind on one object and keep out all other objectsWhen you fix your mind on one object exclusively with strong and stable effort then you will be established in the teachingsIsnt that soU BA KHIN Yes sirSAYADAW To establish your attention thus is effortWhen you fix your attention on one object and no other object enters your mind and your attention is stable you reach viriya iddhipada the basis of attaining perfection by effortBecause the teachings are so extensive you may think it tiresome to practice themThat is why I instruct you in this way that you can reach the goal quicklyWhat happens to the causes of suffering  greed aversion and delusion  when you control your mind in this wayU They are cut out and become quietS People write and preach a lot about greed aversion and delusion dont theyWhen they debate they talk only to win the debate whomever they are talking toBut if they establish awareness of breathing and make their minds stable they acquire real meritWhy dont we try to do thisU Yes sirS Will there be worry fear and greed at that timeU There wont beS No there wont there wont be any worry fear and greedIf there is worry fear and greed are you happy or unhappyU Unhappy sirS And if there is no worry fear and greedU Then one is happyS If one establishes effort only for one splitsecond the viriya iddhipada arisesIt excludes worry fear and greed and there is happinessThere are types of happiness which are not related to the happiness achieved through the Buddhas teachings but people still call them happinessWhat sort of happiness am I talking aboutI am talking about the happiness of becoming a human being or Deva of becoming a king a rich man a universal emperor a Deva king a Sakka or a BrahmaOf course their enjoyment is also called happinessBut let me give you an exampleIf you were asked to bear the golden royal insignia and live in the golden palace of a country that abounded with gold silver gems rice water and paddy that was plentiful in everything would you accept this offer or notU Of course I would acceptS Of course you would acceptThis country is so rich that there is absolutely nothing missingSo you would live wearing your crown in your golden palace smiling all the timeSo I think smiling like that all the time you would enjoy yourself you would be happy wouldnt youWould this happiness keep worry fear and greed awayU No it wouldntS Oh reallyU It wouldnt sirS I mean at that moment you seeU It wouldntS Why are they all smiling and happy thenU Somebody could try to usurp the kingdomIf something happens in his territory he would have duties to fulfillS There is nothing like thatThis country is so good that there is no danger or worry of that kindIt is a very peaceful countryThere is no problem at all everything is calm and quietThere are no troubles at all you just have to live in the golden palace wearing your crownSo simply live there with your ministers troops concubines and wivesYou live always with a smile on your faceWill worry fear greed and anxiety be kept a bay in these circumstancesYou are always smiling and happySo do you think there is no worryU There will be sirU Because there is the fear of deathS Yes there will still be the fear of deathBut you are smiling stillWhat is this smilingWhat about greed aversion and delusionU They wont be kept awayS Even smiles wont keep them awayU No sirS What do smiles meanU They indicate that the object of mind is greedS ReallyIs one happy if there is greedU No sirS Is greed cool and pleasantU No it isntS Is it skillful or unskillfulU It is unskillfulS Are you happy when you are smiling as we just saidU No sirS But you are smiling great smiles arent you but you arent happy yetYou are king arent youMaybe you arent happy because you rule only one countryIll give you another oneSoU Even then I wont be any happierS Are you going to tell me that you dont want another countryU No sir I would take itS You would take it but still not be happyWell I wont give you just another country Ill give you the whole continentWill you tell me that you dont want itU No sirS So you will be happier thenU I wont be happierS ReallyOK I wont give you just another continent but the whole planet and the wheeljewel of the universal monarchNow there wont be any worry or fearWith the turning of the wheeljewel you will become universal monarchWill you be happy nowU I wont sirS Will you feel calm and coolU I wontS Why not discipleU There is still the burning of greed aversion and delusion in my mindS Oh is it still thereU Its still thereS So you arent happy yetNow what about Sakka the Brahmas and the Deva kingsU The same applies to them alsoS We said they were happy and now you tell me the contraryU The objects of their minds are greed aversion and delusionS Oh reallyLet it beIf one lives to a ripe old age always smiling and then dies smilingly will he find peace in the cycle of births and deathsU We wont find peaceS Where will this smiling fellow goU When the karma of this smiling person comes to an end his fate will turnS Yes and where will this smiling fellow end upU With his smiling the mind will be controlled by greed and be destined for the lower worldsS Oh really I thought that being happy was good disciplesIs it not goodI have to ask you Is it goodU No it isntS OK we are not happy yetBut when I asked whether we would be happy later on you said noThere was no peace you saidU There is no peaceS

six qualities of the Dhamma akaliko is one isnt itWhat does akaliko meanU ImmediatenessS Immediateness means that as soon as you fix your attention the results comeSo if you establish effort with

placeU It isnt necessaryS YesAll by yourself without any helpU Its possibleS And in a crowdIf you go outside the pagoda it wont be possible I thinkIt is easy isnt itThe Buddha the allcompassionate and omniscient taught many humans Devas and Brahmas the knowledge he had attained through penetrating the truth himselfThese beings full of confidence after receiving the teachings were able to fulfill their aspirationsAs you establish awareness you should establish continuous effortThere are many different types of peopleSome are good at reciting or reading or preaching or explainingI have no doubt about you disciples with whomever you compete you will winU Yes sirS Yes though they are victorious in their talk will they achieve anything if they dont practiceS So whats the difficultyTalking is tiresome isnt itAll we have to do is to make efforts to bring to fruition the aspirations we have made and work as the wise of old didUnderstanding that we have to take up this work our minds will be focusedYou are very busyYou may say We will practice later when we are free Does this thought come up stillU It doesS Sometimes the mind is like thatBut I think you dont actually say soU Maybe sirS You even speak your mindS Well if you want to say this never mindBut for the future cant you burn these impurities outYou do have the teachings of the Buddha and when this happens to you get rid of

has acquired proficiency in this it isnt difficult anymoreS He says that it is not possible after all to simply focus hereJust put your attention hereThats allWell isnt it that easyU It is easy sirS It is ever so easyThe Buddha is incomparableHe accumulated virtues without ever restingHe completed his parami on his own working for the welfare of allDidnt heU Yes he didS And because he could complete them it is easy for us now isnt itIt is easyHow is it todayYou have to raise yourself happily and complete your work and then in accordance with your aspirations you simply take the bliss you desireIt is ever so easyDont be modestDont allow yourselves to think This is not possible for me This is not suitable for me This is not proper for us This is not for me Aim at what you desireYou will get itIsnt this soU YesIt is sirS In the days of the Buddha too humans Devas and Brahmas came to the Buddha worshiped him and after they received his teachings they achieved everything they completed all their different aspirations didnt theyU They didS Isnt it possible to fulfill your aspiration by establishing unwavering effort while you are a kingCan you count the names of the kings who attained complete understanding of the DhammaU They are without number sirS Many wealthy people made efforts and attained understanding while continuing their work in business didnt theyU They didS Isnt this possibleU It is sirS Can you count such wealthy people in numbersU No sirS What about people who were neither kings nor rich peopleU They are innumerableS Didnt all those who received the teachings and followed them assiduously fulfill their wishesU They didS Humans and devas all of them lay discipleWhat about now lay discipleThe period of time is the same the occasion is the same the plane of existence is the sameIf we simply establish our effort and take the teachings do we still have to choose certain times to practiceU There is no need for thatU That is correct sirS YesThe time and the form of existence is rightYou can achieve your aspirations at the time you wish toCant youU Thats right sirS YesDo you understandBefore they didnt practice because they were busyHow is it with this Ill practice when Im freeDo we still have to set times like thisU It is not necessary to set aside certain timesS What happens if we practice only when we are freeIf we stop the practice then we wont attain what we ought to attainBut now we get these jobs done and what elseWe also fulfill our aspirationsWe get two things done at the same timeDont we lay disciplesWhat is better to get one thing done or to get two things done at the same timeU It is better to get two things done sirS You see its worth keeping yourself busyBut even though I say that its working keeping yourself busy dont start to enjoy simply being busyIf you want to realize the teachings dont just keep running all the timeIf you establish effort at the same time the viriya iddhipada factor will ariseMake yourselves firm in thisIf you say that you want to do this work but still distract yourselves here and there your progress will be slow but if you establish this awareness and keep it up happily then you will make progressWhat about this work that you cant avoid having to doU We will also make progress with thatS Yes lay disciplesOne doesnt only get the results of this noble work but much moreWhat I say is what the Buddha preachedIm not adding anythingNow you are all people of great effort arent youBut I just wanted to warn youWhat I just mentioned can happen at timesWhen you get some holidays you decide to come here and meditate for a few daysThen you have to go back to work and dont get time off anymoreYou dont come backDoes this happen sometimesU It does happenS Then you abandon the meditation dont youDont abandon itCarry on with this awareness and at the same time do your workThen you get two in one go you get twoIf you postpone being aware to your hours of leisure you get only one benefitYou are not fulfilling aspirations which are ordinary are youYou can attain to the highest and noblest blissNow what are these aspirations you are going to fulfillThere are the different forms of BodhiBodhi means the penetrating understanding of the Four Noble TruthsIf you establish effort saying that you want to get it you can fulfill all your different aspirations for Bodhi right nowThis is not ordinaryAnd how are you going to fulfill themEach type of Bodhi has to be fulfilled in its own way Sammasambodhi as Sammasambodhi Paccekabodhi as PaccekabodhiOnly if we understand in this way do we understand correctlyIt is like planting a mature seed when it rains a plant springs upHere this plant is nursed well and when you go back it is deep rooted and strongIs it possible to explain how good this period this time isIt is so easy now lay disciplesHow is it is this a time when one is oppressed by worries and has to groan and moanU No sirS Is it a time when we can only stare resignedlyU No sirS It is a time in which we can be happy and blissful immediately and never get enough of this joyYou get even more than you wanted you get even more than you aspired for dont you discipleU Yes sirS Oh yesYou never get tired not in the present and not in the remainder of samsaraWhat are the teachings of the BuddhaThere is nothing that causes stress and misery in the teachingsIs thereThere isntIt is pure happinessBut the mind may get confused with many thoughts and I dont think that these thoughts are very pertinentNow if you determine to establish this practice then I dont think that thoughts of doubt will remain at the back of your mindCan you not be successful in this wayThe mind will think what it willsLet itFollow the teachings do you understandWhen you arrive at the goal you will probably find that it isnt the way you expected it to beDoesnt this happen to peopleU It happened many times sirS Yes it will happenDear lay disciples I am telling you only a littleThose amongst you who work hard will think This monk is reluctant to tell us all he is probably very unwilling to part with his knowledge You will think This is much greater When you strive for real happiness and because of this arrive at the goal then you experience something that you cannot describe with wordsWhen you decide Ill strive so that I will know for myself then dont procrastinateDont delayDo you hearThis is so highIt is so good lay disciplesWork hard do you understandYou are all people of great effort arent youU Almost all are sirS Yes good goodWork hard wont youYou see when you yourselves arrive at the goal  and for many of you even before that time  you can give this happiness to othersYou will never feel reluctant to giveYou will want to give a great deal of it a great dealU This is true sirIn the course we are conducting now there are three or four students who after about three days of being here cry with great sobs because they regret not having come here earlierS Yes it is like thatU They think I should have come earlierS Yes this happensWork hard in order to attain the highestThis is the perfect placeU It is a place to which you gave your blessings venerable SayadawS This is a nucleusIt is the first center of manyDo you hear meMay this happiness spread slowly out from this placeYes yes you must work hard strive diligentlyWorking means that you must meditate and then at times you want to take restDoes this also happen to you hereU It doesnt sirS It doesntU If the students start to meditate at they come out of their meditation cells only at pmAt the beginning they do take breaks but after two or three days they dont come out for breaks anymoreS Yes you seeIts like thatThe highest bliss cannot be described in wordsBut the mind is like a magicianThough one may be meditating here like this calmly negative thoughts may arise Oh it is so tiring to meditate how can I achieve anythingI cannot do it Isnt that soU It is just as you say sirThey do think in that wayS Yes your mind may be cheating you but after having established right effort there is no cheating yourselfOr is it still possibleU No sir it isntS Only before you really know can you cheat yourselfU Yes sirS Even so you may be saying to yourself that you are meditating too longSo now take restThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseFor centuries people have stood in awe of the Buddha and his attainments and have strived to express their feelings in stone and bronze and with brush and inkSome have been moved by what the Buddha said its logical consistency its scope and its humanismOthers have been inspired by the personality of the Lord himself his manner and conduct and even his physical formThe joyful faith and appreciation that is evoked on recollecting the Buddhas personality and singing his praise gives such people the strength they need to walk the PathFor them the Dhamma comes alive through the life and example of the BuddhaSuch a person was the poet MatrcetaHe was born in India in about the first century AD and was converted from Hinduism to Buddhism by the great philosopher AryadevaHe wrote about a dozen works some of such beauty that he came to be regarded as one of Indias greatest poetsItsing the Chinese pilgrim who traveled through India in the seventh century AD says of Matrcetas poemsItsing also recounts a beautiful legend that was told about the poet indicating his wide popularityOther than these few scraps of information we know nothing of Matrceta and today his name is remembered only for its association with his greatest work the SatapañcasatkaThe name Satapañcasatka literally means Hymn in a Hundred and Fifty Verses although there are actually a hundred and fiftytwo or in some versions a hundred and fiftythree verses in the workIt lies very much within the bhakti or devotional genre of Indian literature but is refreshingly free from the florid style that so often characterizes such worksShackletonBailey notes that the style of the Hymn is simple and direct free from swollen compounds and elaborate conceits Warder says that the restraint of these verses is that of complete mastery of the medium able to express rich meaning with a few carefully chosen words and without the support of outward display He goes on to say that the verses are handled with a kind of reticence suggestive of the poets humility and detachment both of which are probably sincere Certainly all who are familiar with the Hymn in its original Sanskrit acknowledge the great beauty of both its language and meaningIn ancient India numerous commentaries were written on the HymnIt was popular with the followers of all schools of Buddhism and was translated into several different languagesTaranatha the great Tibetan historian says the Hymn had an important part to play in the spread of Buddhism outside India and should it become as well known as it once was it may continue to create an interest in the Buddha and his teachingsCenturies before Matrceta the householder Upali was so inspired by the Buddhas presence that he too composed a hymn of praiseWhen asked why he had done so he repliedThere can be no doubt that Matrcetas hymn likewise is an expression of a deep devotion to the Buddha and an admiration of his qualitiesBut quite apart from the authors motive in writing it the value and indeed the purpose of the Hymn to the Buddha is twofoldFirst it is meant to awaken our faithMatrceta recognized as did the Lord himself that faith has the power to arouse a tremendous amount of positive zeal and energyLong before we have directly experienced it faith keeps our eyes fixed firmly on the goalWhen we stumble and fall faith picks us up when doubt causes us to falter it urges us on and when we get sidetracked it brings us back to the PathWithout faith in the Buddha and the efficacy of his Dharma we would never even bother to try to put the teachings into practiceAs Nagarjuna saysOne associates with the Dharma out of faith but one knows truly out of understanding understanding is the chief of the two but faith precedesThe Buddhas qualities are worthy of respect in themselves but when they are described so fully and so beautifully in verses like those of Matrceta our faith can only be strengthened and growThe other purpose of the Hymn is to urge us into actionMatrceta highlights the Buddhas gentleness his nonretaliation his patience and his other qualities knowing that when we have a deep admiration for someone it is natural to try to emulate himOne feels that he used his poetic skills to the full in the hope that we would be inspired enough to make the Buddha our model and follow his exampleWhen we read that the Buddha extended the hand of friendship to all without exception we feel we should try to do the sameOn being reminded that the Buddha endured abuse and hardship without complaint we find the strength to be a little more forbearingWhen brooding over our imperfections casts us down nothing fills us with new determination and vigor more than calling to mind the Buddhas attainmentsThe receptive mind will transform admiration into actionThe Hymn may have another value as well as an aid to meditationIn concentration meditation thoughts are silenced in mindfulness meditation they are observed with detachment but in recollection meditation thoughts are directed to a specific subject which is then carefully pondered uponThe Buddha says Monks whatever a monk ponders on and thinks about often the mind in consequence gets a leaning in that way and this is certainly trueAny type of thought that is prominent in our mind will have an influence upon our personality and behaviorTo consciously and intentionally think positive thoughts will in time allow such thoughts to arise quite naturally and from that will spring deeds associated with such positive thoughtsIn practicing the Recollection of the Buddha Buddhanussati one sits silently and having made the mind receptive thinks about the Buddhas many deeds and qualitiesIn time faith and devotion both of which are important spiritual faculties begin to gain in strength thus adding energy and even fervor to our practiceThose who do this meditation usually either read or recite the wellknown Itipi so formula to help guide their thoughtsBut they may find that reading extracts from the Hymn to the Buddha can be used together with this formula or at times as a substitute for it with very positive resultsDRShackletonBailey has done a complete English translation of the Hymn to the Buddha and Edward Conze has translated parts of itBoth these translations are literal and scholarly but do not give sufficient regard to the spirit of the work and the authors intention in writing it  to inspire and to upliftBy reworking these two translations and occasionally referring to the Sanskrit text with the help of my friend VenHippola Paññakithi I have attempted to produce a readable rendering of this beautiful and important workThose interested in a scholarly version of the Hymn are advised to read ShackletonBaileys translation with its copious notes on language manuscript variations and textual

Sammaditthi Sutta the Discourse on Right View is the ninth sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya the Collection of Middle Length DiscoursesIts expositor is the Venerable Sariputta Thera the Buddhas chief disciple and the foremost of the Masters bhikkhu disciples in the exercise of the faculty of wisdomThe Buddha declared that next to himself it was the Venerable Sariputta who excelled in turning the incomparable Wheel of the Dhamma in expounding in depth and in detail the Four Noble Truths realized with the attainment of enlightenmentIn the Sammaditthi Sutta the great disciple bears ample testimony to the Buddhas words of praise bequeathing upon us a discourse that has served as a primer of Buddhist doctrine for generations of monks in the monasteries of South and Southeast AsiaAs its title suggests the subject of the Sammaditthi Sutta is right viewThe analysis of right view undertaken in the sutta brings us to the very core of the Dhamma since right view constitutes the correct understanding of the central teachings of the Buddha the teachings which confer upon the Buddhas doctrine its own unique and distinctive stampThough the practice of right mindfulness has rightly been extolled as the crest jewel of the Buddhas teaching it cannot be stressed strongly enough that the practice of mindfulness or any other approach to meditation only becomes an effective instrument of liberation to the extent that it is founded upon and guided by right viewHence to confirm the importance of right view the Buddha places it at the very beginning of the Noble Eightfold PathElsewhere in the Suttas the Buddha calls right view the forerunner of the path which gives direction and efficacy to the other seven path factorsRight view as explained in the commentary to the Sammaditthi Sutta has a variety of aspects but it might best be considered as twofold conceptual right view which is the intellectual grasp of the principles enunciated in the Buddhas teaching and experiential right view which is the wisdom that arises by direct penetration of the teachingConceptual right view also called the right view in conformity with the truths is a correct conceptual understanding of the Dhamma arrived at by study of the Buddhas teachings and deep examination of their meaningSuch understanding though conceptual rather than experiential is not dry and sterileWhen rooted in faith in the Triple Gem and driven by a keen aspiration to realize the truth embedded in the formulated principles of the Dhamma it serves as a critical phase in the development of wisdom for it provides the germ out of which experiential right view gradually evolvesExperiential right view is the penetration of the truth of the teaching in ones own immediate experienceThus it is also called right view that penetrates the truthsThis type of right view is aroused by the practice of insight meditation guided by a correct conceptual understanding of the DhammaTo arrive at direct penetration one must begin with a correct conceptual grasp of the teaching and transform that grasp from intellectual comprehension to direct perception by cultivating the threefold training in morality concentration and wisdomIf conceptual right view can be compared to a hand a hand that grasps the truth by way of concepts then experiential right view can be compared to an eye  the eye of wisdom that sees directly into the true nature of existence ordinarily hidden from us by our greed aversion and delusionThe Discourse on Right View is intended to elucidate the principles that are to be comprehended by conceptual right view and penetrated by experiential right viewThe Venerable Sariputta expounds these principles under sixteen headings the wholesome and the unwholesome the four nutriments of life the Four Noble Truths the twelve factors of dependent arising and the taints as the condition for ignoranceIt will be noted that from the second section to the end of the sutta all the expositions are framed in accordance with the same structure which reveals the principle of conditionality as the scaffolding for the entire teachingEach phenomenon to be comprehended by right view is expounded in terms of its individual nature its arising its cessation and the way leading to its cessationThe grasp of this principle thus makes it clear that any entity taken for examination is not an isolated occurrence with its being locked up in itself but part of a web of conditionally arisen processes that can be terminated by understanding and eliminating the cause that gives it beingThe right view arrived at by penetrating any of the sixteen subjects expounded in the sutta is discussed in terms of two aspects both aspects of supramundane penetrationThe first is the initial penetration of the supramundane path that transforms a person from a worldling into a streamenterer a noble disciple who has entered irreversibly upon the stream to liberationThis aspect of right view is indicated by the words that open each section  who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true Dhamma These qualities are attributes only of the streamenterer and those of higher attainment along the pathThe description thus applies to the trainee the disciple who has entered the path but has not yet reached its endThe words signify right view as a transformative vision which has revealed the ultimate truths underlying our existence but which must still be developed further to complete the full transformation it is capable of effectingThe second aspect of supramundane right view is indicated by the closing words of each section from he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust to he here and now makes an end of suffering This description is fully applicable only to the arahant the liberated one and thus indicates that the right view conceptually grasped by the wise worldling and transformed into direct perception with the attainment of streamentry reaches its consummation with the arrival at the teachings final goal the attainment of complete emancipation from sufferingThe translation of the Sammaditthi Sutta and its commentary presented here has been adapted from manuscripts left behind by Bhikkhu anamoliThe translation of the sutta has been adapted from Venanamolis complete translation of the Majjhima NikayaThe version used has been taken from the edition of the complete Majjhima Nikaya translation that I prepared for publication by Wisdom Publications in the United StatesThis version tentatively scheduled for release in late employs extensive substitution of Venanamolis own technical terminology with my own preferred renderings of Pali doctrinal termsThe commentary to the Sammaditthi Sutta is from the Papañcasudani Acariya Buddhaghosas complete commentary to the Majjhima NikayaThe translation of the commentary has also been adapted from a rendering by Venanamoli contained in a notebook of his that was discovered only a few years ago at Island HermitageThe terminology used in the notebook version suggests that it was one of Venanamolis earliest attempts at translation from the Pali it certainly preceded his translation of the Visuddhimagga The Path of Purification first completed at the end ofIn adapting the translation I have naturally replaced the technical terminology used in the notebook version with that used in the suttaIn places I also decided to translate directly from the Pali text rather than adhere to Venanamolis rendering which sometimes tended to be literal to the point of awkwardnessA few passages from the commentary that are concerned solely with linguistic clarification have been omitted from the translationPassages in the commentarial section enclosed in square brackets are taken from the subcommentary to the Sammaditthi Sutta by Acariya DhammapalaPassages in parenthesis are additions either by Venanamoli or by myselfThe paragraph numbering of the commentarial section follows that of the suttaThe phrases of the sutta that are selected for comment have been set in boldfaceThe backnotes are entirely my ownBhikkhu BodhiThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThere the Venerable Sariputta addressed the bhikkhus thus Friends bhikkhus  Friend they repliedThe Venerable Sariputta said thisOne of right view one of right view is said friendsIn what way is a noble disciple one of right view whose view is straight who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true DhammaIndeed friend we would come from far away to learn from the Venerable Sariputta the meaning of this statementIt would be good if the Venerable Sariputta would explain the meaning of this statementHaving heard it from him the bhikkhus will remember itThen friends listen and attend closely to what I shall sayYes friend the bhikkhus repliedThe Venerable Sariputta said thisWhen friends a noble disciple understands the unwholesome the root of the unwholesome the wholesome and the root of the wholesome in that way he is one of right view whose view is straight who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true DhammaAnd what friends is the unwholesome what is the root of the unwholesome what is the wholesome what is the root of the wholesomeKilling living beings is unwholesome taking what is not given is unwholesome misconduct in sensual pleasures is unwholesome false speech is unwholesome malicious speech is unwholesome harsh speech is unwholesome gossip is unwholesome covetousness is unwholesome ill will is unwholesome wrong view is unwholesomeThis is called the unwholesomeAnd what is the root of the unwholesomeGreed is a root of the unwholesome hate is a root of the unwholesome delusion is a root of the unwholesomeThis is called the root of the unwholesomeAnd what is the wholesomeAbstention from killing living beings is wholesome abstention from taking what is not given is wholesome abstention from misconduct in sensual pleasures is wholesome abstention from false speech is wholesome abstention from malicious speech is wholesome abstention from harsh speech is wholesome abstention from gossip is wholesome noncovetousness is wholesome nonill will is wholesome right view is wholesomeThis is called the wholesomeAnd what is the root of the wholesomeNongreed is a root of the wholesome nonhate is a root of the wholesome nondelusion is a root of the wholesomeThis is called the root of the wholesomeWhen a noble disciple has thus understood the unwholesome the root of the unwholesome the wholesome and the root of the wholesome he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust he abolishes the underlying tendency to aversion he extirpates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit I am and by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge he here and now makes an end of sufferingIn that way too a noble disciple is one of right view whose view is straight who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true DhammaSaying Good friend the bhikkhus delighted and rejoiced in the Venerable Sariputtas wordsThen they asked him a further question But friend might there be another way in which a noble disciple is one of right view and has arrived at this true Dhamma  There might be friendsWhen friends a noble disciple understands nutriment the origin of nutriment the cessation of nutriment and the way leading to the cessation of nutriment in that way he is one of right view and has arrived at this true DhammaAnd what is nutriment what is the origin of nutriment what is the cessation of nutriment what is the way leading to the cessation of nutrimentThere are these four kinds of nutriment for the maintenance of beings that already have come to be and for the support of those seeking a new existenceWhat fourThey are physical food as nutriment gross or subtle contact as the second mental volition as the third and consciousness as the fourthWith the arising of craving there is the arising of nutrimentWith the cessation of craving there is the cessation of nutrimentThe way leading to the cessation of nutriment is just this Noble Eightfold Path that is right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationWhen a noble disciple has thus understood nutriment the origin of nutriment the cessation of nutriment and the way leading to the cessation of nutriment he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to greed
