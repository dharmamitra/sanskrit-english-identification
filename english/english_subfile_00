The Khuddaka Nikaya or Collection of Little Texts the fifth division of the Sutta Pitaka is a wideranging collection of fifteen books containing complete suttas verses and smaller fragments of Dhamma teachings
While many of these have been treasured and memorized by devout Buddhists around the world for centuries others have never left the private domain of Pali scholars some have yet to be translated into English
The following books are included only in the Burmese edition of the Tipitaka in the Sinhala and Thai editions they are regarded as paracanonical
The Milindapañha has long been revered by Theravada Buddhists around the world because it addresses many questions of Buddhist doctrine of the sort that often come up in the course of Dhamma study and meditation practice Are pleasant feelings skillful or unskillful What is the difference between someone with attachment and someone without Can an arahant ever break a Vinaya rule Is it better to perform an unwholesome act knowingly or unknowingly How far away is the Brahmaworld Why are some people healthy and others ill some people attractive and others ugly some rich and others poor All told the king asks some questions along these lines making this one of the most comprehensive and useful Buddhist FAQs in existence

A newly revised biography of Ajaan Mun written by Ajaan Maha Boowa is available from Wat Pah Baan Taad
For more about Ajaan Mun and the history of the Kammatthana tradition see the essay The Customs of the Noble Ones by Thanissaro Bhikkhu
Ajaan Khamdee was born into a farming family in Khon Kaen province in northeastern Thailand
At the age of he ordained at the local temple in line with Thai custom but was dissatisfied with the type of practice customary at village temples
As a result in he reordained in the Dhammayut sect and in the following year became a student of Ajaan Singh Khantiyagamo a senior disciple of Ajaan Mun
Taking up the life of a wandering monk he sought out quiet places in various parts of northeastern Thailand until coming to Tham Phaa Puu in Loei province near the Laotian border in
Finding it an ideal place to practice he stayed there for most of the remainder of his life moving down to the foot of the hill below the cave when he became too old to negotiate the climb
Wellknown as a teacher of strong character and gentle temperament he attracted a large following of students both lay and ordained
By the time of his death a sizable monastery had grown up around him at the foot of Grandfather Cliff
In later years he was the Abbot of a number of monasteries in various parts of Thailand and was given the ecclesiastical title of Phra Khroo Santivaranana in
In he established a monastery in the remote mountains of Chiang Dao in Chiang Mai province that remained his residence until his death in
After finishing his Grade Three Pali studies he therefore left the study monastery and followed Ven
Ajaan Mun into the forests of NE
Thailand
When he caught up with Ven
Ajaan Mun he was told to put his academic knowledge to one side and concentrate on meditation
And that was what he did
He often went into solitary retreat in the mountains and jungle but always returned for help and advice from Ven
Ajaan Mun
He stayed with Ven
Ajaan Mun for seven years right until the Ven
Ajaan's passing away
The vigor and uncompromising determination of his Dhamma practice attracted other monks dedicated to meditation and this eventually resulted in the founding of Wat Pa Bahn Tahd in some forest near the village where he was born
This enabled his mother to come and live as a nun at the monastery
Ven
Ajaan Maha Boowa is well known for the fluency and skill of his Dhamma talks and their direct and dynamic approach
They obviously reflect his own attitude and the way he personally practiced Dhamma
This is best exemplified in the Dhamma talks he gives to those who go to meditate at Wat Pa Bahn Tahd
Such talks usually take place in the cool of the evening with lamps lit and the only sound being the insects and cicadas in the surrounding jungle
He often begins the Dhamma talk with a few moments of stillness  this is the most preparation he needs  and then quietly begins the Dhamma exposition
As the theme naturally develops the pace quickens and those listening increasingly feel its strength and depth
The formal Dhamma talk might last from thirtyfive to sixty minutes
Then after a more general talk the listeners would all go back to their solitary huts in the jungle to continue the practice to try to find the Dhamma they had been listening about  inside themselves
Ajaan Chah was born in in a village in the northeastern part of Thailand
He became a novice at a young age and received higher ordination at the age of twenty
He followed the austere Forest Tradition for years living in forests and begging for almsfood as he wandered about on mendicant pilgrimage
He practiced meditation under a number of masters including Ajaan Mun who had an indelible influence on Ajaan Chah giving his meditation the direction and clarity that it lacked
Ajaan Chah later became an accomplished meditation teacher in his own right sharing his realization of the Dhamma with those who sought it
The essence of the teaching was rather simple be mindful don't hang on to anything let go and surrender to the way things are
Ajaan Chah's simple yet profound teaching style had a special appeal to Westerners and in he established Wat Pah Nanachat a special training monastery for the growing number of Westerners who sought to practice with him
In the first of several branch monasteries in Europe was established in Sussex England by his senior Western disciples
Today there are ten branch monasteries in Europe Australia and New Zealand
Ajaan Chah passed away in January following a long illness
The long names and titles of Buddhist monks sometimes bewilder Westerners who are new to these teachings
Once the basic principles and customs are understood however the names of Thai monks are easily grasped
If the title Mahathera is applied to a monk's name then the terminal vowel in his name changes
For example Ajaan Mun Bhuridatto or Ajaan Mun Bhuridatta Mahathera Ajaan Sao Kantasilo or Ajaan Sao Kantasila Mahathera etc

Only the major divisions of the Pali canon are listed here for individual suttas please see the Index of Suttas
The Digha Nikaya or Collection of Long Discourses is the first division of the Sutta Pitaka and consists of thirtyfour suttas grouped into three vaggas or divisions
For a complete translation see Maurice Walshe's The Long Discourses of the Buddha A Translation of the Digha Nikaya
A selected anthology of suttas from the Digha Nikaya Handful of Leaves Volume One by Thanissaro Bhikkhu is distributed free of charge by Metta Forest Monastery
It is also available to read online and in various ebook formats at dhammatalksorg
The translator appears in the square brackets
The braces contain the volume and starting page number in the PTS romanized Pali edition
The Anguttara Nikaya the fourth division of the Sutta Pitaka consists of several thousand suttas arranged in eleven books according to numerical content
For example the first nipata  the Book of the Ones  contains suttas concerning a single topic the second nipata  the Book of the Twos  contains suttas concerning pairs of things another about two kinds of happiness etc the third nipata contains suttas concerning three things and so on
At first glance this may seem a rather pedantic classification scheme but in fact it often proves quite useful
For example if you dimly recall having heard something about the five subjects worthy of daily contemplation and you'd like to track down the original passage in the Canon a good place to begin your search is the Book of the Fives in the Anguttara

For a complete translation see Bhikkhu Bodhi's The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha A New Translation of the Anguttara Nikaya
A selected anthology of suttas from the Anguttara Nikaya Handful of Leaves Volume Four by Thanissaro Bhikkhu is distributed free of charge by Metta Forest Monastery

The suttas are numbered here by nipata and sutta with the suttas numbered sequentially from the start of each nipata using as a guide the Woodward  Hare PTS English translations of the Anguttara Nikaya
Because suttas in the Anguttara have often been numbered inconsistently in different Tipitaka editions and translations I have also provided alternate reference numbers in the braces that follow the sutta descriptions
For all suttas these alternate references include the volume and starting page number in the PTS romanized Pali edition of the Anguttara Nikaya
For suttas in the Ones and Twos whose numberings are particularly problematic I have also included the nipata vagga and number of the sutta with suttas counted from the start of each vagga
The Majjhima Nikaya or Middlelength Discourses of the Buddha is the second of the five nikayas of the Sutta Pitaka
This nikaya consists of discourses by the Buddha and his chief disciples which together constitute a comprehensive body of teaching concerning all aspects of the Buddha's teachings

The Samyutta Nikaya the third division of the Sutta Pitaka contains suttas grouped into five sections
Each vagga is further divided into samyuttas each of which in turn contains a group of suttas on related topics
The samyuttas are named according to the topics of the suttas they contain
For example the Kosala Samyutta contains suttas concerning King Pasenadi of Kosala the Vedana Samyutta contains suttas concerning feeling and so on
For a complete translation see Bhikkhu Bodhi's The Connected Discourses of the Buddha A New Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya

Stories of Mara's attempts to lure the nuns away from their meditation spots in the forest by asking them provocative questions
Without exception these wise women conquer Mara decisively
In this samyutta the Buddha explains the kinds of conviction and understanding that are required for the attainment of streamentry
These short suttas share an identical structure with each one focusing on a different aspect of experience and the five aggregates

See Thanissaro Bhikkhu's Introduction to this samyutta
The convention by which names are now assigned to Tipitaka files at Access to Insight was first implemented in June
It emerged from more than two years of discussions between jtb Michael Olds Alex Genaud and Hugo Gayosso
Several others contributed helpful ideas on the nowdefunct ATI technical blog including John Gill EM Donnovan Knight Ben N and Robert
This simple experiment reveals two striking facts
Filenames are inconsistent
Some sites name a sutta file using a Pali name some use the local language's translation of the Pali title some use a local index number some use uppercase nikaya abbreviations some use lowercase some use hyphens and underscores
And so on
Directory hierarchies are inconsistent
Moreover they are rarely laid out in a way that reflects the structure of the Tipitaka itself
For example some sites pour all their suttas into one big directory called tipitaka others place them in a sutta directory others refine this a little further by placing each nikaya inside a canon directory while others place the nikayas under a sutta pitaka directory
It is quite natural for a busy webmaster to improvise a filing system that fulfills a site's immediate needs one that quickly gets the job done of making the site's files accessible to its users
This is the strategy that Buddhist sites have usually followed
But as any experienced webmaster knows as the number of files in a site's collection grows the problem of intelligently managing all the hyperlinks between files can escalate at an alarming rate
Any webmaster hoping to host a substantial collection of Tipitaka files must be prepared to provide hyperlinks between many thousands of files
Adding new files to a growing collection is only practical if the site adheres to a consistent and logical filenaming system
There are other compelling reasons for consistent Tipitaka filenames
As Buddhist students practitioners and scholars study the online Tipitaka texts they naturally exchange Tipitaka files with each other via email or via postings on their websites
If you were to send me a file namedhtm along with an email that said Here's that sutta we talked about two weeks ago what am I to make of it
I would have to open it and read it before I could know where to file it
If the file instead had a more meaningful name like mnthanissarohtml then I could tell at a glance that this was Thanissaro's translation of MN and I would know instantly where to drop it in my Tipitaka collection
Moreover if I am trying to locate MN on a website that is poorly indexed and whose filenames are poorly chosen there is no way to know a priori where to find that sutta
This makes it extremely difficult to install useful hyperlinks between sites as the webmaster must first decode the target site's opaque filing system
Large sites and sites that serve as distribution source points for other sites should be concerned about these issues if they hope to continue to provide well organized and richly crossreferenced collections of Tipitaka texts
Filenames shall be constructed from a subset of the World Wide Web Consortium's unreserved characters for URIs
In particular our character set is this
To make filenames machinereadable they are structured to consist of three four or five dotseparated data fields terminated by an extension
The possible fields are
Files from a given VOLUME are stored in a directory with the same name as the VOLUME
Thus files from VOLUME dn are stored in the directory named dn files from VOLUME an are stored in the directory named an etc
The following are not yet implemented on ATI and will be added on an asneeded basis pk jat nc ps ap bv cp nett petk sv dhs vbh kvu pug dhk yam pat
The TEXT field is present in all files
In most cases it corresponds to the basic unit of text in the Sutta Pitaka the sutta
It consists of a one two or threedigit zeropadded subfield optionally followed by
The possible values in the first subfield of the TEXT field are as follows
The optional part of the TEXT contains more specific information about the contents of the file as described above
For example
SOURCE is a onedigit field that is used to further subdivide certain TEXTs the Mv and Cv in the Vinaya and the longer suttas in DN
The SOURCE field is present in all files
It contains a fourbyte translator code that stands for the name of the translator of the given text
For example nymoanamoli Thera thanThanissaro Bhikkhu irelJohn D
Ireland
Librarians and webmasters are encouraged to use translator codes from Access to Insight's pool of Reserved Translator Codes
Eventually the need may emerge for some organizational structure to oversee and coordinate assignment of these codes  especially when managing translations into other languages
But this goes far beyond the scope of what I can do
Additional SOURCE subfields may be needed in the future
All such subfields shall be appended after the translator code
If specific languages are to be incorporated in the future language codes should observe the threebyte ISO
standard
A few suttas contain enumerated sections which in other editions of the Tipitaka are treated as separate suttas
For example AN
contains sections in the Thai edition the first are counted as one sutta and the last as another
To avoid ambiguity we therefore number the first as an and the second as an
Some chapters contain only one sutta which is numbered
Some chapters contain only one sutta which is numbered
Horner's strange enumeration of sections in Miln frustrates attempts at building logical file names
Suttas are grouped in divisions each of which contains several questions posed to Ven
Nagasena
Her chapter II contains divisions  while chapter III contains divisions 
Thus if the last question in chapter II were referenced as Miln the next question in chapter III would be referenced as Miln
In other words there is no Miln
So be it
These fourbyte codes are used in the translator code subfield of a filename
Dividing by vagga has compelling didactic appeal as the thematic grouping of suttas is more tightly bound to vagga than to samyutta
But if the goal is to simplify file management for a website librarian who spends much of his or her time clicking and scrolling through directories to edit files method makes most sense
Consider a website containing the complete SN
Method would yield about filesdir method about fd method about fd plus an additional layer of dirs
From a librarian's point of view the best choice is the simplest cleanest quickest and most intuitive one
To me that's
Although and have theoretical appeal from a practical filemanagement point of view they add additional keystrokes and mouseclicks that I don't want
Librarians and webmasters can of course design their indexhtml files to present SN files as being subdivided any way they like
But that is more a matter of display not of organization
Following a true tradition of Buddhist teaching more will have to be left unsaid here than can possibly be said
The subject of women is large and the contents of the Pali canon on which this article is based are vast
One can make therefore only a relatively small selection of matters that I hope may prove to be of some interest
Women are often the main upholders and supporters of a religion or faith or movement
This was certainly so with Buddhism when it was at its beginnings and hence we are able to find a good deal about them in those portions of the Pali canon known as the Vinayapitaka and the Suttapitaka
The Vinaya which comprises the rules and regulations for monastic discipline contains two sections the Bhikkhunivibhanga and the Bhikkhunikhandhaka both of which deal with the conduct nuns or bhikkhunis and female probationers should observe and with the legislation that was laid down for the proper management of their Order  now unfortunately extinct
In the Buddha's times however it seems that quantities of women became nuns so as to seek for peace inner and outer selfmastery the light of knowledge and so on and perhaps especially for various forms of that freedom which lies at the very heart and center of the Buddha's Teaching As this great ocean has but one taste that of salt so has this Dhamma but one taste that of freedom The ardor and the energy of these early nuns whether they were active in preaching the Word of the Buddha or were absorbed in contemplation and meditation come through to us in three portions of the Suttapitaka that are specially devoted to the verses such nuns are held to have uttered mostly at the time they attained arahantship or won a vision of nibbana
There is first and most important and unique in any literature the Therigatha consisting entirely of sets of verses of varying length attributed to seventythree women who became Theris or Elder nuns
Then there is the Bhikkhunisamyutta a part of the Samyuttanikaya where other verses are collected that are ascribed to ten of these women Elders and thirdly there are in the Apadana biographies in verse of forty nuns said to have been contemporary with the Buddha  as against biographies of monks and to most of whom verses are attributed also in the Therigatha
One cannot say therefore that nuns have been neglected in early Buddhist literature
With the exception of the Suttanipata I think they are mentioned in every Pali canonical work even in the Theragatha the Anthology of verses attributed to monks who were Elders
Against this nowhere in the great Nikayas of the Suttapitaka the Digha Majjhima Samyutta or Anguttara is it possible to find any large section where laywomen devotees are the central figures
It is true that there are records of long conversations held between the Buddha and this or that woman layfollower
For example with Visakha the most eminent and generous benefactor and supporter of the Order of monks and nuns to whom the Buddha granted eight boons that as long as she lived she might be allowed to give robes to the members of the Order for the rainy season food for monks coming into the town of Savatthi food for those leaving it food for the sick food for those that wait on the sick medicines for the sick a constant supply of ricegruel for any needing it and bathing robes for the nuns
Then too there was Queen Mallika chief consort of King Pasenadi of Kosala with whom the Buddha converses now and again and Nakulamata the pious and devoted wife of Nakulapita
And this is typical such records exist but they are scattered through the Vinaya and the Nikayas
These then have to be searched and carefully sifted in order to build up any reliable picture of the position held by laywomen at the time and the place to which this literature purports to refer
And broadly speaking this refers to India in the th century Bwhere the Buddha Gotama was living during the fortyfive years that he was propounding his Teaching on suffering and the escape from it which then and for all the centuries since has so deeply affected the lives of millions of people down to the present day
What with the nuns and the monks the women laydevotees and the mendevotees it is not possible in speaking of women in Early Buddhist literature to keep separate these component parts of the fourfold community that grew up around the Buddha because they were not separate in life
The sexes were not segregated and though naturally nuns had their quarters apart from those of the monks they had yet to carry out some of their official acts such as ordination in conjunction with an Order of monks
Nor was the cloister cut off from the world
On the contrary there was much intermingling
The laity gave almsfood to the monks and nuns and often to the other sectarians who abounded in India at that date either at the doors of their houses or they invited them to come in for their one meal a day
In return the monks and the nuns both of whom could claim some great preachers taught Dhamma to the laity thus giving them the gift that excels all others
This freedom of movement enjoyed by the nuns has a parallel with and is perhaps connected with the freedom of movement that was the happy lot of the laywomen who knew not the cramping and enervating system of purdah though their life might contain other disadvantages
In India as I see it at the time when the Buddha was living and teaching there women were emerging into a relatively free state after they had suffered a certain amount but perhaps an overestimated amount of ignominy of obedience and subservience to men and exclusion from this or that worldly occupation or religious education or observance all of which is generally made out to have been their portion in preBuddhist Indian epochs
We have to be a little on our guard against such statements
For example there is no evidence that women were debarred from taking part in the great debates on philosophical matter that were a feature of Indian life at that time
Famous in the Brhadarañyaka Upanisad for example is the lady Gargi who pushed a debate with Yajñyavalkya to a point beyond which as he told her no further questions should be asked for they hardly admitted of an answer  a distinction no male questioner achieved
A somewhat comparable discussion or minor catechism is recorded in the Pali MajjhimaNikaya but here it is the man the laydevotee Visakha who when he asked his former wife who had become the nun Dhammadinna what is the counterpart of nibbana was told by her that this question goes too far and is beyond the scope of an answer
Dhammadinna knew very well what she was talking about and was outstanding as the most eminent among the Buddhist nuns who were speakers on Dhamma
We too have to believe her
Leaving the realms of high philosophy we must now look at what was regarded as woman's proper sphere namely the home
We have to remember that in India women as mothers had always commanded much veneration and gratitude
By bearing a son she had done what she could and what had been expected of her to ensure the continuance of the family line and had provided for the due performance of the rites of the ancestors Only a son could carry these out they were thought to be very necessary for bringing peace and serenity to the father and the grandfather too after they had died and so to prevent them from returning as ghosts to harry the family
If a woman had no son she might be superseded by a second and a third wife or even turned out of the house
But with the coming of Buddhism the traditional structure and functions of society undoubtedly underwent some alterations
So numerous were the followers of this new Teaching and so rapidly did it spread that they may be held responsible for various not unimportant social changes such as a reduction in size and frequency of the vast animalsacrifices the brahmans had already engaged in for centuries  though even now these have not been abolished entirely from India
Buddhism teaches that sacrifice is internal a composure of mind to be gained by abandoning all ideas that anything in the world is mine or I or my self
For by things without none is made pure so the wise say
So the oldtime sacrifices came to be derided and debased
The noble lady Queen Mallika took a very strong line and on one occasion was able to dissuade her husband King Pasenadi from holding a great animal sacrifice which had been recommended to him by a brahman as a means for saving his life
She was horrified and exclaimed Where did you ever hear of the saving of life for one by the death of another
Just because a stupid brahman told you to why must you plunge the whole populace into suffering
For not only would the animals be slain and lost to their owners thereby endangering their means of livelihood but from a Buddhist point of view such a contravention of true Dhamma and its first moral injunction panatipata veramani would prolong the sacrificer's bondage to the wheel of samsara Long is samsara for fools who do not know true Dhamma
The mention of samsara brings us almost inevitably to kamma that inexorable impersonal force by which beings are bound to the everrolling wheel of samsara
Not that kamma was a new concept introduced by Buddhism
It was ageold but Buddhism made it very central and illuminated it particularly in relation to this long long faringon and circling of beings born only to die and be born again and yet again so long as ignorance the root cause of all suffering and anguish persists
It is held that after the dissolution of his body here the socalled being will be followed by a new birth and again new ones after that all according to kamma that is according to what the being has done whether of good or bad both in this last birth and in anterior ones until all the effects of his volitional deeds of body speech and thought have worn to their karmic end
The effects of good deeds and bad deeds work in independent series and are not to be weighed or balanced against one another or wiped out the one by the other As is the seed that is sown so is the fruit that is gathered
The doer of good good of evil evil
Or again to take another quotation by random and one that is as much Upanishadic as Buddhist in sentiment The uprising of a being is from what has come to be by what he has done by that he uprises
In a word he the being is responsible for his own samsara  not his mother or his father or brother or sister or his friends and acquaintances
So it is he himself who will experience the ripening of the deed he himself did
All this implies that for women there was a lessening an easing of the pious hope that a child could be got by prayers offered to some divinity such as the moon or by circumambulating a tree
For the workings of kamma will not be affected by such devices
This is a reason why Buddhism had no truck with rites at all
They are a fetter to be avoided and feared and useless against the tremendous force of kamma whether their aim were to give a women a child or purify a person of his wrongdoings
As the nun Punna so succinctly observed if bathing and ablution in rivers and wells could purify a person then fishes and crocodiles turtles and watersnakes would be purified and go straight to heaven
So the insistence on impersonal kamma spelt a decrease in a wife's anxiety to give birth to a son because it was no longer held that the future state of the father or grandfather depended on the obsequies for the departed ancestors that had devolved formerly on the sons
Rather their future state was now shown to depend solely on the volitional acts they themselves had done
Therefore as a performer of funeral or ancestral rites a son no longer had a part to play
Nor apparently  and this was another innovation  would it be any great catastrophe if the family lineage were vested in a woman at any rate for the time being
On the Western Coast of India there exists even today a very old class of brahmans called Nairs according to whose traditions the inheritance always passes through the female
At all events the idea however novel that after all sons were not a vital necessity but that a daughter might be every whit as acceptable and could also carry on the family line was early recognized and perhaps even introduced by the Buddha
The following words are ascribed to him when he was trying to comfort his friend King Pasenadi wretched and disappointed on hearing that his Queen Mallika had just given birth to a daughter
Not that I think in preBuddhist India there had been any consistent illtreatment of little girls or injustice shown to them for the very reason that they were not boys
Female infanticide if it obtained at all must have been extremely rare
It had not the support of custom or tradition Macdonell and Keith going so far as to say There is no proof that the Vedic Indians practiced exposure of female children Besides the teaching of ahimsa  nonharming noninjury so ancient that its beginnings are lost in the mists of time  held sway even if in moderation over the whole of India
It was a teaching much accentuated by the Jains who were precursors of the Buddha and also contemporary with him
Though they were among his greatest rivals he would not have wished to go against them on such a point or thought a different teaching possible
And they had the backing of public opinion
Ahimsa certainly would not have tolerated the murder of a defenseless human being
From this teaching the first of the five sila or precepts for ethical conduct drew its strength for Jain and Buddhist alike the abstention from killing or harming any living creature was binding on monks and nuns during the whole of their monastic careers  and on the laity too
Moreover the economic conditions prevailing in India from the th to the th centuries Bwould appear to have been quite flourishing enough to allow for the survival of little girls
And finally as the Buddha spoke out strongly against bloodsacrifice so he would not have permitted the sacrifice of children  boys or girls  though indeed for the purposes of infantsacrifice boys were apparently usually the victims in nonBuddhist India
Even as late as towards the end of last century some little boys were immured in the stonework of the new bridge over the Hooghly river near Calcutta as an offering to the gods to protect the bridge and the human beings using it
If sons were born to courtesans they did however run a certain risk of being murdered
For example Salavati had been established as the courtesan of Rajagaha by the urban council
When she gave birth to a son she told her slave woman to put him in a winnowingbasket and throw him away on a rubbish heap
On the other hand the courtesan Ambapali who was to become famous as one of the most loyal and generous supporters of Buddhist monks and the lady known as Abhaya's mother each had a son who became a monk
When this latter lady had heard her son preach she left the world and entered the Buddhist Order of nuns
Daughters born to courtesans do not appear to have been regarded as a disaster and we hear of at least two who followed the same calling as their mothers though later they became nuns and gained arahantship
In those days it was customary for at all events a brahman to embark on the final or forest stage of his life only when he was fairly well advanced in years
He would then leave his wife as motherinlaw in his eldest son's house
Women must have been prepared for this eventuality
But with the coming of Buddhism there was no longer need for a man to wait to make his soul until he was approaching the end of his life then to seek the solitude of the forest
For once the Order of Buddhist monks had been established and that was very early in the Buddha's teaching life it was ruled that a man as young as years but not less could be fully ordained and at the age of fifteen he could leave his home and go into monastic homelessness as a novice
In both cases he had to have the consent of his mother and father  sometimes given very reluctantly
In a way then the establishment of the Order of monks no less than that of nuns might be regarded as a new menace to the happiness of women
For now there was nothing to stop their sons and daughters from taking up the religious life while they were still quite young
At the beginning of his career the Buddha had been accused of being a breaker of homes of turning wives into widows and rendering mothers childless
For this new menace if we may thus speak of the twofold Order did not merely swallow up children
A woman might now lose a young husband to the monks but generally only after he had obtained her consent
Yet how often one may ask was this withheld
And how often did not women like Capa the daughter of a trapper hope that the son to whom she had given birth would save her from desertion by her husband
I think it was perhaps a sign of the changing times that if a husband no longer dependent on a son for his funeral obsequies since they no longer mattered felt a strong enough pull to leave the world and become a monk nothing could restrain him even as nothing had restrained the Bodhisatta Siddhattha who became the Buddha Gotama from leaving his home and wife and child at the age of to seek for the cause of dukkha  anguish or suffering  and the escape from it
In the same way neither the thought of his son nor of Capa's beauty could keep back her husband Upaka from going forth to find the Lord though it is true he was a Naked Ascetic and not a typical householder
He was adamant on the point
His may have been a case of a husband's exerting his authority issariya against which not all the five powers of which a woman may be possessed can prevail beauty wealth relations a son and ethical conduct sila
It is said that a woman endowed with these five powers may dwell with confidence as mistress of the house get the better of her husband and keep him under her thumb but that if she is lacking in these powers the family may not let her stay in the house but may drive her forth and expel her a fate from which only the possession of moral habit could in theory save her
On the expulsion of the wife it may be assumed that the husband was then free to take another wife even as kings whether or not they were followers of the Buddha's Teaching might have a number of consorts
Certainly women too could remarry as is seen from the strange history of Isidasi who married at least four husbands one after the other and for some reason was displeasing to them all  a reason she attributed to an evil deed she did seven births ago
She then entered the Order of nuns
Another fear that a woman may have felt on marrying was that of a cowife one who may or may not have been installed in the house already
Isidasi had such an experience with her last husband
Kisagotami too one of the most widely known of all the Theris was a woman who had endured much sorrow
But the risk of marriage had to be run and was still the most normal career open to a young woman
As it is said A woman's goal is a man her ambition is for adornment her resolve is for a child her desire is to be without a rival her fulfillment is authority
We have seen that a husband might desert his wife or throw her out of the house
Further her relations even against her will might take away a wife from the husband she was fond of and give her to another man
A drastic case is recorded where a husband cut his wife in two rather than let her suffer this fate
He then committed suicide
This is one of several episodes brought together to show that in the Buddhist view grief and suffering rather than happiness and joy are born of affection
Owing to a woman's rather uncertain position after her marriage though except for the cowives perhaps no more uncertain than in our own days it behooved a girl to reflect well before her marriage on what her duties would be afterwards
An interesting statement of these ascribed to the Buddha himself has fortunately survived and may be regarded as an indication that he liked marriages to be happy
Therefore girls train yourselves thus to whatever husband our parents shall give us for him we will rise up early be the last to retire be willing workers order all things sweetly and speak affectionately
Train yourselves thus girls
And in this way too girls we will honor and respect all whom our husband honors and respects whether mother or father recluse or brahman and on their arrival will offer them water and a seat
And in this way too girls We will be deft and nimble at our husband's homecrafts whether they be of wool or cotton making it our business to understand the work so as to do it and get it done
Train yourselves thus girls
And in this way too girls Whatever our husband's household consists of  servants and messengers and workpeople  we will know the work of each one of them by what has been done and their remissness by what has not been done we will know the strength and the weakness of the sick we will portion out the soft food and the solid food to each according to his share
Train yourselves thus girls
And this way too girls The treasure grain silver and gold that our husband brings home we will keep safely acting as no robber or spendthrift in regard to it
Train yourselves thus girls
If all goes well then the wife is called the comrade supreme
A number of devoted couples are mentioned in the Pali canon such as Queen Mallika and King Pasenadi Nakulamata and Nakulapita and Dhammadinna and Visakha
Nakulamata and Nakulapita were considered by the Buddha to be the most eminent among his laydisciples for their close companionship with one another
And they were matched in their faith in his Teaching their selfcontrol and the affectionate way in which they spoke to one another
A commentary asserts that for births they had been parents or relatives of the Buddha or more strictly speaking of the Bodhisatta Him of the ten powers is the term the Commentary uses to avoid this awkwardness  and so in this life they treated him like a son
Nakulamata as was the custom for brides was taken to Nakulapita's home and as they tell the Buddha ever since that time when he was still a mere lad and she only a girl neither is aware of having transgressed against the other in thought much less in person and each expresses the longing to be together not only here and now but in a future state also
The Buddha reassures them on this point and gives as his reason that both of them are on the same level in regard to their belief their ethical conduct their generosity and wisdom
In these respects therefore a woman may be the equal of a man
Another record relates how Nakulamata once comforted her husband when he was dangerously ill and worrying about what would happen to her and the children should he die
Do not fret she said I am deft at spinning cotton and carding wool and so would be able were you to die to support the children and run the household
Nor would I go to another man
Even greater than when you were alive would be my desire to see the Bhagavan and the Order of monks
As long as the Bhagavan has female disciples clad in white I shall be one of them fulfilling the precepts of ethical behavior and gaining inward tranquility of mind
I shall live confident without doubt or questioning following the Teacher's instruction
So do not die householder while you are fretting for so to die is anguish
Since restlessness and worry are one of the five hindrances to gaining mindcontrol and since to die with an anxious heart works against happiness in the life to come it is important to develop serenity of mind and impassibility of body
Husbands might be prevented from crooked dealing if their wives were upholders of the Buddhist way of life
For example the brahman Dhanañjani was not being diligent
Under the king's patronage he plundered brahman householders and under their patronage he plundered the king
His wife who had had faith in the Buddhist Teaching and had come from a family having faith had died and he married another woman
But she had no faith herself and came from a family lacking in faith
Here the first wife is clearly thought of as able to keep her husband straight while the second one at all events seems to countenance his double dealings even if she does nothing herself to aid and abet him actively
Equally with a man a woman might bring a family to prosperity All families that have attained great possessions have done so for one or other of the following reasons they search for what is lost repair what is dilapidated eat and drink in moderation and place in authority issariya a virtuous woman or man
In preBuddhist days a woman had been looked down on if she did not marry  growing old at home she was called one who sits with her father But in early Buddhist times an unmarried girl might go unabused contented and adequately occupied in caring for her parents and younger brothers and sisters
Hers would have been a domestic life
Or she might become the mistress of great possessions of slaves villages and rich fields as did Subha the goldsmith's daughter
But once Dhamma had been taught to her by Mahapajapati who had been the Buddha's fostermother and then became the first nun she found that all worldly pleasures irk me sore that  silver and gold lead neither to peace nor to enlightenment so she entered the Order of Buddhist nuns
And truly this was a great boon to the unmarried woman
It gave her and the married woman too the means of escaping from some crushing sorrow from difficult worldly circumstances or from the ceaseless round of menial tasks that have to be performed in the home
Isidasi's verses contain a whole catalogue of these
Mutta sums up her domestic drudgery more succinctly
I hope to have shown that in spite of her many trials and tribulations a virtuous woman could have power in her home bear the children she wanted and enjoy the love and respect of her husband and family circle
Again in the home there were the servingwomen whether themselves unmarried or not I cannot say the fostermothers brought in for the occasion and the women musicians and dancers for the most part of course in the homes of the welltodo
Outside the home it would seem that a woman's powers and opportunities were limited
Though they worked in the fields apparently they did not become doctors or even nurses judges or lawyers nor apart from looking after their own possessions did they engage in business
The only profession really open to them was the oldest one in the world
The Buddha neither scorned nor rebuked courtesans but tried to help them by making them realize the impermanence of all conditioned things including the many forms of beauty
The Order of Nuns was as open to them as it was to any other women who qualified for the higher ordination
And indeed it was to the Order of Nuns that a woman could go merely if she felt the nagging worries of domestic life to be unendurable but also if she had a positive vocation for spiritual endeavor
In principle there was nothing very novel in women leaving the world for the houseless state
The Jain Order of Nuns was in being already and there were women wanderers and freelance debaters all seeking for Truth and philosophical understanding
An example of a fine woman disputant is Bhadda Kundalakesin
Formerly a follower of the Jains she now toured the country seeking for knowledge among other learned persons
She would stick a roseapple bough into a heap of sand as a sign that she would debate with anyone who would debate with her
One day Sariputta one of the two chief disciples of the Buddha took up her challenge
But he answered all the questions she put to him and then overthrew her in the debate by asking the single question The one  what is it Leaving aside the intricate literary material that surrounds this question and the deep significance of the correct answer that All beings subsist by food we can do no more here than notice some of the main results of the debate as they affected Bhaddha
First she was taken by Sariputta to the Buddha and after she had heard him speak she gained arahantship
Secondly she entered the Order of Nuns as one who was already an arahant this was unusual
Thirdly the Buddha himself admitted her with the words Come Bhadda and that was her ordination
Great importance came to be attached to this case of a woman being ordained by the Buddha himself and Dhammapala ends his commentary on the Verses of the Women Elders the Therigatha with a note on it
Another Bhadda Bhadda Kapilani is also noteworthy for providing the only case to be recorded of a woman going forth into homelessness at the same time as her husband
We need not however regard this as an isolated incident
Both of them felt a positive call to the homeless life acted in mutual agreement helped one another to put on the yellow robes of a recluse to shave off the hair and sling the beggingbowl from the shoulders
Then they set out together but only to part quite soon and go to the Buddha by different ways for fear people should say that even in their new state they could not do without one another
For then as Bhadda and her husband Kassapa realized such people would run the risk of rebirth in sorrowful states as a result of the false accusations they had made
It is said that owing to the power of such virtue the great earth trembled
Indeed the second of the eight reasons why earthquakes occur is that a person has attained to mastery over his mind and then develops perception of a minute portion of the earth  and these two had earnestly discussed which route each of them would take thereby intimating their mastery over mind  over desire too perhaps
Another woman who felt a true vocation was Dhammadinna whom I have mentioned earlier
Though happily married to Visakha a devout citizen of Rajagaha she yet asked for his consent to go forth into homelessness for apparently as with Bhadda Kapilani and her husband Kassapa the pull of religion was stronger than any earthly tie
Visakha at once sent her to a nunnery in a golden palanquin but unlike Kassapa seems to have felt no desire himself to enter the Order of monks
Dhammadinna gained arahantship and then returned to Rajagaha where she was eagerly questioned by her former husband on matters pertaining to Dhamma
If the questions showed a deep insight the answers showed a deeper
Thus as a result of this dialogue between a nun and a layman recorded in the Culavedalla Sutta the Buddha ranked the nun Dhammadinna foremost among those nuns who could preach  and these were not lacking in number and he also endorsed all she had said declaring that he would have answered all Visakha's questions exactly as she had done
According to the commentary this Discourse may therefore be taken as the Conqueror's speech rather than the disciple's
It thus becomes Buddhavacana the word of the Buddha in virtue of its having won his approval in these terms
There is another occasion when a nun's discourse may be regarded as Buddhavacana
This was when the Buddha commended the unnamed nun of Kajangala for her interpretation of the answers to the Ten Great Questions which begin with the question Sariputta asked Bhadda Kundalakesin The one  what is it Though the nun says she had not learned the answers she would give either from the Buddha or from any monks who were developing their minds and though her answers to four of the questions do in fact differ from those found in the Khuddakapatha the locus classicus for these Ten Great Questions and their answers yet the Lord approved of all of them again stating that he would have answered precisely as the nun had done
Again therefore we get Buddhavacana
In conclusion I hope to have presented you with some material for thinking that in the Buddha's time women were not despised and looked down on but on the contrary were respected and had a place of honor in the home
The difficulties they had to face and overcome were no more than normal for women in any time or country even if their life was at the worldly level more restricted than it has come to be in the last decades as women go in more and more for public work and hold professional posts
At the higher more spiritual level however they had the great advantage and great joy of entering the Order of Nuns either because they wanted to get free of worldly sufferings or more positively and above everything else because they wanted to find the way to the peace and bliss of Nibbana all their former craving for sensepleasures rooted out tranquil and cool
Many of the women I have mentioned here whether they have been nuns or laydevotees by their response to the majesty of the Buddha's Teaching have made an imponderable contribution to its strength vitality expansion and longevity
It is as well to survey again from time to time the lives of these ardent contemporaries of the Buddha
Indeed the Buddhist world owes them a large debt of gratitude
We of today In view of this wonderful gift of the Dhamma that has been vouchsafed to us cannot be merely recipients
We must be givers too
We have had the lofty privilege of coming to know something of the Teachings of the Buddha
We live in a Buddhaera that is at a time when the Teachings of the Buddha are still remembered and are of significance
This alone would make it incumbent on us to spread this Teaching of Peace inner and outer as far and wide and as faithfully as we can

The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
This quotation from chapter of the Parivara the appendix to the Vinaya is obviously not talking about ordinary conversation
It's talking about the ideal type of conversation among meditators the very opposite of idle chatter
Several passages in the Canon list ten ideal topics for such conversation modesty contentment seclusion nonentanglement arousing persistence virtue concentration discernment release and the knowledge  vision of release
The purpose of this study guide is to illustrate each of these topics with passages from the Canon and to provide meditators with the incentive to integrate conversation of this sort into their practice
There is some overlap between the topics listed here and those listed in two other study guides Recognizing the Dhamma and The Ten Perfections
Thus some redundancy has been inevitable but wherever possible I have also included material unavailable in those two guides
The first passage included here in addition to listing the ten ideal topics also lists topics that monks and serious meditators should avoid ranging from politics and food to theories about the creation of the world
The Commentary qualifies this list saying that if one discusses these topics in a way connected with Dhamma  for example pointing out the ephemeral nature of political power so as to engender a feeling of dispassion for it  then that would count as right speech and an aid to the liberation of the mind
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Now at that time a large number of monks after the meal on returning from their alms round had gathered at the meeting hall and were engaged in many kinds of bestial topics of conversation conversation about kings robbers  ministers of state armies alarms  battles food  drink clothing furniture garlands  scents relatives vehicles villages towns cities the countryside women  heroes the gossip of the street  the well tales of the dead tales of diversity the creation of the world  of the sea talk of whether things exist or not
Then the Blessed One emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the meeting hall and on arrival sat down on a seat made ready
As he was sitting there he addressed the monks For what topic of conversation are you gathered together here
In the midst of what topic of conversation have you been interrupted
Just now lord after the meal on returning from our alms round we gathered at the meeting hall and got engaged in many kinds of bestial topics of conversation conversation about kings robbers  ministers of state armies alarms  battles food  drink clothing furniture garlands  scents relatives vehicles villages towns cities the countryside women  heroes the gossip of the street  the well tales of the dead tales of diversity the creation of the world  of the sea talk of whether things exist or not
It isn't right monks that sons of good families on having gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life should get engaged in such topics of conversation ie conversation about kings robbers  ministers of state talk of whether things exist or not
There are these ten topics of conversation
Which ten
Talk on modesty contentment seclusion nonentanglement arousing persistence virtue concentration discernment release and the knowledge  vision of release
These are the ten topics of conversation
If you were to engage repeatedly in these ten topics of conversation you would outshine even the sun  moon so mighty so powerful  to say nothing of the wanderers of other sects
'This Dhamma is for one who is modest not for one who is selfaggrandizing' Thus was it said
With reference to what was it said
There is the case where a monk being modest doesn't want it to be known that 'He is modest' Being content he doesn't want it to be known that 'He is content' Being reclusive he doesn't want it to be known that 'He is reclusive' His persistence being aroused he doesn't want it to be known that 'His persistence is aroused' His mindfulness being established he doesn't want it to be known that 'His mindfulness is established' His mind being centered he doesn't want it to be known that 'His mind is centered' Being endowed with discernment he doesn't want it to be known that 'He is endowed with discernment' Enjoying nonobjectification he doesn't want it to be known that 'He is enjoying nonobjectification'
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Alavi at the Aggalava Shrine
There he addressed the monks Monks remember Hatthaka of Alavi as being endowed with seven amazing astounding qualities
Which seven
Monks Hatthaka of Alavi is endowed with conviction
He is virtuous
He has a sense of conscience
He has a sense of concern
He is learned
He is generous
He is discerning
Remember Hatthaka of Alavi as being endowed with these seven amazing astounding qualities
That is what the Blessed One said
Having said it the One Wellgoing getting up from his seat went into his dwelling
Then early in the morning a certain monk having put on his robes and carrying his bowl  outer robe went to Hatthaka of Alavi's home
On arrival he sat down on a seat made ready
Then Hatthaka of Alavi approached the monk and having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the monk said to him Friend the Blessed One has described you as being endowed with seven amazing astounding qualities
Which seven
'Hatthaka of Alavi is endowed with conviction
He is virtuous
He has a sense of conscience
He has a sense of concern
He is learned
He is generous
He is discerning' Friend the Blessed One has described you as being endowed with these seven amazing astounding qualities
I hope sir that there were no whiteclad householders there
No friend there were no whiteclad householders there
It's good sir that there were no whiteclad householders there
Then the monk having received alms at Hatthaka of Alavi's home departed
After his meal returning from his alms round he went to the Blessed One
On arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One he sat to one side
As he was sitting there 
It's good monk it's very good that the clansman is modest and does not want others to know of the skillful qualities present in him
In that case monk remember Hatthaka of Alavi as being endowed with this eighth amazing astounding quality modesty
'This Dhamma is for one who is content not for one who is discontent' Thus was it said
With reference to what was it said
There is the case where a monk is content with any old robe cloth at all any old almsfood any old lodging any old medicinal requisites for curing sickness at all
And how is a monk content
Just as a bird wherever it goes flies with its wings as its only burden so too is he content with a set of robes to provide for his body and alms food to provide for his hunger
Wherever he goes he takes only his barest necessities along
This is how a monk is content
There is the case where a monk is content with any old robe cloth at all
He speaks in praise of being content with any old robe cloth at all
He does not for the sake of robe cloth do anything unseemly or inappropriate
Not getting cloth he isn't agitated
Getting cloth he uses it unattached to it uninfatuated guiltless seeing the drawbacks and discerning the escape from them
He does not on account of his contentment with any old robe cloth at all exalt himself or disparage others
In this he is diligent deft alert  mindful
This is said to be a monk standing firm in the ancient original traditions of the noble ones
Furthermore the monk is content with any old almsfood at all
He speaks in praise of being content with any old almsfood at all
He does not for the sake of almsfood do anything unseemly or inappropriate

On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Alavi on a spread of leaves by a cattle track in a simsapa forest
Then Hatthaka of Alavi out roaming  rambling for exercise saw the Blessed One sitting on a spread of leaves by the cattle track in the simsapa forest
On seeing him he went to him and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord I hope the Blessed One has slept in ease
Yes young man
I have slept in ease
Of those in the world who sleep in ease I am one
But cold lord is the winter night
The 'BetweentheEights' is a time of snowfall
Hard is the ground trampled by cattle hooves
Thin is the spread of leaves
Sparse are the leaves in the trees
Thin are your ochre robes
And cold blows the Verambha wind
Yet still the Blessed One says 'Yes young man
I have slept in ease
Of those in the world who sleep in ease I am one' In that case young man I will question you in return
Answer as you see fit
Now what do you think Suppose a householder or householder's son has a house with a gabled roof plastered inside  out draftfree with closefitting door  windows shut against the wind
Inside he has a horsehair couch spread with a longfleeced coverlet a white wool coverlet an embroidered coverlet a rug of kadalideer hide with a canopy above  red cushions on either side
And there a lamp would be burning and his four wives with their many charms would be attending to him
Would he sleep in ease or not
Or how does this strike you
Yes lord he would sleep in ease
Of those in the world who sleep in ease he would be one
But what do you think young man
Might there arise in that householder or householder's son any bodily fevers or fevers of mind born of passion aversion delusion so that  burned with those passion aversion delusionborn fevers  he would sleep miserably
Yes lord
As for those passion aversion delusionborn fevers  burned with which the householder or householder's son would sleep miserably  that passion aversion delusion has been abandoned by the Tathagata its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Therefore he sleeps in ease
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Anupiya in the Mango Orchard
Now at that time Ven
Bhaddiya Kaligodha on going to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling would repeatedly exclaim What bliss
What bliss A large number of monks heard Ven
Bhaddiya Kaligodha on going to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling repeatedly exclaim What bliss
What bliss and on hearing him the thought occurred to them There's no doubt but that Ven
Bhaddiya Kaligodha doesn't enjoy leading the holy life for when he was a householder he knew the bliss of kingship so that now on recollecting that he is repeatedly exclaiming 'What bliss
What bliss' They went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they told him Ven
Bhaddiya Kaligodha lord on going to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling repeatedly exclaims 'What bliss
What bliss' There's no doubt but that Ven
Bhaddiya Kaligodha doesn't enjoy leading the holy life for when he was a householder he knew the bliss of kingship so that now on recollecting that he is repeatedly exclaiming 'What bliss
What bliss' Then the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monk
In my name call Bhaddiya saying 'The Teacher calls you my friend'
Then Ven
Bhaddiya went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Bhaddiya that on going to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling you repeatedly exclaim 'What bliss
What bliss'
Yes lord
What meaning do you have in mind that you repeatedly exclaim 'What bliss
What bliss'
Before when I was a householder maintaining the bliss of kingship I had guards posted within and without the royal apartments within and without the city within and without the countryside
But even though I was thus guarded thus protected I dwelled in fear  agitated distrustful and afraid
But now on going alone to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling I dwell without fear unagitated confident and unafraid  unconcerned unruffled my wants satisfied with my mind like a wild deer
This is the meaning I have in mind that I repeatedly exclaim 'What bliss
What bliss' Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Then a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they informed him Lord there is a certain monk by the name of Elder who lives alone and extols the virtues of living alone
Then the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monk
In my name call the monk named Elder saying 'The Teacher calls you my friend'
Then Ven
Elder went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Elder that you live alone and extol the virtues of living alone
Yes lord
But how do you live alone and extol the virtues of living alone
Lord alone I enter the village for alms alone I return alone I sit withdrawn alone I do walking meditation
That is how I live alone and extol the virtues of living alone
There is that way of living alone Elder
I don't say that there isn't
Still listen well to how your living alone is perfected in its details and pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord Ven
Elder responded
The Blessed One said And how is living alone perfected in its details
There is the case where whatever is past is abandoned whatever is future is relinquished and any passion  desire with regard to states of being attained in the present is well subdued
That is how living alone is perfected in its details
That is what the Blessed One said
Having said it the One Wellgone further said this
Then Ven
Migajala went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One 'A person living alone
A person living alone' thus it is said
To what extent lord is one a person living alone and to what extent is one a person living with a companion
Migajala there are forms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing  and a monk relishes them welcomes them  remains fastened to them
As he relishes them welcomes them  remains fastened to them delight arises
There being delight he is impassioned
Being impassioned he is fettered
A monk joined with the fetter of delight is said to be living with a companion
A person living in this way  even if he frequents isolated forest  wilderness dwellings with an unpopulated atmosphere lying far from humanity appropriate for seclusion  is still said to be living with a companion
Why is that
Because craving is his companion and it has not been abandoned by him
Thus he is said to be living with a companion
Now there are forms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing  and a monk does not relish them welcome them or remain fastened to them
As he doesn't relish them welcome them or remain fastened to them delight ceases
There being no delight he is not impassioned
Being not impassioned he is not fettered
A monk disjoined from the fetter of delight is said to be living alone
A person living in this way  even if he lives near a village associating with monks  nuns with male  female lay followers with kings  royal ministers with sectarians  their disciples  is still said to be living alone
A person living alone is said to be a monk
Why is that
Because craving is his companion and it has been abandoned by him
Thus he is said to be living alone
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Now at that time a certain lay follower from Icchanangalaka had arrived in Savatthi on some business affairs
Having settled his affairs in Savatthi he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him At long last you have managed to come here
For a long time I have wanted to come see the Blessed One lord but being involved in one business affair after another I haven't been able to do so
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
'This Dhamma is for one who is reclusive not for one who is entangled' Thus was it said
With reference to what was it said
There is the case where a monk when living in seclusion is visited by monks nuns lay men lay women kings royal ministers sectarians  their disciples
With his mind bent on seclusion tending toward seclusion inclined toward seclusion aiming at seclusion relishing renunciation he converses with them only as much as is necessary for them to take their leave
'This Dhamma is for one whose persistence is aroused not for one who is lazy' Thus was it said
With reference to what was it said
There is the case where a monk keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualities
He is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities
These are the five factors for exertion
Which five
There is the case where a monk has conviction is convinced of the Tathagata's Awakening 'Indeed the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessed'
The monk is free from illness  discomfort endowed with good digestion  not too cold not too hot of moderate strength  fit for exertion
He is neither fraudulent nor deceitful
He declares himself to the Teacher or to his wise friends in the holy life in line with what he actually is
He keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualities
He is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities
He is discerning endowed with discernment leading to the arising of the goal  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress
These are the five factors for exertion
Furthermore the monk finds pleasure  delight in developing finds pleasure  delight in abandoning
He does not on account of his pleasure  delight in developing  abandoning exalt himself or disparage others
In this he is diligent deft alert  mindful
This is said to be a monk standing firm in the ancient original traditions of the noble ones
And how is a monk devoted to wakefulness
There is the case where a monk during the day sitting  pacing back  forth cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in check
During the first watch of the night sitting  pacing back  forth he cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in check
During the second watch of the night reclining on his right side he takes up the lion's posture one foot placed on top of the other mindful alert with his mind set on getting up
During the last watch of the night sitting  pacing back  forth he cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in check
This is how a monk is devoted to wakefulness
Even if a monk isn't skilled in the ways of the minds of others he should train himself 'I will be skilled in reading my own mind'
And how is a monk skilled in reading his own mind
Imagine a young woman  or man  fond of adornment examining the image of her own face in a bright clean mirror or bowl of clear water If she saw any dirt or blemish there she would try to remove it
If she saw no dirt or blemish there she would be pleased her resolves fulfilled 'How fortunate I am
How clean I am' In the same way a monk's selfexamination is very productive in terms of skillful qualities Do I usually remain covetous or not
With thoughts of ill will or not
Overcome by sloth  drowsiness or not
Restless or not
Uncertain or gone beyond uncertainty
Angry or not
With soiled thoughts or unsoiled thoughts
With my body aroused or unaroused
Lazy or with persistence aroused
Unconcentrated or concentrated'
If on examination a monk knows 'I usually remain covetous with thoughts of ill will overcome by sloth  drowsiness restless uncertain angry with soiled thoughts with my body aroused lazy or unconcentrated' then he should put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor undivided mindfulness  alertness for the abandoning of those very same evil unskillful qualities just as when a person whose turban or head was on fire would put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor undivided mindfulness  alertness to put out the fire on his turban or head
But if on examination a monk knows 'I usually remain uncovetous without thoughts of ill will  concentrated' then his duty is to make an effort in establishing those very same skillful qualities to a higher degree for the ending of the effluents
Maha Kassapa There is the case where a monk thinks 'The arising of unarisen evil unskillful qualities would lead to what is unbeneficial' yet he arouses no ardor
'The nonabandoning of arisen evil unskillful qualities would lead to what is unbeneficial' yet he arouses no ardor
'The nonarising of unarisen skillful qualities would lead to what is unbeneficial' yet he arouses no ardor
'The ceasing of arisen skillful qualities would lead to what is unbeneficial' yet he arouses no ardor
This is what it means to be a person without ardor
And how is one a person without concern
There is the case where a monk thinks 'The arising of unarisen evil unskillful qualities would lead to what is unbeneficial' yet he feels no concern
'The nonabandoning of arisen evil unskillful qualities The nonarising of unarisen skillful qualities The ceasing of arisen skillful qualities would lead to what is unbeneficial' yet he feels no concern
This is what it means to be a person without concern
This is how a person without ardor without concern is incapable of selfawakening incapable of Unbinding incapable of attaining the unexcelled security from bondage
And how is a person ardent
There is the case where a monk thinks 'The arising of unarisen evil unskillful qualities would lead to what is unbeneficial' and he arouses ardor
'The nonabandoning of arisen evil unskillful qualities The nonarising of unarisen skillful qualities The ceasing of arisen skillful qualities would lead to what is unbeneficial' and he arouses ardor
This is what it means to be ardent
And how is a person concerned
There is the case where a monk thinks 'The arising of unarisen evil unskillful qualities would lead to what is unbeneficial' and he feels concern
'The nonabandoning of arisen evil unskillful qualities The nonarising of unarisen skillful qualities The ceasing of arisen skillful qualities would lead to what is unbeneficial' and he feels concern
This is what it means to be concerned
This is how a person ardent  concerned is capable of selfawakening capable of Unbinding capable of attaining the unexcelled security from bondage
Sariputta Imagine a bronze bowl brought back from a shop or a smith all covered with dust  dirt that the owners would neither use nor clean but would throw away in the dust
Wouldn't that bronze bowl eventually become even more dirty  defiled with time
Maha Moggallana Yes my friend
Sariputta In the same way when an individual with an internal blemish doesn't discern as it actually is that 'I have an internal blemish' it can be expected of him that he won't generate desire endeavor or arouse persistence for the abandoning of that blemish
He will die with passion aversion delusion  blemished  with a mind defiled
Now imagine a bronze bowl brought back from a shop or a smith all covered with dust  dirt that the owners would both use  clean and would not throw away in the dust
Wouldn't that bronze bowl eventually become clean  pure with time
Maha Moggallana Yes my friend
Sariputta In the same way when an individual with an internal blemish discerns as it actually is that 'I have an internal blemish' it can be expected of him that he will generate desire endeavor  arouse persistence for the abandoning of that blemish
He will die without passion aversion delusion  unblemished  with a mind undefiled
Now imagine a bronze bowl brought back from a shop or a smith all clean  pure that the owners would neither use nor clean but would throw away in the dust
Wouldn't that bronze bowl eventually become dirty  defiled with time
Maha Moggallana Yes my friend
Sariputta In the same way when an individual with no internal blemish doesn't discern as it actually is that 'I have no internal blemish' it can be expected of him that he will attend to the theme of beauty
As he attends to the theme of beauty passion will despoil his mind
He will die with passion aversion delusion  blemished  with a mind defiled
Now imagine a bronze bowl brought back from a shop or a smith all clean  pure that the owners would both use  clean and would not throw away in the dust
Wouldn't that bronze bowl eventually become even more clean  pure with time
Maha Moggallana Yes my friend
Sariputta In the same way when an individual with no internal blemish discerns as it actually is that 'I have no internal blemish' it can be expected of him that he won't attend to the theme of beauty
As he doesn't attend to the theme of beauty passion won't despoil his mind
He will die without passion aversion delusion  unblemished  with a mind undefiled
This is the reason this is the cause why of the two individuals who are blemished one is reckoned to be inferior and the other superior and why of the two individuals who are unblemished one is reckoned to be inferior and the other superior
Maha Moggallana Now this word 'blemish blemish' What is the meaning of blemish
Sariputta Consorting with evil unskillful wishes  this is the meaning of 'blemish'
Udayin there are these four types of people to be found existing in the world
Which four
There is the case where a certain person is practicing for the abandoning  relinquishing of acquisitions
As he is practicing for the abandoning  relinquishing of acquisitions memories  resolves associated with acquisitions assail him
He tolerates them
He doesn't abandon them destroy them dispel them or wipe them out of existence
I tell you Udayin that this sort of person is associated not dissociated
Why is that
Because I have known the diversity of faculties with regard to this type of person
Again there is the case where a certain person practicing for the abandoning  relinquishing of acquisitions is assailed by memories  resolves associated with the acquisitions
He doesn't tolerate them
He abandons them destroys them dispels them  wipes them out of existence
I tell you Udayin that this sort of person is associated not dissociated
Why is that
Because I have known the diversity of faculties with regard to this type of person
Again there is the case where a certain person is practicing for the abandoning  relinquishing of acquisitions Owing to lapses in mindfulness from time to time he is assailed by memories  resolves associated with acquisitions
Slow is the arising of his mindfulness but then he quickly abandons destroys them dispels them  wipes them out of existence
Just as when two or three drops of water fall onto an iron pan heated all day Slow is the falling of the drops of water but they quickly vanish  disappear
In the same way slow is the arising of his mindfulness but then he quickly abandons destroys them dispels them  wipes them out of existence
I tell you Udayin that this sort of person is associated not dissociated
Why is that
Because I have known the diversity of faculties with regard to this type of person
Again there is the case where a certain person realizing that acquisitions are the root of suffering  stress is without acquisitions released in the ending of acquisitions
I tell you Udayin that this sort of person is dissociated not associated
Why is that
Because I have known the diversity of faculties with regard to this type of person

As Ven
Sona was meditating in seclusion this train of thought arose in his awareness Of the Blessed One's disciples who have aroused their persistence I am one but my mind is not released from the effluents through lack of clingingsustenance
Now my family has enough wealth that it would be possible to enjoy wealth  make merit
What if I were to disavow the training return to the lower life and to enjoy wealth  make merit
Then the Blessed One as soon as he perceived with his awareness the train of thought in Ven
Sona's awareness  as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm  disappeared from Mount Vulture Peak appeared in the Cool Wood right in front of Ven
Sona and sat down on a prepared seat
Ven
Sona after bowing down to the Blessed One sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Just now as you were meditating in seclusion didn't this train of thought appear to your awareness 'Of the Blessed One's disciples who have aroused their persistence I am one but my mind is not released from the effluents What if I were to disavow the training return to the lower life and to enjoy wealth  make merit' Yes lord
Now what do you think Sona
Before when you were a housedweller were you skilled at playing the vina
Yes lord
And when the strings of your vina were too taut was your vina in tune  playable
No lord
And when the strings of your vina were too loose was your vina in tune  playable
No lord
And when the strings of your vina were neither too taut nor too loose but tuned to be right on pitch was your vina in tune  playable
Yes lord
In the same way Sona overaroused persistence leads to restlessness overly slack persistence leads to laziness
Thus you should determine the right pitch for your persistence attune the pitch of the faculties and there pick up your theme
Yes lord Ven
Sona answered the Blessed One
Then having given this exhortation to Ven
Sona the Blessed One  as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm  disappeared from the Cool Wood and appeared on Mount Vulture Peak
So after that Ven
Sona determined the right pitch for his persistence attuned the pitch of the faculties and there picked up his theme
Dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now
He knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus Ven
Sona became another one of the arahants
There are these four right exertions
Which four
There is the case where a monk generates desire endeavors arouses persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the nonarising of evil unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the sake of the abandoning of evil unskillful qualities that have arisen for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the maintenance nonconfusion increase plenitude development  culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen
These are the four right exertions
Just as the River Ganges flows to the east slopes to the east inclines to the east in the same way when a monk develops  pursues the four right exertions he flows to Unbinding slopes to Unbinding inclines to Unbinding
There are these four exertions
Which four
The exertion to guard the exertion to abandon the exertion to develop  the exertion to maintain
And what is the exertion to guard
There is the case where a monk on seeing a form with the eye doesn't grasp at any theme or variations by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him
He practices with restraint
He guards the faculty of the eye
He achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the eye
This is called the exertion to guard
And what is the exertion to abandon
There is the case where a monk doesn't acquiesce to a thought of sensuality that has arisen
He abandons it destroys it dispels it wipes it out of existence
He doesn't acquiesce to a thought of ill will a thought of harmfulness any evil unskillful qualities that have arisen
He abandons them destroys them dispels them wipes them out of existence
This is called the exertion to abandon
And what is the exertion to develop
There is the case where a monk develops the mindfulness factor for awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting go
He develops the investigation of qualities factor for awakening the persistence factor for awakening the rapture factor for awakening the serenity factor for awakening the concentration factor for awakening the equanimity factor for awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting go
This is called the exertion to develop
And what is the exertion to maintain
There is the case where a monk maintains a favorable theme of concentration  the skeleton perception the wormeaten perception the livid perception the festering perception the fallingapart perception the bloated perception
This is called the exertion to maintain
These are the four exertions
The ending of the effluents is for one who knows  sees I tell you not for one who does not know  does not see
For one who knows what  sees what
Appropriate attention  inappropriate attention
When a monk attends inappropriately unarisen effluents arise and arisen effluents increase
When a monk attends appropriately unarisen effluents do not arise and arisen effluents are abandoned
There are effluents that are to be abandoned by seeing those that are to be abandoned by restraining those that are to be abandoned by using those that are to be abandoned by tolerating those that are to be abandoned by avoiding those that are to be abandoned by destroying and those that are to be abandoned by developing
And what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by seeing
There is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person doesn't discern what ideas are fit for attention or what ideas are unfit for attention
This being so he doesn't attend to ideas fit for attention and attends to ideas unfit for attention
And what are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends to
Whatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen effluent of sensuality arises and the arisen effluent of sensuality increases the unarisen effluent of becoming the unarisen effluent of ignorance arises and the arisen effluent of ignorance increases This is how he attends inappropriately 'Was I in the past
Was I not in the past
What was I in the past
How was I in the past
Having been what what was I in the past
Shall I be in the future
Shall I not be in the future
What shall I be in the future
How shall I be in the future
Having been what what shall I be in the future' Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present 'Am I
Am I not
What am I
How am I
Where has this being come from
Where is it bound' As he attends inappropriately in this way one of six kinds of view arises in him The view I have a self arises in him as true  established or the view I have no self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive notself or the view It is precisely by means of notself that I perceive self arises in him as true  established or else he has a view like this This very self of mine  the knower that is sensitive here  there to the ripening of good  bad actions  is the self of mine that is constant everlasting eternal not subject to change and will endure as long as eternity
This is called a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of views
Bound by a fetter of views the uninstructed runofthemill person is not freed from birth aging  death from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair
He is not freed I tell you from stress
The wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attention
This being so he doesn't attend to ideas unfit for attention and attends to ideas fit for attention And what are the ideas fit for attention that he attends to
Whatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen effluent of sensuality doesn't arise and the arisen effluent of sensuality is abandoned the unarisen effluent of becoming the unarisen effluent of ignorance doesn't arise and the arisen effluent of ignorance is abandoned He attends appropriately This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress
As he attends appropriately in this way three fetters are abandoned in him identityview doubt and grasping at precepts  practices
These are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by seeing
And what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by restraining
There is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately dwells restrained with the restraint of the eyefaculty
The effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were to dwell unrestrained with the restraint of the eyefaculty don't arise for him when he dwells restrained with the restraint of the eyefaculty
These are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by restraining
And what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by using
There is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately uses the robe simply to counteract cold to counteract heat to counteract the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles simply for the purpose of covering the parts of the body that cause shame
Reflecting appropriately he uses alms food not playfully nor for intoxication nor for putting on bulk nor for beautification but simply for the survival  continuance of this body for ending its afflictions for the support of the holy life thinking 'Thus will I destroy old feelings and not create new feelings
I will maintain myself be blameless  live in comfort'
Reflecting appropriately he uses lodging simply to counteract cold to counteract heat to counteract the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles simply for protection from the inclemencies of weather and for the enjoyment of seclusion
Reflecting appropriately he uses medicinal requisites for curing illness simply to counteract any pains of illness that have arisen and for maximum freedom from disease
The effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to use these things do not arise for him when he uses them
These are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by using
And what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by tolerating
There is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately endures
He tolerates cold heat hunger  thirst the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles illspoken unwelcome words  bodily feelings that when they arise are painful racking sharp piercing disagreeable displeasing  menacing to life
The effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to tolerate these things do not arise for him when he tolerates them
These are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by tolerating
And what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by avoiding
There is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately avoids a wild elephant a wild horse a wild bull a wild dog a snake a stump a bramble patch a chasm a cliff a cesspool an open sewer
Reflecting appropriately he avoids sitting in the sorts of unsuitable seats wandering to the sorts of unsuitable habitats and associating with the sorts of bad friends that would make his knowledgeable friends in the holy life suspect him of evil conduct
The effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to avoid these things do not arise for him when he avoids them
These are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by avoiding
And what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by destroying
There is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately doesn't tolerate an arisen thought of sensuality
He abandons it destroys it dispels it  wipes it out of existence
The effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to destroy these things do not arise for him when he destroys them
These are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by destroying
And what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by developing
There is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting go
He develops analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening persistence rapture serenity concentration equanimity as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting go
The effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to develop these qualities do not arise for him when he develops them
These are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by developing
When a monk's effluents that should be abandoned by seeing have been abandoned by seeing his effluents that should be abandoned by restraining have been abandoned by restraining his effluents that should be abandoned by using have been abandoned by using his effluents that should be abandoned by tolerating have been abandoned by tolerating his effluents that should be abandoned by avoiding have been abandoned by avoiding his effluents that should be abandoned by destroying have been abandoned by destroying his effluents that should be abandoned by developing have been abandoned by developing then he is called a monk who dwells restrained with the restraint of all the effluents
He has severed craving thrown off the fetters and  through the right penetration of conceit  has made an end of suffering  stress
And how is striving fruitful how is exertion fruitful
There is the case where a monk when not loaded down doesn't load himself down with pain nor does he reject pleasure that accords with the Dhamma although he is not infatuated with that pleasure
He discerns that 'When I exert a fabrication against this cause of stress then from the fabrication of exertion there is dispassion
When I look on with equanimity at that cause of stress then from the development of equanimity there is dispassion' So he exerts a mental fabrication against the cause of stress and develops equanimity with regard to the cause of stress Thus the stress is abolished  the stress is abolished
Suppose that a man is in love with a woman his mind ensnared with intense desire  passion
He sees her standing with another man chatting joking  laughing
What do you think monks Would he feel sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair
Yes lord Now suppose the thought were to occur to him 'I am in love with this woman When I see her standing with another man chatting joking  laughing I feel sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair
Why don't I abandon my desire  passion for that woman' So he abandons his desire  passion for that woman and afterwards sees her standing with another man chatting joking  laughing
What do you think monks Would he feel sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair
No lord In the same way the monk when not loaded down doesn't load himself down with pain nor does he reject pleasure that accords with the Dhamma although he is not infatuated with that pleasure He exerts a mental fabrication against the cause of stress and develops equanimity with regard to the cause of stress Thus the stress is abolished  the stress is abolished
Furthermore the monk notices this 'When I live according to my pleasure unskillful mental qualities increase in me  skillful qualities decline
When I exert myself with stress  pain though unskillful qualities decline in me  skillful qualities increase
Why don't I exert myself with stress  pain' So he exerts himself with stress  pain and while he is exerting himself with stress  pain unskillful qualities decline in him  skillful qualities increase
Then at a later time he would no longer exert himself with stress  pain
Why is that
Because he has attained the goal for which he was exerting himself with stress  pain
Suppose that a fletcher were to heat  warm an arrow shaft between two flames making it straight  pliable
Then at a later time he would no longer heat  warm the shaft between two flames making it straight  pliable
Why is that
Because he has attained the goal for which he was heating  warming the shaft In the same way the monk no longer exerts himself with stress  pain
Why is that
Because he has attained the goal for which he was exerting himself with stress  pain
Tell me dear sir how you crossed over the flood
I crossed over the flood without pushing forward without staying in place
But how did you cross over the flood without pushing forward without staying in place
When I pushed forward I was whirled about
When I stayed in place I sank
And so I crossed over the flood without pushing forward without staying in place

For the person who transgresses in one thing I tell you there is no evil deed that is not to be done
Which one thing
This telling a deliberate lie
At that time Ven
Rahula was staying at the Mango Stone
Then the Blessed One arising from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to where Ven
Rahula was staying at the Mango Stone
Ven
Rahula saw him coming from afar and on seeing him set out a seat  water for washing the feet
The Blessed One sat down on the seat set out and having sat down washed his feet
Ven
Rahula bowing down to the Blessed One sat to one side
Then the Blessed One having left a little bit of water in the water dipper said to Ven
Rahula Rahula do you see this little bit of leftover water remaining in the water dipper
Yes sir
That's how little of a contemplative there is in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie
Having tossed away the little bit of leftover water the Blessed One said to Ven
Rahula Rahula do you see how this little bit of leftover water is tossed away
Yes sir
Whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is tossed away just like that
Having turned the water dipper upside down the Blessed One said to Ven
Rahula Rahula do you see how this water dipper is turned upside down
Yes sir
Whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is turned upside down just like that
Having turned the water dipper rightside up the Blessed One said to Ven
Rahula Rahula do you see how empty  hollow this water dipper is
Yes sir
Whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is empty  hollow just like that
Rahula it's like a royal elephant immense pedigreed accustomed to battles its tusks like chariot poles
Having gone into battle it uses its forefeet  hindfeet its forequarters  hindquarters its head  ears  tusks  tail but will simply hold back its trunk
The elephant trainer notices that and thinks 'This royal elephant has not given up its life to the king' But when the royal elephant having gone into battle uses its forefeet  hindfeet its forequarters  hindquarters its head  ears  tusks  tail  his trunk the trainer notices that and thinks 'This royal elephant has given up its life to the king
There is nothing it will not do'
The same holds true with anyone who feels no shame in telling a deliberate lie There is no evil I tell you he will not do
Thus Rahula you should train yourself 'I will not tell a deliberate lie even in jest'
Then after the night had passed the Blessed One early in the morning put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe went to Prince Abhaya's home
On arrival he sat down on a seat made ready
Prince Abhaya with his own hand served  satisfied the Blessed One with fine staple  nonstaple foods
Then when the Blessed One had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl Prince Abhaya took a lower seat and sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord would the Tathagata say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to others
Prince there is no categorical yesorno answer to that
Then right here lord the Niganthas are destroyed
But prince why do you say 'Then right here lord the Niganthas are destroyed'
Just yesterday lord I went to Nigantha Nataputta and he said to me 'Come now prince
Go to Gotama the contemplative and on arrival say this Lord would the Tathagata say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to others If Gotama the contemplative thus asked answers The Tathagata would say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to others then you should say Then how is there any difference between you lord and runofthemill people
For even runofthemill people say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to others But if Gotama the contemplative thus asked answers The Tathagata would not say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to others then you should say Then how lord did you say of Devadatta that 'Devadatta is headed for destitution Devadatta is headed for hell Devadatta will boil for an eon Devadatta is incurable'
For Devadatta was upset  disgruntled at those words of yours When Gotama the contemplative is asked this twopronged question by you he won't be able to swallow it down or spit it up
Just as if a twohorned chestnut were stuck in a man's throat he would not be able to swallow it down or spit it up
In the same way when Gotama the contemplative is asked this twopronged question by you he won't be able to swallow it down or spit it up' Now at that time a baby boy was lying faceup on the prince's lap
So the Blessed One said to the prince What do you think prince If this young boy through your own negligence or that of the nurse were to take a stick or a piece of gravel into its mouth what would you do
I would take it out lord
If I couldn't get it out right away then holding its head in my left hand and crooking a finger of my right I would take it out even if it meant drawing blood
Why is that
Because I have sympathy for the young boy
In the same way prince
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be unfactual untrue unbeneficial unendearing  disagreeable to others he doesn't say them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true unbeneficial unendearing  disagreeable to others he doesn't say them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true beneficial but unendearing  disagreeable to others he has a sense of the proper time for saying them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be unfactual untrue unbeneficial but endearing  agreeable to others he doesn't say them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true unbeneficial but endearing  agreeable to others he doesn't say them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true beneficial and endearing  agreeable to others he has a sense of the proper time for saying them
Why is that
Because the Tathagata has sympathy for living beings
Vassakara the brahman the minister to the king of Magadha approached the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One I am of the view of the opinion that when anyone speaks of what he has seen 'Thus have I seen' there is no fault in that
When anyone speaks of what he has heard 'Thus have I heard' there is no fault in that
When anyone speaks of what he has sensed 'Thus have I sensed' there is no fault in that
When anyone speaks of what he has cognized 'Thus have I cognized' there is no fault in that
I don't say brahman that everything that has been seen should be spoken about
Nor do I say that everything that has been seen should not be spoken about
When for one who speaks of what has been seen unskillful mental qualities increase and skillful mental qualities decrease then that sort of thing should not be spoken about
But when for one who speaks of what has been seen unskillful mental qualities decrease and skillful mental qualities increase then that sort of thing should be spoken about

Then Vassakara the brahman delighting  rejoicing in the Blessed One's words got up from his seat and left
Visakha Now what is concentration what qualities are its themes what qualities are its requisites and what is its development
Sister Dhammadinna Singleness of mind is concentration the four frames of reference are its themes the four right exertions are its requisites and any cultivation development  pursuit of these qualities is its development
You should train yourself thus 'Goodwill as my awarenessrelease will be developed pursued given a means of transport given a grounding steadied consolidated  wellundertaken' That's how you should train yourself
When you have developed this concentration in this way you should develop this concentration with directed thought  evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  a modicum of evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  no evaluation you should develop it accompanied by rapture not accompanied by rapture endowed with a sense of enjoyment you should develop it endowed with equanimity
When this concentration is thus developed thus welldeveloped by you you should then train yourself thus 'Compassion as my awarenessrelease Appreciation as my awarenessrelease Equanimity as my awarenessrelease will be developed pursued given a means of transport given a grounding steadied consolidated  wellundertaken' That's how you should train yourself
When you have developed this concentration in this way you should develop this concentration with directed thought  evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  a modicum of evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  no evaluation you should develop it accompanied by rapture not accompanied by rapture endowed with a sense of enjoyment you should develop it endowed with equanimity
When this concentration is thus developed thus welldeveloped by you you should then train yourself thus 'I will remain focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world' That's how you should train yourself
When you have developed this concentration in this way you should develop this concentration with directed thought  evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  a modicum of evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  no evaluation you should develop it accompanied by rapture not accompanied by rapture endowed with a sense of enjoyment you should develop it endowed with equanimity
When this concentration is thus developed thus welldeveloped by you you should train yourself 'I will remain focused on feelings in  of themselves the mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world' That's how you should train yourself
When you have developed this concentration in this way you should develop this concentration with directed thought  evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  a modicum of evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  no evaluation you should develop it accompanied by rapture not accompanied by rapture endowed with a sense of enjoyment you should develop it endowed with equanimity
When this concentration is thus developed thus welldeveloped by you then wherever you go you will go in comfort
Wherever you stand you will stand in comfort
Wherever you sit you will sit in comfort
Wherever you lie down you will lie down in comfort
Having abandoned the five hindrances  imperfections of awareness that weaken discernment  the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelings mind mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
Just as if an elephant trainer were to plant a large post in the ground and were to bind a forest elephant to it by the neck in order to break it of its forest habits its forest memories  resolves its distraction fatigue  fever over leaving the forest to make it delight in the town and to inculcate in it habits congenial to human beings in the same way these four frames of reference are bindings for the awareness of the disciple of the noble ones to break him of his household habits his household memories  resolves his distraction fatigue  fever over leaving the household life for the attainment of the right method and the realization of Unbinding
Then the Tathagata trains him further 'Come monk remain focused on the body in  of itself but do not think any thoughts connected with the body
Remain focused on feelings in  of themselves but do not think any thoughts connected with feelings
Remain focused on the mind in  of itself but do not think any thoughts connected with mind
Remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves but do not think any thoughts connected with mental qualities' With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters the second jhana
Ananda there is the case of a monk who remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
As he remains thus focused on the body in  of itself a fever based on the body arises within his body or there is sluggishness in his awareness or his mind becomes scattered externally
He should then direct his mind to any inspiring theme
As his mind is directed to any inspiring theme delight arises within him
In one who feels delight rapture arises
In one whose mind is enraptured the body grows serene
His body serene he feels pleasure
As he feels pleasure his mind grows concentrated
He reflects 'I have attained the aim to which my mind was directed
Let me withdraw' He withdraws  engages neither in directed thought nor in evaluation
He discerns 'I am not thinking or evaluating
I am inwardly mindful  at ease'
This Ananda is development based on directing
And what is development based on not directing
A monk when not directing his mind to external things discerns 'My mind is not directed to external things
It is not attentive to what is in front or behind
It is released  undirected
And furthermore I remain focused on the body in  of itself
I am ardent alert mindful  at ease'
When not directing his mind to external things he discerns 'My mind is not directed to external things
It is not attentive to what is in front or behind
It is released  undirected
And furthermore I remain focused on feelings mind mental qualities in  of themselves
I am ardent alert mindful  at ease'
This Ananda is development based on not directing
Now how is mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination
There is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore
Always mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
 Breathing in long he discerns 'I am breathing in long' or breathing out long he discerns 'I am breathing out long' Or breathing in short he discerns 'I am breathing in short' or breathing out short he discerns 'I am breathing out short' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication'
 He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to rapture and to breathe out sensitive to rapture
He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to pleasure and to breathe out sensitive to pleasure
He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to mental fabrications and to breathe out sensitive to mental fabrications
He trains himself to breathe in calming mental fabrication and to breathe out calming mental fabrication
 He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the mind and to breathe out sensitive to the mind
He trains himself to breathe in satisfying the mind and to breathe out satisfying the mind
He trains himself to breathe in steadying the mind and to breathe out steadying the mind
He trains himself to breathe in releasing the mind and to breathe out releasing the mind
 He trains himself to breathe in focusing on inconstancy and to breathe out focusing on inconstancy
He trains himself to breathe in focusing on dispassion and to breathe out focusing on dispassion
He trains himself to breathe in focusing on cessation and to breathe out focusing on cessation
He trains himself to breathe in focusing on relinquishment and to breathe out focusing on relinquishment
 Now on whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns that he is breathing in long or breathing out long discerns that he is breathing out long or breathing in short discerns that he is breathing in short or breathing out short discerns that he is breathing out short trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to the entire body trains himself to breathe in  out calming bodily fabrication On that occasion the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
I tell you monks that this  the inout breath  is classed as a body among bodies which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to rapture trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to pleasure trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to mental fabrication trains himself to breathe in  out calming mental fabrication On that occasion the monk remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
I tell you monks that this  close attention to inout breaths  is classed as a feeling among feelings which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
 On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to the mind trains himself to breathe in  out satisfying the mind trains himself to breathe in  out steadying the mind trains himself to breathe in  out releasing the mind On that occasion the monk remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
I don't say that there is mindfulness of inout breathing in one of confused mindfulness and no alertness which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
 On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in  out focusing on inconstancy trains himself to breathe in  out focusing on dispassion trains himself to breathe in  out focusing on cessation trains himself to breathe in  out focusing on relinquishment On that occasion the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
He who sees clearly with discernment the abandoning of greed  distress is one who oversees with equanimity which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
This is how mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination
A monk endowed with these five qualities is incapable of entering  remaining in right concentration

A monk endowed with these five qualities is not capable of entering  remaining in right concentration
A monk endowed with these five qualities is capable of entering  remaining in right concentration
Which five
He can withstand sights sounds aromas tastes tactile sensations

Sensual desire ill will sloth  drowsiness restlessness  anxiety uncertainty and not seeing well with right discernment as they actually are present the drawbacks of sensual pleasures
A monk who has not abandoned these six qualities is incapable of entering  remaining in the first jhana

Which six
There is the case where a monk is skilled in the attaining of concentration in the maintenance of concentration  in the exit from concentration
He is deliberate in doing it persevering in doing it and amenable to doing it
A monk endowed with these six qualities is capable of mastering strength in concentration
When a monk is intent on the heightened mind there are five themes he should attend to at the appropriate times
Which five
There is the case where evil unskillful thoughts  connected with desire aversion or delusion  arise in a monk while he is referring to  attending to a particular theme
He should attend to another theme apart from that one connected with what is skillful
When he is attending to this other theme those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned  subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it  concentrates it
Just as a skilled carpenter or his apprentice would use a small peg to knock out drive out  pull out a large one in the same way he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it  concentrates it
If evil unskillful thoughts  connected with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is attending to this other theme connected with what is skillful he should scrutinize the drawbacks of those thoughts 'Truly these thoughts of mine are unskillful blameworthy these thoughts of mine result in stress' As he is scrutinizing their drawbacks those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned  subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it  concentrates it
Just as a young woman  or man  fond of adornment would be horrified humiliated  disgusted if the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human being were hung from her neck in the same way the monk steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it  concentrates it
If evil unskillful thoughts  connected with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts he should pay no mind  pay no attention to those thoughts
As he is paying no mind  paying no attention to them those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned  subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it  concentrates it
Just as a man with good eyes not wanting to see forms that had come into range would close his eyes or look away in the same way the monk steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it  concentrates it
If evil unskillful thoughts  connected with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is paying no mind  paying no attention to those thoughts he should attend to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts
As he is attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned  subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it  concentrates it
Just as the thought would occur to a man walking quickly 'Why am I walking quickly
Why don't I walk slowly' So he walks slowly
The thought occurs to him 'Why am I walking slowly
Why don't I stand' So he stands
The thought occurs to him 'Why am I standing
Why don't I sit down' So he sits down
The thought occurs to him 'Why am I sitting
Why don't I lie down' So he lies down
In this way giving up the grosser posture he takes up the more refined one
In the same way the monk steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it  concentrates it
If evil unskillful thoughts  connected with desire aversion or delusion  still arise in the monk while he is attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts then  with his teeth clenched  his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth  he should beat down constrain  crush his mind with his awareness
As  with his teeth clenched  his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth  he is beating down constraining  crushing his mind with his awareness those evil unskillful thoughts are abandoned  subside
With their abandoning he steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it  concentrates it
Just as a strong man seizing a weaker man by the head or the throat or the shoulders would beat him down constrain  crush him in the same way the monk steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it  concentrates it
Now when a monk attending to another theme scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts paying no mind  paying no attention to those thoughts attending to the relaxing of thoughtfabrication with regard to those thoughts beating down constraining  crushing his mind with his awareness steadies his mind right within settles it unifies it  concentrates it He is then called a monk with mastery over the ways of thought sequences
He thinks whatever thought he wants to and doesn't think whatever thought he doesn't
He has severed craving thrown off the fetters and  through the right penetration of conceit  has made an end of suffering  stress
There are these gross impurities in gold dirty sand gravel  grit
The dirtwasher or his apprentice having placed in a vat washes it again  again until he has washed them away
When he is rid of them there remain the moderate impurities in the gold coarse sand  fine grit
He washes the gold again  again until he has washed them away
When he is rid of them there remain the fine impurities in the gold fine sand  black dust
The dirtwasher or his apprentice washes the gold again  again until he has washed them away
When he is rid of them there remains just the gold dust
The goldsmith or his apprentice having placed it in a crucible blows on it again  again to blow away the dross
The gold as long as it has not been blown on again  again to the point where the impurities are blown away as long as it is not refined  free from dross is not pliant malleable or luminous
It is brittle and not ready to be worked
But there comes a time when the goldsmith or his apprentice has blown on the gold again  again until the dross is blown away
The gold is then refined free from dross pliant malleable  luminous
It is not brittle and is ready to be worked
Then whatever sort of ornament he has in mind  whether a belt an earring a necklace or a gold chain  the gold would serve his purpose
In the same way there are these gross impurities in a monk intent on heightened mind misconduct in body speech  mind
These the monk  aware  able by nature  abandons destroys dispels wipes out of existence
When he is rid of them there remain in him the moderate impurities thoughts of sensuality ill will  harmfulness
These he wipes out of existence
When he is rid of them there remain in him the fine impurities thoughts of his caste thoughts of his home district thoughts related to not wanting to be despised
These he wipes out of existence
When he is rid of them there remain only thoughts of the Dhamma
His concentration is neither calm nor refined it has not yet attained serenity or unity and is kept in place by the fabrication of forceful restraint
But there comes a time when his mind grows steady inwardly settles down grows unified  concentrated
His concentration is calm  refined has attained serenity  unity and is no longer kept in place by the fabrication of forceful restraint
Then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know  realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening
There are these four developments of concentration
Which four
There is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to a pleasant abiding in the here  now
There is the development of concentration that leads to the attainment of knowledge  vision
There is the development of concentration that leads to mindfulness  alertness
There is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to the ending of the effluents
And what is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to a pleasant abiding in the here  now
There is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
This is the development of concentration that leads to a pleasant abiding in the here  now
And what is the development of concentration that leads to the attainment of knowledge  vision
There is the case where a monk attends to the perception of light and is resolved on the perception of daytime
Day is the same as night night is the same as day
By means of an awareness open  unhampered he develops a brightened mind
This is the development of concentration that leads to the attainment of knowledge  vision
And what is the development of concentration that leads to mindfulness  alertness
There is the case where feelings are known to the monk as they arise known as they persist known as they subside
Perceptions are known to him as they arise known as they persist known as they subside
Thoughts are known to him as they arise known as they persist known as they subside
This is the development of concentration that leads to mindfulness  alertness
And what is the development of concentration that leads to the ending of the effluents
There is the case where a monk remains focused on arising  falling away with reference to the five aggregates for sustenanceclinging 'Such is form such its origination such its disappearance
Such is feeling Such is perception Such are fabrications Such is consciousness such its origination such its disappearance' This is the development of concentration that leads to the ending of the effluents
These are the four developments of concentration
Now what monks is fivefactored noble right concentration
There is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal
Just as if a skilled bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together sprinkling it again  again with water so that his ball of bath powder  saturated moistureladen permeated within  without  would nevertheless not drip even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of withdrawal
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal
This is the first development of the fivefactored noble right concentration
Furthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of composure
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born of composure
Just like a lake with springwater welling up from within having no inflow from east west north or south and with the skies periodically supplying abundant showers so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate  pervade suffuse  fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of composure
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born of composure
This is the second development of the fivefactored noble right concentration
And furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture
Just as in a blue white or redlotus pond there may be some of the blue white or red lotuses which born  growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated  pervaded suffused  filled with cool water from their roots to their tips and nothing of those blue white or red lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water even so the monk permeates this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture
This is the third development of the fivefactored noble right concentration
And furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure  stress  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain
He sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awareness
Just as if a man were sitting wrapped from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating his body with a pure bright awareness
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awareness
This is the fourth development of the fivefactored noble right concentration
And furthermore the monk has his theme of reflection well in hand well attended to well considered well tuned by means of discernment
Just as if one person were to reflect on another or a standing person were to reflect on a sitting person or a sitting person were to reflect on a person lying down even so monks the monk has his theme of reflection well in hand well attended to well pondered well tuned by means of discernment
This is the fifth development of the fivefactored noble right concentration
When a monk has developed  pursued the fivefactored noble right concentration in this way then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know  realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening
Imagine a water jar set on a stand brimful of water so that a crow could drink from it
If a strong man were to tip it in any way at all would water spill out
In the same way when a monk has developed  pursued the fivefactored noble right concentration in this way then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know  realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening
Imagine a rectangular water tank  set on level ground bounded by dikes  brimful of water so that a crow could drink from it
If a strong man were to loosen the dikes anywhere at all would water spill out
Imagine a chariot on level ground at four crossroads harnessed to thoroughbreds waiting with whips lying ready so that a skilled driver a trainer of tamable horses might mount and  taking the reins with his left hand and the whip with his right  drive out  back to whatever place and by whichever road he liked in the same way when a monk has developed  pursued the fivefactored noble right concentration in this way then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know  realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening
Vassakara Once Ven
Ananda Ven
Gotama was living at Vesali in the Hall with the peaked roof in the Great Forest
I went to where he was staying in the Great Forest and there he spoke in a variety of ways on jhana
Ven
Gotama was both endowed with jhana and made jhana his habit
In fact he praised all sorts of jhana
Ananda It wasn't the case that the Blessed One praised all sorts of jhana nor did he criticize all sorts of jhana
And what sort of jhana didn't he praise
There is the case where a certain person dwells with his awareness overcome by sensual passion obsessed with sensual passion
He doesn't discern the escape as it actually is present from sensual passion once it has arisen
Making that sensual passion the focal point he absorbs himself with it besorbs resorbs  supersorbs himself with it
He dwells with his awareness overcome by ill will sloth  drowsiness restlessness  anxiety uncertainty obsessed with uncertainty
He doesn't discern the escape as it actually is present from uncertainty once it has arisen
Making that uncertainty the focal point he absorbs himself with it besorbs resorbs  supersorbs himself with it
This is the sort of jhana that the Blessed One did not praise
And what sort of jhana did he praise
There is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana the second jhana the third jhana the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
This is the sort of jhana that the Blessed One praised
Vassakara It would seem Ven
Ananda that the Ven
Gotama criticized the jhana that deserves criticism and praised that which deserves praise
Suppose there was a mountain cow  foolish inexperienced unfamiliar with her pasture unskilled in roaming on rugged mountains  and she were to think 'What if I were to go in a direction I have never gone before to eat grass I have never eaten before to drink water I have never drunk before' She would lift her hind hoof without having placed her front hoof firmly and would not get to go in a direction she had never gone before to eat grass she had never eaten before or to drink water she had never drunk before
And as for the place where she was standing when the thought occurred to her 'What if I were to go where I have never been before to drink water I have never drunk before' she would not return there safely
Why is that
Because she is a foolish inexperienced mountain cow unfamiliar with her pasture unskilled in roaming on rugged mountains
In the same way there are cases where a monk  foolish inexperienced unfamiliar with his pasture unskilled in entering  remaining in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation  doesn't stick with that theme doesn't develop it pursue it or establish himself firmly in it
The thought occurs to him 'What if I with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations were to enter  remain in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance' He is not able to enter  remain in the second jhana The thought occurs to him 'What if I were to enter  remain in the first jhana He is not able to enter  remain in the first jhana
This is called a monk who has slipped  fallen from both sides like the mountain cow foolish inexperienced unfamiliar with her pasture unskilled in roaming on rugged mountains
But suppose there was a mountain cow  wise experienced familiar with her pasture skilled in roaming on rugged mountains  and she were to think 'What if I were to go in a direction I have never gone before to eat grass I have never eaten before to drink water I have never drunk before' She would lift her hind hoof only after having placed her front hoof firmly and would get to go in a direction she had never gone before to drink water she had never drunk before
And as for the place where she was standing when the thought occurred to her 'What if I were to go in a direction I have never gone before to drink water I have never drunk before' she would return there safely
Why is that
Because she is a wise experienced mountain cow familiar with her pasture skilled in roaming on rugged mountains
In the same way there are some cases where a monk  wise experienced familiar with his pasture skilled in entering  remaining in the first jhana sticks with that theme develops it pursues it  establishes himself firmly in it
The thought occurs to him 'What if I were to enter  remain in the second jhana ' Without jumping at the second jhana he  with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations  enters  remains in the second jhana
He sticks with that theme develops it pursues it  establishes himself firmly in it
The thought occurs to him 'What if I were to enter  remain in the third jhana' Without jumping at the third jhana he enters  remains in the third jhana
He sticks with that theme develops it pursues it  establishes himself firmly in it
The thought occurs to him 'What if I were to enter  remain in the fourth jhana' Without jumping at the fourth jhana he enters  remains in the fourth jhana
He sticks with that theme develops it pursues it  establishes himself firmly in it
The thought occurs to him 'What if I with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity thinking Infinite space were to enter  remain in the dimension of the infinitude of space' Without jumping at the dimension of the infinitude of space he enters  remains in dimension of the infinitude of space
He sticks with that theme develops it pursues it  establishes himself firmly in it
The thought occurs to him 'What if I with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space thinking Infinite consciousness were to enter  remain in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness' Without jumping at the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness he enters  remains in dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
He sticks with that theme develops it pursues it  establishes himself firmly in it
The thought occurs to him 'What if I with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness thinking There is nothing were to enter  remain in the dimension of nothingness' Without jumping at the dimension of nothingness he enters  remains in dimension of nothingness
He sticks with that theme develops it pursues it  establishes himself firmly in it
The thought occurs to him 'What if I with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness were to enter  remain in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception' Without jumping at the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception he enters  remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
He sticks with that theme develops it pursues it  establishes himself firmly in it
The thought occurs to him 'What if I with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception were to enter  remain in the cessation of perception  feeling' Without jumping at the cessation of perception  feeling he enters  remains in the cessation of perception  feeling
When a monk enters  emerges from that very attainment his mind is pliant  malleable
With his pliant malleable mind limitless concentration is well developed
With his well developed limitless concentration then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know  realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening
Suppose that an archer or archer's apprentice were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay so that after a while he would become able to shoot long distances to fire accurate shots in rapid succession and to pierce great masses
In the same way there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born of withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perception fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness notself
He turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness 'This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding'
Staying right there he reaches the ending of the mental effluents
Or if not then  through this very dhammapassion this very dhammadelight and from the total wasting away of the first five of the Fetters  he is due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that world
Three types of discernment
This is the way leading to discernment when visiting a brahman or contemplative to ask 'What is skillful venerable sir
What is unskillful
What is blameworthy
What is blameless
What should be cultivated
What should not be cultivated
What having been done by me will be for my longterm harm  suffering
Or what having been done by me will be for my longterm welfare  happiness'
And what is the food for the arising of unarisen analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening or for the growth  increase of analysis of qualities once it has arisen
There are mental qualities that are skillful  unskillful blameworthy  blameless gross  refined siding with darkness  with light
To foster appropriate attention to them This is the food for the arising of unarisen analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening or for the growth  increase of analysis of qualities once it has arisen
And what is the right view that has effluents sides with merit  results in acquisitions
'There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificed
There are fruits  results of good  bad actions
There is this world  the next world
There is mother  father
There are spontaneously reborn beings there are brahmans  contemplatives who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves' This is the right view that has effluents sides with merit  results in acquisitions
And what is the right view that is without effluents transcendent a factor of the path
The discernment the faculty of discernment the strength of discernment analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening the path factor of right view in one developing the noble path whose mind is noble whose mind is free from effluents who is fully possessed of the noble path
This is the right view that is without effluents transcendent a factor of the path
And what is the right resolve that has effluents sides with merit  results in acquisitions
Being resolved on renunciation on freedom from ill will on harmlessness
This is the right resolve that has effluents sides with merit  results in acquisitions
And what is the right resolve that is without effluents transcendent a factor of the path
The thinking directed thinking resolve mental absorption mental fixity focused awareness  verbal fabrications in one developing the noble path whose mind is noble whose mind is without effluents who is fully possessed of the noble path
This is the right resolve that is without effluents transcendent a factor of the path
One tries to abandon wrong resolve  to enter into right resolve This is one's right effort
One is mindful to abandon wrong resolve  to enter  remain in right resolve This is one's right mindfulness
Thus these three qualities  right view right effort  right mindfulness  run  circle around right resolve
And what is the faculty of discernment
There is the case where a monk a disciple of the noble ones is discerning endowed with discernment of arising  passing away  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress
He discerns as it has come to be 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress' This is called the faculty of discernment

'Stress should be known
The cause by which stress comes into play should be known
The diversity in stress should be known
The result of stress should be known
The cessation of stress should be known
The path of practice for the cessation of stress should be known' Thus it has been said
Why was it said
Birth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are stressful association with what is not loved is stressful separation from what is loved is stressful not getting what is wanted is stressful
In short the five aggregates for sustenance are stressful
And what is the cause by which stress comes into play
Craving is the cause by which stress comes into play
And what is the diversity in stress
There is major stress  minor slowly fading  quickly fading
This is called the diversity in stress
And what is the result of stress
There are some cases in which a person overcome with pain his mind exhausted grieves mourns laments beats his breast  becomes bewildered
Or one overcome with pain his mind exhausted comes to search outside 'Who knows a way or two to stop this pain' I tell you monks that stress results either in bewilderment or in search
And what is the cessation of stress
From the cessation of craving is the cessation of stress and just this noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress right view right aspiration right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
Kaccayana 'Lord Right view right view it is said
To what extent is there right view'
The Buddha 'By  large Kaccayana this world is supported by a polarity that of existence  nonexistence
But when one sees the origination of the world as it actually is with right discernment nonexistence with reference to the world does not occur to one
When one sees the cessation of the world as it actually is with right discernment existence with reference to the world does not occur to one
'By  large Kaccayana this world is in bondage to attachments clingings  biases
But one such as this does not get involved with or cling to these attachments clingings fixations of awareness biases or latent tendencies nor is he resolved on my self He has no uncertainty or doubt that when there is arising only stress is arising and that when there is passing away stress is passing away
In this one's knowledge is independent of others
It is to this extent Kaccayana that there is right view'
Then Anathapindika the householder went to where the wanderers of other persuasions were staying
On arrival he greeted them courteously
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there the wanderers said to him 'Tell us householder what views Gotama the contemplative has'
'Venerable sirs I don't know entirely what views the Blessed One has'
'Well well
So you don't know entirely what views Gotama the contemplative has
Then tell us what views the monks have'
'I don't even know entirely what views the monks have'
'So you don't know entirely what views Gotama the contemplative has or even that the monks have
Then tell us what views you have'
'It wouldn't be difficult for me to expound to you what views I have
But please let the venerable ones expound each in line with his position and then it won't be difficult for me to expound to you what views I have'
When this had been said one of the wanderers said to Anathapindika the householder 'The cosmos is eternal
Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
This is the sort of view I have'
Another wanderer said to Anathapindika 'The cosmos is not eternal
Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
This is the sort of view I have'
Another wanderer said 'The cosmos is finite''The cosmos is infinite''The soul  the body are the same''The soul is one thing and the body another''After death a Tathagata exists''After death a Tathagata does not exist''After death a Tathagata both does  does not exist''After death a Tathagata neither does nor does not exist
Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
This is the sort of view I have'
When this had been said Anathapindika the householder said to the wanderers 'As for the venerable one who says The cosmos is eternal
Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
This is the sort of view I have his view arises from his own inappropriate attention or in dependence on the words of another
Now this view has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently coarisen
Whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently coarisen that is inconstant
Whatever is inconstant is stress
This venerable one thus adheres to that very stress submits himself to that very stress' 
When this had been said the wanderers said to Anathapindika the householder 'We have each  every one expounded to you in line with our own positions
Now tell us what views you have'
'Whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently coarisen that is inconstant
Whatever is inconstant is stress
Whatever is stress is not mine is not what I am is not my self
This is the sort of view I have'
'So householder whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently coarisen that is inconstant
Whatever is inconstant is stress
You thus adhere to that very stress submit yourself to that very stress'
'Venerable sirs whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently coarisen that is inconstant
Whatever is inconstant is stress
Whatever is stress is not mine is not what I am is not my self
Having seen this well with right discernment as it actually is present I also discern the higher escape from it as it actually is present'
When this had been said the wanderers fell silent abashed sitting with their shoulders drooping their heads down brooding at a loss for words
Anathapindika the householder perceiving that the wanderers were silent abashed at a loss for words got up  left
Just as the ocean has a single taste  that of salt  in the same way this Dhamma  Discipline has a single taste that of release
Defiled by passion the mind is not released
Defiled by ignorance discernment does not develop
Thus from the fading of passion is there awarenessrelease
From the fading of ignorance is there discernmentrelease

If he wants then through the ending of the mental effluents he enters  remains in the effluentfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known and realized them for himself right in the here  now
He can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening
And how is the awarenessrelease through good will developed what is its destiny what is its excellence its reward  its consummation
There is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening accompanied by good will dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting go
He develops analysis of qualities persistence rapture serenity concentration equanimity as a factor for awakening accompanied by good will dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting go
If he wants he remains percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome
If he wants he remains percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome
If he wants he remains percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome  what is
If he wants he remains percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not
If he wants  in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not  cutting himself off from both he remains equanimous alert  mindful
Or he may enter  remain in the beautiful liberation
I tell you monks the awarenessrelease through good will has the beautiful as its excellence  in the case of one who has penetrated to no higher release
And how is the awarenessrelease through compassion developed what is its destiny what is its excellence its reward  its consummation
There is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening accompanied by compassion etc If he wants  in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not  cutting himself off from both he remains equanimous alert  mindful
Or with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity 'Infinite space' he enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space
I tell you monks the awarenessrelease through compassion has the dimension of the infinitude of space as its excellence  in the case of one who has penetrated to no higher release
And how is the awarenessrelease through appreciation developed what is its destiny what is its excellence its reward  its consummation
There is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening accompanied by appreciation etc If he wants  in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not  cutting himself off from both he remains equanimous alert  mindful
Or with the complete transcending of the dimension of infinitude of space thinking 'Infinite consciousness' he enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
I tell you monks the awarenessrelease through appreciation has the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness as its excellence  in the case of one who has penetrated to no higher release
And how is the awarenessrelease through equanimity developed what is its destiny what is its excellence its reward  its consummation
There is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening accompanied by equanimity etc If he wants  in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not  cutting himself off from both he remains equanimous alert  mindful
Or with the complete transcending of the dimension of infinitude of consciousness thinking 'There is nothing' he enters  remains in the dimension of nothingness
I tell you monks the awarenessrelease through equanimity has the dimension of nothingness as its excellence  in the case of one who has penetrated to no higher release
Monks these six properties are means of escape
Which six
There is the case where a monk might say 'Although good will has been developed pursued handed the reins taken as a basis steadied consolidated and wellundertaken by me as my awarenessrelease still ill will keeps overpowering my mind' He should be told 'Don't say that
You shouldn't speak in that way
Don't misrepresent the Blessed One for it's not right to misrepresent the Blessed One and the Blessed One wouldn't say that
It's impossible there is no way that  when good will has been developed pursued handed the reins taken as a basis steadied consolidated and wellundertaken as an awarenessrelease  ill will would still keep overpowering the mind
That possibility doesn't exist for this is the escape from ill will good will as an awarenessrelease'
Furthermore there is the case where a monk might say 'Although compassion has been developed pursued handed the reins taken as a basis steadied consolidated and wellundertaken by me as my awarenessrelease still viciousness keeps overpowering my mind' He should be told 'Don't say that It's impossible there is no way that  when compassion has been developed pursued handed the reins taken as a basis steadied consolidated and wellundertaken as an awarenessrelease  viciousness would still keep overpowering the mind
That possibility doesn't exist for this is the escape from viciousness compassion as an awarenessrelease'
Furthermore there is the case where a monk might say 'Although appreciation has been developed pursued handed the reins taken as a basis steadied consolidated and wellundertaken by me as my awarenessrelease still resentment keeps overpowering my mind' He should be told 'Don't say that It's impossible there is no way that  when appreciation has been developed pursued handed the reins taken as a basis steadied consolidated and wellundertaken as an awarenessrelease  resentment would still keep overpowering the mind
That possibility doesn't exist for this is the escape from resentment appreciation as an awarenessrelease'
Furthermore there is the case where a monk might say 'Although equanimity has been developed pursued handed the reins taken as a basis steadied consolidated and wellundertaken by me as my awarenessrelease still passion keeps overpowering my mind' He should be told 'Don't say that It's impossible there is no way that  when equanimity has been developed pursued handed the reins taken as a basis steadied consolidated and wellundertaken as an awarenessrelease  passion would still keep overpowering the mind
That possibility doesn't exist for this is the escape from passion equanimity as an awarenessrelease'
Furthermore there is the case where a monk might say 'Although the signless has been developed pursued handed the reins taken as a basis steadied consolidated and wellundertaken by me as my awarenessrelease still my consciousness follows the drift of signs' He should be told 'Don't say that It's impossible there is no way that  when the signless has been developed pursued handed the reins taken as a basis steadied consolidated and wellundertaken as an awarenessrelease  consciousness would follow the drift of signs
That possibility doesn't exist for this is the escape from all signs the signless as an awarenessrelease'
Furthermore there is the case where a monk might say 'Although I am is gone and I do not assume that I am this still the arrow of uncertainty  perplexity keeps overpowering my mind' He should be told 'Don't say that
You shouldn't speak in that way
Don't misrepresent the Blessed One for it's not right to misrepresent the Blessed One and the Blessed One wouldn't say that
It's impossible there is no way that  when I am is gone and I am this is not assumed  the arrow of uncertainty  perplexity would keep overpowering the mind
That possibility doesn't exist for this is the escape from the arrow of uncertainty  perplexity the uprooting of the conceit I am'
These monks are six properties that are means of escape
On one occasion Ven
Godatta was living near Macchikasanda in the Wild Mango Grove
Then Citta the householder went to him and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there Ven
Godatta said to him Householder the immeasurable awarenessrelease the nothingness awarenessrelease the emptiness awarenessrelease the themeless awarenessrelease Are these phenomena different in meaning and different in name or are they one in meaning and different only in name
Venerable sir there is a line of reasoning by which these phenomena are different in meaning and different in name and there is a line of reasoning by which they are one in meaning and different only in name
And what is the line of reasoning by which they are different in meaning and different in name
There is the case where a monk keeps pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with good will likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth
Thus above below  all around everywhere in its entirety he keeps pervading the allencompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with good will  abundant expansive immeasurable without hostility without ill will
He keeps pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with compassion appreciation equanimity likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth
Thus above below  all around everywhere in its entirety he keeps pervading the allencompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with equanimity  abundant expansive immeasurable without hostility without ill will
This is called the immeasurable awarenessrelease
And what is the nothingness awarenessrelease
There is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness 'There is nothing' enters  remains in the dimension of nothingness
This is called the nothingness awarenessrelease
And what is the emptiness awarenessrelease
There is the case where a monk having gone into the wilderness to the root of a tree or into an empty dwelling considers this 'This is empty of self or of anything pertaining to self' This is called the emptiness awarenessrelease
And what is the themeless awarenessrelease
There is the case where a monk not attending to any theme enters  remains in the themeless concentration of awareness
This is called the themeless awarenessrelease
This venerable sir is the line of reasoning by which these phenomena are different in meaning and different in name
And what venerable sir is the line of reasoning by which they are one in meaning and different only in name
Passion venerable sir is a making of measurement aversion a making of measurement delusion a making of measurement
For a monk whose fermentations are ended these have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
To the extent that there are immeasurable awarenessreleases the unprovoked awarenessrelease is declared supreme
And that unprovoked awarenessrelease is empty of passion empty of aversion empty of delusion
Passion is a something aversion a something delusion a something
For a monk whose fermentations are ended these have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
To the extent that there are nothingness awarenessreleases the unprovoked awarenessrelease is declared supreme
And that unprovoked awarenessrelease is empty of passion empty of aversion empty of delusion
Passion is a making of themes aversion a making of themes delusion a making of themes
For a monk whose fermentations are ended these have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
To the extent that there are themeless awarenessreleases the unprovoked awarenessrelease is declared supreme
And that unprovoked awarenessrelease is empty of passion empty of aversion empty of delusion
This venerable sir is the line of reasoning by which these phenomena are one in meaning and different only in name
It's a gain for you householder a great gain what your eye of discernment plumbs in the deep word of the Buddha
'Discernmentreleased discernmentreleased' it is said
To what extent is one described by the Blessed One as discernmentreleased
There is the case my friend where a monk withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
And he knows it through discernment
It's to this extent that one is described with explication by the Blessed One as discernmentreleased

'Released both ways released both ways' it is said
To what extent is one described by the Blessed One as released both ways
There is the case my friend where a monk withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
He remains touching with his body in whatever way there is an opening there and he knows it through discernment
It's to this extent that one is described with explication by the Blessed One as released both ways
'
Then on the attainment of arahantship this thought occurred to Ven
Sona What if I were to go to the Blessed One and on arrival to declare gnosis in his presence So he then went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One When a monk is an arahant with his fermentations ended one who has reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and is released through right gnosis he is dedicated to six things renunciation seclusion nonafflictiveness the ending of craving the ending of clingingsustenance  nondeludedness
Now it may occur to a certain venerable one to think 'Perhaps it is entirely dependent on conviction that this venerable one is dedicated to renunciation' but it should not be seen in that way
The monk whose fermentations are ended having fulfilled does not see in himself anything further to do or anything further to add to what he has done
It is because of the ending of passion because of his being free of passion that he is dedicated to renunciation
It is because of the ending of aversion because of his being free of aversion that he is dedicated to renunciation
It is because of the ending of delusion because of his being free of delusion that he is dedicated to renunciation
Now it may occur to a certain venerable one to think 'Perhaps it is because he desires gain honor  fame that this venerable one is dedicated to seclusion' 'Perhaps it is because he falls back on attachment to precepts  practices as being essential that he is dedicated to nonafflictiveness' but it should not be seen in that way
The monk whose fermentations are ended having fulfilled does not see in himself anything further to do or anything further to add to what he has done
It is because of the ending of passion because of his being free of passion that he is dedicated to nonafflictiveness
It is because of the ending of aversion because of his being free of aversion that he is dedicated to nonafflictiveness
It is because of the ending of delusion because of his being free of delusion that he is dedicated to nonafflictiveness
It is because of the ending of passion because of his being free of passion because of the ending of aversion because of his being free of aversion because of the ending of delusion because of his being free of delusion that he is dedicated to the ending of craving to the ending of clingingsustenance to nondeludedness
Even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into the visual range of a monk whose mind is thus rightly released his mind is neither overpowered nor even engaged
Being still having reached imperturbability he focuses on their passing away
And even if powerful sounds aromas flavors tactile sensations Even if powerful ideas cognizable by the intellect come into the mental range of a monk whose mind is thus rightly released his mind is neither overpowered nor even engaged
Being still having reached imperturbability he focuses on their passing away
Just as if there were a mountain of rock  without cracks without fissures one solid mass  and then from the east there were to come a powerful storm of wind  rain the mountain would neither shiver nor quiver nor shake
And then from the west the north the south there were to come a powerful storm of wind  rain the mountain would neither shiver nor quiver nor shake
In the same way even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into the visual range of a monk whose mind is thus rightly released his mind is neither overpowered nor even engaged
Being still having reached imperturbability he focuses on their passing away
And even if powerful sounds aromas flavors tactile sensations Even if powerful ideas cognizable by the intellect come into the mental range of a monk whose mind is thus rightly released his mind is neither overpowered nor even engaged
Being still having reached imperturbability he focuses on their passing away
Just as if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen  clear limpid and unsullied  where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells gravel and pebbles and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting and it would occur to him 'This pool of water is clear limpid and unsullied
Here are these shells gravel and pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting' In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability  the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental effluents
He discerns as it has come to be that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are mental effluents This is the origination of effluents This is the cessation of effluents This is the way leading to the cessation of effluents' His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the effluent of sensuality the effluent of becoming the effluent of ignorance
With release there is the knowledge 'Released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
Vision arose clear knowing arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before 'This is the noble truth of stress This noble truth of stress is to be comprehended This noble truth of stress has been comprehended This is the noble truth of the origination of stress This noble truth of the origination of stress is to be abandoned This noble truth of the origination of stress has been abandoned This is the noble truth of the cessation of stress This noble truth of the cessation of stress is to be realized This noble truth of the cessation of stress has been realized This is the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress This noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress is to be developed This noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress has been developed'
And monks as long as this knowledge  vision of mine  with its three rounds  twelve permutations concerning these four noble truths as they actually are  was not pure I did not claim to have directly awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening But as soon as this knowledge  vision of mine  with its three rounds  twelve permutations concerning these four noble truths as they actually are  was truly pure only then did I claim to have directly awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening The knowledge  vision arose in me 'Unshakable is my release
This is the last birth
There is now no further becoming'
What a Tathagata sees is this 'Such is form such its origin such its disappearance such is feeling such its origin such its disappearance such is perceptionsuch are mental fabricationssuch is consciousness such its origin such its disappearance' Because of this I say a Tathagata  with the ending fading out cessation renunciation  relinquishment of all construings all excogitations all Imaking  minemaking  obsessions with conceit  is through lack of clingingsustenance released
But Master Gotama the monk whose mind is thus released Where does he reappear
'Reappear' Vaccha doesn't apply
In that case Master Gotama he does not reappear
'Does not reappear' Vaccha doesn't apply
both does  does not reappear
doesn't apply
neither does nor does not reappear
doesn't apply
How is it Master Gotama when Master Gotama is asked if the monk reappears does not reappear both does  does not reappear neither does nor does not reappear he says ' doesn't apply' in each case
At this point Master Gotama I am befuddled at this point confused
The modicum of clarity coming to me from your earlier conversation is now obscured
Of course you're befuddled Vaccha
Of course you're confused
Deep Vaccha is this phenomenon hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wise
For those with other views other practices other satisfactions other aims other teachers it is difficult to know
That being the case I will now put some questions to you
Answer as you see fit
How do you construe this Vaccha If a fire were burning in front of you would you know that 'This fire is burning in front of me'
yes And suppose someone were to ask you Vaccha 'This fire burning in front of you dependent on what is it burning' Thus asked how would you reply
I would reply 'This fire burning in front of me is burning dependent on grass  timber as its sustenance' If the fire burning in front of you were to go out would you know that 'This fire burning in front of me has gone out'
yes And suppose someone were to ask you 'This fire that has gone out in front of you in which direction from here has it gone
East
West
North
Or south' Thus asked how would you reply
That doesn't apply Master Gotama
Any fire burning dependent on a sustenance of grass  timber being unnourished  from having consumed that sustenance and not being offered any other  is classified simply as 'out'
Even so Vaccha any physical form by which one describing the Tathagata would describe him That the Tathagata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Freed from the classification of form Vaccha the Tathagata is deep boundless hard to fathom like the sea
'Reappears' doesn't apply
'Does not reappear' doesn't apply
'Both does  does not reappear' doesn't apply
'Neither reappears nor does not reappear' doesn't apply
Any feeling Any perception Any mental fabrication
Any consciousness by which one describing the Tathagata would describe him That the Tathagata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Freed from the classification of consciousness Vaccha the Tathagata is deep boundless hard to fathom like the sea
To ask what it means to live with dignity may sound strange in an age like our own when our frantic struggle to make ends meet hardly allows us the leisure to ponder such weighty matters
But if we do pause a moment to give this question a little thought we would realize soon enough that it is not merely the idle musing of someone with too much time on his hands
The question not only touches on the very meaning of our lives but goes even beyond our personal quest for meaning to bore into the very springs of contemporary culture
For if it isn't possible to live with dignity then life has no transcendent purpose and in such a case our only aim in the brief time allotted to us should be to snatch whatever thrills we can before the lights go off for good
But if we can give sense to the idea of living with dignity then we need to consider whether we are actually ordering our lives in the way we should and even more broadly whether our culture encourages a dignified lifestyle
Though the idea of dignity seems simple enough at first sight it is actually fairly complex
My Webster's Collegiate Dictionary defines dignity as elevation of character intrinsic worth excellence nobleness of manner aspect or style My Roget's Thesaurus groups it with prestige esteem repute honor glory renown fame  evidence that over the last forty years the word's epicenter of meaning has undergone a shift
When we inquire about living with dignity our focus should be on the word's older nuance
What I have in mind is living with the conviction that one's life has intrinsic worth that we possess a potential for moral excellence that resonates with the rhythm of the seasons and the silent hymn of the galaxies
The conscious pursuit of dignity does not enjoy much popularity these days having been crowded out by such stiff competitors as wealth and power success and fame
Behind this devaluation of dignity lies a series of developments in Western thought that emerged in reaction to the dogmatic certainties of Christian theology
The Darwinian theory of evolution Freud's thesis of the Id economic determinism the computer model of the mind all these trends arisen more or less independently have worked together to undermine the notion that our lives have any more worth than the value of our bank accounts
When so many selfassured voices speak to the contrary we no longer feel justified in viewing ourselves as the crowning glory of creation
Instead we have become convinced we are nothing but packets of protoplasm governed by selfish genes clever monkeys with college degrees and business cards plying across highways rather than trees
Such ideas in however distorted a form have seeped down from the halls of academia into popular culture eroding our sense of human dignity on many fronts
The freemarket economy the task master of the modern social order leads the way
For this system the primary form of human interaction is the investment and the sale with people themselves reckoned simply as producers and consumers sometimes even as commodities
Our vast impersonal democracies reduce the individual to a nameless face in the crowd to be manipulated by slogans images and promises into voting this way or that
Cities have expanded into sprawling urban jungles dirty and dangerous whose dazed occupants seek an easy escape with the help of drugs and loveless sex
Escalation in crime political corruption upheavals in family life the despoliation of the environment these all speak to us as much of a deterioration in how we regard ourselves as in how we relate to others
Amidst these pangs of forlorn hope can the Dhamma help us recover our lost sense of dignity and thereby give new meaning to our lives
The answer to this question is yes and in two ways first by justifying our claim to innate dignity and second by showing us what we must do to actualize our potential dignity
For Buddhism the innate dignity of human beings does not stem from our relationship to an allmighty God or our endowment with an immortal soul
It stems rather from the exalted place of human life in the broad expanse of sentient existence
Far from reducing human beings to children of chance the Buddha teaches that the human realm is a very special realm standing squarely at the spiritual center of the cosmos
What makes human life so special is that human beings have a capacity for moral choice that is not shared by other types of beings
Though this capacity is inevitably subject to limiting conditions we always possess in the immediate present a margin of inner freedom that allows us to change ourselves and hereby to change the world
But life in the human realm is far from cozy
To the contrary it is inconceivably difficult and complex rife with conflicts and moral ambiguities offering enormous potential for both good and evil
This moral complexity can make of human life a painful struggle indeed but it also renders the human realm the most fertile ground for sowing the seeds of enlightenment
It is at this tauntingly ambiguous crossroads in the long journey of being that we can either rise to the heights of spiritual greatness or fall to degrading depths
The two alternatives branch out from each present moment and which one we take depends on ourselves
While this unique capacity for moral choice and spiritual awakening confers intrinsic dignity on human life the Buddha does not emphasize this so much as he does our ability to acquire active dignity
This ability is summed up by a word that lends its flavor to the entire teaching ariya or noble
The Buddha's teaching is the ariyadhamma the noble doctrine and its purpose is to change human beings from ignorant worldlings into noble disciples resplendent with noble wisdom
The change does not come about through mere faith and devotion but by treading the Buddhist path which transmutes our frailties into invincible strengths and our ignorance into knowledge
The notion of acquired dignity is closely connected with the idea of autonomy
Autonomy means selfcontrol and selfmastery freedom from the sway of passion and prejudice the ability to actively determine oneself
To live with dignity means to be one's own master to conduct one's affairs on the basis of one's own free choices instead of being pushed around by forces beyond one's control
The autonomous individual draws his or her strength from within free from the dictates of craving and bias guided by a thirst for righteousness and an inner perception of truth
The person who represents the apex of dignity for Buddhism is the arahant the liberated one who has reached the pinnacle of spiritual autonomy release from the dictates of greed hatred and delusion
The very word arahant suggests this sense of dignity the word means worthy one one who deserves the offerings of gods and humans
Although in our present condition we might still be far from the stature of an arahant this does not mean we are utterly lost for the means of reaching the highest goal is already within our reach
The means is the Noble Eightfold Path with its twin pillars of right view and right conduct
Right view is the first factor of the path and the guide for all the others
To live with right view is to see that our decisions count that our volitional actions have consequences that extend beyond themselves and conduce to our longterm happiness or suffering
The active counterpart of right view is right conduct action guided by the ideal of moral and spiritual excellence
Right conduct in body speech and mind brings to fulfillment the other seven factors of the eightfold path culminating in true knowledge and deliverance
In today's hectic world humankind is veering recklessly in two destructive directions
One is the path of violent struggle and confrontation the other that of frivolous selfindulgence
Beneath their apparent contrasts what unites these two extremes is a shared disregard for human dignity the former violates the dignity of other people the latter undermines one's own dignity
The Buddha's Noble Eightfold Path is a middle way that avoids all harmful extremes
To follow this path not only brings a quiet dignity into one's own life but also answers the cynicism of our age with a note of wholesome affirmation
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
In this short autobiographical passage the Buddha describes his sense of dismay at the violence in the world together with his important discovery that the only escape from violence is to remove the causes of violence from one's own heart
To remove these causes one must first refrain from violence on the external level so as to create the proper karmic context  more peaceful and honest  for extracting the causes of violence on the internal level
The following passages from the Pali canon illustrate these two levels of the practice starting first with a few considerations on the principle of kamma
For a more complete background on kamma see the study guide on that topic
The concluding passages in this collection focus on the concept of papañca or objectification as the internal cause of conflict
For a discussion of this concept see the Introduction to MN
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Nalanda in the Pavarika Mango Grove
Then Asibandhakaputta the headman went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One The brahmans of the Western lands lord  those who carry water pots wear garlands of water plants purify with water  worship fire  can take a dead person lift it out instruct it  send it to heaven
But the Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened can arrange it so that all the world at the breakup of the body after death reappears in a good destination the heavenly world
Very well then headman I will question you on this matter
Answer as you see fit
What do you think There is the case where a man is one who takes life steals indulges in illicit sex is a liar one who speaks divisive speech harsh speech  idle chatter is greedy bears thoughts of illwill  holds to wrong views
Then a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart 'May this man at the breakup of the body after death reappear in a good destination the heavenly world' What do you think would that man  because of the prayers praise  circumambulation of that great crowd of people  at the breakup of the body after death reappear in a good destination the heavenly world
No lord
Suppose a man were to throw a large boulder into a deep lake of water and a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart 'Rise up O boulder
Come floating up O boulder
Come float to the shore O boulder' What do you think would that boulder  because of the prayers praise  circumambulation of that great crowd of people  rise up come floating up or come float to the shore
No lord
So it is with any man who takes life steals indulges in illicit sex is a liar one who speaks divisive speech harsh speech  idle chatter is greedy bears thoughts of illwill  holds to wrong views
Even though a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart  'May this man at the breakup of the body after death reappear in a good destination the heavenly world'  still at the breakup of the body after death he would reappear in destitution a bad destination the lower realms hell
Beings are the owners of their actions heir to their actions born of their actions related through their actions and have their actions as their arbitrator
Action is what creates distinctions among beings in terms of coarseness  refinement
There is the case where a certain woman or man is one who takes life  brutal bloodyhanded violent cruel merciless to living beings
From adopting  carrying out such actions then on the breakup of the body after death this person reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
Or if heshe does not reappear in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell but instead returns to the human state then heshe is shortlived wherever reborn
This is the way leading to short life namely being one who takes life
But there is the case where a certain woman or man abandoning the taking of life abstains from the taking of life dwelling with rod laid down knife laid down scrupulous merciful sympathetic for the benefit of all living beings
From adopting  carrying out such actions then on the breakup of the body after death this person reappears in the good destinations in the heavenly world
Or if heshe does not reappear in the good destinations in the heavenly world but instead returns to the human state then heshe is longlived wherever reborn
This is the way leading to long life namely being one who abandoning the taking of life abstains from taking life
Furthermore there is the case where a certain woman or man has a tendency to injure living beings with the hand with a clod with a stick or with a knife
From adopting  carrying out such actions then on the breakup of the body after death this person reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
Or if heshe does not reappear in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell but instead returns to the human state then heshe is sickly wherever reborn
This is the way leading to being sickly namely being one who has a tendency to injure living beings with the hand with a clod with a stick or with a knife
But there is the case where a certain woman or man does not have a tendency to injure living beings with the hand with a clod with a stick or with a knife
Or if heshe does not reappear in the good destinations in the heavenly world but instead returns to the human state then heshe is healthy wherever reborn
This is the way leading to being healthy namely being one who abandoning the taking of life abstains from taking life does not have a tendency to injure living beings with the hand with a clod with a stick or with a knife
And how is one made impure in three ways by bodily action
There is the case where a certain person takes life is brutal bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beings
He takes what is not given
He takes in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by them
He engages in sensual misconduct
He gets sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their Dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another man
This is how one is made impure in three ways by bodily action
And how is one made impure in four ways by verbal action
There is the case where a certain person engages in false speech
When he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty if he is asked as a witness 'Come  tell good man what you know' If he doesn't know he says 'I know' If he does know he says 'I don't know' If he hasn't seen he says 'I have seen' If he has seen he says 'I haven't seen' Thus he consciously tells lies for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of a certain reward
He engages in divisive speech
What he has heard here he tells there to break those people apart from these people here
What he has heard there he tells here to break these people apart from those people there
Thus breaking apart those who are united and stirring up strife between those who have broken apart he loves factionalism delights in factionalism enjoys factionalism speaks things that create factionalism
He engages in abusive speech
He speaks words that are harsh cutting bitter to others abusive of others provoking anger and destroying concentration
He engages in idle chatter
He speaks out of season speaks what isn't factual what isn't in accordance with the goal the Dhamma  the Vinaya words that are not worth treasuring
This is how one is made impure in four ways by verbal action
And how is one made pure in three ways by bodily action
There is the case where a certain person abandoning the taking of life abstains from the taking of life
He dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beings
Abandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not given
He does not take in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by them
Abandoning sensual misconduct he abstains from sensual misconduct
He does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their Dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another man
This is how one is made pure in three ways by bodily action
And how is one made pure in four ways by verbal action
There is the case where a certain person abandoning false speech abstains from false speech
When he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty if he is asked as a witness 'Come  tell good man what you know' If he doesn't know he says 'I don't know' If he does know he says 'I know' If he hasn't seen he says 'I haven't seen' If he has seen he says 'I have seen' Thus he doesn't consciously tell a lie for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of any reward
Abandoning false speech he abstains from false speech
He speaks the truth holds to the truth is firm reliable no deceiver of the world
Abandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speech
What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people here
What he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people there
Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concord
Abandoning abusive speech he abstains from abusive speech
He speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing  pleasing to people at large
Abandoning idle chatter he abstains from idle chatter
He speaks in season speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the Dhamma  the Vinaya
He speaks words worth treasuring seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goal
This is how one is made pure in four ways by verbal action
Then Yodhajiva the headman went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord I have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of professional warriors that 'When a professional warrior strives  exerts himself in battle if others then strike him down  slay him while he is striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle' What does the Blessed One have to say about that
Enough headman put that aside
Don't ask me that
A second time A third time Yodhajiva the headman said Lord I have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of professional warriors that 'When a professional warrior strives  exerts himself in battle if others then strike him down  slay him while he is striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle' What does the Blessed One have to say about that
Apparently headman I haven't been able to get past you by saying 'Enough headman put that aside
Don't ask me that' So I will simply answer you
When a professional warrior strives  exerts himself in battle his mind is already seized debased  misdirected by the thought 'May these beings be struck down or slaughtered or annihilated or destroyed
May they not exist' If others then strike him down  slay while he is thus striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the hell called the realm of those slain in battle
But if he holds such a view as this 'When a professional warrior strives  exerts himself in battle if others then strike him down  slay him while he is striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle' that is his wrong view
Now there are two destinations for a person with wrong view I tell you either hell or the animal womb
When this was said Yodhajiva the headman sobbed  burst into tears
That is what I couldn't get past you by saying 'Enough headman put that aside
Don't ask me that' I'm not crying lord because of what the Blessed One said to me but simply because I have been deceived cheated  fooled for a long time by that ancient teaching lineage of professional warriors who said 'When a professional warrior strives  exerts himself in battle if others then strike him down  slay him while he is striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle'
Magnificent lord
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Community of monks
May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life
As he was sitting to one side King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One Just now lord while I was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in my awareness 'Who have themselves protected and who leave themselves unprotected' Then it occurred to me 'Those who engage in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct leave themselves unprotected
Even though a squadron of elephant troops might protect them a squadron of cavalry troops a squadron of chariot troops a squadron of infantry troops might protect them still they leave themselves unprotected
Why is that
Because that's an external protection not an internal one
Therefore they leave themselves unprotected
But those who engage in good bodily conduct good verbal conduct  good mental conduct have themselves protected
Even though neither a squadron of elephant troops a squadron of cavalry troops a squadron of chariot troops nor a squadron of infantry troops might protect them still they have themselves protected
Why is that
Because that's an internal protection not an external one
Therefore they have themselves protected' That's the way it is great king
That's the way it is
Those who engage in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct leave themselves unprotected
Even though a squadron of elephant troops might protect them a squadron of cavalry troops a squadron of chariot troops a squadron of infantry troops might protect them still they leave themselves unprotected
Why is that
Because that's an external protection not an internal one
Therefore they leave themselves unprotected
But those who engage in good bodily conduct good verbal conduct  good mental conduct have themselves protected
Even though neither a squadron of elephant troops a squadron of cavalry troops a squadron of chariot troops nor a squadron of infantry troops might protect them still they have themselves protected
Why is that
Because that's an internal protection not an external one
Therefore they have themselves protected
That is what the Blessed One said
Having said that the One WellGone the Teacher said further
And what is right resolve
Being resolved on renunciation on freedom from ill will on harmlessness This is called right resolve
I undertake the training rule to refrain from taking life
From the instructions to every new monk
A monk who has been accepted should not deprive a living being of life even if it is only a black or white ant
Any monk who purposely deprives a human being of life even to the extent of causing an abortion is not a contemplative not a son of the Sakyan
Just as a solid block of stone broken in two cannot be joined together again in the same way a monk who has purposely deprived a human being of life is not a contemplative not a son of the Sakyan
You are not to do this for the rest of your life
 Mv I
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones abandoning the taking of life abstains from taking life
In doing so he gives freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings
In giving freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings he gains a share in limitless freedom from danger freedom from animosity and freedom from oppression
This is the first gift the first great gift  original longstanding traditional ancient unadulterated unadulterated from the beginning  that is not open to suspicion will never be open to suspicion and is unfaulted by knowledgeable contemplatives  brahmans
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi at Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said Once in the past the devas  asuras were arrayed for battle
Then Vepacitti the asuraking said to Sakka the devaking 'Let there be victory through what is well spoken'
'Yes Vepacitti let there be victory through what is well spoken'
So the devas  asuras appointed a panel of judges 'These will decide for us what is well spoken  poorly spoken'
Then Vepacitti the asuraking said to Sakka the devaking 'Say a verse devaking'
When this was said Sakka the devaking said to Vepacitti the asuraking 'But you are the senior deity here Vepacitti
You say a verse'
When this was said Vepacitti recited this verse
When Vepacitti had said this verse the asuras applauded but the devas were silent
So Vepacitti said to Sakka 'Say a verse devaking'
When this was said Sakka recited this verse
When Sakka had said this verse the devas applauded but the asuras were silent
So Sakka said to Vepacitti 'Say a verse Vepacitti'
When this was said Vepacitti recited this verse
When Vepacitti had said this verse the asuras applauded but the devas were silent
So Vepacitti said to Sakka 'Say a verse devaking'
When this was said Sakka recited this verse
When Sakka had said this verse the devas applauded but the asuras were silent
Then the deva  asura panel of judges said 'The verses said by Vepacitti the asuraking lie in the sphere of swords  weapons  thence arguments quarrels  strife
Whereas the verses said by Sakka the devaking lies outside the sphere of swords  weapons  thence no arguments no quarrels no strife
The victory through what is well spoken goes to Sakka the devaking'
And that monks is how the victory through what was well spoken went to Sakka the devaking

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels' Sanctuary
Then the brahman Akkosaka Bharadvaja heard that a brahman of the Bharadvaja clan had gone forth from the home life into homelessness in the presence of the Blessed One
Angered  displeased he went to the Blessed One and on arrival insulted  cursed him with rude harsh words
When this was said the Blessed One said to him What do you think brahman Do friends  colleagues relatives  kinsmen come to you as guests
Yes Master Gotama sometimes friends  colleagues relatives  kinsmen come to me as guests
And what do you think Do you serve them with staple  nonstaple foods  delicacies
Yes sometimes I serve them with staple  nonstaple foods  delicacies
And if they don't accept them to whom do those foods belong
If they don't accept them Master Gotama those foods are all mine
In the same way brahman that with which you have insulted me who is not insulting that with which you have taunted me who is not taunting that with which you have berated me who is not berating that I don't accept from you
It's all yours brahman
It's all yours
Whoever returns insult to one who is insulting returns taunts to one who is taunting returns a berating to one who is berating is said to be eating together sharing company with that person
But I am neither eating together nor sharing your company brahman
It's all yours
It's all yours
The king together with his court know this of Master Gotama  'Gotama the contemplative is an arahant'  and yet still Master Gotama gets angry 
Now as for a person who is impure in his bodily behavior but pure in his verbal behavior how should one subdue hatred for him
Just as when a monk who makes use of things that are thrown away sees a rag in the road Taking hold of it with his left foot and spreading it out with his right he would tear off the sound part and go off with it
In the same way when the individual is impure in his bodily behavior but pure in his verbal behavior one should at that time pay no attention to the impurity of his bodily behavior and instead pay attention to the purity of his verbal behavior
Thus the hatred for him should be subdued
And as for a person who is impure in his verbal behavior but pure in his bodily behavior how should one subdue hatred for him
Just as when there is a pool overgrown with slime  water plants and a person comes along burning with heat covered with sweat exhausted trembling  thirsty
He would jump into the pool part the slime  water plants with both hands and then cupping his hands drink the water and go on his way
In the same way when the individual is impure in his verbal behavior but pure in his bodily behavior one should at that time pay no attention to the impurity of his verbal behavior and instead pay attention to the purity of his bodily behavior
Thus the hatred for him should be subdued
And as for a person who is impure in his bodily behavior  verbal behavior but who periodically experiences mental clarity  calm how should one subdue hatred for him
Just as when there is a little puddle in a cow's footprint and a person comes along burning with heat covered with sweat exhausted trembling  thirsty
The thought would occur to him 'Here is this little puddle in a cow's footprint
If I tried to drink the water using my hand or cup I would disturb it stir it up  make it unfit to drink
What if I were to get down on all fours and slurp it up like a cow and then go on my way' So he would get down on all fours slurp up the water like a cow and then go on his way
In the same way when an individual is impure in his bodily behavior  verbal behavior but periodically experiences mental clarity  calm one should at that time pay no attention to the impurity of his bodily behavior the impurity of his verbal behavior and instead pay attention to the fact that he periodically experiences mental clarity  calm
Thus the hatred for him should be subdued
And as for a person who is impure in his bodily behavior  verbal behavior and who does not periodically experience mental clarity  calm how should one subdue hatred for him
Just as when there is a sick man  in pain seriously ill  traveling along a road far from the next village  far from the last unable to get the food he needs unable to get the medicine he needs unable to get a suitable assistant unable to get anyone to take him to human habitation
Now suppose another person were to see him coming along the road
He would do what he could out of compassion pity  sympathy for the man thinking 'O that this man should get the food he needs the medicine he needs a suitable assistant someone to take him to human habitation
Why is that
So that he won't fall into ruin right here' In the same way when a person is impure in his bodily behavior  verbal behavior and who does not periodically experience mental clarity  calm one should do what one can out of compassion pity  sympathy for him thinking 'O that this man should abandon wrong bodily conduct and develop right bodily conduct abandon wrong verbal conduct and develop right verbal conduct abandon wrong mental conduct and develop right mental conduct
Why is that
So that on the breakup of the body after death he won't fall into the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms purgatory' Thus the hatred for him should be subdued
And as for a person who is pure in his bodily behavior  verbal behavior and who periodically experiences mental clarity  calm how should one subdue hatred for him
Just as when there is a pool of clear water  sweet cool  limpid with gently sloping banks  shaded on all sides by trees of many kinds  and a person comes along burning with heat covered with sweat exhausted trembling  thirsty
Having plunged into the pool having bathed  drunk  come back out he would sit down or lie down right there in the shade of the trees
In the same way when an individual is pure in his bodily behavior  verbal behavior and periodically experiences mental clarity  calm one should at that time pay attention to the purity of his bodily behavior the purity of his verbal behavior and to the fact that he periodically experiences mental clarity  calm
Thus the hatred for him should be subdued
An entirely inspiring individual can make the mind grow serene
Once monks in this same Savatthi there was a lady of a household named Vedehika
This good report about Lady Vedehika had circulated 'Lady Vedehika is gentle
Lady Vedehika is eventempered
Lady Vedehika is calm' Now Lady Vedehika had a slave named Kali who was diligent deft  neat in her work
The thought occurred to Kali the slave 'This good report about my Lady Vedehika has circulated Lady Vedehika is eventempered
Lady Vedehika is gentle
Lady Vedehika is calm Now is anger present in my lady without showing or is it absent
Or is it just because I'm diligent deft  neat in my work that the anger present in my lady doesn't show
Why don't I test her'
So Kali the slave got up after daybreak
Then Lady Vedehika said to her 'Hey Kali'
'Yes madam'
'Why did you get up after daybreak'
'No reason madam'
'No reason you wicked slave and yet you get up after daybreak' Angered  displeased she scowled
Then the thought occurred to Kali the slave 'Anger is present in my lady without showing and not absent
And it's just because I'm diligent deft  neat in my work that the anger present in my lady doesn't show
Why don't I test her some more'
So Kali the slave got up later in the day
Then Lady Vedehika said to her 'Hey Kali'
'Yes madam'
'Why did you get up later in the day'
'No reason madam'
'No reason you wicked slave and yet you get up later in the day' Angered  displeased she grumbled
Then the thought occurred to Kali the slave 'Anger is present in my lady without showing and not absent
And it's just because I'm diligent deft  neat in my work that the anger present in my lady doesn't show
Why don't I test her some more'
So Kali the slave got up even later in the day
Then Lady Vedehika said to her 'Hey Kali'
'Yes madam'
'Why did you get up even later in the day'
'No reason madam'
'No reason you wicked slave and yet you get up even later in the day' Angered  displeased she grabbed hold of a rolling pin and gave her a whack over the head cutting it open
Then Kali the slave with blood streaming from her cutopen head went and denounced her mistress to the neighbors 'See ladies the gentle one's handiwork
See the eventempered one's handiwork
See the calm one's handiwork
How could she angered  displeased with her only slave for getting up after daybreak grab hold of a rolling pin and give her a whack over the head cutting it open'
After that this evil report about Lady Vedehika circulated 'Lady Vedehika is vicious
Lady Vedehika is foultempered
Lady Vedehika is violent'
In the same way monks a monk may be ever so gentle ever so eventempered ever so calm as long as he is not touched by disagreeable aspects of speech
But it is only when disagreeable aspects of speech touch him that he can truly be known as gentle eventempered  calm
I don't call a monk easy to admonish if he is easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish only by reason of robes almsfood lodging  medicinal requisites for curing the sick
Why is that
Because if he doesn't get robes almsfood lodging  medicinal requisites for curing the sick then he isn't easy to admonish and doesn't make himself easy to admonish
But if a monk is easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish purely out of esteem for the Dhamma respect for the Dhamma reverence for the Dhamma then I call him easy to admonish
Thus monks you should train yourselves 'We will be easy to admonish and make ourselves easy to admonish purely out of esteem for the Dhamma respect for the Dhamma reverence for the Dhamma' That's how you should train yourselves
Monks there are these five aspects of speech by which others may address you timely or untimely true or false affectionate or harsh beneficial or unbeneficial with a mind of goodwill or with inner hate
Others may address you in a timely way or an untimely way
They may address you with what is true or what is false
They may address you in an affectionate way or a harsh way
They may address you in a beneficial way or an unbeneficial way
They may address you with a mind of goodwill or with inner hate
In any event you should train yourselves 'Our minds will be unaffected and we will say no evil words
We will remain sympathetic to that person's welfare with a mind of good will and with no inner hate
We will keep pervading him with an awareness imbued with good will and beginning with him we will keep pervading the entire world with an awareness imbued with good will  abundant expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill will' That's how you should train yourselves
Suppose that a man were to come along carrying a hoe  a basket saying 'I will make this great earth be without earth' He would dig here  there scatter soil here  there spit here  there urinate here  there saying 'Be without earth
Be without earth' Now what do you think  would he make this great earth be without earth
No lord
Why is that
Because this great earth is deep  enormous
It can't easily be made to be without earth
The man would reap only a share of weariness  disappointment

Suppose that a man were to come along carrying lac yellow orpiment indigo or crimson saying 'I will draw pictures in space I will make pictures appear' Now what do you think  would he draw pictures in space  make pictures appear
No lord
Why is that
Because space is formless  featureless
It's not easy to draw pictures there and to make them appear
The man would reap only a share of weariness  disappointment
In the same way monks there are these five aspects of speech by which others may address you timely or untimely true or false affectionate or harsh beneficial or unbeneficial with a mind of goodwill or with inner hate

Suppose that a man were to come along carrying a burning grass torch and saying 'With this burning grass torch I will heat up the river Ganges and make it boil' Now what do you think  would he with that burning grass torch heat up the river Ganges and make it boil
No lord
Why is that
Because the river Ganges is deep  enormous
It's not easy to heat it up and make it boil with a burning grass torch
The man would reap only a share of weariness  disappointment

Suppose there were a catskin bag  beaten wellbeaten beaten through  through soft silky free of rustling  crackling  and a man were to come along carrying a stick or shard and saying 'With this stick or shard I will take this catskin bag  beaten wellbeaten beaten through  through soft silky free of rustling  crackling  and I will make it rustle  crackle' Now what do you think  would he with that stick or shard take that catskin bag  beaten wellbeaten beaten through  through soft silky free of rustling  crackling  and make it rustle  crackle
No lord
Why is that
Because the catskin bag is beaten wellbeaten beaten through  through soft silky free of rustling  crackling
It's not easy to make it rustle  crackle with a stick or shard
The man would reap only a share of weariness  disappointment

Monks even if bandits were to carve you up savagely limb by limb with a twohandled saw he among you who let his heart get angered even at that would not be doing my bidding

Monks if you attend constantly to this admonition on the simile of the saw do you see any aspects of speech slight or gross that you could not endure
No lord
Then attend constantly to this admonition on the simile of the saw
That will be for your longterm welfare  happiness
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
Well then Punna
Now that I have instructed you with a brief instruction in which country are you going to live
Lord there is a country called Sunaparanta
I am going to live there
Punna the Sunaparanta people are fierce
They are rough
If they insult and ridicule you what will you think
If they insult and ridicule me I will think 'These Sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they don't hit me with their hands' That is what I will think O Blessed One
That is what I will think O One Wellgone
But if they hit you with their hands what will you think
I will think 'These Sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they don't hit me with a clod' But if they hit you with a clod
I will think 'These Sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they don't hit me with a stick' But if they hit you with a stick
I will think 'These Sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they don't hit me with a knife' But if they hit you with a knife
I will think 'These Sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they don't take my life with a sharp knife' But if they take your life with a sharp knife
If they take my life with a sharp knife I will think 'There are disciples of the Blessed One who  horrified humiliated and disgusted by the body and by life  have sought for an assassin but here I have met my assassin without searching for him' That is what I will think O Blessed One
That is what I will think O One Wellgone
Good Punna very good
Possessing such calm and selfcontrol you are fit to dwell among the Sunaparantans
Now it is time to do as you see fit
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels' Sanctuary
Then Prince Abhaya went to Nigantha Nataputta and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there Nigantha Nataputta said to him Come now prince
Refute the words of Gotama the contemplative and this admirable report about you will spread afar 'The words of Gotama the contemplative  so mighty so powerful  were refuted by Prince Abhaya' But how venerable sir will I refute the words of Gotama the contemplative  so mighty so powerful
Come now prince
Go to Gotama the contemplative and on arrival say this 'Lord would the Tathagata say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to others' If Gotama the contemplative thus asked answers 'The Tathagata would say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to others' then you should say 'Then how is there any difference between you lord and runofthemill people
For even runofthemill people say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to others' But if Gotama the contemplative thus asked answers 'The Tathagata would not say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to others' then you should say 'Then how lord did you say of Devadatta that Devadatta is headed for destitution Devadatta is headed for hell Devadatta will boil for an eon Devadatta is incurable
For Devadatta was upset  disgruntled at those words of yours' When Gotama the contemplative is asked this twopronged question by you he won't be able to swallow it down or spit it up
Just as if a twohorned chestnut were stuck in a man's throat he would not be able to swallow it down or spit it up
In the same way when Gotama the contemplative is asked this twopronged question by you he won't be able to swallow it down or spit it up
Responding As you say venerable sir Prince Abhaya got up from his seat bowed down to Nigantha Nataputta circumambulated him and then went to the Blessed One
On arrival he bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side
As he was sitting there he glanced up at the sun and thought Today is not the time to refute the Blessed One's words
Tomorrow in my own home I will overturn the Blessed One's words So he said to the Blessed One May the Blessed One together with three others acquiesce to my offer of tomorrow's meal
The Blessed One acquiesced with silence
Then Prince Abhaya understanding the Blessed One's acquiescence got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One circumambulated him and left
Then after the night had passed the Blessed One early in the morning put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe went to Prince Abhaya's home
On arrival he sat down on a seat made ready
Prince Abhaya with his own hand served  satisfied the Blessed One with fine staple  nonstaple foods
Then when the Blessed One had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl Prince Abhaya took a lower seat and sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord would the Tathagata say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to others
Prince there is no categorical yesorno answer to that
Then right here lord the Niganthas are destroyed
But prince why do you say 'Then right here lord the Niganthas are destroyed'
Just yesterday lord I went to Nigantha Nataputta and he said to me 'Come now prince
Go to Gotama the contemplative and on arrival say this Lord would the Tathagata say words that are unendearing  disagreeable to others Just as if a twohorned chestnut were stuck in a man's throat he would not be able to swallow it down or spit it up
In the same way when Gotama the contemplative is asked this twopronged question by you he won't be able to swallow it down or spit it up' Now at that time a baby boy was lying faceup on the prince's lap
So the Blessed One said to the prince What do you think prince If this young boy through your own negligence or that of the nurse were to take a stick or a piece of gravel into its mouth what would you do
I would take it out lord
If I couldn't get it out right away then holding its head in my left hand and crooking a finger of my right I would take it out even if it meant drawing blood
Why is that
Because I have sympathy for the young boy
In the same way prince
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be unfactual untrue unbeneficial unendearing  disagreeable to others he does not say them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true unbeneficial unendearing  disagreeable to others he does not say them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true beneficial but unendearing  disagreeable to others he has a sense of the proper time for saying them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be unfactual untrue unbeneficial but endearing  agreeable to others he does not say them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true unbeneficial but endearing  agreeable to others he does not say them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true beneficial and endearing  agreeable to others he has a sense of the proper time for saying them
Why is that
Because the Tathagata has sympathy for living beings
Lord when wise nobles or brahmans householders or contemplatives having formulated questions come to the Tathagata and ask him does this line of reasoning appear to his awareness beforehand  'If those who approach me ask this I  thus asked  will answer in this way'  or does the Tathagata come up with the answer on the spot
In that case prince I will ask you a counterquestion
Answer as you see fit
What do you think are you skilled in the parts of a chariot
Yes lord
I am skilled in the parts of a chariot
And what do you think When people come  ask you 'What is the name of this part of the chariot' does this line of reasoning appear to your awareness beforehand  'If those who approach me ask this I  thus asked  will answer in this way'  or do you come up with the answer on the spot
Lord I am renowned for being skilled in the parts of a chariot
All the parts of a chariot are wellknown to me
I come up with the answer on the spot
In the same way prince when wise nobles or brahmans householders or contemplatives having formulated questions come to the Tathagata and ask him he comes up with the answer on the spot
Why is that
Because the property of the Dhamma is thoroughly penetrated by the Tathagata
From his thorough penetration of the property of the Dhamma he comes up with the answer on the spot
When this was said Prince Abhaya said to the Blessed One Magnificent lord
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monks
May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life
Whereas some brahmans and contemplatives living off food given in faith are addicted to debates such as these  'You understand this doctrine and discipline
I'm the one who understands this doctrine and discipline
How could you understand this doctrine and discipline
You're practicing wrongly
I'm practicing rightly
I'm being consistent
You're not
What should be said first you said last
What should be said last you said first
What you took so long to think out has been refuted
Your doctrine has been overthrown
You're defeated
Go and try to salvage your doctrine extricate yourself if you can'  he abstains from debates such as these
This too is part of his virtue
Five qualities to establish in oneself before accusing another of wrong doing
I will speak at the right time not at the wrong time
I will say what is factual not what is not factual
I will speak gently and not harshly
I will say what is connected with the goal not what is unconnected to the goal
I will speak with an attitude of good will and not with inner aversion
There is the case headman where a Tathagata appears in the world worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in clear knowing  conduct wellgone a knower of the cosmos unexcelled trainer of those to be tamed teacher of human  divine beings awakened blessed
He in various ways criticizes  censures the taking of life and says 'Abstain from taking life' He criticizes  censures stealing and says 'Abstain from stealing' He criticizes  censures indulging in illicit sex and says 'Abstain from indulging in illicit sex' He criticizes  censures the telling of lies and says 'Abstain from the telling of lies'
A disciple has faith in that teacher and reflects 'The Blessed One in a variety of ways criticizes  censures the taking of life and says Abstain from taking life There are living beings that I have killed to a greater or lesser extent
That was not right
That was not good
But if I become remorseful for that reason that evil deed of mine will not be undone' So reflecting thus he abandons right then the taking of life and in the future refrains from taking life
This is how there comes to be the abandoning of that evil deed
This is how there comes to be the transcending of that evil deed
'The Blessed One in a variety of ways criticizes  censures stealing indulging in illicit sex the telling of lies and says Abstain from the telling of lies There are lies I have told to a greater or lesser extent
That was not right
That was not good
But if I become remorseful for that reason that evil deed of mine will not be undone' So reflecting thus he abandons right then the telling of lies and in the future refrains from telling lies
This is how there comes to be the abandoning of that evil deed
This is how there comes to be the transcending of that evil deed
Having abandoned the taking of life he refrains from taking life he refrains from stealing he refrains from illicit sex he refrains from lies he refrains from divisive speech he refrains from abusive speech he refrains from idle chatter
Having abandoned covetousness he becomes uncovetous
Having abandoned malevolence  anger he becomes one with a mind of no malevolence
Having abandoned wrong views he becomes one who has right views
That disciple of the noble ones headman  thus devoid of covetousness devoid of malevolence unbewildered alert mindful  keeps pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with good will likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth
Thus above below  all around everywhere in its entirety he keeps pervading the allencompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with good will  abundant expansive immeasurable without hostility without malevolence
Just as a strong conchtrumpet blower can notify the four directions without any difficulty in the same way when the awarenessrelease through good will is thus developed thus pursued any deed done to a limited extent no longer remains there no longer stays there
That disciple of the noble ones keeps pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with compassion appreciation equanimity likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth
Thus above below  all around everywhere in its entirety he keeps pervading the allencompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with equanimity  abundant expansive immeasurable without hostility without malevolence
Just as a strong conchtrumpet blower can notify the four directions without any difficulty in the same way when the awarenessrelease through equanimity is thus developed thus pursued any deed done to a limited extent no longer remains there no longer stays there
For one whose awarenessrelease through good will is cultivated developed pursued handed the reins and taken as a basis given a grounding steadied consolidated and wellundertaken eleven benefits can be expected
Which eleven
One sleeps easily wakes easily dreams no evil dreams
One is dear to human beings dear to nonhuman beings
The devas protect one
Neither fire poison nor weapons can touch one
One's mind gains concentration quickly
One's complexion is bright
One dies unconfused and  if penetrating no higher  is headed for the Brahma worlds
Wise  mindful you should develop immeasurable concentration
When wise  mindful one has developed immeasurable concentration five realizations arise right within oneself
Which five
The realization arises right within oneself that 'This concentration is blissful in the present and will result in bliss in the future'
The realization arises right within oneself that 'This concentration is noble  not connected with the baits of the flesh'
The realization arises right within oneself that 'This concentration is not obtained by base people'
The realization arises right within oneself that 'This concentration is peaceful exquisite the acquiring of serenity the attainment of unity not kept in place by the fabrications of forceful restraint'
The realization arises right within oneself that 'I enter into this concentration mindfully and mindfully I emerge from it'
Wise  mindful you should develop immeasurable concentration
When wise  mindful one has developed immeasurable concentration these five realizations arise right within oneself
It's with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source sensuality for the cause the reason being simply sensuality that kings quarrel with kings nobles with nobles brahmans with brahmans householders with householders mother with child child with mother father with child child with father brother with brother sister with sister brother with sister sister with brother friend with friend
And then in their quarrels brawls  disputes they attack one another with fists or with clods or with sticks or with knives so that they incur death or deadly pain
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
Furthermore it's with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that taking swords  shields and buckling on bows  quivers charge into battle massed in double array while arrows  spears are flying and swords are flashing and there they are wounded by arrows  spears and their heads are cut off by swords so that they incur death or deadly pain
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason
Furthermore it's with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that taking swords  shields and buckling on bows  quivers charge slippery bastions while arrows  spears are flying and swords are flashing and there they are splashed with boiling cow dung and crushed under heavy weights and their heads are cut off by swords so that they incur death or deadly pain
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
It's with a cause monks that sensual thinking occurs and not without a cause And how is it monks that sensual thinking occurs with a cause and not without a cause
In dependence on the property of sensuality there occurs the perception of sensuality
In dependence on the perception of sensuality there occurs the consideration of sensuality the desire for sensuality the fever for sensuality the quest for sensuality
Questing for sensuality monks an uninstructed runofthemill person conducts himself wrongly through three means through body through speech  through mind
Just as if a man were to throw a burning firebrand into a dry grassy wilderness and not quickly stamp it out with his hands  feet and thus whatever animals inhabiting the grass  timber would come to ruin  loss even so monks any contemplative or brahman who does not quickly abandon dispel demolish  wipe out of existence any wrongheaded unwise perceptions once they have arisen will dwell in stress in the present life  troubled despairing  feverish  and on the breakup of the body after death can expect a bad destination
Now craving is dependent on feeling seeking is dependent on craving acquisition is dependent on seeking ascertainment is dependent on acquisition desire and passion is dependent on ascertainment attachment is dependent on desire and passion possessiveness is dependent on attachment stinginess is dependent on possessiveness defensiveness is dependent on stinginess and because of defensiveness dependent on defensiveness various evil unskillful phenomena come into play the taking up of sticks and knives conflicts quarrels and disputes accusations divisive speech and lies
Having been given leave by the Blessed One Sakka the devaking asked him his first question Fettered with what dear sir  though they think 'May we live free from hostility free from violence free from rivalry free from ill will free from those who are hostile'  do devas human beings asuras nagas gandhabbas  whatever other many kinds of beings there are nevertheless live in hostility violence rivalry ill will with those who are hostile
Thus Sakka asked his first question of the Blessed One and the Blessed One when asked replied Devas human beings asuras nagas gandhabbas  whatever other many kinds of beings there are are fettered with envy  stinginess which is why  even though they think 'May we live free from hostility free from violence free from rivalry free from ill will free from those who are hostile  they nevertheless live in hostility violence rivalry ill will with those who are hostile
Thus the Blessed One answered having been asked by Sakka the devaking
Gratified Sakka was delighted in  expressed his approval of the Blessed One's words So it is O Blessed One
So it is O One Wellgone
Hearing the Blessed One's answer to my question my doubt is now cut off my perplexity is overcome
Then Sakka having delighted in  expressed his approval of the Blessed One's words asked him a further question But what dear sir is the cause of envy  stinginess what is their origination what gives them birth what is their source
When what exists do they come into being
When what doesn't exist do they not
Envy  stinginess have dearnotdear as their cause have dearnotdear as their origination have dearnotdear as what gives them birth have dearnotdear as their source
When dearnotdear exist they come into being
When dearnotdear are not they don't
But what dear sir is the cause of dearnotdear what is their origination what gives them birth what is their source
When what exists do they come into being
When what doesn't exist do they not
Dearnotdear have desire as their cause have desire as their origination have desire as what gives them birth have desire as their source
When desire exists they come into being
When desire is not they don't
But what dear sir is the cause of desire what is its origination what gives it birth what is its source
When what exists does it come into being
When what doesn't exist does it not
Desire has thinking as its cause has thinking as its origination has thinking as what gives it birth has thinking as its source
When thinking exists desire comes into being
When thinking is not it doesn't
But what dear sir is the cause of thinking what is its origination what gives it birth what is its source
When what exists does it come into being
When what doesn't exist does it not
Thinking has the perceptions  categories of objectification as its cause has the perceptions  categories of objectification as its origination has the perceptions  categories of objectification as what gives it birth has the perceptions  categories of objectification as its source
When the perceptions  categories of objectification exists thinking comes into being
When the perceptions  categories of objectification are not it doesn't
And how has he practiced dear sir the monk who has practiced the practice leading to the right cessation of the perceptions  categories of objectification
Joy is of two sorts I tell you devaking to be pursued  not to be pursued
Grief is of two sorts to be pursued  not to be pursued
Equanimity is of two sorts to be pursued  not to be pursued
'Joy is of two sorts I tell you devaking to be pursued  not to be pursued' Thus was it said
And in reference to what was it said
When one knows of a feeling of joy 'As I pursue this joy unskillful mental qualities increase and skillful mental qualities decline' that sort of joy is not to be pursued
When one knows of a feeling of joy 'As I pursue this joy unskillful mental qualities decline and skillful mental qualities increase' that sort of joy is to be pursued
And this sort of joy may be accompanied by directed thought  evaluation or free of directed thought  evaluation
Of the two the latter is the more refined
'Joy is of two sorts I tell you devaking to be pursued  not to be pursued' Thus was it said

And this sort of equanimity may be accompanied by directed thought  evaluation or free of directed thought  evaluation
Of the two the latter is the more refined
'Equanimity is of two sorts I tell you to be pursued  not to be pursued' Thus was it said
And in reference to this was it said
This is how he has practiced devaking the monk who has practiced the practice leading to the right cessation of the perceptions  categories of objectification
Thus the Blessed One answered having been asked by Sakka the devaking
Gratified Sakka was delighted in  expressed his approval of the Blessed One's words So it is O Blessed One
So it is O One Wellgone
Hearing the Blessed One's answer to my question my doubt is now cut off my perplexity is overcome
Then Sakka having delighted in  expressed his approval of the Blessed One's words asked him a further question But how has he practiced dear sir the monk who has practiced for restraint in the Patimokkha
Bodily conduct is of two sorts I tell you devaking to be pursued  not to be pursued
Verbal conduct is of two sorts to be pursued  not to be pursued
Searching is of two sorts to be pursued  not to be pursued
'Bodily conduct is of two sorts I tell you devaking to be pursued  not to be pursued' Thus was it said
And in reference to what was it said
When one knows of bodily conduct 'As I pursue this bodily conduct unskillful mental qualities increase and skillful mental qualities decline' that sort of bodily conduct is not to be pursued

This is how has he practiced devaking the monk who has practiced the practice for restraint in the Patimokkha

Hearing the Blessed One's answer to my question my doubt is now cut off my perplexity is overcome
Then Sakka having delighted in  expressed his approval of the Blessed One's words asked him a further question But how has he practiced dear sir the monk who has practiced for restraint with regard to the sense faculties
Forms cognizable by the eye are of two sorts I tell you devaking to be pursued  not to be pursued
Sounds cognizable by the ear Aromas cognizable by the nose Flavors cognizable by the tongue Tactile sensations cognizable by the body Ideas cognizable by the intellect are of two sorts to be pursued  not to be pursued
When this was said Sakka the devaking said to the Blessed One Dear sir I understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed One's brief statement
If as one pursues a certain type of form cognizable by the eye unskillful mental qualities increase and skillful mental qualities decline that sort of form cognizable by the eye is not to be pursued
But if as one pursues a certain type of form cognizable by the eye unskillful mental qualities decline and skillful mental qualities increase that sort of form cognizable by the eye is to be pursued
If as one pursues a certain type of sound cognizable by the ear
If as one pursues a certain type of aroma cognizable by the nose
If as one pursues a certain type of flavor cognizable by the tongue
If as one pursues a certain type of tactile sensation cognizable by the body
If as one pursues a certain type of idea cognizable by the intellect unskillful mental qualities increase and skillful mental qualities decline that sort of idea cognizable by the intellect is not to be pursued
But if as one pursues a certain type of idea cognizable by the intellect unskillful mental qualities decline and skillful mental qualities increase that sort of idea cognizable by the intellect is to be pursued
This is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed One's brief statement
Hearing the Blessed One's answer to my question my doubt is now cut off my perplexity is overcome
For a fuller explanation of this term see the introduction to MN
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was living among the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Park
Then in the early morning having put on his robes and carrying his bowl  outer robe he went into Kapilavatthu for alms
Having gone for alms in Kapilavatthu after the meal returning from his alms round he went to the Great Wood for the day's abiding
Plunging into the Great Wood he sat down at the root of a bilva sapling for the day's abiding
Dandapani the Sakyan out roaming  rambling for exercise also went to the Great Wood
Plunging into the Great Wood he went to where the Blessed One was under the bilva sapling
On arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he stood to one side
As he was standing there he said to the Blessed One What is the contemplative's doctrine
What does he proclaim
The sort of doctrine friend where one does not keep quarreling with anyone in the cosmos with its deities Maras  Brahmas with its contemplatives  brahmans its royalty  commonfolk the sort where perceptions no longer obsess the brahman who remains dissociated from sensuality free from perplexity his uncertainty cut away devoid of craving for becoming  non
Such is my doctrine such is what I proclaim
When this was said Dandapani the Sakyan  shaking his head wagging his tongue raising his eyebrows so that his forehead was wrinkled in three furrows  left leaning on his stick
Then when it was evening the Blessed One rose from his seclusion and went to the Banyan Park
On arrival he sat down on a seat made ready
As he was sitting there he
When this was said a certain monk said to the Blessed One Lord what sort of doctrine is it where one does not keep quarreling with anyone in the cosmos with its deities Maras  Brahmas with its contemplatives  brahmans its royalty  commonfolk where perceptions no longer obsess the brahman who remains dissociated from sensuality free from perplexity his uncertainty cut away devoid of craving for becoming  non
If monk with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions  categories of objectification assail a person there is nothing there to relish welcome or remain fastened to then that is the end of the obsessions of passion the obsessions of resistance the obsessions of views the obsessions of uncertainty the obsessions of conceit the obsessions of passion for becoming  the obsessions of ignorance
That is the end of taking up rods  bladed weapons of arguments quarrels disputes accusations divisive talebearing  false speech
That is where these evil unskillful things cease without remainder That is what the Blessed One said
Having said it the One Wellgone got up from his seat and went into his dwelling
Then not long after the Blessed One had left this thought occurred to the monks This brief statement the Blessed One made after which he went into his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning  ie 'If with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions  categories of objectification assail a person there is nothing to relish that is where these evil unskillful things cease without remainder' now who might analyze the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement Then the thought occurred to them Ven
Maha Kaccana is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his knowledgeable companions in the holy life
He is capable of analyzing the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement
Suppose we were to go to him and on arrival question him about this matter
So the monks went to Ven
Maha Kaccana and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies they sat to one side
As they were sitting there they Analyze the meaning Ven
Maha Kaccana
Friends it's as if a man needing heartwood looking for heartwood wandering in search of heartwood  passing over the root  trunk of a standing tree possessing heartwood  were to imagine that heartwood should be sought among its branches  leaves
So it is with you who  having bypassed the Blessed One when you were face to face with him the Teacher  imagine that I should be asked about this matter
For knowing the Blessed One knows seeing he sees
He is the Eye he is Knowledge he is Dhamma he is Brahma
He is the speaker the proclaimer the elucidator of meaning the giver of the Deathless the lord of the Dhamma the Tathagata
That was the time when you should have questioned him about this matter
However he answered that was how you should have remembered it
Yes friend Kaccana knowing the Blessed One knows seeing he sees
He is the Eye he is Knowledge he is Dhamma he is Brahma
He is the speaker the proclaimer the elucidator of meaning the giver of the Deathless the lord of the Dhamma the Tathagata
That was the time when we should have questioned him about this matter
However he answered that was how we should have remembered it
But you are praised by the Teacher and esteemed by your knowledgeable companions in the holy life
You are capable of analyzing the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement
Analyze the meaning Ven
Maha Kaccana
In that case my friends listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say friend the monks responded
Ven
Maha Kaccana said this Concerning the brief statement the Blessed One made after which he went into his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning  ie 'If with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions  categories of objectification assail a person there is nothing there to relish welcome or remain fastened to then that is the end of the obsessions of passion the obsessions of resistance the obsessions of views the obsessions of uncertainty the obsessions of conceit the obsessions of passion for becoming  the obsessions of ignorance
That is the end of taking up rods  bladed weapons of arguments quarrels disputes accusations divisive talebearing  false speech
That is where these evil unskillful things cease without remainder'  I understand the detailed meaning to be this
Dependent on eye  forms eyeconsciousness arises
The meeting of the three is contact
With contact as a requisite condition there is feeling
What one feels one perceives
What one perceives one thinks about
What one thinks about one objectifies
Based on what a person objectifies the perceptions  categories of objectification assail himher with regard to past present  future forms cognizable via the eye
Dependent on ear  sounds earconsciousness arises
Dependent on nose  aromas noseconsciousness arises
Dependent on tongue  flavors tongueconsciousness arises
Dependent on body  tactile sensations bodyconsciousness arises
Dependent on intellect  ideas intellectconsciousness arises
The meeting of the three is contact
With contact as a requisite condition there is feeling
What one feels one perceives
What one perceives one thinks about
What one thinks about one objectifies
Based on what a person objectifies the perceptions  categories of objectification assail himher with regard to past present  future ideas cognizable via the intellect
Now when there is the eye when there are forms when there is eyeconsciousness it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of contact
When there is a delineation of contact it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of feeling
When there is a delineation of feeling it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of perception
When there is a delineation of perception it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of thinking
When there is a delineation of thinking it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of being assailed by the perceptions  categories of objectification
When there is the ear
When there is the nose
When there is the tongue
When there is the body
When there is the intellect when there are ideas when there is intellectconsciousness it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of contact
When there is a delineation of contact it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of feeling
When there is a delineation of feeling it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of perception
When there is a delineation of perception it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of thinking
When there is a delineation of thinking it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of being assailed by the perceptions  categories of objectification
Now when there is no eye when there are no forms when there is no eyeconsciousness it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of contact
When there is no delineation of contact it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of feeling
When there is no delineation of feeling it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of perception
When there is no delineation of perception it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of thinking
When there is no delineation of thinking it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of being assailed by the perceptions  categories of objectification
When there is no ear
When there is no nose
When there is no tongue
When there is no body
When there is no intellect when there are no ideas when there is no intellectconsciousness it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of contact
When there is no delineation of contact it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of feeling
When there is no delineation of feeling it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of perception
When there is no delineation of perception it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of thinking
When there is no delineation of thinking it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of being assailed by the perceptions  categories of objectification
So concerning the brief statement the Blessed One made after which he entered his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning  ie 'If with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions  categories of objectification assail a person there is nothing there to relish welcome or remain fastened to then that is the end of the obsessions of passion the obsessions of resistance the obsessions of views the obsessions of uncertainty the obsessions of conceit the obsessions of passion for becoming  the obsessions of ignorance
That is the end of taking up rods  bladed weapons of arguments quarrels disputes accusations divisive talebearing  false speech
That is where these evil unskillful things cease without remainder'  this is how I understand the detailed meaning
Now if you wish having gone to the Blessed One question him about this matter
However he answers is how you should remember it
Then the monks delighting  approving of Ven
Maha Kaccana's words rose from their seats and went to the Blessed One
On arrival having bowed down to him they sat to one side
As they were sitting there they Then Ven
Maha Kaccana analyzed the meaning using these words statements  phrases
Maha Kaccana is wise monks
He is a person of great discernment
If you had asked me about this matter I too would have answered in the same way he did
That is the meaning of this statement
That is how you should remember it
When this was said Ven
Ananda said to the Blessed One Lord it's as if a man  overcome with hunger weakness  thirst  were to come across a ball of honey
Wherever he were to taste it he would experience a sweet delectable flavor
In the same way wherever a monk of capable awareness might investigate the meaning of this Dhamma discourse with his discernment he would experience gratification he would experience confidence
What is the name of this Dhamma discourse
Then Ananda you can remember this Dhamma discourse as the 'Ball of Honey Discourse' That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Ven
Ananda delighted in the Blessed One's words

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Kajjangalas in the Bamboo Grove
Then the young brahman Uttara a student of Parasiri went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged friendly greetings  courtesies
After this exchange of courteous greetings he sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Uttara does the brahman Parasiri teach his followers the development of the faculties
Yes master Gotama he does
And how does he teach his followers the development of the faculties
There is the case where one does not see forms with the eye or hear sounds with the ear
That's how the brahman Parasiri teaches his followers the development of the faculties
That being the case Uttara then a blind person will have developed faculties and a deaf person will have developed faculties according to the words of the brahman Parasiri
For a blind person does not see forms with the eye and a deaf person does not hear sounds with the ear
When this was said the young brahman Uttara sat silent  abashed his shoulders slumped his head down brooding at a loss for words
The Blessed One  noticing that Uttara was sitting silent  abashed his shoulders slumped his head down brooding at a loss for words  said to Ven
Ananda Ananda the development of the faculties that the brahman Parasiri teaches his followers is one thing but the unexcelled development of the faculties in the discipline of a noble one is something else entirely
Now is the time O Blessed One
Now is the time O One WellGone for the Blessed One to teach the unexcelled development of the faculties in the discipline of the noble one
Having heard the Blessed One the monks will remember it
In that case Ananda listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord Ven
Ananda responded to the Blessed One
The Blessed One said Now how Ananda in the discipline of a noble one is there the unexcelled development of the faculties
There is the case where when seeing a form with the eye there arises in a monk what is agreeable what is disagreeable what is agreeable  disagreeable
He discerns that 'This agreeable thing has arisen in me this disagreeable thing this agreeable  disagreeable thing has arisen in me
And that is compounded gross dependently coarisen
But this is peaceful this is exquisite ie equanimity' With that the arisen agreeable thing disagreeable thing agreeable  disagreeable thing ceases and equanimity takes its stance
Just as a man with good eyes having closed them might open them or having opened them might close them that is how quickly how rapidly how easily no matter what it refers to the arisen agreeable thing disagreeable thing agreeable  disagreeable thing ceases and equanimity takes its stance
In the discipline of a noble one this is called the unexcelled development of the faculties with regard to forms cognizable by the eye
Furthermore when hearing a sound with the ear there arises in a monk what is agreeable what is disagreeable what is agreeable  disagreeable
He discerns that 'This agreeable thing has arisen in me this disagreeable thing this agreeable  disagreeable thing has arisen in me
And that is compounded gross dependently coarisen
But this is peaceful this is exquisite ie equanimity' With that the arisen agreeable thing disagreeable thing agreeable  disagreeable thing ceases and equanimity takes its stance
Just as a strong man might easily snap his fingers that is how quickly how rapidly how easily no matter what it refers to the arisen agreeable thing disagreeable thing agreeable  disagreeable thing ceases and equanimity takes its stance
In the discipline of a noble one this is called the unexcelled development of the faculties with regard to sounds cognizable by the ear
Furthermore when smelling an aroma with the nose there arises in a monk what is agreeable what is disagreeable what is agreeable  disagreeable
He discerns that 'This agreeable thing has arisen in me this disagreeable thing this agreeable  disagreeable thing has arisen in me
And that is compounded gross dependently coarisen
But this is peaceful this is exquisite ie equanimity' With that the arisen agreeable thing disagreeable thing agreeable  disagreeable thing ceases and equanimity takes its stance
Just as drops of water roll off a gently sloping lotus leaf  do not remain there that is how quickly how rapidly how easily no matter what it refers to the arisen agreeable thing disagreeable thing agreeable  disagreeable thing ceases and equanimity takes its stance
In the discipline of a noble one this is called the unexcelled development of the faculties with regard to aromas cognizable by the nose
Furthermore when tasting a flavor with the tongue there arises in a monk what is agreeable what is disagreeable what is agreeable  disagreeable
He discerns that 'This agreeable thing has arisen in me this disagreeable thing this agreeable  disagreeable thing has arisen in me
And that is compounded gross dependently coarisen
But this is peaceful this is exquisite ie equanimity' With that the arisen agreeable thing disagreeable thing agreeable  disagreeable thing ceases and equanimity takes its stance
Just as a strong man might easily spit out a ball of saliva gathered on the tip of his tongue that is how quickly how rapidly how easily no matter what it refers to the arisen agreeable thing disagreeable thing agreeable  disagreeable thing ceases and equanimity takes its stance
In the discipline of a noble one this is called the unexcelled development of the faculties with regard to flavors cognizable by the tongue
Furthermore when touching a tactile sensation with the body there arises in a monk what is agreeable what is disagreeable what is agreeable  disagreeable
He discerns that 'This agreeable thing has arisen in me this disagreeable thing this agreeable  disagreeable thing has arisen in me
And that is compounded gross dependently coarisen
But this is peaceful this is exquisite ie equanimity' With that the arisen agreeable thing disagreeable thing agreeable  disagreeable thing ceases and equanimity takes its stance
Just as a strong man might easily extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm that is how quickly how rapidly how easily no matter what it refers to the arisen agreeable thing disagreeable thing agreeable  disagreeable thing ceases and equanimity takes its stance
In the discipline of a noble one this is called the unexcelled development of the faculties with regard to tactile sensations cognizable by the body
Furthermore when cognizing an idea with the intellect there arises in a monk what is agreeable what is disagreeable what is agreeable  disagreeable
He discerns that 'This agreeable thing has arisen in me this disagreeable thing this agreeable  disagreeable thing has arisen in me
And that is compounded gross dependently coarisen
But this is peaceful this is exquisite ie equanimity
With that the arisen agreeable thing disagreeable thing agreeable  disagreeable thing ceases and equanimity takes its stance
Just as a strong man might let two or three drops of water fall onto an iron pan heated all day Slow would be the falling of the drops of water but they quickly would vanish  disappear
That is how quickly how rapidly how easily no matter what it refers to the arisen agreeable thing disagreeable thing agreeable  disagreeable thing ceases and equanimity takes its stance
In the discipline of a noble one this is called the unexcelled development of the faculties with regard to ideas cognizable by the intellect
And how is one a person in training someone following the way
There is the case where when seeing a form with the eye there arises in a monk what is agreeable what is disagreeable what is agreeable  disagreeable
He feels horrified humiliated  disgusted with the arisen agreeable thing disagreeable thing agreeable  disagreeable thing
When hearing a sound with the ear When smelling an aroma with the nose When tasting a flavor with the tongue When touching a tactile sensation with the body When cognizing an idea with the intellect there arises in him what is agreeable what is disagreeable what is agreeable  disagreeable
He feels horrified humiliated  disgusted with the arisen agreeable thing disagreeable thing agreeable  disagreeable thing
This is how one is a person in training someone following the way
And how is one a noble one with developed faculties
There is the case where when seeing a form with the eye there arises in a monk what is agreeable what is disagreeable what is agreeable  disagreeable
If he wants he remains percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome
If he wants he remains percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome
If he wants he remains percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome  what is
If he wants he remains percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not
If he wants  in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not  cutting himself off from both he remains equanimous alert  mindful
When hearing a sound with the ear When smelling an aroma with the nose When tasting a flavor with the tongue When touching a tactile sensation with the body When cognizing an idea with the intellect there arises in him what is agreeable what is disagreeable what is agreeable  disagreeable
If he wants he remains percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome
If he wants he remains percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome
If he wants he remains percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome  what is
If he wants he remains percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not
If he wants  in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not  cutting himself off from both he remains equanimous alert  mindful
This is how one is a noble one with developed faculties
So Ananda I have taught you the unexcelled development of the faculties in the discipline of a noble one I have taught you how one is a person in training someone following the way I have taught you how one is a noble one with developed faculties
Whatever a teacher should do  seeking the welfare of his disciples out of sympathy for them  that have I done for you
Over there are the roots of trees over there empty dwellings
Practice jhana Ananda
Don't be heedless
Don't later fall into regret
This is our message to you all
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Ven
Ananda delighted in the Blessed One's words
Phra Ajaan Mun Bhuridatta Thera was born in in Baan Kham Bong a farming village in Ubon Ratchathani province northeastern Thailand
Ordained as a Buddhist monk in he spent the remainder of his life wandering through Thailand Burma and Laos dwelling for the most part in the forest engaged in the practice of meditation
He attracted an enormous following of students and together with his teacher Phra Ajaan Sao Kantasilo was responsible for the establishment of the forest ascetic tradition that has now spread throughout Thailand and to several countries abroad
He passed away in at Wat Suddhavasa Sakon Nakhorn province
Much has been written about his life but very little was recorded of his teachings during his lifetime
Most of his teachings he left in the form of people the students whose lives were profoundly shaped by the experience of living and practicing meditation under his guidance
One of the pieces that was recorded is translated here
A Heart Released is a record of passages from his sermons made during the years  by two monks who were staying under his guidance and edited by a third monk an ecclesiastical official who frequently visited him for instruction in meditation
The first edition of the book was printed with his permission for free distribution to the public
The title of the book was taken from a comment made by the Ven
Chao Khun Upali Gunupamacariya who after listening to a sermon delivered by Phra Ajaan Mun on the root themes of meditation praised the sermon as having been delivered with 'muttodaya'  a heart released  and as conveying the heart of release
The unusual style of Phra Ajaan Mun's sermons may be explained in part by the fact that in the days before his ordination he was skilled in a popular form of informal village entertainment called maw lam
Maw lam is a contest in extemporaneous rhyming usually reproducing the war between the sexes in which the battle of wits can become quite fierce
Much use is made of word play riddles puns innuendoes metaphors and simple playing with the sounds of words
The sense of language that Ajaan Mun developed in maw lam he carried over into his teachings after becoming a monk
Often he would teach his students in extemporaneous puns and rhymes
This sort of word play he even applied to the Pali language and a number of instances can be cited in Muttodaya in  the pun on the word dhatu which can mean both physical element and speech element the use of the phonemes na mo ba dha to stand for the four physical elements the play on namo and mano in  the use of the Patthana as an image for the mind in  the extraction of the word santo from pavessanto in  and  the grammatical pun on loke in  and santo in  the threes in  the eights in  and so on
This sort of rhetorical style has gone out of fashion in the West and is going out of style today even in Thailand but in the Thailand of Ajaan Mun's time it was held in high regard as a sign of quick intelligence and a subtle mind
Ajaan Mun was able to use it with finesse as an effective teaching method forcing his students to become more quickwitted and alert to implications correspondences multiple levels of meaning and the elusiveness of language to be less dogmatic in their attachments to the meanings of words and less inclined to look for the truth in terms of language
As Ajaan Mun once told a pair of visiting monks who were proud of their command of the medieval text The Path of Purification the niddesa on virtue concentration and discernment contained in that work were simply nidana
If they wanted to know the truth of virtue concentration and discernment they would have to bring these qualities into being in their own hearts and minds
The Lord Buddha taught that his Dhamma when placed in the heart of an ordinary runofthemill person is bound to be thoroughly corrupted but if placed in the heart of a Noble One it is bound to be genuinely pure and authentic something that at the same time can be neither effaced nor obscured
So as long as we are devoting ourselves merely to the theoretical study of the Dhamma it can't serve us well
Only when we have trained our hearts to eliminate their 'chameleons'  their corruptions  will it benefit us in full measure
And only then will the true Dhamma be kept pure free from distortions and deviations from its original principles
Our Lord Buddha first trained and tamed himself to the point where he attained unexcelled right selfawakening becoming buddho one who knows before becoming bhagava one who spreads the teaching to those who are to be taught
Only then did he become sattha the teacher and trainer of human and divine beings whose stage of development qualifies them to be trained
And thus kalyano kittisaddo abbhuggato His good name has spread to the four quarters of the compass even up to the present day
The same is true of all the Noble Disciples of the past
They trained and tamed themselves well before helping the Teacher spread his teachings to people at large and so their good name has spread just like the Buddha's
If however a person spreads the teaching without first having trained himself well papako saddo hoti His bad name will spread to the four quarters of the compass due to his error in not having followed the example of the Lord Buddha and all the Noble Disciples of the past
Why is it that wise people  before chanting receiving the precepts or performing any other act of merit  always take up namo as their starting point
Why is it that namo is never omitted or discarded
This suggests that namo must be significant
If we take it up for consideration we find that na stands for the water element and mo for the earth element  and with this a line from the scriptures comes to mind
matapetikasambhavo odanakummasapaccayo
'When the generative elements of the mother and father are combined the body comes into being
When it is born from the mother's womb it is nourished with rice and bread and so is able to develop and grow' Na is the mother's element mo the father's element
When these two elements are combined the mother's fire element then heats the combination until it becomes what is called a kalala a droplet of oil
This is the point where the connecting cognizance can make its connection so that the mind becomes joined to the namo element
Once the mind has taken up residence the droplet of oil develops until it is an ambuja a glob of blood
From a glob of blood it becomes a ghana a rod and then a pesi a piece of flesh
Then it expands itself into a lizardlike shape with five extensions two arms two legs and a head
After the child is born it has to depend on na its mother and mo its father to care for it nurturing it and nourishing it with such foods as rice and bread at the same time teaching and training it in every form of goodness
The mother and father are thus called the child's first and foremost teachers
The love and benevolence the mother and father feel for their children cannot be measured or calculated
The legacy they give us  this body  is our primal inheritance
External wealth silver or gold come from this body
If we didn't have this body we wouldn't be able to do anything which means that we wouldn't have anything at all
For this reason our body is the root of our entire inheritance from our mother and father which is why we say that the good they have done us cannot be measured or calculated
Wise people thus never neglect or forget them
We first have to take up this body this namo and only then do we perform the act of bowing it down in homage
To translate namo as homage is to translate only the act not the source of the act
This same root inheritance is the starting capital we use in training ourselves so we needn't feel lacking or poor when it comes to the resources needed for the practice
The two elements namo when mentioned by themselves aren't adequate or complete
We have to rearrange the vowels and consonants as follows Take the a from the n and give it to the m take the o from the m and give it to the n and then put the ma in front of the no
This gives us mano the heart
Now we have the body together with the heart and this is enough to be used as the root foundation for the practice
Mano the heart is primal the great foundation
Everything we do or say comes from the heart as stated in the Buddha's words
'All dhammas are preceded by the heart dominated by the heart made from the heart' The Buddha formulated the entire Dhamma and Vinaya from out of this great foundation the heart
So when his disciples contemplate in accordance with the Dhamma and Vinaya until namo is perfectly clear then mano lies at the end point of formulation
In other words it lies beyond all formulations
All supposings come from the heart
Each of us has his or her own load which we carry as supposings and formulations in line with the currents of the flood to the point where they give rise to unawareness the factor that creates states of becoming and birth all from our not being wise to these things from our deludedly holding them all to be 'me' or 'mine'
The seven books of the Abhidhamma except for the Patthana are finite in scope
As for the Patthana it is anantanaya infinite in scope
Only a Buddha is capable of comprehending it in its entirety
When we consider the Pali text which begins hetupaccayo we find that the cause that acts as the primal sustaining factor for all things in the cosmos is nothing other than the heart
The heart is the great cause  what is primal what is important
All things apart from it are effects or conditions
The remaining factors mentioned in the Patthana from arammana to aviggata can act as sustaining factors only because the great cause the heart comes first
Thus mano discussed in  thitibhutam which will be discussed in  and the great cause discussed here all refer to the same thing
The Buddha was able to formulate the Dhamma and Vinaya to know things with his tenpowered intuition and to comprehend all knowable phenomena all because the great cause acted as the primal factor
His comprehension was thus infinite in scope
In the same way all of the disciples had this great cause acting as their primal factor and so were able to know in accordance with the Buddha's teachings
This is why the Venerable Assaji the fifth of the five brethren taught Upatissa
'Whatever dhammas arise from a cause' This great cause being the important factor the primal factor then when the Venerable Assaji reached this point  the great cause  how could the Venerable Sariputta's mind help but penetrate down to the current of the Dhamma
 for everything in the world comes about due to the great cause
Even the transcendent dhammas are reached by the great cause
This is why the Patthana is said to be infinite in its scope
Whoever trains the heart the great cause until it is clear and dazzling is capable of knowing everything of every sort infinitely both within and without
Each and every one of us born as a human being has a birthplace we have our parents as our birthplace
So why did the Buddha formulate the teaching on sustained conditions only from the factor of unawareness onwards
What unawareness comes from he didn't say
Unawareness has to have a mother and father just as we do and we learn from the above line that thitibhutam is its mother and father
Thitibhutam refers to the primal mind
When the primal mind is imbued with delusion there is a sustaining factor the condition of unawareness
Once there is unawareness it acts as the sustenance for the fashioning of sankhara mental fashionings together with the act of clinging to them which gives rise to states of becoming and birth
In other words these things will have to keep on arising and giving rise to each other continually
They are thus called sustained or sustaining conditions because they support and sustain one another
Awareness and unawareness both come from thitibhutam
When thitibhutam is imbued with unawareness it isn't wise to its conditions but when it is imbued with awareness it realizes its conditions for what they really are
This is how the matter appears when considered with the clear insight leading to emergence
To summarize Thitibhutam is the primal instigator of the cycle of death and rebirth
Thus it is called the root source of the three
When we are to cut the cycle of death and rebirth so that it disconnects and vanishes into nothingness we have to train the primal instigator to develop awareness alert to all conditions for what they really are
It will then recover from its delusion and never give rise to any conditions again
Thitibhutam the root instigator will stop spinning and this will end our circling through the cycle of death and rebirth
aggam thanam manussesu maggam sattavisuddhiya
'The supreme position is to be found among human beings the path to the purification of living beings' This can be explained as follows We have received our legacy from namo our parents  ie this body which has taken a human birth the highest birth there is
We are supreme beings wellplaced in a supreme position complete with the treasures of thought word and deed
If we want to amass external treasures such as material wealth money and gold we can
If we want to amass internal treasures such as the extraordinary qualities of the paths their fruitions and nibbana we also can
The Buddha formulated the Dhamma and Vinaya for us human beings and not at all for cows horses elephants and so on
We human beings are a race that can practice to reach purity
So we shouldn't be discouraged or selfdeprecating thinking that we are lacking in worth or potential because as human beings we are capable
What we don't have we can give rise to
What we already have we can make greater
This is in keeping with the teaching found in the Vessantara Jataka
danam deti silam rakkhati bhavanam bhavetva ekacco saggam gacchati ekacco mokkham gacchati nissansayam
'Having worked at amassing wisdom through being charitable observing the precepts and developing the mind in line with the teachings of the Lord Buddha those who work only a little will have to go to heaven while those who are determined and really do the work  and at the same time having the help of the potential and perfections they have developed in the past  will reach nibbana without a doubt
'
Common animals are said not to be supreme because they can't act as human beings can
So it is rightly said that human beings are wellplaced in a supreme position able to lead themselves to the paths their fruitions and to pure nibbana
In which set of principles did the Lord Buddha establish our stronghold
When we consider this question we find that he established our stronghold in the great frames of reference
To make a comparison with worldly affairs In armed battles where victory is at stake it is necessary to find a stronghold
If one obtains a good stronghold one can successfully ward off the weapons of the enemy and there one can accumulate great strength to launch an attack driving the enemy to defeat
Such a place is thus called a stronghold ie a place complete with strong stockades gates moats and embattlements
So it is with the affairs of the Dhamma when we take the great frames of reference as our stronghold in that those who go into battle with the enemy  defilement  must start out by keeping track of the body as their frame of reference because when such things as sensual passion arise they arise at the body and mind
Because the sight of a body causes the mind to be aroused we can conclude that the body is the provocation and so we must examine the body as a means of stilling the Hindrances and calming the mind
This is a point that you should work at and develop as much as possible
In other words keep investigating that point without giving way at all
When an image of any part of the body arises take that part of the body as the basic theme for your investigation
You don't have to go shifting to other parts
To think that 'I've already seen this part
Other parts I haven't seen so I'll have to go and investigate other parts' isn't advisable at all
Even if you investigate the body until you have it analyzed minutely into all of its parts that are composed of the properties of earth water fire and wind  this is called patibhaga  you should still keep examining the body as it first appeared in the original image until you have it mastered
To master it you have to examine that same point over and over again just as when you chant
If you memorize a particular discourse and then leave it without chanting or repeating it again you will forget it and it won't serve any purpose due to your complacency in not mastering it
The same holds true in your investigation of the body
Once an image of any part arises if you don't investigate it repeatedly and instead heedlessly let it pass it won't serve any purpose at all
This investigation of the body has many citations one being in our presentday ordination ceremony
Before all else the preceptor must tell the ordinand the five meditation themes  hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth and skin ie this very body  because of their importance
In the Commentary to the Dhammapada it is said that an unwise preceptor who doesn't teach the investigation of the body may destroy his pupil's potential for arahantship
So at present the preceptor must first teach the five meditation themes
In another spot the Buddha taught that there is no such thing as a Buddha or an arahant who has not fixed on at least one part of the body as a meditation theme
Thus he told a group of monks who were discussing the earth  saying that such and such a village had red soil or black soil etc
 that they were discussing external earth when they should be investigating internal earth
In other words they should have been investigating this body intelligently penetrating it throughout and making it absolutely clear
When the Buddha finished his discussion of this topic all monks reached the fruition of arahantship
From this we can conclude that the investigation of the body must be important
Each and every person who is to gain release from all suffering and stress has to investigate the body
If we are to accumulate great strength we must accumulate it by investigating the body
Even the Lord Buddha when he was about to attain Awakening started out by investigating the breath  and what is the breath if not the body
So the great frames of reference starting with the contemplation of the body are said to be our stronghold
Once we have obtained a good stronghold  ie once we have put the principles of the great frames of reference into practice until we have them mastered  we should then investigate things as they are in terms of the inherent nature of their elements using the strategies of clear insight which will be discussed next
The nature of all good things is that they come from things that aren't good just as lotuses that are fair and lovely are born from mud that is filthy and repulsive yet once they rise clear of the mud they are clean and pure becoming a fitting headdress for a king a viceroy or a courtier never again returning to the mud
In this they are like the earnest meditator one engaged in a persistent effort
Such a person must investigate a thing that is filthy and repulsive if the mind is to gain release from all filthy and repulsive things
The 'thing that is filthy and repulsive' here is the body
The body is an assemblage of filth urine and excrement
The things that are exuded from the hair of the head the hair of the body nails teeth skin and so on are all forms of excrement
When they fall into food people take offense at it
The food has to be thrown out for no one can stomach it
Moreover the body has to be constantly washed and scrubbed if it is to look presentable
If we don't clean it it will smell rank and no one will let us come near
Clothing and other accessories when they are apart from the body are clean and attractive but as soon as they come into contact with the body they become dirty
If we let them go without washing for a long time no one will let us come near because of the smell
From this we can see that the body is a house of urine and excrement asubha  unattractive patikkula  repulsive
When still alive it's bad enough when there is no more life to it it's even more disgusting to the point where nothing else can compare
So from the very beginning all earnest meditators investigate the body methodically until they have it mastered
Before the body becomes clear they investigate whichever part or aspect of the body is agreeable to their temperament until a particular aspect of the body appears as an uggaha nimitta
Then they focus on that aspect working at it and developing it repeatedly
'Working at it and developing it repeatedly' should be understood as follows When rice farmers grow rice they work in the soil plowing the soil and planting rice in the soil
The following year they grow rice in the soil again
They don't grow their rice in the air or in the middle of the sky
They grow it only in the soil and the rice then fills their granaries of its own accord
When they work repeatedly in the soil they don't have to plead 'Rice O rice please come and fill our granaries' The rice pours in of its own accord
And even if they forbid it saying 'Rice O rice don't come and fill our granaries' if they have completed their work in the soil there's no doubt but that the rice will still come and keep their granaries full
In the same way we as earnest meditators should keep investigating the body at the point that is agreeable to our temperaments or first appears for us to see
No matter what we should not neglect or abandon that point
Working at it repeatedly doesn't refer only to the practice of walking meditation
We should be mindful continuing our investigation in all places and at all times
Sitting standing walking and lying down eating drinking working speaking and thinking we should always have allround mindfulness of the present This is what is meant by 'working at it repeatedly'
Once you have investigated the body until it is clear you should then consider dividing it up into its various parts using your own way of being methodical
Separate the body into the elements of earth water fire and wind examining it until you really see it in those terms
At this stage you may use any strategies of your own devising that are agreeable to your temperament but you must not in any event abandon the original reference point that first appeared to you
When you are investigating at this stage you should work at it and develop it repeatedly
Don't investigate once and then let it go for half a month or a month
Investigate in and out back and forth again and again
In other words withdraw inward to quiet the mind and then come out again to investigate the body
Don't exclusively investigate the body or exclusively quiet the mind
When you have investigated in this way until you have it thoroughly mastered what happens next is what comes of its own accord
The mind is bound to converge in a big way and the instant it converges everything will appear to converge being one and the same
The entire world will be nothing but elements
At the same time an image will appear of the world as being level as a drum head because the entire world is of one and the same inherent nature
Forests mountains people animals  even you yourself  will all ultimately have to be leveled down in one and the same way
Together with this vision knowledge arises cutting off all doubts in the heart
This is called yathabhutañanadassana vipassana the clear insight that both knows and sees things for what they actually are
This step is not the end point
It is the beginning of the next stage we have to practice which we as earnest meditators are to work at and develop repeatedly in order for heightened awareness to be mastered and complete
Then we will see that the mental fashionings that suppose 'This is mine That is me' are inconstancy and that because of attachment they are suffering  for all elements have been the way they are all along arising aging growing ill and dying arising and deteriorating since before we were born
From time immemorial this is the way they have been
But because the conditions of the mind and the five khandhas  rupa vedana sañña sankhara and viññana  have fashioned and labeled throughout every existence up to the present through lives too numerous to number the mind has been deluded into following its supposings
It's not the case that our supposings have attached themselves to us
When you come right down to it there's no doubt but that all phenomena in the world whether endowed with consciousness or not have been the way they are  arising and deteriorating on their own  in just this way
So we realize pubbe ananussu tesu dhammesu  these regularities of behavior have been this way from the past
Even though no one has told us we know that this is just the way they have been
This is why the Buddha maintained with regard to this point that he didn't hear this from anyone wasn't taught this by anyone  for this is just the way these things had been since before his time
Thus we can see that the regularities in the behavior of all elements are bound to be this way
But because the conditions of the mind have fastened into all of these things for so many lives they have behaved in line with those supposings
The mind has been overwhelmed by latent tendencies to the point where it is deluded into believing them and so states of becoming and birth have been created through the clinging of the conditions of the mind
Thus the earnest meditator comes to analyze things down in line with their inherent nature seeing that
sabbe sankhara anicca sabbe sankhara dukkha
Acts of mental fashioning  the conditions of the mind  are what is inconstant
The world of living beings is constant It is simply the way it is
Analyze these things in terms of the four Noble Truths as a way of rectifying the conditions of the mind so that you can see for certain in your own right that these conditions of the mind are inconstant and stressful
And the fact that you haven't seen in your own right that they are inconstant and stressful is why you have fallen for mental fashionings
When you truly see this it will rectify the conditions of the mind
The realization will come to you
sankhara sassata natthi
'There are no mental fashionings that are constant and lasting' Mental fashionings are simply conditions of the mind like mirages
As for living beings they have been a constant feature of the world all along
When you know both sides  ie that living beings are simply the way they are and that mental fashionings are simply a condition of the mind that supposes them  then thitibhutam the primal mind that has no conditions can gain release
As for the teaching that all phenomena or regularities of behavior are notself How could they be the self
Their business is simply to arise the way they do
Thus the Buddha taught
sabbe dhamma anatta
'All phenomena are notself' We as earnest meditators should investigate things to see them clearly in this way until the mind is made to converge enabling us to see truly and vividly along these lines in our own right at the same time giving rise to the knowledge that accompanies this vision
This is what is meant by vutthanagamini vipassana
We should work at this stage until it is mastered until we see truly and clearly along with the full convergence of the mind and its concurrent knowledge converging against the current curing the latent tendencies turning supposing into release or until we converge on the primal mind that is simply the way it is to the point where it is absolutely clear with the concurrent knowledge
Khina jati ñanam hoti
'There is the knowledge of no more birth'
This stage is not an assumption or a supposing
It isn't anything fashioned or conjectured into being nor is it anything that can be obtained by wanting
It is something that arises is and knows entirely of its own accord
Intense relentless practice in which we analyze things shrewdly on our own is what will cause it to arise of its own accord
This has been compared to rice plants
Once we have properly nourished and cared for the rice plant the results  the grains of rice  are not something that can be obtained by wanting
They will appear of their own accord
If a person who wants to get rice is lazy and doesn't care for the rice plant he can keep wanting until the day he dies but no rice grains will appear for him
The same holds true with the reality of release It isn't something that can be obtained by wanting
A person who wants release but who practices wrongly or doesn't practice  and wastes his time being lazy until the day he dies  won't meet with release at all
'Monks this mind is originally radiant and clear but because passing corruptions and defilements come and obscure it it doesn't show its radiance' This has been compared to a tree in the poem that runs
This can be explained as follows The tall tree with branches  if we cut off the three zeroes this leaves us with six which stands for the six sense doors the entry way for the chameleons ie things that are counterfeit not things that are genuine
Defilements aren't genuine
They are simply things that come drifting in through the sense doors by the hundreds and thousands
Not only that defilements that haven't yet arisen will arise more and more every day as long as we don't find a means for rectifying the nature of the mind
The mind is something more radiant than anything else can be but because counterfeits  passing defilements  come and obscure it it loses its radiance like the sun when obscured by clouds
Don't go thinking that the sun goes after the clouds
Instead the clouds come drifting along and obscure the sun
So meditators when they know in this manner should do away with these counterfeits by analyzing them shrewdly as explained in the strategies of clear insight 
When they develop the mind to the stage of the primal mind this will mean that all counterfeits are destroyed or rather counterfeit things won't be able to reach into the primal mind because the bridge making the connection will have been destroyed
Even though the mind may then still have to come into contact with the preoccupations of the world its contact will be like that of a bead of water rolling over a lotus leaf
A famous horsetrainer once approached the Lord Buddha and asked him how he trained his disciples
The Buddha responded by asking the trainer how he trained horses
The trainer replied that there were four kinds of horses those easy to tame those of an intermediate sort those genuinely hard to tame and those that couldn't be tamed at all and had to be killed
The Buddha replied 'So it is with me' Those easy to tame ie those whose minds gather easily should eat enough food to nourish the body
Those of an intermediate sort ie those whose minds have some trouble settling down should not be allowed to eat much  only a little food
Those genuinely hard to tame ie those who really have trouble getting their minds to settle down shouldn't eat at all but they have to be attannu They have to know their own strength and exactly how much they will be able to endure
As for those who couldn't be tamed and had to be killed  ie those termed padaparama who couldn't subdue their minds at all  the Buddha would withdraw the bridge
In other words he wouldn't teach them which was tantamount to killing them
Tika means three
Mula means root
Together they mean 'things that are roots in sets of three' Passion aversion and delusion are three termed the roots of what is unwise
Craving comes in threes sensual craving craving for becoming and craving for no becoming
The floods and effluents of the mind each come in threes sensuality states of becoming and unawareness
If a person falls in with these sorts of threes then
tiparivattam
He or she will have to keep spinning around in threes and so the three realms  the realms of sensuality form and formlessness  will have to continue as they are for these threes are the roots of the three realms
The remedy also comes in threes virtue concentration and discernment
When people practice in line with the virtue concentration and discernment forming the cure then
na tiparivattam
They won't have to keep spinning in threes
The three realms won't exist
In other words they will gain utter release from the three realms
akuppam sabbadhammesu neyyadhamma pavessanto
'One must have a mind unaroused with regard to any defilements and must know all phenomena both within and without
in order to be calm and at peace' A person at peace in this way will have a fully developed sense of conscience and shame mental qualities that are pure and clean a firm steady mind and a personal integrity endowed with the qualities of a deva as stated in the stanza that runs
Devas by birth  the inhabitants of the celestial realms  are replete with sensual pleasures and restless with defilement
How then can they be at peace
This stanza thus must surely refer to visuddhi devas ie to arahants
Such people are genuinely at peace and qualify as having a fully developed sense of conscience and shame together with 'white qualities' ie true purity
The four Noble Truths  suffering its cause its cessation and the path to its cessation  are activities in that each truth has an aspect that has to be done Suffering has to be understood its cause abandoned its cessation made clear and the path to its cessation developed
All of these are aspects that have to be done  and if they have to be done they must be activities
So we can conclude that all four truths are activities
This is in keeping with the first verse quoted above which speaks of the four truths as feet stair treads or steps that must be taken for the task to be finished
What follows is thus termed activitylessness  like writing the numerals   then erasing  leaving just and not writing anything more
What is left is read as 'zero' but it doesn't have any value at all
You can't use it to add subtract multiply or divide with any other numerals yet at the same time you can't say that it doesn't exist for there it is
This is like the discernment that knows all around because it destroys the activity of supposing
In other words it erases supposing completely and doesn't become involved with or hold on to any supposings at all
With the words 'erasing' or 'destroying' the activity of supposing the question arises 'When supposing is entirely destroyed where will we stay' The answer is that we will stay in a place that isn't supposed right there with activitylessness
This explanation is in line with the aspects of reality that appear clearly only to those who practice and that people who don't practice can't know
Only when we listen and then practice accordingly until we see and know of our own accord will we be able to understand
The meaning of the next verse is this 'Those who have no more effluents extinguish the three realms and are dazzling' In other words they have practiced persistence and made an investigation 'bhavito bahulikato' In other words they have worked at it and developed it repeatedly to the point where the mind has the strength capable of analyzing and destroying all supposings so as to reach activitylessness
They can thus gain release from the three realms
In extinguishing the three realms arahants don't fly up into the realms of sensuality form and formlessness
They stay right where they are
The same was true of the Buddha When he extinguished the three realms he was sitting in one spot under the Bodhi tree
He didn't fly up into the three realms
He extinguished them at the mind  for right there in the mind is where the three realms exist
Those who aim at extinguishing the three realms should thus extinguish them in their own hearts
Only then will they obliterate activity  the act of supposing  from the heart leaving just activitylessness
This is the primal heart the primal Dhamma which knows no death
The realms of the heavenly beings the human realm and the realms of destitution are classed as the sensual realm the abode of living beings who indulge in sensuality
Taken together they count as one
The realms of form the abodes of living beings who have attained rupa jhana are four
The realms of formlessness the abodes of living beings who have attained arupa jhana are also four
So altogether there are nine abodes for living beings
Those  the arahants  who are wise to the nine abodes leave them and don't have to live in any of them
This appears in the last of the Novice's Questions 'dasa nama kim'  What is ten
 which is answered
'dasahangehi samaññagato arahati vuccati ti'  The arahant one who is endowed with ten qualities gains release from the nine abodes of living beings
This can be compared to writing the numerals  
to are numbers that can be counted named added subtracted multiplied and divided
As for ten  and  when we erase the because it's a repetition we are left with
If we use to add subtract multiply or divide with any other number it won't increase the value of that number and by itself has no value at all  but you can't say that it doesn't exist because there it is
The same is true with the heart It's a nature whose attributes are like
When is connected to any other number it greatly increases the value of that number
For instance connected with becomes
So it is with the heart
When connected with anything it instantly proliferates into things elaborate and fantastic
But when trained until it is wise and discerning with regard to all knowable phenomena it returns to its state as  empty open and clear beyond all counting and naming
It doesn't stay in the nine places that are abodes for living beings
Instead it stays in a place devoid of supposing and formulation its inherent nature as or activitylessness as mentioned in 
The sermons delivered by the Lord Buddha at three points in his career have a great significance to which Buddhists should give special thought and consideration
A
At the beginning of the Buddha's career he delivered a sermon to the five brethren at the forest in the Deer Park at Isipatana near Benares
This was his first sermon called the Wheel of Dhamma
He started with the two extremes that those who have gone forth from the household life should not indulge in saying
dveme bhikkhave anta pabbajitena na sevitabba
'Monks there are these two extremes that those who have gone forth from the household life should not pursue indulgence in sensual pleasure and indulgence in self  affliction' To explain Indulgence in sensual pleasure lies on the side of love indulgence in selfaffliction on the side of hate
Both sides are causes of suffering and stress
When we practice selfpurification and yet fall into either of these two sides we can't be said to have entered the middle way for when we are making a persistent effort to practice and the mind becomes fully calm and relaxed we are pleased when the mind thinks and becomes restless and distracted we are displeased
Being pleased is indulgence in pleasure being displeased indulgence in selfaffliction
Being pleased is passion being displeased is aversion and not being wise to passion and aversion is delusion
Whoever makes an effort to develop persistence in concentration has to start out by running into these two extremes
If we run into these extremes we are classed as wrong but it is only normal that we be wrong before we can be right
Even the Buddha before his Awakening was completely wrong in just the same way
Even his two foremost disciples were wrong  and held pernicious doctrines to boot
All the other disciples started out wrong from the beginning as well
But when the Buddha came to follow the middle way while meditating under the shade of the Bodhi tree after having gained the first two knowledges  remembrance of previous lifetimes and knowledge of the death and rebirth of living beings  in the first two watches of the night he gained the third knowledge  knowledge of the ending of mental effluents  in the watch toward dawn
This was when he found the genuine middle way releasing his mind from the error of the two extremes
Released from the clan class abodes lineage and legacy of convention and supposing he attained the clan class abode lineage and legacy of the Noble Ones
The Noble Disciples came to know following the Buddha acting correctly in line with the knowledge of the ending of mental effluents and gained release from error just as he had
As for us as meditators in the very beginning it is only normal that we will have to be wrong
As long as we let ourselves be pleased and displeased in the development of merit and wisdom we fall under the sway of the ways of the world and when we are under the sway of the ways of the world we are shaken by pleasure and displeasure
This is called being shaken back and forth
uppanno kho me
Where do the ways of the world arise
In ourselves
The ways of the world have eight factors and the path that cures them has eight as well
The eightfold path is the cure for the eight ways of the world
Thus the Buddha taught the middle way as the cure for the two extremes
Once we have cured ourselves of the two extremes we enter the noble path cutting across the currents of the world making the mind cago patinissaggo mutti analayo  relinquish release and rest easy
To summarize As long as the two extremes still exist in your heart you are not on the right track
But when your heart gains release from the two extremes you become unshakable free from impurities and safe from the flood
This is why the meaning of the Wheel of Dhamma is very significant
When the Buddha explained the Wheel of Dhamma it caused the elements of the world to tremble
And when the message is so significant how could they help but tremble
The elements of the world are nothing else but this very body of ours
Our body is composed of the world's elements and it trembles because the mind sees into something it has never seen before
The fact that the mind is released from the two extremes is what causes the elements of the world to tremble
They tremble because the mind is not coming back to give rise to them ever again
B
At the midpoint of the Buddha's career he delivered the Patimokkha Exhortation to an assembly of arahants at the Squirrels' Feeding Grounds in the Royal Bamboo Grove near Rajagaha
One of the important points was
adhicitte ca ayogo etam buddhanasasanam
'Heighten the mind That is the teaching of the Buddhas' To heighten the mind we have to be calm and at peace
iccha lobhasamapanno samano kim bhavissati
'When we are endowed with desire  greedy struggling and deluded  how can we be calm and at peace' We need to practice by following the discipline as our starting point and by developing our meditation theme beginning with walking and sitting meditation
We must work at our contemplation of the great frames of reference and develop it repeatedly starting by keeping track of the body as our frame of reference
At first we should contemplate the parts of the body by means of parikamma savana ie by means of conjecture  that this part is like that and that is like this  because if we do this mindfully with selfawareness the mind won't wander far from the body and will settle down easily
When we practice parikamma savana repeatedly an uggaha nimitta will arise
We should then master that stage until we reach patibhaga analyzing the vision into its parts
When we master patibhaga fully it will turn into insight meditation
We then develop insight meditation to its highest degree so that the mind will reach thitibhutam as discussed in the strategies of clear insight
This is what is meant by 'practice' When we have practiced
We will cross over and beyond
It is because of the practices that we have done to completion that we will cross over and beyond  ie beyond the world
This is what is meant by the transcendent dhammas
We will gain relief from bondage
Thus the message of the middle sermon is significant because it aims at release
At the end of his career when he was about to enter total nibbana the Buddha delivered his final sermon in the midst of a gathering of Noble Disciples in the Royal Sala Grove of the Mallian gentry of Kusinara saying handadani amantayami vo bhikkhave pativediyami vo bhikkhave khayavayadhamma sankhara appamadena sampadetha 'I say to you monks do not be complacent
Contemplate fashionings that arise and then decay
When you contemplate in this manner you will penetrate completely
' That was all he said and he never said anything further
This is thus said to be his final sermon
To explain the meaning Where do fashionings arise
What are fashionings
Fashionings arise in our own minds
They are an effect or condition of the mind that gives rise to all supposings
These fashionings are the culprits that suppose and formulate everything in the world
Actually the things of the world  in their elementary properties as phenomena  are simply the way they are
Earth trees mountains sky and sunshine don't say that they are anything at all
Even the human body which is also composed of the world's elements doesn't say that it is this or that
Mental fashioning is the culprit that styles these things as being this or that  and we fall for what it says as being true holding that all these things are ours or ourselves
Passion aversion and delusion thus arise causing the primal mind to stray deludedly after birth aging illness and death circling around endlessly through innumerable states of becoming and birth  all through the instigation of mental fashioning
This is why the Buddha taught us to contemplate mental fashionings as inconstant and stressful
sabbe sankhara anicca sabbe sankhara dukkha
We keep at this until we see them with full and clear comprehension  which arises as the fruit of having earlier developed patibhaga  to the point where the mind enters the bhavanga its underlying state
When the current of the bhavanga disappears a genuinely intuitive understanding will arise right at the heart 'That's just how they are  inconstant and stressful' When we master this and see it clearly and distinctly we will then be wise to mental fashionings
Mental fashionings will no longer be able to fashion the mind into becoming aroused ever again as stated in the verse
akuppam sabbadhammesu neyyadhamma pavessanto
When mental fashioning can no longer fashion the mind the mind doesn't become aroused
It is wise to all knowable dhammas
and thus calm and at peace reaching release
The words of this final sermon are truly significant
They can make the person who contemplates them awaken to the ultimate degree  which is why the Buddha stopped speaking and said no more
The sermons given at these three points in the Buddha's career have a significance over and beyond that of any other he ever gave
The first sermon aims at release the middle sermon aims at release the final sermon aims at release
In this way all three of them without exception aim at nothing but release
'They dwell without effluent having entered the release through concentration and release through discernment realized and verified by themselves in the very present'
This passage from the Canon shows that arahants of no matter what sort reach both release through concentration and release through discernment free from effluents in the present
No distinctions are made saying that this or that group reaches release only through concentration or only through discernment
The explanation given by the Commentators  that release through concentration pertains to those arahants who develop concentration first while release through discernment pertains to the 'dry insight' arahants who develop insight exclusively without having first developed concentration  runs counter to the path
The eightfold path includes both Right View and Right Concentration
A person who is to gain release has to develop all eight factors of the path
Otherwise he or she won't be able to gain release
The threefold training includes both concentration and discernment
A person who is to attain knowledge of the ending of mental effluents has to develop all three parts of the threefold training completely
This is why we say that arahants of every sort have to reach both release through concentration and release through discernment
Thus have I heard 
On one occasion the Blessed One was living on the Vulture's Peak near Rajagaha
Then four great kings having placed a guard over the four quarters with a large army of Yakkhas of Gandhabbas of Kumbhandas of Nagas having placed troops having placed a barricade of soldiers on four sides came to the presence of the Blessed One when the night was far advanced illuminating the entire Vulture's Peak with their surpassing radiance saluted the Blessed One and sat on one side
From among the Yakkhas some saluted the Blessed One and sat on one side some exchanged greetings with the Blessed One conversing in a friendly and courteous manner and sat on one side some saluted him with clasped hands and sat on one side some announced their name and lineage and sat on one side some sat on one side in silence
Then the great King Vessavana who was seated on one side said to the Blessed One
Venerable Sir there are eminent Yakkhas who are not pleased with the Blessed One there are also eminent Yakkhas pleased with the Blessed One
There are Yakkhas of middle rank who are not pleased with the Blessed One and there are those who are pleased with the Blessed One
There are Yakkhas of inferior rank who are not pleased with the Blessed One and there are those who are pleased with the Blessed One
The Yakkhas bhante as a rule are not pleased with the Blessed One
What is the reason for this
Well the Blessed One teaches the Dhamma to establish abstention from killing from stealing from sexual misconduct from false speech and from liquor that causes intoxication and negligence
To them such teaching is unpleasant and unpalatable
Surely bhante there are disciples of the Blessed One
They frequent the remote recesses of forest and woodland wilderness where there is no sound no tumult where breezes are void of human contact and suitable for man's seclusion and quiet contemplation
There are eminent Yakkhas who haunt these forests who have no faith in the word of the Blessed One
Bhante may the Blessed One learn the Atanata protection so that the displeased Yakkhas may be pleased so that the monks and nuns laymen and laywomen may be at ease guarded protected and unharmed
The Blessed One gave consent by his silence
Then the great King Vessavana knowing that the Blessed One had consented recited the Atanatiya protection

Happy One this is the Atanata protection whereby both the monks and nuns laymen and laywomen may live at ease guarded protected and unharmed
If any monk or nun layman or laywoman learns by heart this Atanata protection and be wordperfect in repeating it and if any nonhuman male or female Yakkha youth or maiden Yakkha Yakkha Minister or any Yakkha or Yakkha attendant male or female Gandhabba male or female Kumbhanda male or female Naga were to walk with him or her or stand or sit or lie down with him or her with malevolent intent such a nonhuman Happy One will not obtain hospitality from any town or township will not obtain a place to dwell nor could live in the Kingdom of Alakamanda

Happy One there are nonhumans who are fierce violent given to retaliation those nonhumans heed neither the great kings nor their ministers nor their attendants
They are called rebels against the great kings
Even as in the kingdom of Magadha the thieves heed neither the king of Magadha nor the ministers nor their attendants and are called rebels against the king of Magadha so there are nonhumans who are fierce
They are called rebels against the great kings
Happy One if any nonhuman  male or female Yakkha youth or maiden Yakkha yakkha minister or any Yakkha or Yakkha attendant male or female Gandhabba male or female Kumbhanda male or female Naga were to walk with a monk or nun or a layman or laywoman or stand or sit or lie down with him or her with malevolent intent then should inform cry aloud and shout to those Yakkhas to the mighty Yakkhas their commanders and chief commanders saying 'This Yakkha is seizing me takes possession of me is harassing me assailing me is harming me harming me intensely and would not let me go'
Who are the Yakkhas mighty Yakkhas and commanders and chief commanders
These are the Yakkhas mighty Yakkhas the commanders the chief commanders to whom should inform cry aloud and shout saying 'This Yakkha is seizing me takes possession of me is harassing me assailing me is harming me and harming me intensely and this Yakkha would not let me go'
This Happy One is the Atanata protection whereby monks and nuns laymen and laywomen may live at ease guarded protected and unharmed
Happy One we now take our leave of you for we have many duties to attend to
Great Kings it is time for your departure
The four great kings arose from their seats and saluting the Blessed One circled round him on his right side and there and then vanished
From among the Yakkhas some arose from their seats and saluted the Blessed One circled round him on his right side and there and then vanished some exchanged greetings with the Blessed One conversing in a friendly and courteous manner and there and then vanished some saluted the Blessed One with clasped hands and there and then vanished some announced their name and lineage and there and then vanished some in silence there and then vanished
When the night had passed the Blessed One addressed the monks Learn by heart monks the Atanata protection constantly make use of it bear it in mind
This Atanata protection monks pertains to your welfare and by virtue of it monks and nuns laymen and laywomen may live at ease guarded protected and unharmed
This the Blessed One said
Those monks glad at heart rejoiced at the words of the Blessed One
They are Dhatarattha Virulha Virupakkha and Vessavana presiding over the four quarters in the celestial regions
Vessavana king of the Northern quarter according to the Commentary was familiar with the Buddha expert in conversation and welldisciplined and thus he became the spokesman
Kuvera is another name for Vessavana
stanza 
According to Dighanikayaattakathatika King Vessavana had a town by the name of Atanata where the four kings assembled and recited this Paritta which speaks of the virtues of the seven Buddhas Vipassi Sikhi Vessabhu Kakusanda Konagama Kassapa Gotama
They approached the Buddha with the intention of obtaining his approval in which event they felt that this Paritta will attain a revered position satthu kathite imam parittam garu bhavissatiti pi aha
Learn ugganhatha There is nothing for the Buddha to learn afresh
As the Commentary says it was to create an opportunity for the Buddha to listen to the discourse Imam parittam savetum okasam karonto evamha
Vijjacarana literally science and conduct
From the th stanza I have adopted the method of numbering the stanzas in consecutive order
Kusalena an unusual phrase omniscience pure wisdom sublime wisdom
Na piniyanti literally they do not carry the plough
Tam pittim abhiruyha mounting on the back
Etassa aparabhage
On one occasion Ven
Ananda was staying in Kosambi at Ghosita's monastery
There he addressed the monks Friend monks
Yes friend the monks replied to him
Ven
Ananda said It is amazing friends it is marvelous how the Blessed One who knows  sees the worthy one rightly selfawakened has attained  recognized the opportunity for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow  lamentation for the disappearance of pain  distress for the attainment of the right method  for the realization of Unbinding where the eye will be and forms and yet one will not be sensitive to that dimension where the ear will be and sounds where the nose will be and aromas where the tongue will be and flavors where the body will be and tactile sensations and yet one will not be sensitive to that dimension
When this was said Ven
Udayin said to Ven
Ananda Is one percipient when not sensitive to that dimension my friend or unpercipient
One is percipient when not sensitive to that dimension my friend not unpercipient
When not sensitive to that dimension my friend one is percipient of what
There is the case where with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity 'Infinite space' one enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space
This is one way of being percipient when not sensitive to that dimension
Then again with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space 'Infinite consciousness' one enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
This is another way of being percipient when not sensitive to that dimension
Then again with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness 'There is nothing' one enters  remains in the dimension of nothingness
This is another way of being percipient when not sensitive to that dimension
Once friend when I was staying in Saketa at the Game Refuge in the Black Forest the nun Jatila Bhagika went to where I was staying and on arrival  having bowed to me  stood to one side
As she was standing there she said to me 'The concentration whereby  neither pressed down nor forced back nor with fabrication kept blocked or suppressed  still as a result of release contented as a result of standing still and as a result of contentment one is not agitated This concentration is said by the Blessed One to be the fruit of what'
I said to her 'Sister the concentration whereby  neither pressed down nor forced back nor with fabrication kept blocked or suppressed  still as a result of release contented as a result of standing still and as a result of contentment one is not agitated This concentration is said by the Blessed One to be the fruit of gnosis' This is another way of being percipient when not sensitive to that dimension
This anthology drawn from the teachings of Phra Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo provides an introduction to the basic outlines of his thought and the method of meditation he taught
The first excerpt from The Craft of the Heart was written shortly after he had received training from Phra Ajaan Mun Bhuridatto
In it Ajaan Lee shows how he regarded the state of meditation practice in Thailand at the time and gives some ideas of why he himself had chosen the path of becoming a meditating monk
The passage from Keeping the Breath in Mind details the method of meditation he developed and taught in the later years of his life
The passage from The Path to Peace and Freedom for the Mind elaborates on a theme he had learned from Ajaan Mun that there are no sharp boundaries among the practice of virtue concentration and discernment and that all three of these aspects of the path are mutually reinforcing
The three excerpts from Dhamma talks make a similar point that there is no sharp division between the practice of tranquillity meditation and insight meditation
They also emphasize the role played by experimenting and using one's powers of observation in developing meditation as a skill
The excerpts from Frames of Reference and Basic Themes deal with the development of discernment particularly with regard to detecting the currents of the mind  both those that flow out and get involved with the world and those that spin around with reference to the mind in the present  so as to touch the aspect of the mind that doesn't flow even to the present moment
The next excerpt from the concluding section of The Craft of the Heart discusses the goal of the practice as a supreme awareness beyond all suppositions
The final excerpt from Ajaan Lee's Autobiography discusses some of the lessons he learned by living in the forest
My hope is that this anthology will inspire the reader to further explore Ajaan Lee's teachings  both through reading more of his writings and through putting their teachings into practice
When I first became aware of the conflicting views held by people who practice  and of how illinformed they are  I felt inspired by their desire to learn the truth but at the same time dismayed over their views right mixed with wrong some people saying that nibbana and the paths leading to it still exist others maintaining that nibbana has passed away and can no longer be attained
This latter belief is a particular cause for dismay because a desire for nibbana is what has led us all to submit ourselves to the practice of the Buddha's teachings in the first place
If we don't have such a desire we aren't likely to be especially sincere in our practice and if we aren't sincere our practice will be in vain as far as the benefits the Buddha intended for us are concerned because the Buddha's sole purpose in teaching was to liberate living beings from suffering and stress
If we were to worm our way in as parasites on his religion it would run counter to his compassionate intentions toward us
Each and every one of us aims for what is good so we should pay heed to whatever factors may lead to release from suffering and stress
Don't let the Buddha's teaching pass by you in vain
By and large from what I've seen of people who practice a great many of them train themselves in ways that mix right with wrong and then set themselves up as teachers instructing their pupils in line with their various theories about jhana concentration nibbana and the stream leading to it
The lowest level are those who get so caught up with their own views and opinions that their teachings can become detrimental  saying for example that we don't have enough merit to practice that we've been born too late for nibbana and the paths leading to it and so have to give up our practice

But no matter what level a person may know if he doesn't know the hearts and minds of others he'll have great difficulty in making his teachings effective and beneficial
Even though he may have good intentions if he lacks knowledge of those he is teaching progress will be difficult
The Buddha whenever he taught knew the capabilities and dispositions of his listeners and the level of teaching for which they were ripe
He then tailored his teachings to suit their condition which was why he was able to get good results
Even though he had a lot of seed to sow he planted it only where he knew it would sprout
If he saw that the soil was barren or the climate harsh he wouldn't plant any seed at all
But as for us we have only a fistful of rice and yet we cast it along a mountain spine or in the belly of the sea and so get either meager results or none at all
Thus in this book I have included teachings on every level  elementary intermediate and advanced  leaving it up to the reader to pick out the teachings intended for his or her own level of attainment
In practicing meditation if you direct your mind along the right path you'll see results in the immediate present
At the same time if you lead yourself astray you'll reap harm in the immediate present as well
For the most part if meditators lack the training that comes from associating with those who are truly expert and experienced they can become deluded or schizoid in a variety of ways
How so
By letting themselves get carried away with the signs or visions that appear to them to the point where they lose sense of their own bodies and minds
Playing around with an external kasina is a special culprit in this regard
Those who lack sufficient training will tend to hallucinate convinced of the truth of whatever they focus on letting themselves get carried away by what they know and see until they lose touch with reality making it difficult for any sort of discernment to arise
For this reason in this guide I have taught to focus exclusively on the body and mind the important point being not to fasten on or become obsessed with whatever may appear in the course of your practice
There are a wide variety of meditation teachers who deviate from the basic principles taught by the Buddha
Some of them hoping for gain status or praise set up their own creeds with magical formulae and strict observances teaching their students to invoke the aid of the Buddha
Some teachers invoke the five forms of rapture or else visions of this or that color or shape
If you see such and such vision you attain the first level of the path and so on until you attain the second third and fourth levels and then once a year you present your teacher with offerings of rice fruit and a pig's head
Once the pupils of such teachers come to the end of their observances they run out of levels to attain and so can assume themselves to be Buddhas Private Buddhas or Noble Disciples and thus they become instant arahants
Their ears prick up their hair stands on end and they get excited all out of proportion to any basis in reality
When you study with some teachers you have to start out with an offering of five candles and incense sticks or maybe ten plus soandso many flowers and soandso much puffed rice on this or that day of the week at this or that time of day depending on the teacher's preferences
Once you finish the ceremony the teacher tells you to meditate araham araham or buddho buddho until you get the vision he teaches you to look for  such as white blue red yellow a corpse water fire a person the Buddha a Noble Disciple heaven hell  and then you start making assumptions that follow the drift of the objects you see
You jump to the conclusion that you've seen something special or have attained nibbana
Sometimes the mind gathers to the point where you sit still in a daze with no sense of selfawareness at all
Or else pleasure arises and you become attached to the pleasure or stillness arises and you become attached to the stillness or a vision or a color arises and you become attached to that

Perhaps a thought arises and you think that it's insight and then you really get carried away
You may decide that you're a streamwinner a oncereturner or an arahant and no one in the world can match you
You latch onto your views as correct in every way giving rise to pride and conceit
When this happens liberating insight won't have a chance to arise
So you have to keep digging away for decades  and then get fixated on the fact that you've been practicing a full twenty years and so won't stand for it if anyone comes along and thinks he's better than you
So out of fear that others will look down on you you become even more stubborn and proud and that's as far as your knowledge and ingenuity will get you
When it comes to actual attainment some people of this sort haven't even brought the Triple Gem into their hearts
Of course there are probably many people who know better than this
I don't mean to cast aspersions on those who know
For this reason I have drawn up this book in line with what I have studied and practiced If you see that this might be the path you are looking for give it a good look
My teacher didn't teach like the examples mentioned above
He taught in line with what was readily available without requiring that you had to offer five incense sticks or ten candles or a pig's head or puffed rice or flowers or whatever
All he asked was that you have conviction in the Buddha and a willingness to practice his teachings
If you wanted to make an offering some candles and incense as an offering to the Triple Gem would do  one candle if you had one two if you had two if you didn't have any you could dedicate your life instead
Then he would have you repeat the formula for taking refuge in the Triple Gem as in the method given in this book
His approach to teaching in this way has always struck me as conducive to the practice
I have been practicing for a number of years now and what I have observed all along has led me to have a sense of pity both for myself and for my fellow human beings
If we practice along the right lines we may very likely attain the benefits we hope for quickly
We'll gain knowledge that will make us marvel at the good that comes from the practice of meditation or we may even see the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana in this present life  because nibbana is always present
It lacks only the people who will uncover it within themselves
Some people don't know how others know but aren't interested  and have mistaken assumptions about it to boot thinking for example that nibbana is extinct doesn't exist can't be attained is beyond the powers of people in the present day saying that since we aren't Noble Disciples how could we possibly attain it
This last is especially deluded
If we were already good already Noble Disciples what purpose would we have in going around trying to attain nibbana
If we don't despise the Buddha's teachings then we can all practice them
But the truth of the matter is that though we worship the Dhamma we don't practice the Dhamma which is the same as despising it
If we feel wellenough situated in the present we may tell ourselves that we can wait to practice the Dhamma in our next lifetime or at least anytime by right now
Or we may take our defilements as an excuse saying that we'll have to abandon greed anger and delusion before we can practice the Buddha's teachings
Or else we take our work as an excuse saying that we'll have to stop working first
Actually there's no reason that meditation should get in the way of our work because it's strictly an activity of the heart
There's no need to dismantle our homes or abandon our belongings before practicing it and if we did throw away our belongings in this way it would probably end up causing harm
Even though it's true that we love ourselves yet if we don't work for our own benefit if we vacillate and hesitate loading ourselves down with ballast and bricks we make our days and nights go to waste
So we should develop and perfect the factors that bring about the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana
If you're interested then examine the procedures explained in the following sections
Pick out whichever section seems to correspond to your own level and abilities and take that as your guide
As for myself I was first attracted to the Buddha's teachings by his statement that to lay claim to physical and mental phenomena as our own is suffering
After considering his teaching that the body is anatta  notself  I began to be struck by a sense of dismay over the nature of the body
I examined it to see in what way it was notself and  as far as my understanding allowed  the Buddha's teaching began to make very clear sense to me
I considered how the body arises is sustained and passes away and I came to the conclusion that
It is sustained by nourishment provided by our parents and since our parents have nothing of their own with which to nourish us they have to search for food  twofooted animals fourfooted animals animals in the water and animals on land  either buying this food or else killing it on their own and then feeding it to us
The animals abused in this way are bound to curse and seek revenge against those who kill and eat them just as we are possessive of our belongings and seek revenge against those who rob us
Those who don't know the truth of the body take it to be the self but after considering the diseases we suffer in our eyes nose mouth and throughout the various parts of the body I concluded that we've probably been cursed by the animals we've eaten because all of these parts come from the food we've made of their bodies
And so our body cursed in this way suffers pain with no recourse for begging mercy
Thus victim to the spirits of these animals we suffer pains in the eyes pains in the ears pains in the nose and mouth and throughout the body until in the end we have to relinquish the whole thing so they can eat it all up
Even while we're still living some of them  like mosquitoes and sandflies  come and try to take it by force
If we don't let go of our attachments to the body we're bound to suffer for many lives to come
This is one reason why I felt attracted to the Buddha's teachings on notself
The body passes away from being denied nourishment
The fact that this happens to us is without a doubt a result of our past actions
We've probably been harsh with other living beings denying them food to the point where they've had to part with the bodies they feel such affection for
When the results of such actions bear fruit our bodies will have to break up and disband in the same way
Considering things in this manner caused me to feel even more attracted to the practical methods recommended by the Buddha for seeing notself and letting go of our clinging assumptions so that we no longer have to be possessive of the treasures claimed by ignorant and fixated animals
If we persist in holding onto the body as our own it's the same as cheating others of their belongings turning them into our own flesh and blood and then forgetting where these things came from latching onto them as our very own
When this happens we're like a child who born in one family and then taken and raised in another family with a different language is sure to forget his original language and family name
If someone comes along and calls him by his original name he most likely won't stand for it because of his ignorance of his own origins
So it is with the body Once it has grown we latch onto it assuming it to be the self
We forget its origins and so become drugged addicted to physical and mental phenomena enduring pain for countless lifetimes
These thoughts are what led me to start practicing the teachings of the Buddha so as to liberate myself from this mass of suffering and stress
There are seven basic steps
Start out with three or seven long inandout breaths thinking bud with the inbreath and dho with the out
Keep the meditation syllable as long as the breath
Be clearly aware of each inandout breath
Observe the breath as it goes in and out noticing whether it's comfortable or uncomfortable broad or narrow obstructed or freeflowing fast or slow short or long warm or cool
If the breath doesn't feel comfortable change it until it does
For instance if breathing in long and out long is uncomfortable try breathing in short and out short
As soon as you find that your breathing feels comfortable let this comfortable breath sensation spread to the different parts of the body
To begin with inhale the breath sensation at the base of the skull and let it flow all the way down the spine
Then if you are male let it spread down your right leg to the sole of your foot to the ends of your toes and out into the air
Inhale the breath sensation at the base of the skull again and let it spread down your spine down your left leg to the ends of your toes and out into the air

Then let the breath from the base of the skull spread down over both shoulders past your elbows and wrists to the tips of your fingers and out into the air
Let the breath at the base of the throat spread down the central nerve at the front of the body past the lungs and liver all the way down to the bladder and colon
Inhale the breath right at the middle of the chest and let it go all the way down to your intestines
Let all these breath sensations spread so that they connect and flow together and you'll feel a greatly improved sense of wellbeing
Learn four ways of adjusting the breath
Breathe whichever way is most comfortable for you
Or better yet learn to breathe comfortably all four ways because your physical condition and your breath are always changing
Become acquainted with the bases or focal points for the mind  the resting spots of the breath  and center your awareness on whichever one seems most comfortable
A few of these bases are
If you suffer from frequent headaches or nervous problems don't focus on any spot above the base of the throat
And don't try to force the breath or put yourself into a trance
Breathe freely and naturally
Let the mind be at ease with the breath  but not to the point where it slips away
Spread your awareness  your sense of conscious feeling  throughout the entire body
Unite the breath sensations throughout the body letting them flow together comfortably keeping your awareness as broad as possible
Once you are fully aware of the aspects of the breath you already know in your body you'll come to know all sorts of other aspects as well
The breath by its nature has many facets breath sensations flowing in the nerves those flowing around and about the nerves those spreading from the nerves to every pore
Beneficial breath sensations and harmful ones are mixed together by their very nature
To summarize for the sake of improving the energy already existing in every part of your body so that you can contend with such things as disease and pain and for the sake of clarifying the knowledge already within you so that it can become a basis for the skills leading to release and purity of heart  you should always bear these seven steps in mind because they are absolutely basic to every aspect of breath meditation
When you've mastered them you will have cut a main road
As for the side roads  the incidentals of breath meditation  there are plenty of them but they aren't really important
You'll be perfectly safe if you stick to these seven steps and practice them as much as possible
Now we will summarize the methods of breath meditation under the headings of jhana
Jhana means to be absorbed or focused in a single object or preoccupation as when we deal with the breath
The first jhana has five factors Directed thought Think of the breath until you can recognize it clearly without getting distracted
Singleness of object Keep the mind with the breath
Don't let it stray after other objects
Watch over your thoughts so that they deal only with the breath to the point where the breath becomes comfortable
Evaluation Gain a sense of how to let this comfortable breath sensation spread and coordinate with the other breath sensations in the body
Let these breath sensations spread until they all merge
Once the body has been soothed by the breath feelings of pain will grow calm
The body will be filled with good breath energy

These three qualities must be brought together to bear on the same stream of breathing for the first jhana to arise
This stream of breathing can then take you all the way to the fourth jhana
Directed thought singleness of object and evaluation act as the causes
When the causes are fully ripe results will appear  rapture a compelling sense of fullness and refreshment for body and mind going straight to the heart independent of all else
Pleasure physical ease arising from the body's being still and unperturbed mental contentment arising from the mind's being at ease on its own unperturbed serene and exultant
Rapture and pleasure are the results
The factors of the first jhana thus come down simply to two sorts causes and results
As rapture and pleasure grow stronger the breath becomes more subtle
The longer you stay focused and absorbed the more powerful the results become
This enables you to set directed thought and evaluation aside and  relying completely on a single factor singleness of object  you enter the second jhana
The second jhana has three factors rapture pleasure and singleness of object
This refers to the state of mind that has tasted the results coming from the first jhana
Once you have entered the second level rapture and pleasure become stronger because they rely on a single cause singleness of object which looks after the work from here on in focusing on the breath so that it becomes more and more refined keeping steady and still with a sense of refreshment and ease for both body and mind
The mind is even more stable and intent than before
As you continue focusing rapture and pleasure become stronger and begin to expand and contract
Continue focusing on the breath moving the mind deeper to a more subtle level to escape the motions of rapture and pleasure and you enter the third jhana
The third jhana has two factors pleasure and singleness of object
The body is quiet motionless and solitary
No feelings of pain arise to disturb it
The mind is solitary and still
The breath is refined freeflowing and broad
A radiance  white like cotton wool  pervades the entire body stilling all feelings of physical and mental discomfort
Keep focused on looking after nothing but the broad refined breath
The mind is free No thoughts of past or future disturb it
The mind stands out on its own
The four properties  earth water fire and wind  are in harmony throughout the body
You could almost say that they're pure throughout the entire body because the breath has the strength to control and take good care of the other properties keeping them harmonious and coordinated
Mindfulness is coupled with singleness of object which acts as the cause
The breath fills the body
Mindfulness fills the body
Focus on in The mind is bright and powerful the body is light
Feelings of pleasure are still
Your sense of the body feels steady and even with no slips or gaps in your awareness so you can let go of your sense of pleasure
The manifestations of pleasure grow still because the four properties are balanced and free from motion
Singleness of object the cause has the strength to focus more heavily down taking you to the fourth jhana
The fourth jhana has two factors equanimity and singleness of object or mindfulness
Equanimity and singleness of object on the fourth jhana are powerfully focused  solid stable and sure
The breath element is absolutely quiet free from ripples and gaps
The mind neutral and still lets go of all preoccupations with past and future
The breath which forms the present is still like the ocean or air when they are free from currents or waves
You can know distant sights and sounds because the breath is even and unwavering and so acts like a movie screen giving a clear reflection of whatever is projected onto it
Knowledge arises in the mind You know but stay neutral and still
The mind is neutral and still the breath neutral and still past present and future are all neutral and still
This is true singleness of object focused on the unperturbed stillness of the breath
All parts of the breath in the body connect so that you can breathe through every pore
You don't have to breathe through the nostrils because the inandout breath and the other aspects of the breath in the body form a single unified whole
All aspects of the breath energy are even and full
The four properties all have the same characteristics
The mind is completely still
The mind sheds light in all directions
The breath is radiant the mind fully radiant due to the focusing of mindfulness
The focus is strong the light aglow The mind has power and authority
All four of the frames of reference are gathered into one
There is no sense that 'That's the body That's a feeling That's the mind That's a mental quality' There's no sense that they're four This is thus called the great frame of reference because none of the four are in any way separate
Mindfulness and alertness converge into one This is what is meant by the one path  the concord among the properties and frames of reference four in one giving rise to great energy and wakefulness the purifying inner fire that can thoroughly dispel all obscuring darkness
As you focus more strongly on the radiance of the mind the power that comes from letting go of all preoccupations enables the mind to stand alone
You're like a person who has climbed to the top of a mountain and has the right to see in all directions
The mind's dwelling  the breath which supports the mind's freedom  is in a heightened state so the mind is able to see all things fashioned clearly in terms of the Dhamma as properties khandhas and sense media
Just as a person who has taken a camera up in an airplane can take pictures of practically everything below so a person who has reached this stage can see the world and the Dhamma as they truly are
In addition awareness of another sort in the area of the mind  called liberating insight or the skill of release  also appears
The elements or properties of the body acquire potency the mind resilient power
When you want knowledge of the world or the Dhamma focus the mind heavily and forcefully on the breath
As the concentrated power of the mind strikes the pure element intuitive knowledge will spring up in that element just as the needle of a record player as it strikes a record will give rise to sounds
Once your mindfulness is focused on a pure object then if you want images images will appear if sounds sounds will arise whether near or far matters of the world or the Dhamma concerning yourself or others past present or future  whatever you want to know
As you focus down think of what you want to know and it will appear
This is ñana  intuitive sensitivity capable of knowing past present and future  an important level of awareness that you can know only for yourself
The elements are like radio waves going through the air
If your mind and mindfulness are strong and your skills highly developed you can use those elements to put yourself in touch with the entire world so that knowledge can arise within you
When you have mastered the fourth jhana it can act as the basis for eight skills
Manomayiddhi the ability to use the mind to influence events
Iddhividhi the ability to display supranormal powers eg creating images in certain instances that certain groups of people will be able to see
Dibbasota the ability to hear distant sounds
Cetopariyañana the ability to know the level  good or evil high or low  of other people's minds
Pubbenivasanussatiñana the ability to remember previous lifetimes

Dibbacakkhu the ability to see gross and subtle images both near and far
Asavakkhayañana the ability to reduce and eliminate the effluents of defilement in the heart
These eight skills come exclusively from the centering the mind which is why I have written this condensed guide to concentration and jhana based on the technique of keeping the breath in mind
If you aspire to the good that can come from these things you should turn your attention to training your own heart and mind
There are three levels of virtue 
Hetthimasila normalcy of word and deed which consists of three kinds of bodily acts  not killing not stealing not engaging in sexual misconduct and four kinds of speech  not lying not speaking divisively not saying anything coarse or abusive not speaking idly
If we class virtue on this level according to the wording of the precepts and the groups of people who observe them there are four  the five precepts the eight the ten and the precepts
All of these deal with aspects of behavior that should be abandoned termed pahanakicca
At the same time the Buddha directed us to develop good manners and proper conduct in the use of the four necessities of life  food clothing shelter and medicine  so that our conduct in terms of thought word and deed will be orderly and becoming
This aspect is termed bhavanakicca behavior we should work at developing
Observance of these precepts or rules  dealing merely with words and deeds  forms the lower or preliminary level of virtue which is what makes us into fullfledged human beings
Majjhimasila the medium level of virtue ie keeping watch over your words and deeds so that they cause no harm and in addition keeping watch over your thoughts so as to keep them upright in three ways 
a
Anabhijjhavisamalobha not coveting things that do not belong to you and that lie beyond your scope or powers not focusing your thoughts on such things not building what are called castles in the air
The Buddha taught us to tend to the wealth we already have so that it can grow on its own
The wealth we already have if we use our intelligence and ingenuity will draw more wealth our way without our having to waste time and energy by being covetous or greedy
For example suppose we have a single banana tree If we water it give it fertilizer loosen the soil around its roots and guard it in other ways our single banana tree will eventually give rise to an increase of other banana trees
In other words if we're shrewd we can turn whatever wealth we have into a basis for a livelihood
But if we lack intelligence  if our hearts simply want to get without wanting work  then even if we acquire a great deal of wealth we won't be able to support ourselves
Thus greed of this sort in which we focus our desires above and beyond our capacities is classed as a wrong kind of mental action
b
Abyapada abandoning thoughts of ill will hatred and vengeance and developing thoughts of benevolence and good will instead thinking of the good aspects of the people who have angered us
When people make us angry it comes from the fact that our dealings with them  in which we associate with and assist one another  sometimes lead to disappointment
This gives rise to dislike and irritation which in turn cause us to brood so that we develop hurt feelings that grow into anger and thoughts of retaliation
Thus we should regard such people from many angles for ordinarily as human beings they should have some good to them
If they don't act well toward us they may at least speak well to us
Or if they don't act or speak well to us perhaps their thoughts may be wellmeaning to at least some extent
Thus when you find your thoughts heading in the direction of anger or dislike you should sit down and think in two ways 
Try to think of whatever ways that person has been good to you
When these things come to mind they'll give rise to feelings of affection love and good will
This is one way
Anger is something worthless like the scum that floats on the surface of a lake
If we're stupid we won't get to drink the clean water that lies underneath or if we drink the scum we may catch a disease
A person who is bad to you is like someone sunk in filth
If you're stupid enough to hate or be angry with such people it's as if you wanted to go sit in the filth with them
Is that what you want
Think about this until any thoughts of ill will and anger disappear
c
Sammaditthi abandoning wrong views and mental darkness
If our minds lack the proper training and education we may come to think that we and all other living beings are born simply as accidents of nature that 'father' and 'mother' have no special meaning that good and evil don't exist
Such views deviate from the truth
They can dissuade us from restraining the evil that lies within us and from searching for and fostering the good
To believe that there's no good or evil that death is annihilation is Wrong View  a product of faulty thinking and poor discernment seeing things for what they aren't
So we should abandon such views and educate ourselves searching for knowledge of the Dhamma and associating with people wiser than we so that they can show us the proper path
We'll then be able to reform our views and make them Right which is one form of mental uprightness
Virtue on this level when we can maintain it well will qualify us to be heavenly beings
The qualities of heavenly beings which grow out of human values will turn us into human beings who are divine in our virtues for to guard our thoughts words and deeds means that we qualify for heaven in this lifetime
This is one aspect of the merit developed by a person who observes the middle level of virtue
Uparimasila higher virtue where virtue merges with the Dhamma in the area of mental activity
There are two sides to higher virtue 
a
PAHANAKICCA qualities to be abandoned which are of five sorts 
Byapada ill will and hatred
Thinamiddha discouragement drowsiness sloth
Uddhaccakukkucca restlessness and anxiety
Vicikiccha doubt uncertainty indecision
Ill will lies at the essence of killing for it causes us to destroy our own goodness and that of others  and when our mind can kill off our own goodness what's to keep us from killing other people and animals as well
Restlessness lies at the essence of taking what is not given
The mind wanders about taking hold of other people's affairs sometimes their good points sometimes their bad
To fasten onto their good points isn't too serious for it can give us at least some nourishment
As long as we're going to steal other people's business and make it our own we might as well take their silver and gold
Their bad points though are like trash they've thrown away  scraps and bones with nothing of any substance  and yet even so we let the mind feed on them
When we know that other people are possessive of their bad points and guard them well and yet we still take hold of these things to think about it should be classed as a form of taking what isn't given
Sensual desires lie at the essence of sensual misconduct
The mind feels an attraction for sensual objects  thoughts of past or future sights sounds smells tastes or tactile sensations  or for sensual defilements  passion aversion or delusion  to the point where we forget ourselves
Mental states such as these can be said to overstep the bounds of propriety in sensual matters
Doubt lies at the essence of lying
In other words our minds are unsure with nothing reliable or true to them
We have no firm principles and so drift along under the influence of all kinds of thoughts and preoccupations
Drowsiness is intoxication  discouragement dullness forgetfulness with no mindfulness or restraint watching over the mind
This is what it means to be drugged or drunk
All of these unwise qualities are things we should eliminate by training the heart along the lines of
b
BHAVANAKICCA qualities to be developed 
Vicara Evaluate and be observant
Make yourself aware of whether or not you've received a sense of comfort and relaxation from your breathing
If not tend to the breath and adjust it in a variety of ways eg in long and out long in long and out short in short and out short in short and out long in slow and out slow in fast and out fast in gently and out gently in strong and out strong in throughout the body and out throughout the body
Adjust the breath until it gives good results to both body and mind and you'll be able to kill off feelings of ill will and hatred
Piti When you get good results  for instance when the subtle breath sensations in the body merge and flow together permeating the entire sense of the body  the breath is like an electric wire the various parts of the body such as the bones are like electricity poles mindfulness and selfawareness are like a power source and awareness is thus bright and radiant
Both body and mind feel full and satisfied
This is piti or rapture which can kill off feelings of drowsiness
Sukha Now that feelings of restlessness and anxiety have disappeared a sense of pleasure and ease for body and mind arises
This pleasure is what kills off restlessness
Ekaggata Doubts and uncertainty fade into the distance
The mind reaches oneness of object in a state of normalcy and equilibrium
This normalcy of mind which is maintained through the power of the discipline of mindfulness forms the essence of virtue firmness steadiness stability
And the resulting flavor or nourishment of virtue is tranquillity lightheartedness and a sense of independence for the mind
When freedom of this sort arises within us this is called the development of silanussati the mindfulness of virtue
This is virtue that attains excellence  leading to the paths their fruitions and nibbana  and thus can be called uparimasila higher virtue
To summarize there are three levels of virtue external virtue intermediate virtue and internal virtue
In ultimate terms however there are two 
Mundane virtue virtue connected with the world in which we maintain the principles of ordinary human morality but are as yet unable to reach the transcendent levels streamentry oncereturning nonreturning and arahantship
We can't yet cut the Fetters that tie the heart to the influences of all the worlds
This is thus called mundane virtue
Transcendent virtue virtue that's constant and sure going straight to the heart bathing the heart with its nourishment
This arises from the practice of tranquillity meditation and insight meditation
tranquillity meditation forms the cause and insight meditation the result discovering the true nature of the properties aggregates and senses seeing clearly the four Noble Truths in proportion to our practice of the Path and abandoning the first three of the Fetters 
b
Vicikiccha doubt concerning what's genuine and true and what's counterfeit and false
The power of Right View enables us to see that the quality to which we awaken exists at all times and that the true qualities that cause us to awaken also exist and are made effective through the power of the practices we're following
Our knowledge is definite and true
Our doubts concerning the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha are cleared up for good
This is called becoming a niyatapuggala a person who is certain and sure
c
Silabbataparamasa When the heart abandons this Fetter it no longer dotes on theories concerning moral virtue it's no longer stuck merely on the level of manners and actions
Good and evil are accomplished through the heart activities and actions are something separate
Even though people who reach this level do good  taking the precepts making gifts and offerings or meditating in line with the good customs of the world  they're not caught up on any of these things because their hearts have reached the nourishment of virtue
They aren't stuck on the particulars ie their actions and activities nor are they stuck on the purpose ie the meaning or intent of their various good manners
Their hearts dwell in the nourishment of virtue tranquillity stability normalcy of mind
Just as a person who has felt the nourishment that comes from food permeating his body isn't stuck on either the food or its flavor  because he's received the benefits of the nourishment it provides  in the same way the hearts of people who have reached the essence of virtue are no longer stuck on actions or manners particulars or purposes because they've tasted virtue's nourishment
This is thus classed as transcendent virtue the first stage of nibbana
Even though such people may be destined for further rebirth they're apart from the ordinary
Anyone whose practice reaches this level can be counted as fortunate as having received dependable wealth like ingots of gold
Just as gold can be used as currency all over the world because it has special value for all human beings  unlike paper currency whose use is limited to specific countries  in the same way a heart that's truly attained virtue has a value in this life that will remain constant in lives to come
Thus a person who has reached this level has received part of the Noble Wealth of those who practice the religion
Concentration has three levels 
Kamavacarakhanikasamadhi The mind keeps thinking coming to rest and running along after worthwhile preoccupations  either internal or external  on the sensory level sights sounds smells flavors tactile sensations or ideas
An example of this is when the mind becomes quiet and rested for a moment as we sit listening to a sermon or chanting
In other words the mind grows still for momentary periods in the same way that a person walks One foot takes a step while the other foot rests on the ground providing the energy needed to reach one's goal
This is thus called momentary concentration something possessed by people all over the world
Whether or not we practice concentration the mind is always behaving this way by its very nature
This is called the 'bhavangacitta' or 'bhavangapada' The mind stops for a moment and then moves on
In developing higher levels of concentration we have to start out with this ordinary level as our basis
Otherwise the higher levels probably wouldn't be possible
Still this level of concentration can't be used as a basis for discernment which is why we have to go further in our practice
Rupavacaraupacarasamadhi This refers to the first jhana in which the mind comes inward to rest on a single preoccupation within the body fixing its attention for example on the inandout breath
When the mind stays with its one object this is called ekaggata
At the same time there's mindfulness keeping the breath in mind This is called vitakka
The mind then adjusts and expands the various aspects of the breath throughout the entire body evaluating them mindfully with complete circumspection This is called selfawareness or vicara which is the factor aware of causes and results
Mindfulness the cause is what does the work
Thus vitakka and vicara cooperate in focusing on the same topic
We are then aware of the results as they arise  feelings of fullness pleasure and ease for body and mind
At this point the mind lets down its burdens to rest for a while like a person walking along who meets with something pleasing and attractive and so stops to look Both feet are standing still stepping neither forward nor back
If we aren't skilled enough to go on any further we will then retreat
If we see results  such as signs and visions  arising in the mind we may get excited and so cause our original preoccupation to waver or fade
Like a person sitting on a chair If he sees something appealing in front of him he may become so interested that he leans forward and reaches out his hand he may even begin to budge a bit from his seat or stand up completely
In the same way if we get engrossed in visions thoughts or views when we're engaged in threshold concentration we can become excited and pleased  we may even think that we've reached the transcendent  and this can cause our concentration to degenerate
If we try to do it again and can't we may then seize the opportunity to say that we've gone beyond the practice of concentration so that we can now take the way of discernment  thinking pondering and letting go in line with nothing more than our own views and ideas
This though is not likely to succeed because our knowledge has no firm basis or core like a wheel with no axle or hub How can it get anywhere
The power of threshold concentration if we don't watch after it well is bound to deteriorate and we'll be left with nothing but old leftover concepts
Rupavacaraappanasamadhi This refers to the practice of all four levels of rupa jhana
The first jhana has five factors thinking evaluating fullness pleasure and singleness of object
The second level has three fullness pleasure and singleness of object
The third has two pleasure and singleness of object and the fourth has two equanimity and singleness of object
Fixed penetration in the realm of form means that the mind focuses on the internal sense of the body remaining steadily with a single object  such as the inandout breath  until it reaches jhana beginning with the first level which is composed of thinking evaluating fullness pleasure and singleness of object
When you see results arising focus in on those results and they will then turn into the second level which has three factors fullness pleasure and singleness of object
As your focus becomes stronger it causes the sense of fullness to waver so you can now let go of that sense of fullness and your concentration turns into the third jhana in which only two factors are left pleasure and singleness of object
The mind has few burdens its focus is strong and the sense of inner light is radiant
This causes the feeling of pleasure to waver so that you can let go of that sense of pleasure and the mind attains oneness in a very subtle preoccupation
The preoccupation doesn't waver and neither does the mind
It stands firm in its freedom
This is called equanimity and singleness of object which form the fourth jhana
Mindfulness is powerful
Selfawareness is complete
Both are centered on a single preoccupation without getting snagged on any other allusions or perceptions
This mental state is called the fourth jhana which has two factors Equanimity or stillness is the external attitude of the mind as for the real factors they're mindfulness and singleness steady and firm
The mind experiences a sense of brightness the radiance that comes from its state of fixed penetration
Mindfulness and selfawareness are circumspect and allround and so give rise to skill and proficiency in practicing jhana  in focusing staying in place stepping through the various levels withdrawing going back and forth
When the mind behaves as you want it to no matter when you practice only then does this truly qualify as fixed penetration the basis for the arising of three qualities intuitive knowledge discernment and cognitive skill
Intuitive knowledge here refers to knowledge or sensitivity of an extraordinary sort
For example 
Cutupapatañana the ability to focus on the death and rebirth of other living beings  sometimes in good destinations sometimes in bad  together with the causes that lead them to be reborn in such ways
This gives rise to a sense of weariness and disenchantment with sensations and mental acts body and mind
Asavakkhayañana knowing how to put an end to the defilements of the heart in accordance with the knowledge  the clear vision of the four Noble Truths  that accompanies the particular transcendent path reached
And there are still other forms of extraordinary knowledge such as iddhividhi the ability to display supernormal powers to make an image of oneself appear to other people dibbasota clairaudience dibbacakkhu clairvoyance  ie the ability to see objects at tremendous distances
Discernment refers to discriminating knowledge clear comprehension knowledge in line with the truth
For example 
Atthapatisambhida acumen with regard to aims and results thoroughgoing comprehension of cause and effect knowing for example how stress is caused by ignorance and craving and how the disbanding of stress is caused by the intuitive discernment that forms the Path comprehending the meaning and aims of the Buddha's various teachings and knowing how to explain them so that other people will understand  being able for instance to summarize a long passage without distorting its meaning
Dhammapatisambhida acumen with regard to mental qualities knowing how to explain deep and subtle points so that other people will understand
Niruttipatisambhida acumen with regard to different languages
According to the texts this includes knowing foreign languages and the languages of various other living beings by means of the eye of discernment
Patibhanapatisambhida acumen with regard to expression being fluent in making explanations and quickwitted in debate knowing the most strategic way to express things
All of these forms of discernment can arise from training the mind to attain fixed penetration
Vijja  clear open knowledge free from any further concealments and aloka  brilliance radiance streaming out in all directions  enable us to see the true nature of sensations and mental acts in accordance with our powers of intuitive discernment
Cognitive skill refers to clear uncanny knowledge that arises from the mind's being firmly fixed in jhana
There are eight sorts 
Manomayiddhi psychic powers influencing events through the power of thought
Iddhividhi the ability to display powers making one's body appear in a variety of ways
Dibbacakkhu clairvoyance
Dibbasota clairaudience
Cetopariyañana the ability to know the mental states of other people
Pubbenivasanussatiñana the ability to remember previous lives
Asavakkhayañana the ability to put an end to the effluents that defile the heart
Thus jhana on the level of fixed penetration is extremely important
It can give us support on all sides  on the level of the world and of the Dhamma  and can bring success in our various activities both in our worldly affairs and in our Dhamma duties leading us on to the transcendent
To summarize there are two kinds of concentration
That which helps us to fulfill our duties on the level of the Dhamma leading to vipassanañana or asavakkhayañana the knowledge that enables us  in accordance with the discernment and insight that arise  to abandon or cut off completely the mental tendencies that lean in the direction of the Fetters This is termed transcendent concentration
Discernment is of three kinds 
Cintamayapañña discernment that comes from reflecting
Bhavanamayapañña discernment that comes from developing the mind
l
Sutamayapañña refers to the discernment that comes from having listened a great deal like the Venerable Ananda
Listening here though includes studying and taking interest in a variety of ways paying attention taking notes asking questions and taking part in discussions so as to become quickwitted and astute
Education of all kinds comes down to two sorts learning the basic units such as the letters of the alphabet their sound and pronunciation so as to understand their accepted usage and learning how to put them together  for instance how to combine the letters so as to give rise to words and meanings  as when we complete our elementary education so that we won't be at a loss when we're called on to read and write in the course of making a living
In the area of the religion we have to study the letters of the Pali alphabet their combinations their meanings and their pronunciation
If we don't understand clearly we should take an interest in asking questions
If we have trouble memorizing we should take an interest in jotting down notes as a way of aiding our memory and expanding our concepts
In addition we have to study by means of our senses
For example when we see a visual object we should find out its truth
When we hear sounds or words we should find out their truth
When we smell an aroma we should consider it to see what it comes from
We should take an interest in flavors so that we know what they come from and in tactile sensations  the heat and cold that touch the body  by studying such things as the way weather behaves
All of these forms of education are ways of giving rise to astuteness  both in the area of the world and in the area of the Dhamma  because they constitute a basic level of knowledge like the primary education offered in schools
Cintamayapañña refers to thinking and evaluating so as to learn the meaning and truth of one's beginning education
This level of education draws out the meaning of the knowledge we have gained through studying
When we gain information we should reflect on it until we understand it so that we will be led by our sense of reason and not by gullibility or ignorance
This is like a person who has used his knowledge of the alphabet to gain knowledge from books to complete his secondary education
Such a person has reached the level where he can think things through clearly
In the area of the Dhamma the same holds true
Once we have learned the basics we should research and think through the content of the Teaching until we give rise to an understanding so that we can conduct ourselves correctly in line with the methods and aims taught by the sages of the past
This level of discernment is what prepares us to conduct ourselves properly in line with the true essence of the Doctrine and Discipline
This is classed as an aspect of pariyatti dhamma Dhamma on the level of theory
By learning the language and meaning of the Teaching we can become astute as far as theory is concerned but if we don't use that knowledge to train ourselves it's as if we studied a profession  such as law  but then went out to become bandits so that our knowledge wouldn't give its proper results
For this reason we've been taught still another method which is the wellspring of discernment or mastery  ie the mental activity termed bhavanamayapañña
Bhavanamayapañña discernment that arises exclusively from the practice of concentration
In other words this level of discernment isn't related to the old observations we have gained from the past because our old observations are bound to obscure the new observations endowed with the truth that can arise only right at the mind
When you engage in this form of practice focus exclusively on the present taking note of a single thing not getting involved with past or future
Steady the mind bringing it into the present
Gather virtue concentration and discernment all into the present
Think of your meditation object and bring your powers of evaluation to bear on it  say by immersing mindfulness in the body focusing on such objects as the inandout breath
When you do this knowledge will arise
'anam udapadi' Intuitive knowledge of things we have never before studied or known will appear
For example pubbenivasanussatiñana  the ability to remember our present life and past lives cutupapatañana  the ability to know living beings as they die and are reborn  well or poorly happily or miserably  knowing the causes and results of how they fare asavakkhayañana  the ability to cleanse ourselves of the effluents that defile the mind thinning them out or eliminating them altogether as we are able
These three forms of knowledge don't arise for people who simply study or think things through in ordinary ways
They form a mental skill that arises from the practice of concentration and are an aspect of Dhamma on the level of practice
Another aspect  'pañña udapadi' Clear discernment of the true nature of the properties aggregates and sense media arises
We can focus on these things by way of the mind and know them in terms of the four Noble Truths stress which arises from a cause ie ignorance and craving and then nirodha the ceasing and disbanding of stress which occurs as the result of a cause ie the Path composed of practices for the mind
These things can be known by means of the discernment that arises exclusively and directly within us and is termed the eye of discernment or the eye of Dhamma the eye of the mind awakening from its slumbers
'Vijja udapadi' The eight forms of cognitive skill which follow the laws of cause and effect  means of practice that bring us results  can arise in a quiet mind
'Aloko udapadi' Brightness clarity relief and emptiness arise in such a mind
Thus the discernment that results from developing the mind differs from the beginning stages of discernment that come from studying and reflecting
Study and reflection are classed as Dhamma on the level of theory and can give only a preliminary level of knowledge
They're like a person who has awakened but has yet to open his eyes
The discernment that comes from developing the mind though is like waking up and seeing the truth  past present and future  in all four directions
We can clearly see stress its cause its disbanding and the Path to its disbanding and so can abandon the first set of Fetters
Our hearts will then flow to nibbana just as the water in a mountain cataract is sure to flow to the sea
Our hearts will flow to their natural truth the mental fullness and completeness of a person who has practiced mental development until discernment arises within
We will meet with a special form of wisdom  transcendent wisdom  whose power will stay with us always a quality that's certain and sure termed certain truth certain wisdom making us people certain for nibbana
So this level of discernment  termed the discernment of liberating insight  is especially important
It arises on its own not from cogitating along the lines of old concepts we've learned but from abandoning them
Old concepts are what obscure the new knowledge ready to arise
The nature of liberating insight is like an electric light Simply press the switch once and things all around are made bright
In the same way when the mind reaches a stage of readiness insight will arise in a single mental instant and everything will become clear properties aggregates and the sense media
We'll know on the one hand what's inconstant stressful and notself and on the other hand what's uncommon ie niccam  what's constant and true sukham  true happiness termed niramisasukha and atta  the self
The eye of the mind can know both sides and let go both ways
It's attached neither to what's inconstant stressful and notself nor to what's constant good and right
It can let these things go in line with their true nature
The knowledge that comes from discernment cognitive skill and intuitive insight it can let go as well
It isn't attached to views  for there's yet another separate sort of reality that has no 'this' or 'that' In other words it has no sense of 'I' It lets go of the assumptions that 'That's the self' 'That's not the self' 'That's constant' 'That's inconstant' 'That arises' 'That doesn't arise' It can let go of these things completely
That's the Dhamma and yet it doesn't hold onto the Dhamma which is why we say that the Dhamma is notself
It also doesn't hold on to the view that says 'notself' It lets go of views causes and effects and isn't attached to anything at all dealing with wordings or meanings conventions or practices
This then is discernment that arises from the development of the mind
To conclude The discernment that comes from studying and reflecting is classed as Dhamma on the level of theory
The discernment that comes from developing the mind is classed as Dhamma on the level of practice
The results that arise are two 
Transcendent discernment awareness that goes beyond the ordinary giving rise to clear realization within
People who reach this level are said to have awakened and opened their eyes which is what is meant by 'Buddho'
Insight isn't something that can be taught
It's something you have to give rise to within yourself
It's not something you simply memorize and talk about
If we were to teach it just so we could memorize it I can guarantee that it wouldn't take five hours
But if you wanted to understand one word of it three years might not even be enough
Memorizing gives rise simply to memories
Acting is what gives rise to the truth
This is why it takes effort and persistence for you to understand and master this skill on your own
When insight arises you'll know what's what where it's come from and where it's going  as when we see a lantern burning brightly We know that 'That's the flame That's the smoke That's the light' We know how these things arise from mixing what with what and where the flame goes when we put out the lantern
All of this is the skill of insight
Some people say that tranquillity meditation and insight meditation are two separate things  but how can that be true
tranquillity meditation is 'stopping' insight meditation is 'thinking' that leads to clear knowledge
When there's clear knowledge the mind stops still and stays put
They're all part of the same thing
Knowing has to come from stopping
If you don't stop how can you know
For instance if you're sitting in a car or a boat that is traveling fast and you try to look at the people or things passing by right next to you along the way you can't see clearly who's who or what's what
But if you stop still in one place you'll be able to see things clearly
Or even closer to home When we speak there has to be a pause between each phrase
If you tried to talk without any pauses at all would anyone be able to understand what you said
This is why we first have to make the mind stop to be quiet and still
When the mind stays still in a state of normalcy concentration arises and discernment follows
This is something you have to work at and do for yourself
Don't simply believe what others say
Get so that you know 'Oh
Oh
Oh' from within and not just 'Oh
Oh
Oh' from what people say
Don't take the good things they say and stick them in your heart
You have to make these things your own by getting them to arise from within you
Spending one dollar of your own money is better than spending dollars you've borrowed from someone else
If you use borrowed money you have to worry because you're in debt
If you use your own money there's nothing to worry about
Stopping is what gives rise to strength
If a man is walking or running he can't put up a good fight with anyone because the advantage lies with the person standing still not with the person walking or running
This is why we're taught to make the mind stop still so that it can gain strength
Then it will be able to start walking again with strength and agility
It's true that we have two feet but when we walk we have to step with one foot at a time
If you try to step with both feet at once you won't get anywhere
Or if you try to walk with just one foot you can't do that either
When the right foot stops the left foot has to take a step
When the left foot stops the right foot has to take a step
You have to stop with one foot and step with the other if you're going to walk with any strength because the strength comes from the foot that has stopped not from the foot taking a step
One side has to stop while the other side takes a step
Otherwise you'll have no support and are sure to fall down
If you don't believe me try stepping with both feet at once and see how far you get
In the same way tranquillity and insight have to go together
You first have to make the mind stop in tranquillity and then take a step in your investigation This is insight meditation
The understanding that arises is discernment
To let go of your attachment to that understanding is release
So stopping is the factor that gives rise to strength knowledge and discernment  the fixed mind that knows both the world and the Dhamma in a state of heightened virtue heightened consciousness and heightened discernment leading on to the transcendent
  
To get full results from our meditation the mind has to give the orders
Mindfulness is what does the work and assists in the progress of all our activities while alertness is what observes the results of what we've done
To speak in terms of the frames of reference these qualities are called mindfulness and alertness
To speak in terms of jhana they're called directed thought and evaluation
They're the qualities that give rise to discernment
Discernment comes from observing causes and effects
If we know effects without knowing causes that doesn't qualify as discernment
If we know causes without knowing effects that doesn't qualify either
We have to know both of them together with our mindfulness and alertness
This is what qualifies as allaround knowing in the full sense of the term
The allaround knowing that arises within us comes from causes and effects not from what we read in books hear other people tell us or conjecture on our own
Suppose we have some silver coins in our pocket
If all we know is that other people tell us it's money we don't know its qualities
But if we experiment with it and put it in a smelter to see what it's made of and to see how it can be made into other things that's when we'll know its true qualities
This is the kind of knowledge that comes from our own actions
This knowledge when we meditate comes in five forms
We find within ourselves that some things are caused by the properties of the body some are caused by the mind some causes come from the mind but have an effect on the body some causes come from the body but have an effect on the mind some causes come from the body and mind acting together
This kind of knowledge is discernment
So we have to learn from virtue concentration and discernment by giving rise to them
If we don't we'll suffer from unawareness and delusion
Mindfulness is what brings light to the mind like a candle
If we take a candle into a room at night close the windows and doors and fill in all the cracks in the walls no wind from outside will be able to slip in and make the flame waver
The flame will give off even more light and we'll be able to see everything in the room clearly
Closing the windows and doors and filling in the cracks means exercising restraint over our eyes ears nose tongue body and mind so that our attention doesn't go straying out after outside perceptions and preoccupations
This is called restraint through mindfulness
Our mindfulness will gather into one
When mindfulness is strong the results are immediate a sense of ease and mental wellbeing
When mindfulness is solid and unflagging our concentration will become stronger
The mind will be still and upright
Light will arise in one of two ways from within ourself or from what's reflected off the walls
This is why mindfulness is the cause the supporting factor that keeps our concentration progressing
  
What does discernment come from
You might compare it with learning to become a potter a tailor or a basket weaver
The teacher will start out by telling you how to make a pot sew a shirt or a pair of pants or weave different patterns but the proportions and beauty of the object you make will have to depend on your own powers of observation
Suppose you weave a basket and then take a good look at its proportions to see if it's too short or too tall
If it's too short weave another one a little taller and then take a good look at it to see if there's anything that still needs improving to see if it's too thin or too fat
Then weave another one betterlooking than the last
Keep this up until you have one that's as beautiful and wellproportioned as possible one with nothing to criticize from any angle
This last basket you can take as your standard
You can now set yourself up in business
What you've done is to learn from your own actions
As for your previous efforts you needn't concern yourself with them any longer
Throw them out
This is a sense of discernment that arises of its own accord an ingenuity and sense of judgment that come not from anything your teachers have taught you but from observing and evaluating on your own the object that you yourself have made
The same holds true in practicing meditation
For discernment to arise you have to be observant as you keep track of the breath and to gain a sense of how to adjust and improve it so that it's wellproportioned throughout the body  to the point where it flows evenly without faltering so that it' s comfortable in slow and out slow in fast and out fast long short heavy or refined
Get so that both the inbreath and the outbreath are comfortable no matter what way you breathe so that  no matter when  you immediately feel a sense of ease the moment you focus on the breath
When you can do this physical results will appear a sense of ease and lightness open and spacious
The body will be strong the breath and blood will flow unobstructed and won't form an opening for disease to step in
The body will be healthy and awake
As for the mind when mindfulness and alertness are the causes a still mind is the result
When negligence is the cause a mind distracted and restless is the result
So we must try to make the causes good in order to give rise to the good results we've referred to
If we use our powers of observation and evaluation in caring for the breath and are constantly correcting and improving it we'll develop awareness on our own the fruit of having developed our concentration higher step by step
When the mind is focused with full circumspection it can let go of concepts of the past
It sees the true nature of its old preoccupations that there's nothing lasting or certain about them
As for the future lying ahead of us it's like having to sail a small boat across the great wide sea There are bound to be dangers on all sides
So the mind lets go of concepts of the future and comes into the present seeing and knowing the present
Knowledge arises for an instant and then disappears so that you can know that there in the present is a void
You don't latch on to worldfashionings of the past worldfashionings of the future or dhammafashionings of the present
Fashionings disappear
Avijja  counterfeit untrue awareness  disappears
'True' disappears
All that remains is awareness 'buddha buddha'
The factor that fashions the body ie the breath the factors that fashion speech ie thoughts that formulate words and the factor that fashions the mind ie thinking all disappear
But awareness doesn't disappear
When the factor that fashions the body moves you're aware of it
When the factor that fashions speech moves you're aware of it
When the factor that fashions the mind moves you're aware of it but awareness isn't attached to anything it knows
In other words no fashionings can affect it
There's simply awareness
At a thought the mind appears fashionings appear
If you want to use them there they are
If not they disappear on their own by their very nature
Awareness is above everything else
This is release
Meditators have to reach this sort of awareness if they're to get good results
In training the mind this is all there is
Complications are a lot of fuss and bother and tend to bog down without ever getting to the real point
In using the mind as a frame of reference there are three aspects to deal with
'The mind inside' refers to a state exclusively in the heart when it isn't involved with any outer preoccupations
'The mind outside' refers to its interaction with such outer preoccupations as sights sounds etc
'The mind in and of itself' refers to the act of singling out any aspect of the mind as it appears whether inside or out
As for the modes of the mind inside there are three 
Dosacitta a sense of inner irritation and displeasure
Mohacitta a cloudy murky or confused state of mind in which it is unable to consider anything in short delusion
The mind outside is divided into the same three aspects  states of passion irritation and delusion  but these are said to be 'outside' because once any of these aspects arises it tends to go out and latch onto an outer preoccupation that simply serves to further aggravate the original state of passion irritation or delusion
The mind then doesn't clearly or truly understand its objects
Its knowledge goes off in various directions away from the truth seeing beauty for instance in things that aren't beautiful constancy in things that are inconstant pleasure in things that are painful and self in things that are notself
All of these things are aspects of the mind outside
'The mind in and of itself' refers to the act of singling out any one of these aspects of the mind
For example sometimes passion arises sometimes anger sometimes delusion Whichever aspect may be arising in the present single it out
With your alertness firmly in place be mindful of that aspect of the mind without making reference to any other objects  and without letting any hopes or wants arise in that particular mental moment at all
Then focus unwaveringly on investigating that state of mind until you know its truth
The truth of these states is that sometimes once they've arisen they flare up and spread sometimes they die away
Their nature is to arise for a moment and then dissolve away with nothing of any substance or worth
When you are intent on examining things in this way  with your mindfulness alertness and powers of focused investigation firmly in place  then none of these defilements even though they may be appearing will have the chance to grow or spread
This is like the baskets or jars used to cover new lettuce plants If no one removes the baskets the plants will never have a chance to grow and will simply wither away and die
Thus you have to keep your alertness right with each mental state as it arises
Keep mindfulness constantly referring to its object and use your powers of focused investigation to burn into those defilements so as to keep them away from the heart at all times
To put this another way all of the mental states mentioned above are like lettuce or greengram seeds
Mindfulness is like a basket
Alertness is the person who scatters the seeds while the power of focused investigation is the heat of the sun that burns them up
So far we have mentioned only bad mental states
Their opposites are good mental states viragacitta  the mind free from the grip of passion adosacitta  the mind free from the annoyance or anger that can lead to loss and ruin amohacitta  the mind free from delusion intoxication and misunderstandings
These are skillful states of mind which form the root of all that is good
When they arise maintain them and observe them so that you can come to know the level of your mind
There are four levels of good mental states 
Rupavacarabhumi the level of form
Arupavacarabhumi the level of formlessness
Lokuttarabhumi the transcendent level
The level of sensuality A mental state arises and connects with a wholesome object  any sight sound smell taste tactile sensation or idea that can form the basis for skillful mental states
When it meets with its object it becomes happy joyful and glad
If you were to refer to the Heavens of Sensual Bliss as they appear within each of us the list would run as follows Sights that can form the basis for skillful mental states are one level sounds are another and same with smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas
Together they form the six levels of heaven on the sensual level
The level of form A mental state arises from thinking about a physical object that serves as the theme of one's meditation and then analyzing the object into its various aspects at the same time making sure that the mind doesn't slip away from the object
When the mind and its object are one in this way the object becomes light
The mind is unburdened and can relax its sense of concern
Rapture and ease arise as a result
When these five factors appear in the mind it has entered the first jhana  the beginning stage in the level of form
The level of formlessness The mind lets go of its physical object on the level of form but is still attached to a very subtle mental notion  the jhana of unbounded space for instance in which you are focused on a sense of emptiness and awareness with no physical object or image passing into your field of attention so that you are unable to know its full range
What has actually happened is that you have curled up and are hiding inside
This isn't the kind of 'going in to know' that comes from finishing your work
It's the 'going in to know' that comes from wanting to run away
You've seen the faults of what arises outside you but haven't seen that they really lie buried within you  so you've hidden inside by limiting the field of your attention
Some people when they reach this point believe that they have done away with defilement because they mistake the emptiness for nibbana
Actually it's only the first stage in the level of formlessness and so is still on the mundane level
If you seriously want to know whether your mind is on the mundane or the transcendent level then observe it when you turn your awareness inward and make it still  when you feel a sense of peace and ease that seems to have no defilements adulterating it at all
Let go of that mental state to see how it behaves on its own
If defilements can reappear you're still on the mundane level
Sometimes that mental state remains unchanged through the power of your own efforts but after a while you become unsure of your knowledge
Your mind has to keep fondling ie making a running commentary on it
When this is the case don't go believing that your knowledge is in any way true
There are many many kinds of knowledge The intellect knows the heart knows the mind knows consciousness knows discernment knows alertness knows awareness knows unawareness knows
All these modes are based on knowledge they differ simply in how they know
If you aren't able to distinguish clearly among the different modes of knowing knowing can become confused  and so you might take wrong knowing to be right knowing or unawareness to be awareness or knowledge attached to suppositions to be freedom from suppositions
Thus you should experiment and examine things carefully from all angles so that you can come to see for yourself which kind of knowledge is genuine and which is counterfeit
Counterfeit knowledge merely knows but can't let go
Genuine knowledge when it goes about knowing anything is bound to let go
All three levels of the mind discussed so far are on the mundane level
The transcendent level This begins with the path and fruition of entry into the stream to nibbana
Those who reach this level have begun by following the threefold training of virtue concentration and discernment on the mundane level but then have gone on to gain their first true insight into the four Noble Truths enabling them to free themselves from the first three Fetters
Their minds are thus released into the stream to nibbana
The three Fetters are 
b
Doubt the uncertainty that leads us to be unsure of the good we believe in  ie of how much truth there is to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
c
Attachment to precepts and practices fondling the good that we practice being attached to those forms of goodness that are merely external  for instance observing precepts or practices by clinging simply to the level of bodily action or speech
Examples of this attitude include such things as developing virtue by adhering simply to the precepts practicing concentration by simply sitting like a post not being able to free yourself from these actions always holding onto the goodness that comes from them happy when you have the chance to perform them in a particular way upset when you don't thinking for instance that virtue is something you get from monks when they give you the precepts that the eight precepts are to be observed only on certain days and nights months and years that you gain or lose merit simply as a result of external actions associated with your accustomed beliefs
None of these attitudes reaches the essence of virtue
They go no further than simply clinging to beliefs customs and conventions clutching onto these forms of goodness always fondling them unable to let them go
Thus this is called 'attachment to precepts and practices'
Such attitudes are an obstacle to what is truly good
Take for example the longheld belief that goodness means to practice charity virtue and meditation on the sabbath days streamwinners have completely let go of such beliefs
Their hearts are no longer caught up in beliefs and customs
Their virtues no longer have precepts
In other words they have reached the essence of virtue
Their virtue is free from the limits of time
In this they differ from ordinary runofthemill people
Ordinary people have to hand goodness over to external criteria  believing for instance that virtue lies on this day or that during Rains Retreat during this or that month or year  and then holding fast to that belief maintaining that anyone who doesn't follow the custom can't be virtuous
In the end such people have a hard time finding the opportunity really to do good
Thus we can say that they don't know the true criteria for goodness
As for streamwinners all the qualities of virtue have come in and filled their hearts
They are able to unshackle themselves from the conventional values of the world that say that this or that is good
What is truly good they have seen appear in their hearts
Good lies right here
Evil lies right here
Neither depends on external actions
This is in line with the Buddha's saying
This is what is meant by 'streamwinner'
Streamwinners are like people who have rowed their boats into the main current of the Chao Phraya River and so are destined to float down to the river's mouth and into the sea of amata  deathless  nibbana
There are three ways they can reach the sea
The second level is like a boatsman who has his foot on the rudder his hands on the oars and rows along
The third level The boat is equipped with a motor and the boatsman is at the steering wheel and so he reaches the goal in practically no time at all
This  reaching the stream to nibbana  is the beginning stage of the transcendent level
If you were to simplify the three Fetters you could do so as follows To be attached to the body as being one's own is selfidentification
To be attached to the actions of the body is attachment to precepts and practices
Not knowing how to separate the mind from the body or from one's actions makes one unable to see clearly and know truly This leads to uncertainty and doubt
These are simply my opinions on the matter so you who read this should consider things carefully on your own
This ends the discussion of the transcendent and mundane skillful states of mind
When you know the characteristics of the various mental states you should use the three qualities mentioned above as your tools Keep your mindfulness alertness and powers of focused investigation firmly in place at the mind
To be able to gain knowledge you have to use the power of focused investigation which is an aspect of discernment to know how mental states arise and fall pulling out taking a stance and then returning into stillness
You must keep your attention fixed on investigating these things constantly in order to be able to know the arising and falling away of mental states  and you will come to know the nature of the mind that doesn't arise and doesn't fall away
To know the arising and falling away of mental states of the past is one level of cognitive skill and deserves to be called 'knowledge of previous births' To know the states of the mind as they change in the present deserves to be called 'knowledge of death and rebirth' To know how to separate mental states from their objects knowing the primal nature of the mind knowing the current or force of the mind that flows to its objects separating the objects the current of mind that flows and the primal nature of the mind To be able to know in this way deserves to be called 'knowledge of the ending of mental effluents' The objects or preoccupations of the mind are the effluent of sensuality
The current that flows is the effluent of becoming
Not knowing the primal nature of the mind is the effluent of unawareness
If we were to express this in terms of the four Noble Truths we would have to do so as follows The objects or preoccupations of the mind are the truth of stress
The current of the mind that flows into and falls for its objects is the truth of the cause of stress
The mental state that penetrates in to see clearly the truth of all objects the current of the mind and the primal nature of the mind is called the mental moment that forms the Path
To let go of the objects the mental current and the primal nature of the mind without any sense of attachment is the truth of the disbanding of stress
When the three qualities that assist the mind  alertness mindfulness and focused investigation  are vigorous and strong alertness becomes the awareness of release mindfulness becomes intuitive understanding and focused investigation becomes liberating insight the discernment that can stay fixed on knowing the truth of stress without permitting any sense of pleasure or displeasure for its object to arise
Intuitive understanding fathoms the cause of stress and the awareness of release knows the heart clearly all the way through
When you can know in this way you can say that you know rightly
Here I'd like to back up and discuss the question of the mind in a little more detail
The word 'mind' covers three aspects
All of these aspects taken together make up the mind
If you don't know the mind in this way you can't say that you really know it
All you can do is say that the mind arises and falls away the mind doesn't rise or fall away the mind is good the mind is evil the mind becomes annihilated the mind doesn't become annihilated the mind is a dhamma the mind isn't a dhamma the mind gains release the mind doesn't gain release the mind is nibbana the mind isn't nibbana the mind is sensory consciousness the mind isn't sensory consciousness the mind is the heart the mind isn't the heart
As the Buddha taught there are only two paths to practice  the body speech and heart and the body speech and mind  and in the end both paths reach the same point Their true goal is release
So if you want to know the truth concerning any of the above issues you have to follow the path and reach the truth on your own
Otherwise you'll have to argue endlessly
These issues  for people who haven't practiced all the way to clear insight  have been termed by people of wisdom as sedamocanakatha issues that can only make you break out in a sweat
So I would like to make a short explanation The primal nature of the mind is a nature that simply knows
The current that thinks and streams out from knowing to various objects is a mental state
When this current connects with its objects and falls for them it becomes a defilement darkening the mind This is a mental state in interaction
Mental states by themselves and in interaction whether good or evil have to arise have to disband have to dissolve away by their very nature
The source of both these sorts of mental states is the primal nature of the mind which neither arises nor disbands
It is a fixed phenomenon always in place
By the primal nature of the mind  which is termed 'pabhassara' or radiant  I mean the ordinary elementary state of knowing in the present
But whoever isn't able to penetrate in to know it can't gain any good from it like the proverbial monkey with the diamond
Thus the name given by the Buddha for this state of affairs is really fitting avijja  dark knowledge counterfeit knowledge
This is in line with the terms 'pubbante aññanam'  not knowing the beginning ie the primal nature of the mind 'parante aññanam'  not knowing the end ie mental states in interaction with their objects 'majjhantika aññanam'  not knowing the middle ie the current that streams from the primal nature of knowing
When this is the case the mind becomes a sankhara a concoctor a magician fabricating prolifically in its myriad ways
This ends the discussion of the mind as a frame of reference
In other words keep death in mind
This is where the mind advances to the development of liberating insight taking death as its theme
'Death' here refers to the death occurring in the present  physical sensations arising and passing away mental acts arising and passing away all in a moment of awareness
Only when you're aware on this level can you be classed as being mindful of death
Now that we've brought up the topic of death we have to reflect on birth seeing how many ways sensations are born and how many ways mental acts are born
This is something a person with a quiet mind can know
A
Sensations have up to five levels of refinement 
Panitarupa exquisite sensations that make the body feel pleasurable light and refined
Focus on what causes them until they disappear
Sukhumalarupa delicate sensations tender yielding and agile
When they arise focus on what causes them until they disappear
Olarikarupa physical sensations that give a sense of grandeur exuberance brightness and exultation 'Mukhavanno vipassidati' When they arise focus on finding out what causes them until they disappear
All four of these sensations arise and disband by their very nature and it's possible to find out where they first appear
'Manobhava' imagined circumstances that appear through the power of the mind
When they arise focus on keeping track of them until they disappear
Once you're able to know in this way you enter the sphere of true mindfulness of death
An explanation of this sort of sensation When the mind is quiet and steadily concentrated it has the power to create images in the imagination
Whatever images it thinks of will then appear to it and once they appear the mind tends to enter into them and take up residence
If the mind fastens onto these sensations it is said to take birth  simply because it has no sense of death
These sensations can appear in any of five ways 
b
arising from thoughts imbued with greed hatred or delusion  arising taking a stance and then disbanding
c
arising with an inbreath and disbanding with the following outbreath
d
arising from the cleansing of the blood in the lungs  appearing and disbanding in a single instant
e
arising from the heart's pumping blood into the various parts of the body the pressure of the blood causing sensations to arise that correspond to sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations
Sensations of this sort are arising and disbanding every moment
Another class of sensation is termed 'gocararupa'  sensations that circle around the physical body
There are five sorts  light sound smells tastes and tactile sensations  each having five levels
For instance common light travels slowly in the flash of an eye it runs for a league and then dies away
The second level subtle light goes further and the third level goes further still
The fourth and fifth levels can travel the entire universe
The same holds true for sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations
The relationships between all the potentials in the universe are interacting at every moment differing only as to whether they're fast or slow
This is the inequality that has been termed 'aniccalakkhana'  inherent inconstancy
Whoever is ignorant is bound to think that all this is impossible but actually this is the way things already are by their nature
We'll come to know this through vijja  cognitive skill  not through ordinary labels and concepts
This is called true knowing which meditators who develop the inner eye will realize for themselves knowing the arising of these sensations their persisting and their disbanding in terms of their primary qualities and basic regularity
Nibbanam paramam sukham
Nibbana is the ultimate ease
B
As for mental acts that arise and die their timespan is many thousands of times faster than that of sensations
To be able to keep track of their arising and dying away our awareness has to be still
The four kinds of mental acts are
 Sañña recognizing and labeling the objects of the mind
 Sankhara mental fabrications or fashionings of good and bad
 Viññana distinct consciousness or cognizance of objects
One class of these mental acts stays in place arising and disbanding with reference to the immediate present
Another class is termed 'gocara vedana' 'gocara sañña' etc which go out to refer to the world
Each of these has five levels differing as to whether they're common refined or subtle slow or fast
These five levels connect with each other running out in stages and then circling back to their starting point disbanding and then arising again  all without end
When we don't have the skill to discern the primary sensations and mental acts that stay in place we can't see into the 'gocara' sensations and mental acts that go flowing around
This is termed 'avijja' the unawareness that opens the way for connecting consciousness giving rise to the act of fashioning which is the essence of kamma
This gives fruit as sensations and feelings that are followed by craving and then the act of labeling which gives rise to another level of consciousness  of sensory objects  and then the cycle goes circling on
This is termed the 'khandhavatta' the cycle of the aggregates circling and changing unevenly and inconsistently
To see this is called aniccanupassanañana the knowledge that keeps track of inconstancy as it occurs
This is known through the inner eye ie the skill of genuine discernment
Thus those who practice the exercises of insight meditation should use their sensitivities and circumspection to the full if they hope to gain release from unawareness
Fashionings in this context are like waves on the ocean
If we're out in a boat on the ocean when the waves are high our vision is curtailed
Our senses of hearing smell taste touch and ideation are all curtailed
We won't be able to perceive far into the distance
What this means is that when our minds are immersed in the Hindrances we won't be able to perceive death at all
But once we've been able to suppress the Hindrances it's like taking a boat across the ocean when there are no waves
We'll be able to see objects far in the distance
Our eyes will be clearseeing our ears clearhearing our senses of smell taste touch and ideation will be broad and wide open
The water will be clear and the light brilliant
We'll be able to know all around us
In the same way those who are to know death clearly have to begin by practicing concentration as a foundation for developing liberating insight
How do the five sorts of abovementioned sensation arise
What are their causes
How do they disappear
How do physical and mental feelings arise
How do they disappear
What are their causes
How do labels and concepts arise
What are their causes
How do they disappear
How do mental fashionings arise
What are their causes
How do they disappear
How does consciousness arise by way of the senses of sight hearing smell taste touch and ideation
What are its causes
How does it disappear
Altogether there are four levels to each of the five aggregates external and internal staying in place and streaming outward
These can be known at all times but only people who have the discernment that comes from training the mind in tranquillity and insight meditation will be able to know death on this level
The discernment that arises in this way has been termed 'pubbenivasanussatiñana ie understanding past sensations future sensations and sensations in the present
These sensations differ in the way they arise and pass away
To know this is to have mastered one cognitive skill
Cutupapatañana With discernment of this sort we're able to keep track of the states of our own mind as they arise and disappear sometimes good as they arise and good as they disappear sometimes bad as they arise and bad as they disappear sometimes good as they arise and bad as they disappear sometimes bad as they arise and good as they disappear
To be able to keep track in this way is to know states of being and birth
Asavakkhayañana When the discernment of this skill arises it leads to disenchantment with the way sensations and mental acts arise and disappear and then arise again simply circling about coarser sensations going through the cycle slowly more refined sensations going quickly coarser mental acts going slowly more refined mental acts going quickly
When you can keep track of this you know one form of stress
Now focus attention back on your own mind to see whether or not it's neutral at that moment
If the mind approves of its knowledge or of the things it knows that's kamasukhallikanuyoga  indulgence in pleasure
If the mind disapproves of its knowledge or of the things it knows that's attakilamathanuyoga indulgence in selfinfliction
Once you've seen this make the mind neutral toward whatever it may know That moment of awareness is the mental state forming the Path
When the Path arises the causes of stress disband
Try your best to keep that mental state going
Follow that train of awareness as much as you can
The mind when it's in that state is said to be developing the Path  and at whatever moment the Path stands firm disbanding and relinquishing occur
When you can do this you reach the level where you know death clearly
People who know death in this way are then able to reduce the number of their own deaths
Some of the Noble Ones have seven more deaths ahead of them some have only one more others go beyond death entirely
These Noble Ones are people who understand birth and death and for this reason have only a few deaths left to them
Ordinary people who understand their own birth and death on this level are hard to find
Common ordinary birth and death aren't especially necessary but people who don't understand the Dhamma have to put up with birth and death as a common thing
So whoever is to know death on this level will have to develop the cognitive skill that comes from training the mind
The skill here is knowing which preoccupations of the mind are in the past which are in the future and which are in the present
This is cognitive skill
Letting go of the past letting go of the future letting go of the present not latching onto anything at all This is purity and release
As for unawareness it's the exact opposite not knowing what's past not knowing what's future not knowing what's present  that is the arising and falling away of sensations and mental acts or body and mind  or at most knowing only on the level of labels and concepts remembered from what other people have said not knowing on the level of awareness that we've developed on our own
All of this is classed as avijja or unawareness
No matter how much we may use words of wisdom and discernment it still won't gain us release
For instance we may know that things are inconstant but we still fall for inconstant things
We may know about things that are stressful but we still fall for them
We may know that things are notself but we still fall for things that are notself
Our knowledge of inconstancy stress and notself isn't true
Then how are these things truly known
Like this
'Knowing both sides' means knowing what's constant and what's inconstant what's stress and what's ease what's notself and what's self
'Letting go both ways' means not latching onto things that are constant or inconstant not latching onto stress or ease not latching onto self or notself
'Shedding everything' means not holding onto past present or future Awareness doesn't head forward or back and yet you can't say that it's taking a stance
Now I would like to describe the virtues of the arahants those who have gained complete insight into the world abandoning it once and for all
Though their aggregates may still appear to the world they are pure aggregates absolutely free from both good and evil because the mind doesn't claim possession of them
The mind is untouched by the behavior of the aggregates
The ten fetters have been disbanded completely and no longer entangle the heart which is why this state is called nibbana liberation
The mind is radiant and clear passion aversion and delusion can no longer cloud it
It has reached the radiance of the primal nature of the heart to which nothing else can compare
Once this radiance is realized it obliterates the radiance of all three levels of existence so that no state of being appears at all
As long as the mind has yet to gain release from defilement it is bound to regard the three levels of existence as radiant and appealing
Once the mind reaches streamentry the radiance of the three levels of existence begins to darken and dim
When it reaches the level of oncereturning that radiance appears even dimmer and on the level of nonreturning it appears dimmer yet although it is still there
When arahantship is reached the radiance of the three levels of existence is so dim that it has virtually vanished
When virtue concentration and discernment are gathered at the mind and unawareness disbands along with the higher levels of the noble path the world doesn't appear at all
You can't tell what features colors or shapes it has or even where it is
There is only the pure brilliance of nibbana
All the worlds are dissolved in the moments of the path and fruition of arahantship
This brilliance is something always there but we don't see it because of our own darkness and delusion
This very brilliance though can obliterate the darkness of the world so that only nibbana will appear
The radiance of nibbana obliterates the radiance of the world just as the light of the sun which illumines the world of human beings and common animals can obliterate at midday the light of the stars appearing in the sky at night
Another comparison is the light of the candle which in the darkness appears bright to our eyes If a burning kerosene lantern is brought near the candle the candle's light will appear to dim
If the lantern's light is really brilliant the light of the candle won't even appear
If we aren't observant we may think that the candle isn't shedding any light at all but actually it's giving off as much light as before only now no one pays it any attention
So it is with the mind that has reached radiant nibbana which obliterates the light of the sun and moon and wipes from the heart the glittering appeal of heaven and the Brahma worlds
This is why nibbana is said to be zero or void None of the three worlds appears as a preoccupation of the heart the heart no longer entangles itself
It zeroes itself from the world ie it no longer takes part in birth aging illness and death
Nibbana is something genuine and unchanging
It knows nothing of deterioration
It always stays as it is
As long as there is birth aging illness and death there will always be nibbana because birthlessness comes from birth and deathlessness lies buried in the very midst of dying
The problem then lies with those who don't lay the groundwork for realizing nibbana
Nibbana doesn't vacillate back and forth but most people who practice virtue concentration and discernment do
Just like a man who is going to walk to a city but when he gets halfway there turns back Normally he should reach the city in thirty days but if he walks back and forth like this even for three years he'll never get there
And when he doesn't reach the city if he were then to go telling people that it doesn't exist he would be making a serious mistake
So it is with people who practice virtue concentration and discernment in half measures back and forth and  when they don't gain Awakening  go telling others that nibbana is null and void that the Buddha took it with him when he died
This is very wrong
We can make a comparison with a field where our parents have raised rice and always gotten a good crop
If they die and our own laziness fills their place so that we don't do the work we're bound to go hungry
And once we're hungry can we then say that our parents took the rice or the field with them
In the same way nibbana is there but if we don't assemble the causes for realizing it and then go denying its existence you can imagine for yourself how much harm we're doing
If we haven't yet reached or realized nibbana there's nothing extraordinary about it
But once we have come close to nibbana the world will appear as if full of vipers and masses of fire
The palaces and mansions of heavenly beings if you can see them will look like the hovels of outcastes
You won't be attracted to living in them because you've already known nibbana
Nibbana is nothing else but this ordinary heart freed from all the effluents of defilement so that it reaches its primal nature
The primal nature of the heart is something that doesn't take birth age grow ill or die
What takes birth is the act of falling for preoccupations
The heart's nature is clear and shining but unawareness keeps it clouded and opaque
Yet even on the physical level  to say nothing of the heart  if someone were to come along and say that the water in the ocean is clear by nature that a person with any intelligence could see the ocean floor you'd have a hard time trying to find anyone to believe him
But what he says is true
There are plenty of reasons why we can't see the ocean floor  the dust and minute particles floating in the water the wind and the sea creatures that interact with the water  but if you could get someone to eliminate these factors so that there would be nothing but the nature of the water it would be crystal clear
You could tell at a glance how deep or shallow the ocean was without having to waste your time diving and groping around
So it is with the heart If our hearts are still ignorant we shouldn't go groping elsewhere for nibbana
Only if we cleanse our own hearts will we be able to see it
People who meditate are by and large extremely prone to conjecture and speculation judging nibbana to be like this or that but actually there's nothing especially deep dark or mysterious about it
What makes nibbana seem mysterious is our own lack of discernment
Nibbana is always present along with the world
As long as the world exists there will always be nibbana
But if no one explores the truth of nibbana it will appear mysterious and far away
And once we give rise to our own misunderstandings we're bound to start formulating notions that nibbana is like this or like that
We may decide that nibbana is extinguished that nibbana is null and void that nibbana has no birth aging illness or death that nibbana is the self or that nibbana is notself
Actually each of these expressions is neither right nor wrong
Right and wrong belong to the person speaking because nibbana is something untouched by supposing
No matter what anyone may call it it simply stays as it is
If we were to call it heaven or a Brahma world it wouldn't object just as we suppose names for sun and moon If we were to call them stars or clouds or worlds or jewels whatever they really are stays as it is they aren't transformed by our words
At the same time they themselves don't announce that they are sun or moon or anything
They are thitidhamma  they simply are what they are
So it is with the pure heart that we call nibbana
No matter what we call it it simply stays as it is
Thus we say that with nibbana there's no right and no wrong
Right and wrong belong to the person speaking
People who don't know drag out their right and wrong to talk about
Nibbana is something known exclusively through the heart
Words and deeds aren't involved
Our talking is merely a matter of the path
The result once attained is something completely apart
We thus call it release because it's untouched by supposing attaining a nature that is pure heartwood the heart that neither spins forward nor back the heart that attains a quality that doesn't develop or deteriorate come or go
It stays as it is  what we suppose as thitidhamma free from the germs of defilement  our very own heart ie the heart's primal nature
Actually the heart is pure by nature but various moods and objects  various preoccupations  are mixed up with it
Once these preoccupations are cleaned out there you are nibbana
To know nibbana clearly is nothing other than knowing how this one heart takes its preoccupations as itself
The heart by nature is one but if it hasn't been trained by discernment it tends to go streaming toward preoccupations both within and without and then we say that this state of mind differs from that state of mind and so they begin to multiply until they're so many that we give up trying to look after them all
They seem many because we count each preoccupation as a state of the mind itself
The problem is that we don't understand the teachings of the ancient philosophers and so think that the mind can be called many
Take a simple example Suppose a person has many jobs
Sometimes he sells so he's called a merchant
If he also grows rice he's called a farmer
If he works for the King he's called a government official
If he acquires rank he's called by his rank
Actually he's only one person and none of his titles are wrong
They've been given to him simply in line with the work he does
But anyone who didn't understand would think that this man was an awful lot of people
Another comparison When a person is born we call it a baby
When it gets older we call it a child
When it gets still older we call it a young man or a young lady and when its hair gets gray and its teeth break we call it Grandma or Gramps
What gives rise to all these names
One and the same person
So it is with the mind that is supposed to be many
We don't understand what the words are supposed to mean so we go groping around after our own shadows
When this is the case we find it hard to practice
We don't understand the states of mind that have been supposed into being and so don't see the mind that is released untouched by supposing
When the mind is said to have many states this is what is meant Sometimes the mind takes on passion this is called saragacitta a passionate mind
Sometimes it takes on irritation and aversion this is called sadosacitta an angry mind
Sometimes it takes on a deluded state as itself this is called samohacitta a deluded mind
These states are all on the unwise side and are termed akusalacitta unskillful mental states
As for the good side vitaragacitta the mind has reached satisfaction and so its desires fade vitadosacitta the mind has had enough and so its anger disappears vitamohacitta the mind is bright and so withdraws from its dullness just as the sun or moon withdraws from an eclipse and is bright and clear
These are termed kusalacitta skillful mental states
Some people at this point think that there are six states to the mind or even six minds
The true nature of the mind though is one
To count six states or six minds is to count the preoccupations the primal mind is radiant
We take a few things to be many and so end up poor just as when a foolish or poor person thinks that a thousand baht is a lot of money
An intelligent or rich person though realizes that it's just a little You can spend it all in two days
A fool however would think that a thousand baht would make him rich and so he'll have to continue being poor
So it is if we see our one mind as many We'll have to be poor because we'll be at our wits' end trying to train it
The nature of the mind that's clear and one is like clean clear water mixed with different colors in different bottles
We may call it red water yellow water green water etc but the water itself is still clear as it always was
If a fool comes along and falls for the colors he wants to taste them all
He may drink five bottles but they'll all be just like the first
If he knows beforehand that it's all the same water he won't feel any desire to waste his time drinking this or that bottle
All he has to do is taste one bottle and that'll be enough
So it is with the mind If we realize that the mind is in charge and is the determining factor in all good and evil and in the attainment of nibbana we won't feel any desire to go saying that the mind is like this or like that
The mind seems to be many because it gets entangled in various preoccupations and when these preoccupations dye the mind we count them as states of the mind itself
The pure nature of the heart and mind is like the sun which shines every day throughout the year but is concealed by clouds during the rainy season
Those who don't know its nature then say that the sun isn't shining
This is wrong
Their vision can't penetrate the clouds and so they find fault with the sun
They suppose that the darkness of the clouds belongs to the sun get stuck on their own supposings and so don't reach the truth
The true nature of the sun is always bright no matter what the season
If you don't believe me ask an airplane pilot
If you go up past the clouds in an airplane on a dark rainy day you'll know whether the sun is in fact dark or shining
So it is with the mind No matter how it may be behaving its nature is one  radiant and clear
If we lack discernment and skill we let various preoccupations come flowing into the mind which lead it to act  sometimes wisely and sometimes not  and then we designate the mind according to its behavior
Because there is one mind it can have only one preoccupation
And if it has only one preoccupation then there shouldn't be too much difficulty in practicing so as to know its truth
Even though the mind may seem to have many preoccupations they don't come all at once in a single instant
They have to pass by one at a time
A good mood enters as a bad one leaves pleasure enters pain leaves ingenuity enters stupidity leaves darkness enters brightness leaves
They keep trading places without letup
Mental moments though are extremely fast
If we aren't discerning we won't be able to know our own preoccupations
Only after they've flared up and spread to affect our words and deeds are we usually aware of them
Normally this one mind is very fast
Just as when we turn on a light If we don't look carefully the light seems to appear and the darkness to disperse the very instant we turn on the switch
This one mind when it changes preoccupations is that fast
This one mind is what leads to various states of being because our preoccupations get into the act so that we're entangled and snared
It's not the case that one person will have many minds
Say that a person goes to heaven He goes just to heaven
Even if he is to go on to other levels of being he has to pass away from heaven first
It's not the case that he'll go to heaven hell and the Brahma worlds all at the same time
This goes to show that the mind is one
Only its thoughts and preoccupations change
The preoccupations of the mind come down simply to physical and mental phenomena that change causing the mind to experience birth in various states of being
Since the mind lacks discernment and doesn't know the true nature of its preoccupations it gropes about experiencing death and rebirth in the four modes of generation
If the mind has the discernment to know its preoccupations and let go of them all without remainder leaving only the primal nature of the heart that doesn't fall for any preoccupation on the levels of sensuality form or formlessness it will be able to gain release from suffering and stress
Once the mind is fully matured by means of virtue concentration and discernment it gains complete release from the effluents of defilement
Khandhakamo  desire for the five aggregates is over and done with
Bhavakamo  desire for the three levels of being disbands and disperses
The three levels of being are essentially only two the aggregate of physical phenomena which includes the properties of earth water fire and wind and the aggregates of mental phenomena which include feelings labels fashionings and consciousness  in short the phenomena that appear in the body and heart or if you will the body and mind
Physical phenomena are those that can be seen with the eye
Mental phenomena are those that can't be seen with the eye but can be sensed only through the heart and mind
Once we can distinguish these factors and see how they're related we'll come to see the truth of the aggregates They are stress they are the cause of stress they are the path
Once we understand them correctly we can deal with them properly
Whether they arise fade or vanish we won't  if we have any discernment  latch onto them with any false assumptions
The mind will let go
It will simply know neutral and undisturbed
It won't feel any need to worry about the conditions or behavior of the aggregates because it sees that the aggregates can't be straightened out
Even the Buddha didn't straighten out the aggregates
He simply let them go in line with their own true nature
The heart is what creates the substance of the aggregates
If you try to straighten out the creations you'll never be done with them
If you straighten out the creator you'll have the job finished in no time
When the heart is clouded with dullness and darkness it creates aggregates or physical and mental phenomena as its products to the point where the birth aging illness and death of the aggregates become absolutely incurable  unless we have the wisdom to leave them alone in line with their own nature
In other words we shouldn't latch onto them
This is illustrated in the Canon where the Buddha says in some passages that he is free from birth aging illness and death
If we read further though we'll notice that his body grew old ill and then died his mental activity ended
This shows that the aggregates should be left alone
Whatever their nature may be don't try to resist it or go against it
Keep your mind neutral and aware
Don't go latching onto the various preoccupations that arise age grow ill and vanish as pertaining to the self
If you can do this you're practicing correctly
Aim only at the purity of the one heart that doesn't die
The heart clouded with dullness and darkness lacks a firm base and so drifts along taking after the aggregates
When they take birth it thinks that it's born when they age it thinks that it's aged when they grow ill and disband it gets mixed up along with them and so experiences stress and pain its punishment for drifting along in the wake of its supposings
If the mind doesn't drift in this way there is simply the disbanding of stress
The cause of stress and the path disband as well leaving only the nature that doesn't die buddha a mind that has bloomed and awakened
For the mind to bloom it needs the fertilizer of virtue and concentration
For it to awaken and come to its senses it needs discernment
The fertilizer of concentration is composed of the exercises of tranquillity and insight meditation
The mind then gains allaround discernment with regard to the aggregates  seeing the pain and harm they bring  and so shakes itself free and keeps its distance which is why the term arahant is also translated as one who is distant In other words the mind has had enough
It has had its fill
It's no longer flammable ie it offers no fuel to the fires of passion aversion and delusion which are now dispersed once and for all through the power of discernment
This is the supreme nibbana
Birth has been absolutely destroyed but nibbana isn't annihilation
Nibbana is the name for what still remains the primal heart
So why isn't it called the heart
Because it's now a heart with no preoccupations
Just as with the names we suppose for tree and steel If the tree is cut they call it lumber If it's made into a house they call it home If it's made into a place to sit they call it a chair You never see anyone who would still call it a tree The same with steel Once it's been made into a car or a knife we call it a car or a knife You never see anyone who would still call it a steel But even though they don't call it a steel the steel is still there
It hasn't run off anywhere
It's still steel just as it always was
So it is with the heart when the expert craftsman discernment has finished training it We call it nibbana
We don't call it by its old name
When we no longer call it the heart some people think that the heart vanishes but actually it's simply the heart in its primal state that we call nibbana
Or again it's simply the heart untouched by supposing
No matter what anyone may call it it simply stays as it is
It doesn't take on anyone's suppositions at all
Just as when we correctly suppose a diamond to be a diamond No matter what anyone may call it its real nature stays as it is
It doesn't advertise itself as a diamond
It simply is what it is
The same with the heart Once it gains release it doesn't suppose itself to be this or that
It's still there
It hasn't been annihilated
Just as when we call a diamond a diamond it's there and when we don't call it anything it's still there  it hasn't vanished or disappeared  so it is with the hear that is nibbana It's there
If we call it a sun a moon heaven Brahma world earth water wind fire woman man or anything at all it's still there just as before
It hasn't changed in any way
It stays as it is one heart one Dhamma free from the germs of defilement
This is why the truest name to suppose for it is release
What we call heart mind intellect form feeling labels mental fashionings consciousness All these are true as far as supposing goes
Wherever supposing is there release can be found
Take a blatant example the five aggregates
If you look at their true nature you'll see that they've never said Look
We're aggregates or Look
We're the heart So it is with the heart that's nibbana that has reached nibbana It won't proclaim itself as this or that which is why we suppose it to be release
Once someone has truly reached release that's the end of speaking
I make it a practice to wander about during the dry season every year
I do this because I feel that a monk who stays put in one monastery is like a train sitting still at HuaLampong station  and everyone knows the worth of a train sitting still
So there's no way I could stay in one place
I'll have to keep on the move all of my life as long as I'm still ordained
Some of my companions have criticized me for being this way and others have praised me but I myself feel that it brings nothing but good
I've learned about the land events customs and religious practices in different areas
In some places it may be that I'm more ignorant than the people there in other places and with other groups it might be that I know more than they so there's no way I can lose by traveling about
Even if I just sit still in the forest I gain by it
Wherever I find the people know less than I do I can be their teacher
In whatever groups I find that I know less than they do I'm willing to be their student
Either way I profit
At the same time living in the forest as I like to do has given me a lot to think about
 It was a custom of the Buddha
He was born in the forest attained Awakening in the forest and totally entered nibbana in the forest  and yet how was he at the same time able to bring his virtues right into the middle of great cities as when he spread his religious work to include King Bimbisara of Rajagaha
 As I see it it's better to evade than to fight
As long as I'm not superhuman as long as my skin can't ward off knives bullets and spears I'd better not live in the centers of human society
This is why I feel it's better to evade than to fight
People who know how to evade have a saying 'To evade is wings to avoid is a tail' This means A tiny chick fresh out of the egg if it knows how to evade won't die
It will have a chance to grow feathers and wings and be able to survive on its own in the future
'To avoid is a tail' This refers to the tail of a boat
If the person holding the rudder knows how to steer he'll be able to avoid stumps and sand bars
For the boat to avoid running aground depends on the rudder
Since this is the way I see things I prefer living in the forest
 I've come to consider the principles of nature It's a quiet place where you can observe the influences of the environment
Wild animals for example sleep differently from domesticated animals
This can be a good lesson
Or take the wild rooster Its eyes are quick its tail feathers sparse its wings strong and its call short
It can run fast and fly far
What do these characteristics come from
I've made this a lesson for myself
Domesticated roosters and wild roosters come from the same species but the domesticated rooster's wings are weak its call long its tail feathers lush and ungainly its behavior different from that of the wild rooster
The wild rooster is the way it is because it can't afford to let down its guard
It always has to be on the alert because danger is everpresent in the forest
If the wild rooster went around acting like a domestic rooster the cobras and mongooses would make a meal of it in no time
So when it eats sleeps opens and closes its eyes the wild rooster has to be strong and resilient in order to stay alive
So it is with us
If we spend all our time wallowing around in companionship we're like a knife or a hoe stuck down into the dirt It'll rust easily
But if it's constantly sharpened on a stone or a file rust won't have a chance to take hold
Thus we should learn to be always on the alert
This is why I like to stay in the forest
I benefit from it and learn many lessons
 I've learned to reflect on the teachings that the Buddha taught first to each newlyordained monk
They're very thoughtprovoking
He taught the Dhamma first and then the Vinaya
He'd begin with the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha followed by the five basic objects of meditation hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth and skin
Then he'd give a sermon with four major points
b Live in a quiet place such as an abandoned house under a projecting cliff face in a cave
People have asked if the Buddha had any reasons for this teaching but I've always been convinced that if there were no benefits to be gained from these places he wouldn't have recommended them
Still I wondered what the benefits were which is why I've taken an interest in this matter
c The Buddha taught monks to make robes from cloth that had been thrown away  even to the point of wearing robes made from the cloth used to wrap a corpse
This teaching made me reflect on death
What benefits could come from wearing the cloth used to wrap a corpse
For a simple answer think for a moment about a corpse's things They don't appeal to anyone
No one wants them  and so they hold no dangers
In this point it's easy enough to see that the Buddha taught us not to take pride in our possessions
d The Buddha taught that we should use medicines near at hand such as medicinal plants pickled in urine
These teachings of the Buddha when I first heard them sparked my curiosity
Whether or not I would benefit from following them there was one thing I was sure of that the Buddha was not the sort of person who would hold blindly to anything and that he would never teach anything without good reason
So even if I wasn't totally convinced of his teachings I should at least respect them
Or if I didn't yet have confidence in my teacher's ability I owed it to him and to the traditions of the Sangha to give his teachings a try
I was reminded of the words of MahaKassapa who asked to be allowed to follow such ascetic practices as living in the forest eating one meal a day and wearing robes made from thrownaway rags all of his life
The Buddha questioned him 'You've already eradicated your defilements
What is there left for you to strive for'
MahaKassapa answered 'I want to observe these practices not for my own sake but for the sake of those yet to come
If I don't follow these practices who will they be able to take as an example
If a person teaches by example the students will learn easily just as when a person teaches students how to read If he has pictures to go along with the text the students will learn much more quickly
My observing these practices is the same sort of thing'
When I thought of these words I felt sympathy for MahaKassapa subjecting himself to all sorts of hardships
If you were to put it in worldly terms you could say that he was already a multimillionaire deserving a soft bed and fine food but instead he slept and ate on the ground and had only coarse food to eat
Thinking of his example I'd be ashamed to look for nothing more than creature comforts
As for MahaKassapa he could have eaten fine food and lived in a beautiful home with no danger of his heart's being defiled
But  and it's not surprising  he was more concerned with benefiting those who came after
All of these things have given me food for thought ever since I was first ordained
Speaking of living in the forest I've learned a lot of unusual lessons there
Sometimes I've seen death close at hand and have learned a lot of lessons  sometimes from seeing the behavior of animals sometimes from talking to people who live there
Once there was an old man who told me of the time he had gone with his wife to tap tree sap deep in a large forest
They happened to run into a bear and a fight ensued
The wife was able to get up a tree in time and then called down to her husband 'If you can't fight it off lie down and play dead
Don't make a move'
When her husband heard this he came to his senses and so fell back on the ground lying absolutely still
Seeing this the bear climbed up astride him but then let go of him and simply stood looking at him
The old man lay there on his back meditating on the word 'buddho buddho' and thinking 'I'm not going to die
I'm not going to die' The bear pulled at his legs and then at his head and then used its nuzzle to push him left and right
The old man kept his joints loose and didn't react in any way
After the bear had decided that the man was dead it left
A moment or so later the man got up and walked home with his wife
His head was all battered and bloody but he didn't die
When he had finished telling me the story he added 'That's the way forest animals have to be
If you can't fight you have to play dead'
Hearing this the thought occurred to me 'No one is interested in a dead person
Since I live in the forest I should play dead
Whoever praises me or attacks me I'll have to be still  quiet in thought word and deed  if I want to survive' This can also be a good reminder in the way of the Dhamma To free yourself from death you have to play dead
This is a good lesson in maranassati keeping death in mind
Another time early one morning when I was staying in the middle of a large forest I took my followers out for alms
As we were going through the forest I heard a mother chicken cry 'Kataak
Kataak' Since she didn't fly away I figured she probably had some baby chicks so I sent the boys to run and look
This frightened the chicken and she flew away over the trees
The boys saw a lot of baby chicks running around but before they could catch them the chicks scurried into a large pile of fallen leaves
There they hid themselves and lay absolutely still
The boys took a stick and stirred around in the leaves but the chicks didn't move
They didn't even make a peep
Although the boys kept looking for a while they couldn't find even a single chick
I knew that the chicks hadn't gone anywhere
They had just pretended to be fallen leaves
So as it turned out of all those little tiny chicks we couldn't catch a one
Thinking about this I was struck by their instincts for selfpreservation and how clever they were They simply kept themselves quiet in a pile of fallen leaves
And so I made a comparison for myself 'When you're in the wilds then if you can keep your mind still like the baby chicks you're sure to be safe and to free yourself from dying' This was another good lesson
In addition to the animals there are other aspects of nature  such as trees and vines  that can set you thinking
Take vines for instance
There are some that don't turn in any direction but right
Observing this I've made it a lesson for myself
'If you're going to take your mind to the highest good you'll have to act like the vines ie always to the right for the Buddha taught 'Kayakammam vacakammam manokammam padakkhinam'  going to the right in thought word and deed
You'll always have to go right  by keeping yourself above the defilements that flare up and consume the heart
Otherwise you'll be no match even for a vine'
Some kind of trees make themselves quiet in ways we can see We say that they 'sleep' At night they fold up their leaves
If you go lie under them you'll have a clear view of the stars in the nighttime sky
But when day comes they'll spread out their leaves and give a dense shade
This is a good lesson for the mind When you sit in meditation close only your eyes
Keep your mind bright and alert like a tree that closes its leaves and thus doesn't obstruct our view of the stars
When you can think in this way you see the value of living in the forest
The mind becomes confident
Dhamma that you have studied  or even that you haven't  will make itself clear because nature is the teacher
It's like the sciences of the world which every country has used to develop amazing powers
None of their inventions or discoveries came out of a textbook
They came because scientists studied the principles of nature all of which appear right here in the world
As for the Dhamma it's just like science It exists in nature
When I realized this I no longer worried about studying the scriptures and I was reminded of the Buddha and his disciples They studied and learned from the principles of nature
None of them followed a textbook
For these reasons I'm willing to be ignorant when it comes to texts and scriptures
Some kinds of trees sleep at night and are awake during the day
Others sleep by day and are awake by night
The same is true of forest animals
Living in the forest you also learn from the vapors that each plant exudes
Some plants are good for your health some are bad
Sometimes for example when I've been feverish I've gone to sit under certain kinds of trees and my fever has disappeared
Sometimes when I've been feeling well I've gone to sit under certain kinds of trees and the elements in my body have become disturbed
Sometimes I've been hungry and thirsty but as soon as I go sit under certain kinds of trees my hunger and thirst disappear
Learning from trees in this way has caused me to think about the traditional doctors who keep a statue of a hermit on their altars
Those hermits never studied medical textbooks but were able to teach about medicines that can cure disease because they had studied nature by training their minds the same way we do
Similar lessons can be learned from water earth and air
Realizing this I've never gotten very excited about medicines that cure disease because I feel that good medicines are everywhere
The important point is whether or not we recognize them and this depends on us
In addition there's another quality we need in order to take care of ourselves the power of the mind
If we're able to keep the mind quiet its ability to cure disease will be tens of times greater than that of any medicine
This is called dhammaosatha the medicine of the Dhamma
All in all I can really see that I've gained from living in forests and other quiet places in order to train the mind
One by one I've been able to cut away my doubts about the Buddha's teachings
And so for this reason I'm willing to devote myself to the duties of meditation until there's no more life left for me to live
The gains that come from training the mind if I were to describe them in detail would go on and on but I'll ask to finish this short description here
Indeed the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessed
This selection of excerpts from the Pali canon provides a rough outline of the life of the Buddha
I hope you will find enough in this anthology to gain at least an inkling both of the range of the Buddha's teachings and of the sweeping trajectory of his extraordinary life
For more thorough accounts of the Buddha's life please see these two excellent anthologies The Splendour of Enlightenment A Life of the Buddha compiled by Phra Khantipalo and The Life of the Buddha by Bhikkhu anamoli
Monks I lived in refinement utmost refinement total refinement
My father even had lotus ponds made in our palace one where redlotuses bloomed one where white lotuses bloomed one where blue lotuses bloomed all for my sake
I used no sandalwood that was not from Varanasi
My turban was from Varanasi as were my tunic my lower garments  my outer cloak
A white sunshade was held over me day  night to protect me from cold heat dust dirt  dew
I had three palaces one for the cold season one for the hot season one for the rainy season
During the four months of the rainy season I was entertained in the rainyseason palace by minstrels without a single man among them and I did not once come down from the palace
Whereas the servants workers  retainers in other people's homes are fed meals of lentil soup  broken rice in my father's home the servants workers  retainers were fed wheat rice and meat
Even though I was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me 'When an untaught runofthemill person himself subject to aging not beyond aging sees another who is aged he is horrified humiliated  disgusted oblivious to himself that he too is subject to aging not beyond aging
If I  who am subject to aging not beyond aging  were to be horrified humiliated  disgusted on seeing another person who is aged that would not be fitting for me' As I noticed this the young person's intoxication with youth entirely dropped away
Even though I was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me 'When an untaught runofthemill person himself subject to illness not beyond illness sees another who is ill he is horrified humiliated  disgusted oblivious to himself that he too is subject to illness not beyond illness
And if I  who am subject to illness not beyond illness  were to be horrified humiliated  disgusted on seeing another person who is ill that would not be fitting for me' As I noticed this the healthy person's intoxication with health entirely dropped away
Even though I was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me 'When an untaught runofthemill person himself subject to death not beyond death sees another who is dead he is horrified humiliated  disgusted oblivious to himself that he too is subject to death not beyond death
And if I  who am subject to death not beyond death  were to be horrified humiliated  disgusted on seeing another person who is dead that would not be fitting for me' As I noticed this the living person's intoxication with life entirely dropped away
Before my Awakening when I was still an unawakened Bodhisatta the thought occurred to me 'The household life is crowded a dusty road
Life gone forth is the open air
It isn't easy living in a home to lead the holy life that is totally perfect totally pure a polished shell
What if I having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe were to go forth from the home life into homelessness'
So at a later time when I was still young blackhaired endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life having shaved off my hair  beard  though my parents wished otherwise and were grieving with tears on their faces  I put on the ochre robe and went forth from the home life into homelessness
Having gone forth in search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace I went to Alara Kalama and on arrival said to him 'Friend Kalama I want to practice in this doctrine  discipline'
When this was said he replied to me 'You may stay here my friend
This doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter  dwell in his own teacher's knowledge having realized it for himself through direct knowledge'
It was not long before I learned the doctrine
As far as mere lipreciting  repetition I could speak the words of knowledge the words of the elders and I could affirm that I knew  saw  I along with others
I thought 'It isn't through mere conviction alone that Alara Kalama declares I have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge Certainly he dwells knowing  seeing this Dhamma' So I went to him and said 'To what extent do you declare that you have entered  dwell in this Dhamma' When this was said he declared the dimension of nothingness
I thought 'Not only does Alara Kalama have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernment
I too have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernment
What if I were to endeavor to realize for myself the Dhamma that Alara Kalama declares he has entered  dwells in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge' So it was not long before I quickly entered  dwelled in that Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge
I went to him and said 'Friend Kalama is this the extent to which you have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge'
'Yes my friend'
'This friend is the extent to which I too have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge'
'It is a gain for us my friend a great gain for us that we have such a companion in the holy life
So the Dhamma I declare I have entered  dwell in having realized it for myself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge
And the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma I declare I have entered  dwell in having realized it for myself through direct knowledge
The Dhamma I know is the Dhamma you know the Dhamma you know is the Dhamma I know
As I am so are you as you are so am Come friend let us now lead this community together'
In this way did Alara Kalama my teacher place me his pupil on the same level with himself and pay me great honor
But the thought occurred to me 'This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to Awakening nor to Unbinding but only to reappearance in the dimension of nothingness' So dissatisfied with that Dhamma I left
In search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace I went to Uddaka Ramaputta and on arrival said to him 'Friend Uddaka I want to practice in this doctrine  discipline'
When this was said he replied to me 'You may stay here my friend
This doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter  dwell in his own teacher's knowledge having realized it for himself through direct knowledge'
It was not long before I quickly learned the doctrine
As far as mere lipreciting  repetition I could speak the words of knowledge the words of the elders and I could affirm that I knew  saw  I along with others
I thought 'It wasn't through mere conviction alone that Rama declared I have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge Certainly he dwelled knowing  seeing this Dhamma' So I went to Uddaka and said 'To what extent did Rama declare that he had entered  dwelled in this Dhamma' When this was said Uddaka declared the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
I thought 'Not only did Rama have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernment
I too have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernment
What if I were to endeavor to realize for myself the Dhamma that Rama declared he entered  dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge' So it was not long before I quickly entered  dwelled in that Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge
I went to Uddaka and said 'Friend Uddaka is this the extent to which Rama entered  dwelled in this Dhamma having realized it for himself through direct knowledge'
'Yes my friend'
'This friend is the extent to which I too have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge'
'It is a gain for us my friend a great gain for us that we have such a companion in the holy life
So the Dhamma Rama declared he entered  dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge
And the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma Rama declared he entered  dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge
The Dhamma he knew is the Dhamma you know the Dhamma you know is the Dhamma he knew
As he was so are you as you are so was he
Come friend lead this community'
In this way did Uddaka Ramaputta my companion in the holy life place me in the position of teacher and pay me great honor
But the thought occurred to me 'This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to Awakening nor to Unbinding but only to reappearance in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception' So dissatisfied with that Dhamma I left
I thought 'Suppose that I clenching my teeth and pressing my tongue against the roof of my mouth were to beat down constrain  crush my mind with my awareness' So clenching my teeth and pressing my tongue against the roof of my mouth I beat down constrained  crushed my mind with my awareness
Just as a strong man seizing a weaker man by the head or the throat or the shoulders would beat him down constrain  crush him in the same way I beat down constrained  crushed my mind with my awareness
As I did so sweat poured from my armpits
And although tireless persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness established my body was aroused  uncalm because of the painful exertion
But the painful feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
I thought 'Suppose I were to become absorbed in the trance of nonbreathing' So I stopped the inbreaths  outbreaths in my nose  mouth
As I did so there was a loud roaring of winds coming out my earholes just like the loud roar of winds coming out of a smith's bellows So I stopped the inbreaths  outbreaths in my nose  mouth  ears
As I did so extreme forces sliced through my head just as if a strong man were slicing my head open with a sharp sword Extreme pains arose in my head just as if a strong man were tightening a turban made of tough leather straps around my head Extreme forces carved up my stomach cavity just as if a butcher or his apprentice were to carve up the stomach cavity of an ox There was an extreme burning in my body just as if two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms were to roast  broil him over a pit of hot embers
And although tireless persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness established my body was aroused  uncalm because of the painful exertion
But the painful feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
Devas on seeing me said 'Gotama the contemplative is dead' Other devas said 'He isn't dead he's dying' Others said 'He's neither dead nor dying he's an arahant for this is the way arahants live'
I thought 'Suppose I were to practice going altogether without food' Then devas came to me and said 'Dear sir please don't practice going altogether without food
If you go altogether without food we'll infuse divine nourishment in through your pores and you will survive on that' I thought 'If I were to claim to be completely fasting while these devas are infusing divine nourishment in through my pores I would be lying' So I dismissed them saying 'Enough'
I thought 'Suppose I were to take only a little food at a time only a handful at a time of bean soup lentil soup vetch soup or pea soup' So I took only a little food at a time only handful at a time of bean soup lentil soup vetch soup or pea soup
My body became extremely emaciated
Simply from my eating so little my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stems My backside became like a camel's hoof My spine stood out like a string of beads My ribs jutted out like the jutting rafters of an old rundown barn The gleam of my eyes appeared to be sunk deep in my eye sockets like the gleam of water deep in a well My scalp shriveled  withered like a green bitter gourd shriveled  withered in the heat  the wind The skin of my belly became so stuck to my spine that when I thought of touching my belly I grabbed hold of my spine as well and when I thought of touching my spine I grabbed hold of the skin of my belly as well If I urinated or defecated I fell over on my face right there Simply from my eating so little if I tried to ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands the hair  rotted at its roots  fell from my body as I rubbed simply from eating so little
People on seeing me would say 'Gotama the contemplative is black' Other people would say 'Gotama the contemplative isn't black he's brown' Others would say 'Gotama the contemplative is neither black nor brown he's goldenskinned' So much had the clear bright color of my skin deteriorated simply from eating so little
I thought 'Whatever brahmans or contemplatives in the past have felt painful racking piercing feelings due to their striving this is the utmost
None have been greater than this
Whatever brahmans or contemplatives in the future will feel painful racking piercing feelings due to their striving this is the utmost
None will be greater than this
Whatever brahmans or contemplatives in the present are feeling painful racking piercing feelings due to their striving this is the utmost
None is greater than this
But with this racking practice of austerities I haven't attained any superior human state any distinction in knowledge or vision worthy of the noble ones
Could there be another path to Awakening'
I stayed in the sort of places that are aweinspiring and make your hair stand on end such as parkshrines forestshrines  treeshrines
And while I was staying there a wild animal would come or a bird would make a twig fall or wind would rustle the fallen leaves
The thought would occur to me 'Is this that fear  terror coming' Then the thought occurred to me 'Why do I just keep waiting for fear
What if I were to subdue fear  terror in whatever state they come' So when fear  terror came while I was walking back  forth I would not stand or sit or lie down
I would keep walking back  forth until I had subdued that fear  terror
When fear  terror came while I was standing I would not walk or sit or lie down
I would keep standing until I had subdued that fear  terror
When fear  terror came while I was sitting I would not lie down or stand up or walk
I would keep sitting until I had subdued that fear  terror
When fear  terror came while I was lying down I would not sit up or stand or walk
I would keep lying down until I had subdued that fear  terror
Monks Mara is continually ceaselessly hovering around you 'Perhaps I'll get an opportunity by means of the eye the ear the nose the tongue the body
Perhaps I'll get an opportunity by means of the intellect' Thus monks you should dwell with the doors to your senses wellguarded
I thought 'I recall once when my father the Sakyan was working and I was sitting in the cool shade of a roseapple tree then  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities  I entered  remained in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
Could that be the path to Awakening' Then following on that memory came the realization 'That is the path to Awakening' I thought 'So why am I afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensuality nothing to do with unskillful mental qualities' I thought 'I am no longer afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensuality nothing to do with unskillful mental qualities but it is not easy to achieve that pleasure with a body so extremely emaciated
Suppose I were to take some solid food some rice  porridge' So I took some solid food some rice  porridge
Now five monks had been attending on me thinking 'If Gotama our contemplative achieves some higher state he will tell us' But when they saw me taking some solid food  some rice  porridge  they were disgusted and left me thinking 'Gotama the contemplative is living luxuriously
He has abandoned his exertion and is backsliding into abundance'
So when I had taken solid food and regained strength then  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities I entered  remained in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations I entered  remained in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
With the fading of rapture I remained in equanimity mindful  alert and physically sensitive of pleasure
I entered  remained in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  I entered  remained in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
There are these two extremes that are not to be indulged in by one who has gone forth
Which two
That which is devoted to sensual pleasure with reference to sensual objects base vulgar common ignoble unprofitable and that which is devoted to selfaffliction painful ignoble unprofitable
Avoiding both of these extremes the middle way realized by the Tathagata  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
And what is the middle way realized by the Tathagata that  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
Precisely this Noble Eightfold Path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
This is the middle way realized by the Tathagata that  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past lives
I recollected my manifold past lives ie one birth two five ten fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many eons of cosmic contraction many eons of cosmic expansion many eons of cosmic contraction  expansion 'There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose there
There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose here' Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes  details
This was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resolute
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away  reappearance of beings
I saw  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma 'These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech  mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
But these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech  mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world' Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  I saw beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma
This was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resolute
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations
I discerned as it had come to be that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations' My heart thus knowing thus seeing was released from the fermentation of sensuality released from the fermentation of becoming released from the fermentation of ignorance
With release there was the knowledge 'Released' I discerned that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
This was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resolute
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
The world has been fully awakened to by the Tathagata
From the world the Tathagata is disjoined
The origination of the world has been fully awakened to by the Tathagata
The origination of the world has by the Tathagata been abandoned
The cessation of the world has been fully awakened to by the Tathagata
The cessation of the world has by the Tathagata been realized
The path leading to the cessation of the world has been fully awakened to by the Tathagata
The path leading to the cessation of the world has by the Tathagata been developed
Whatever in this world  with its devas Maras  Brahmas its generations complete with contemplatives  brahmans princes  men  is seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after pondered by the intellect that has been fully awakened to by the Tathagata
Thus he is called the Tathagata
From the night the Tathagata fully awakens to the unsurpassed Right Selfawakening to the night he is totally unbound in the Unbinding property with no fuel remaining whatever the Tathagata has said spoken explained is just so and not otherwise
Thus he is called the Tathagata
The Tathagata is one who does in line with what he teaches one who teaches in line with what he does
Thus he is called the Tathagata
In this world with its devas Maras  Brahmas its generations complete with contemplatives  brahmans princes  men the Tathagata is the unconquered conqueror allseeing the wielder of power
Thus he is called the Tathagata
I have heard that on one occasion when the Blessed One was newly Awakened  staying at Uruvela by the banks of the Nerañjara River in the shade of the Bodhi tree the tree of Awakening  he sat in the shade of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of release
At the end of seven days after emerging from that concentration in the third watch of the night he gave close attention to dependent coarising in forward and reverse order thus
In other words
From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications
From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness
From consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameandform
From nameandform as a requisite condition come the six sense media
From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact
From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling
From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving
From craving as a requisite condition comes clingingsustenance
From clingingsustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming
From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth
From birth as a requisite condition then old age and death sorrow lamentation pain distress and despair come into play
Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress and suffering
Now from the remainderless fading and cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications
From the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness
From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of nameandform
From the cessation of nameandform comes the cessation of the six sense media
From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact
From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling
From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving
From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clingingsustenance
From the cessation of clingingsustenance comes the cessation of becoming
From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth
From the cessation of birth then old age and death sorrow lamentation pain distress and despair all cease
Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress and suffering
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
I have heard that on one occasion when the Blessed One was newly Selfawakened he was staying at Uruvela on the bank of the Nerañjara River at the foot of the Goatherd's Banyan Tree
Then while he was alone and in seclusion this line of thinking arose in his awareness One suffers if dwelling without reverence or deference
Now on what brahman or contemplative can I dwell in dependence honoring and respecting him
Then the thought occurred to him It would be for the sake of perfecting an unperfected aggregate of virtue that I would dwell in dependence on another brahman or contemplative honoring and respecting him
However in this world with its devas Maras  Brahmas in this generation with its brahmans and contemplatives its royalty and commonfolk I do not see another brahman or contemplative more consummate in virtue than I on whom I could dwell in dependence honoring and respecting him
It would be for the sake of perfecting an unperfected aggregate of concentration
It would be for the sake of perfecting an unperfected aggregate of discernment
It would be for the sake of perfecting an unperfected aggregate of release
It would be for the sake of perfecting an unperfected aggregate of knowledge and vision of release that I would dwell in dependence on another brahman or contemplative honoring and respecting him
However in this world with its devas Maras  Brahmas in this generation with its brahmans and contemplatives its royalty and commonfolk I do not see another brahman or contemplative more consummate in knowledge and vision of release than I on whom I could dwell in dependence honoring and respecting him
What if I were to dwell in dependence on this very Dhamma to which I have fully awakened honoring and respecting it
Then having known with his own awareness the line of thinking in the Blessed One's awareness  just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm  Brahma Sahampati disappeared from the Brahmaworld and reappeared in front of the Blessed One
Arranging his upper robe over one shoulder he saluted the Blessed One with his hands before his heart and said to him So it is Blessed One
So it is OneWellGone
Those who were arahants Rightly Selfawakened Ones in the past  they too dwelled in dependence on the very Dhamma itself honoring and respecting it
Those who will be arahants Rightly Selfawakened Ones in the future  they too will dwell in dependence on the very Dhamma itself honoring and respecting it
And let the Blessed One who is at present the arahant the Rightly Selfawakened One dwell in dependence on the very Dhamma itself honoring and respecting it
I have heard that on one occasion when the Blessed One was newly Selfawakened he was staying at Uruvela on the bank of the Nerañjara River at the foot of the Goatherd's Banyan Tree
Then while he was alone and in seclusion this line of thinking arose in his awareness This Dhamma that I have attained is deep hard to see hard to realize peaceful refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wise
But this generation delights in attachment is excited by attachment enjoys attachment
For a generation delighting in attachment excited by attachment enjoying attachment thisthat conditionality and dependent coarising are hard to see
This state too is hard to see the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding
And if I were to teach the Dhamma and if others would not understand me that would be tiresome for me troublesome for me
Just then these verses unspoken in the past unheard before occurred to the Blessed One
As the Blessed One reflected thus his mind inclined to dwelling at ease not to teaching the Dhamma
Then Brahma Sahampati having known with his own awareness the line of thinking in the Blessed One's awareness thought The world is lost
The world is destroyed
The mind of the Tathagata the arahant the Rightly Selfawakened One inclines to dwelling at ease not to teaching the Dhamma Then just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm Brahma Sahampati disappeared from the Brahmaworld and reappeared in front of the Blessed One
Arranging his upper robe over one shoulder he knelt down with his right knee on the ground saluted the Blessed One with his hands before his heart and said to him Lord let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma
Let the OneWellGone teach the Dhamma
There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are falling away because they do not hear the Dhamma
There will be those who will understand the Dhamma

Then the Blessed One having understood Brahma's invitation out of compassion for beings surveyed the world with the eye of an Awakened One
As he did so he saw beings with little dust in their eyes and those with much those with keen faculties and those with dull those with good attributes and those with bad those easy to teach and those hard some of them seeing disgrace and danger in the other world
Just as in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses some lotuses  born and growing in the water  might flourish while immersed in the water without rising up from the water some might stand at an even level with the water while some might rise up from the water and stand without being smeared by the water  so too surveying the world with the eye of an Awakened One the Blessed One saw beings with little dust in their eyes and those with much those with keen faculties and those with dull those with good attributes and those with bad those easy to teach and those hard some of them seeing disgrace and danger in the other world
Then Brahma Sahampati thinking The Blessed One has given his consent to teach the Dhamma bowed down to the Blessed One and circling him on the right disappeared right there
Then the thought occurred to me 'To whom should I teach the Dhamma first
Who will quickly understand this Dhamma' Then the thought occurred to me 'This Alara Kalama is wise competent intelligent
He has long had little dust in his eyes
What if I were to teach him the Dhamma first
He will quickly understand this Dhamma' Then devas came to me and said 'Lord Alara Kalama died seven days ago' And knowledge  vision arose within me 'Alara Kalama died seven days ago' The thought occurred to me 'A great loss has Alara Kalama suffered
If he had heard this Dhamma he would have quickly understood it'
Then the thought occurred to me 'To whom should I teach the Dhamma first
Who will quickly understand this Dhamma' Then the thought occurred to me 'This Uddaka Ramaputta is wise competent intelligent
He has long had little dust in his eyes
What if I were to teach him the Dhamma first
He will quickly understand this Dhamma' Then devas came to me and said 'Lord Uddaka Ramaputta died last night' And knowledge  vision arose within me 'Uddaka Ramaputta died last night' The thought occurred to me 'A great loss has Uddaka Ramaputta suffered
If he had heard this Dhamma he would have quickly understood it'
Then the thought occurred to me 'To whom should I teach the Dhamma first
Who will quickly understand this Dhamma' Then the thought occurred to me 'They were very helpful to me the group of five monks who attended to me when I was resolute in exertion
What if I were to teach them the Dhamma first' Then the thought occurred to me 'Where are the group of five monks staying now' And with the divine eye purified  surpassing the human I saw that they were staying near Varanasi in the Deer Park at Isipatana
Then having stayed at Uruvela as long as I liked I set out to wander by stages to Varanasi
Upaka the Ajivaka saw me on the road between Gaya and the Awakening and on seeing me said to me 'Clear my friend are your faculties
Pure your complexion and bright
On whose account have you gone forth
Who is your teacher
In whose Dhamma do you delight'
When this was said I replied to Upaka the Ajivaka in verses
'From your claims my friend you must be an infinite conqueror'
When this was said Upaka said 'May it be so my friend' and  shaking his head taking a sideroad  he left
Then wandering by stages I arrived at Varanasi at the Deer Park in Isipatana to where the group of five monks were staying
From afar they saw me coming and on seeing me made a pact with one another 'Friends here comes Gotama the contemplative living luxuriously straying from his exertion backsliding into abundance
He doesn't deserve to be bowed down to to be greeted by standing up or to have his robe  bowl received
Still a seat should be set out if he wants to he can sit down' But as I approached they were unable to keep to their pact
One standing up to greet me received my robe  bowl
Another spread out a seat
Another set out water for washing my feet
However they addressed me by name and as 'friend'
So I said to them 'Don't address the Tathagata by name and as friend The Tathagata friends is a worthy one rightly selfawakened
Lend ear friends the Deathless has been attained
I will instruct you
I will teach you the Dhamma
Practicing as instructed you will in no long time reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for yourselves in the here  now'
When this was said the group of five monks replied to me 'By that practice that conduct that performance of austerities you did not attain any superior human states any distinction in knowledge  vision worthy of a noble one
So how can you now  living luxuriously straying from your exertion backsliding into abundance  have attained any superior human states any distinction in knowledge  vision worthy of a noble one'
When this was said I replied to them 'The Tathagata monks is not living luxuriously has not strayed from his exertion has not backslid into abundance
The Tathagata friends is a worthy one rightly selfawakened
Lend ear friends the Deathless has been attained
I will instruct you
I will teach you the Dhamma
Practicing as instructed you will in no long time reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for yourselves in the here  now'
A second time A third time the group of five monks said to me 'By that practice that conduct that performance of austerities you did not attain any superior human states any distinction in knowledge  vision worthy of a noble one
So how can you now  living luxuriously straying from your exertion backsliding into abundance  have attained any superior human states any distinction in knowledge  vision worthy of a noble one'
When this was said I replied to the group of five monks 'Do you recall my ever having spoken in this way before'
'No lord'
'The Tathagata monks is not living luxuriously has not strayed from his exertion has not backslid into abundance
The Tathagata friends is a worthy one rightly selfawakened
Lend ear friends the Deathless has been attained
I will instruct you
I will teach you the Dhamma
Practicing as instructed you will in no long time reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for yourselves in the here  now'
And so I was able to convince them
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Varanasi in the Game Refuge at Isipatana
There he addressed the group of five monks
There are these two extremes that are not to be indulged in by one who has gone forth
Which two
That which is devoted to sensual pleasure with reference to sensual objects base vulgar common ignoble unprofitable and that which is devoted to selfaffliction painful ignoble unprofitable
Avoiding both of these extremes the middle way realized by the Tathagata  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
And what is the middle way realized by the Tathagata that  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
Precisely this Noble Eightfold Path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
This is the middle way realized by the Tathagata that  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
Now this monks is the noble truth of stress Birth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are stressful association with the unbeloved is stressful separation from the loved is stressful not getting what is wanted is stressful
In short the five clingingaggregates are stressful
And this monks is the noble truth of the origination of stress the craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion  delight relishing now here  now there  ie craving for sensual pleasure craving for becoming craving for nonbecoming
And this monks is the noble truth of the cessation of stress the remainderless fading  cessation renunciation relinquishment release  letting go of that very craving
And this monks is the noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress precisely this Noble Eightfold Path  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
Vision arose insight arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before 'This is the noble truth of stress' 'This noble truth of stress is to be comprehended' 'This noble truth of stress has been comprehended'
Vision arose insight arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before 'This is the noble truth of the origination of stress' 'This noble truth of the origination of stress is to be abandoned' 'This noble truth of the origination of stress has been abandoned'
Vision arose insight arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before 'This is the noble truth of the cessation of stress' 'This noble truth of the cessation of stress is to be directly experienced' 'This noble truth of the cessation of stress has been directly experienced'
Vision arose insight arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before 'This is the noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress' 'This noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress is to be developed' 'This noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress has been developed'
And monks as long as this knowledge  vision of mine  with its three rounds  twelve permutations concerning these four noble truths as they actually are present  was not pure I did not claim to have directly awakened to the right selfawakening unexcelled in the cosmos with its devas Maras  Brahmas with its contemplatives  brahmans its royalty  commonfolk
But as soon as this knowledge  vision of mine  with its three rounds  twelve permutations concerning these four noble truths as they actually are present  was truly pure then I did claim to have directly awakened to the right selfawakening unexcelled in the cosmos with its devas Maras  Brahmas with its contemplatives  brahmans its royalty  commonfolk
Knowledge  vision arose in me 'Unprovoked is my release
This is the last birth
There is now no further becoming' That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the group of five monks delighted at his words
And while this explanation was being given there arose to Ven
Kondañña the dustless stainless Dhamma eye Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation
And when the Blessed One had set the Wheel of Dhamma in motion the earth devas cried out At Varanasi in the Game Refuge at Isipatana the Blessed One has set in motion the unexcelled Wheel of Dhamma that cannot be stopped by brahman or contemplative deva Mara or God or anyone in the cosmos On hearing the earth devas' cry the devas of the Four Kings' Heaven took up the cry the devas of the Thirtythree the Yama devas the Tusita devas the Nimmanarati devas the Paranimmitavasavatti devas the devas of Brahma's retinue took up the cry At Varanasi in the Game Refuge at Isipatana the Blessed One has set in motion the unexcelled Wheel of Dhamma that cannot be stopped by brahman or contemplative devas Mara or God or anyone at all in the cosmos
So in that moment that instant the cry shot right up to the Brahma worlds
And this tenthousand fold cosmos shivered  quivered  quaked while a great measureless radiance appeared in the cosmos surpassing the effulgence of the devas
Then the Blessed One exclaimed So you really know Kondañña
So you really know And that is how Ven
Kondañña acquired the name AññaKondañña  Kondañña who knows
Thus monks any body whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every body is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Any feeling whatsoever
Any perception whatsoever
Any fabrications whatsoever
Any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Seeing thus the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with the body disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness
Disenchanted he becomes dispassionate
Through dispassion he is fully released
With full release there is the knowledge 'Fully released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world' That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the group of five monks delighted at his words
And while this explanation was being given the hearts of the group of five monks through not clinging were fully released from fermentationeffluents
So what difference what distinction what distinguishing factor is there between one rightly selfawakened and a monk discernmentreleased
For us lord the teachings have the Blessed One as their root their guide  their arbitrator
It would be good if the Blessed One himself would explicate the meaning of this statement
Having heard it from the Blessed One the monks will remember it
In that case monks listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said The Tathagata  the worthy one the rightly selfawakened one  is the one who gives rise to the path unarisen who engenders the path unengendered who points out the path not pointed out
He knows the path is expert in the path is adept at the path
And his disciples now keep following the path and afterwards become endowed with the path
This is the difference this the distinction this the distinguishing between one rightly selfawakened and a monk discernmentreleased
And how is a monk one with a sense of social gatherings
There is the case where a monk knows his social gathering 'This is a social gathering of noble warriors this a social gathering of brahmans this a social gathering of householders this a social gathering of contemplatives here one should approach them in this way stand in this way act in this way sit in this way speak in this way stay silent in this way' If he didn't know his social gathering  'This is a social gathering of noble warriors this a social gathering of brahmans this a social gathering of householders this a social gathering of contemplatives here one should approach them in this way stand in this way act in this way sit in this way speak in this way stay silent in this way'  he wouldn't be said to be one with a sense of social gatherings
So it's because he does know his social gathering  'This is a social gathering of noble warriors this a social gathering of brahmans this a social gathering of householders this a social gathering of contemplatives here one should approach them in this way stand in this way act in this way sit in this way speak in this way stay silent in this way'  that he is said to be one with a sense of social gatherings
This is one with a sense of Dhamma a sense of meaning a sense of himself a sense of moderation a sense of time  a sense of social gatherings
And what is the treasure of generosity
There is the case of a disciple of the noble ones his awareness cleansed of the stain of stinginess living at home freely generous openhanded delighting in being magnanimous responsive to requests delighting in the distribution of alms
This is called the treasure of generosity
And what is the treasure of virtue
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones abstains from taking life abstains from stealing abstains from illicit sexual conduct abstains from lying abstains from taking intoxicants that cause heedlessness
This monks is called the treasure of virtue
There is the case where a person being subject himself to aging realizing the drawbacks of what is subject to aging seeks the unaging unsurpassed rest from the yoke Unbinding
Being subject himself to illness realizing the drawbacks of what is subject to illness he seeks the unailing unsurpassed rest from the yoke Unbinding
Being subject himself to death realizing the drawbacks of what is subject to death he seeks the undying unsurpassed rest from the yoke Unbinding
Being subject himself to defilement realizing the drawbacks of what is subject to defilement he seeks the undefiled unsurpassed rest from the yoke Unbinding
Having seen the drawback of sensual pleasures I pursued that theme having understood the reward of renunciation I familiarized myself with it
My heart leaped up at renunciation grew confident steadfast  firm seeing it as peace
Then quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities I entered  remained in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
Bhikkhus it is through not realizing through not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that this long course of birth and death has been passed through and undergone by me as well as by you
What are these four
They are the noble truth of Dukkha the noble truth of the origin of Dukkha the noble truth of the cessation of Dukkha and the noble truth of the way to the cessation of Dukkha
But now bhikkhus that these have been realized and penetrated cut off is the craving for existence destroyed is that which leads to renewed becoming and there is no fresh becoming
There is that dimension where there is neither earth nor water nor fire nor wind neither dimension of the infinitude of space nor dimension of the infinitude of consciousness nor dimension of nothingness nor dimension of neither perception nor nonperception neither this world nor the next world nor sun nor moon
And there I say there is neither coming nor going nor stasis neither passing away nor arising without stance without foundation without support
This just this is the end of stress
Both formerly  now it is only stress that I describe and the cessation of stress
As he was sitting there said to Ven
Ananda Master Ananda is there any one monk endowed in each  every way with the qualities with which Master Gotama  worthy  rightly selfawakened  was endowed
No brahman there isn't any one monk endowed in each  every way with the qualities with which the Blessed One  worthy  rightly selfawakened  was endowed
For the Blessed One was the arouser of the unarisen path the begetter of the unbegotten path the expounder of the unexpounded path the knower of the path the expert with regard to the path adept at the path
And now his disciples follow the path and become endowed with it after him
A monk called Gotama it seems a son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan has been wandering in the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus and has come to Sala
Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect 'That Blessed One is such since he is arahant and Fully Enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable teacher of men to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessed
He describes this world with its gods its Maras and its Divinities this generation with its monks and brahmans with its kings and its people which he has himself realized through direct knowledge
He teaches a Dhamma that is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with meaning and phrasing he affirms a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure' Now it is good to see such arahants
I recall having approached many hundred assemblies of nobles many hundred assemblies of brahmans many hundred assemblies of householders many hundred assemblies of recluses
At one time the Lord was staying near Savatthi in the Jeta Grove at Anathapindika's monastery
Now the layfollower Dhammika with other layfollowers approached the Lord
Having drawn near and having saluted the Lord respectfully he sat down at one side
Sitting there the layfollower Dhammika addressed the Lord
Dighajanu the Koliyan went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One We are lay people enjoying sensuality living crowded with spouses  children using Kasi fabrics  sandalwood wearing garlands scents  creams handling gold  silver
May the Blessed One teach the Dhamma for those like us for our happiness  wellbeing in this life for our happiness  wellbeing in lives to come
There are these four qualities TigerPaw that lead to a lay person's happiness and wellbeing in this life
Which four
Being consummate in initiative being consummate in vigilance admirable friendship and maintaining one's livelihood in tune
And what does it mean to be consummate in initiative
There is the case where a lay person by whatever occupation he makes his living  whether by farming or trading or cattle tending or archery or as a king's man or by any other craft  is clever and untiring at it endowed with discrimination in its techniques enough to arrange and carry it out
This is called being consummate in initiative
And what does it mean to be consummate in vigilance
There is the case when a lay person has righteous wealth  righteously gained coming from his initiative his striving his making an effort gathered by the strength of his arm earned by his sweat  he manages to protect it through vigilance 'How shall neither kings nor thieves make off with this property of mine nor fire burn it nor water sweep it away nor hateful heirs make off with it' This is called being consummate in vigilance
And what is meant by admirable friendship
There is the case where a lay person in whatever town or village he may dwell spends time with householders or householders' sons young or old who are advanced in virtue
He talks with them engages them in discussions
He emulates consummate conviction in those who are consummate in conviction consummate virtue in those who are consummate in virtue consummate generosity in those who are consummate in generosity and consummate discernment in those who are consummate in discernment
This is called admirable friendship
And what does it mean to maintain one's livelihood in tune
There is the case where a lay person knowing the income and outflow of his wealth maintains a livelihood in tune neither a spendthrift nor a pennypincher 'Thus will my income exceed my outflow and my outflow will not exceed my income' Just as when a weigher or his apprentice when holding the scales knows 'It has tipped down so much or has tipped up so much' in the same way the lay person knowing the income and outflow of his wealth maintains a livelihood in tune neither a spendthrift nor a pennypincher 'Thus will my income exceed my outflow and my outflow will not exceed my income' If a lay person has a small income but maintains a grand livelihood it will be rumored of him 'This clansman devours his wealth like a fruittree eater' If a lay person has a large income but maintains a miserable livelihood it will be rumored of him 'This clansman will die of starvation' But when a lay person knowing the income and outflow of his wealth maintains a livelihood in tune neither a spendthrift nor a pennypincher 'Thus will my income exceed my outflow and my outflow will not exceed my income' this is called maintaining one's livelihood in tune
These are the four drains on one's store of wealth debauchery in sex debauchery in drink debauchery in gambling and evil friendship evil companionship evil camaraderie
Just as if there were a great reservoir with four inlets and four drains and a man were to close the inlets and open the drains and the sky were not to pour down proper showers the depletion of that great reservoir could be expected not its increase
In the same way these are the four drains on one's store of wealth debauchery in sex debauchery in drink debauchery in gambling and evil friendship evil companionship evil camaraderie
These are the four inlets to one's store of wealth no debauchery in sex no debauchery in drink no debauchery in gambling and admirable friendship admirable companionship admirable camaraderie
Just as if there were a great reservoir with four inlets and four drains and a man were to open the inlets and close the drains and the sky were to pour down proper showers the increase of that great reservoir could be expected not its depletion
In the same way these are the four inlets to one's store of wealth no debauchery in sex no debauchery in drink no debauchery in gambling and admirable friendship admirable companionship admirable camaraderie
These TigerPaw are the four qualities that lead to a lay person's happiness and wellbeing in this life
There are these four qualities that lead to a lay person's happiness and wellbeing in lives to come
Which four
Being consummate in conviction being consummate in virtue being consummate in generosity being consummate in discernment
And what does it mean to be consummate in conviction
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones has conviction is convinced of the Tathagata's Awakening 'Indeed the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge and conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine and human beings awakened blessed' This is called being consummate in conviction
And what does it mean to be consummate in virtue
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones abstains from taking life abstains from stealing abstains from illicit sexual conduct abstains from lying abstains from taking intoxicants that cause heedlessness
This is called being consummate in virtue
And what does it mean to be consummate in generosity
There is the case of a disciple of the noble ones his awareness cleansed of the stain of miserliness living at home freely generous openhanded delighting in being magnanimous responsive to requests delighting in the distribution of alms
This is called being consummate in generosity
And what does it mean to be consummate in discernment
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones is discerning endowed with discernment of arising and passing away  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress
This is called being consummate in discernment
These TigerPaw are the four qualities that lead to a lay person's happiness and wellbeing in lives to come
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Great Wood together with a large Sangha of approximately bhikkhus all of them arahants
Then the Blessed One having encompassed the awareness of the entire assembly with his awareness asked himself Now who here is capable of understanding the Dhamma He saw Suppabuddha the leper sitting in the assembly and on seeing him the thought occurred to him This person here is capable of understanding the Dhamma So aiming at Suppabuddha the leper he gave a stepbystep talk ie a talk on generosity on virtue on heaven he declared the drawbacks degradation  corruption of sensual passions and the rewards of renunciation
Then when he saw that Suppabuddha the leper's mind was ready malleable free from hindrances elated  bright he then gave the Dhammatalk peculiar to Awakened Ones ie stress origination cessation  path
And just as a clean cloth free of stains would properly absorb a dye in the same way as Suppabuddha the leper was sitting in that very seat the dustless stainless Dhamma eye arose within him Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation
Then King Pasenadi Kosala approached the Blessed One in the middle of the day and on arrival having bowed down sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Well now great king where are you coming from in the middle of the day
Just now lord I was engaged in the sort of royal affairs typical of headanointed noblewarrior kings intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures who have attained stable control in their country and who rule having conquered a great sphere of territory on earth
What do you think great king
Suppose a man trustworthy and reliable were to come to you from the east and on arrival would say 'If it please your majesty you should know that I come from the east
There I saw a great mountain as high as the clouds coming this way crushing all living beings
Do whatever you think should be done' Then a second man were to come to you from the west Then a third man were to come to you from the north Then a fourth man were to come to you from the south and on arrival would say 'If it please your majesty you should know that I come from the south
There I saw a great mountain as high as the clouds coming this way crushing all living beings
Do whatever you think should be done' If your majesty such a great peril should arise such a terrible destruction of human life  the human state being so hard to obtain  what should be done
If lord such a great peril should arise such a terrible destruction of human life  the human state being so hard to obtain  what else should be done but Dhammaconduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deeds
I inform you great king I announce to you great king aging and death are rolling in on you
When aging and death are rolling in on you great king what should be done
As aging and death are rolling in on me lord what else should be done but Dhammaconduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deeds
So it is great king
So it is great king
As aging and death are rolling in on you what else should be done but Dhammaconduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deeds
Then Punna a son of the Koliyans and an oxduty ascetic and also Seniya a naked dog duty ascetic went to the Blessed One and Punna the ox duty ascetic paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side while Seniya the naked dogduty ascetic exchanged greetings with the Blessed One and when the courteous and amiable talk was finished he too sat down at one side curled up like a dog
When Punna the oxduty ascetic sat down he asked the Blessed One Venerable sir this naked dogduty ascetic Seniya does what is hard to do he eats his food when it is thrown on the ground
That dog duty has long been taken up and practiced by him
What will be his destination
What will be his future course
Enough Punna let that be
Do not ask me that
A second time A third time Punna the oxduty ascetic asked the Blessed One Venerable sir this naked dogduty ascetic Seniya does what is hard to do he eats his food when it is thrown on the ground
That dog duty has long been taken up and practiced by him
What will be his destination
What will be his future course
Well Punna since I certainly cannot persuade you when I say 'Enough Punna let that be
Do not ask me that' I shall therefore answer you
Here Punna someone develops the dog duty fully and unstintingly he develops the doghabit fully and unstintingly he develops the dog mind fully and unstintingly he develops dog behavior fully and unstintingly
Having done that on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the company of dogs
But if his view is such as this 'By this virtue or duty or asceticism or religious life I shall become a god or some god' that is wrong view in his case
Now there are two destinations for one with wrong view I say hell or the animal womb
So Punna if his dog duty is perfected it will lead him to the company of dogs if it is not it will lead him to hell
many hundred assemblies of gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings many hundred assemblies of gods of the heaven of the Thirtythree many hundred assemblies of Mara's retinue many hundred assemblies of Brahmas
And formerly I had sat with them there and talked with them and held conversations with them
Renouncing the five pleasures of sense that entrance and delight the mind and in faith departing from home become one who makes an end of suffering
Associate with good friends and choose a remote lodging secluded with little noise
Be moderate in eating
Robes almsfood remedies and a dwelling  do not have craving for these things do not be one who returns to the world
Practice restraint according to the Discipline and control the five sensefaculties
Practice mindfulness of the body and continually develop dispassion
Avoid the sign of the beautiful connected with passion by meditating on the foul cultivate a mind that is concentrated and collected
Meditate on the Signless and get rid of the tendency to conceit
By thoroughly understanding and destroying conceit you will live in the peace
In this manner the Lord repeatedly exhorted the Venerable Rahula
I have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying at Vesali in the Peaked Roof Hall in the Great Forest
Then Mahapajapati Gotami went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him stood to one side
As she was standing there she said to him It would be good venerable sir if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief such that having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One I might dwell alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute
Gotami the qualities of which you may know 'These qualities lead to passion not to dispassion to being fettered not to being unfettered to accumulating not to shedding to selfaggrandizement not to modesty to discontent not to contentment to entanglement not to seclusion to laziness not to aroused persistence to being burdensome not to being unburdensome' You may categorically hold 'This is not the Dhamma this is not the Vinaya this is not the Teacher's instruction'
As for the qualities of which you may know 'These qualities lead to dispassion not to passion to being unfettered not to being fettered to shedding not to accumulating to modesty not to selfaggrandizement to contentment not to discontent to seclusion not to entanglement to aroused persistence not to laziness to being unburdensome not to being burdensome' You may categorically hold 'This is the Dhamma this is the Vinaya this is the Teacher's instruction' That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Mahapajapati Gotami delighted at his words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Now at that time Ven
Nanda  the Blessed One's brother son of his maternal aunt  told a large number of monks I don't enjoy leading the holy life my friends
I can't endure the holy life
Giving up the training I will return to the common life
Then a certain monk went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he told the Blessed One Lord Ven
Nanda  the Blessed One's brother son of his maternal aunt  has told a large number of monks 'I don't enjoy leading the holy life my friends
I can't endure the holy life
Giving up the training I will return to the common life' Then the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monk
In my name call Nanda saying 'The Teacher calls you my friend' As you say lord the monk answered and having gone to Ven
Nanda on arrival he said The Teacher calls you my friend
As you say my friend Ven
Nanda replied
Then he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Nanda that you have told a large number of monks 'I don't enjoy leading the holy life my friends
I can't endure the holy life
Giving up the training I will return to the common life'
Yes lord
But why Nanda don't you enjoy leading the holy life
Lord as I was leaving home a Sakyan girl  the envy of the countryside  glanced up at me with her hair halfcombed and said 'Hurry back master' Recollecting that I don't enjoy leading the holy life
I can't endure the holy life
Giving up the training I will return to the common life
Then taking Ven
Nanda by the arm  as a strong man might flex his extended arm or extend his flexed arm  the Blessed One disappeared from Jeta's Grove and reappeared among the devas of the Tavatimsa Heaven
Now at that time about dovefooted nymphs had come to wait upon Sakka the ruler of the devas
And the Blessed One said to Ven
Nanda Nanda do you see those dovefooted nymphs
Yes lord
What do you think Nanda Which is lovelier better looking more charming  the Sakyan girl the envy of the countryside or these dovefooted nymphs
Lord compared to these dovefooted nymphs the Sakyan girl the envy of the countryside is like a cauterized monkey with its ears and nose cut off
She doesn't count
She's not even a small fraction
There's no comparison
The dovefooted nymphs are lovelier better looking more charming
Then take joy Nanda
Take joy
I am your guarantee for getting dovefooted nymphs
If the Blessed One is my guarantee for getting dovefooted nymphs I will enjoy leading the holy life under the Blessed One
Then taking Ven
Nanda by the arm  as a strong man might flex his extended arm or extend his flexed arm  the Blessed One disappeared from among the devas of the Tavatimsa Heaven and reappeared in Jeta's Grove
The monks heard They say that Ven
Nanda  the Blessed One's brother son of his maternal aunt  is leading the holy life for the sake of nymphs
They say that the Blessed One is his guarantee for getting dovefooted nymphs
Then the monks who were friends of Ven
Nanda went around addressing him as they would a hired hand and a dealer Our friend Nanda they say is a hired hand
Our friend Nanda they say is a dealer
He's leading the holy life for the sake of nymphs
The Blessed One is his guarantee for getting dovefooted nymphs
Then Ven
Nanda  humiliated ashamed and disgusted that the monks who were his friends were addressing him as they would a hired hand and a dealer  went to dwell alone secluded heedful ardent and resolute
He in no long time entered and remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing and realizing it for himself in the here and now
He knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus Ven
Nanda became another one of the arahants
Now on that occasion the Blessed One on emerging from seclusion in the late afternoon sat warming his back in the western sun
Then Ven
Ananda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One massaged the Blessed One's limbs with his hand and said It's amazing lord
It's astounding how the Blessed One's complexion is no longer so clear  bright his limbs are flabby  wrinkled his back bent forward there's a discernible change in his faculties  the faculty of the eye the faculty of the ear the faculty of the nose the faculty of the tongue the faculty of the body
That's the way it is Ananda
When young one is subject to aging when healthy subject to illness when alive subject to death
The complexion is no longer so clear  bright the limbs are flabby  wrinkled the back bent forward there's a discernible change in the faculties  the faculty of the eye the faculty of the ear the faculty of the nose the faculty of the tongue the faculty of the body
Now I am frail Ananda old aged far gone in years
This is my eightieth year and my life is spent
Even as an old cart Ananda is held together with much difficulty so the body of the Tathagata is kept going only with supports
It is Ananda only when the Tathagata disregarding external objects with the cessation of certain feelings attains to and abides in the signless concentration of mind that his body is more comfortable
Therefore Ananda be islands unto yourselves refuges unto yourselves seeking no external refuge with the Dhamma as your island the Dhamma as your refuge seeking no other refuge
And how Ananda is a bhikkhu an island unto himself a refuge unto himself seeking no external refuge with the Dhamma as his island the Dhamma as his refuge seeking no other refuge
When he dwells contemplating the body in the body earnestly clearly comprehending and mindfully after having overcome desire and sorrow in regard to the world when he dwells contemplating feelings in feelings the mind in the mind and mental objects in mental objects earnestly clearly comprehending and mindfully after having overcome desire and sorrow in regard to the world then truly he is an island unto himself a refuge unto himself seeking no external refuge having the Dhamma as his island the Dhamma as his refuge seeking no other refuge
Today Ananda at the Capala shrine Mara the Evil One approached me saying 'Now O Lord bhikkhus and bhikkhunis laymen and laywomen have come to be true disciples of the Blessed One  wise well disciplined apt and learned preservers of the Dhamma living according to the Dhamma abiding in the appropriate conduct and having learned the Master's word are able to expound it preach it proclaim it establish it reveal it explain it in detail and make it clear and when adverse opinions arise they are now able to refute them thoroughly and well and to preach this convincing and liberating Dhamma
'And now O Lord this holy life taught by the Blessed One has become successful prosperous farrenowned popular and widespread and it is well proclaimed among gods and men
Therefore O Lord let the Blessed One come to his final passing away
Let the Happy One utterly pass away
The time has come for the Parinibbana of the Lord'
And then Ananda I answered Mara the Evil One saying 'Do not trouble yourself Evil One
Before long the Parinibbana of the Tathagata will come about
Three months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass away'
And in this way Ananda today at the Capala shrine the Tathagata has renounced his will to live on
At these words the Venerable Ananda spoke to the Blessed One saying May the Blessed One remain O Lord
May the Happy One remain O Lord throughout the worldperiod for the welfare and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit well being and happiness of gods and men
And the Blessed One answered saying Enough Ananda
Do not entreat the Tathagata for the time is past Ananda for such an entreaty
Now O bhikkhus I say to you that these teachings of which I have direct knowledge and which I have made known to you  these you should thoroughly learn cultivate develop and frequently practice that the life of purity may be established and may long endure for the welfare and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit well being and happiness of gods and men
And what bhikkhus are these teachings
They are the four foundations of mindfulness the four right efforts the four constituents of psychic power the five faculties the five powers the seven factors of enlightenment and the Noble Eightfold Path
These bhikkhus are the teachings of which I have direct knowledge which I have made known to you and which you should thoroughly learn cultivate develop and frequently practice that the life of purity may be established and may long endure for the welfare and happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the benefit well being and happiness of gods and men
Then the Blessed One said to the bhikkhus So bhikkhus I exhort you All compounded things are subject to vanish
Strive with earnestness
The time of the Tathagata's Parinibbana is near
Three months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass away
And soon after the Blessed One had eaten the meal provided by Cunda the metalworker a dire sickness fell upon him even dysentery and he suffered sharp and deadly pains
But the Blessed One endured them mindfully clearly comprehending and unperturbed
Then the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying Come Ananda let us go to Kusinara And the Venerable Ananda answered So be it Lord
Then the Blessed One with a large community of monks went to the far shore of the Hiraññavati River and headed for Upavattana the Mallans' salgrove near Kusinara
On arrival he said to Ven
Ananda Ananda please prepare a bed for me between the twin saltrees with its head to the north
I am tired and will lie down
Responding As you say lord Ven
Ananda prepared a bed between the twin saltrees with its head to the north
Then the Blessed One lay down on his right side in the lion's sleeping posture with one foot on top of the other mindful  alert
Now at that time the twin saltrees were in full bloom even though it was not the time for flowering
They showered strewed  sprinkled on the Tathagata's body in homage to him
Heavenly coraltree blossoms fell from the sky showering strewing  sprinkling the Tathagata's body in homage to him
Heavenly sandalwood powder fell from the sky showering strewing  sprinkling the Tathagata's body in homage to him
Heavenly music was playing in the sky in homage to the Tathagata
Heavenly songs were sung in the sky in homage to the Tathagata
Ananda there are these four places that merit being seen by a clansman with conviction that merit his feelings of urgency  dismay
Which four
'Here the Tathagata was born' is a place that merits being seen by a clansman with conviction that merits his feelings of urgency  dismay
'Here the Tathagata awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening' 'Here the Tathagata set rolling the unexcelled wheel of Dhamma' 'Here the Tathagata was totally unbound in the remainderless property of Unbinding' is a place that merits being seen by a clansman with conviction that merits his feelings of urgency  dismay
These are the four places that merit being seen by a clansman with conviction that merit his feelings of urgency  dismay
They will come out of conviction Ananda  monks nuns male lay followers  female lay followers  to the spots where 'Here the Tathagata was born' 'Here the Tathagata awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening' 'Here the Tathagata set rolling the unexcelled wheel of Dhamma' 'Here the Tathagata was totally unbound in the remainderless property of Unbinding' And anyone who dies while making a pilgrimage to these memorials with a bright confident mind will  on the breakup of the body after death  reappear in a good destination the heavenly world
Now at that time the Kusinara Mallans had met for some business in their assembly hall
Ven
Ananda went to the assembly hall and on arrival announced to them Tonight Vasitthas in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of the Tathagata will occur
Come out Vasitthas
Come out Vasitthas
Don't later regret that 'The Tathagata's total Unbinding occurred within the borders of our very own town but we didn't get to see him in his final hour' When they heard Ven
Ananda the Mallans together with their sons daughters  wives were shocked saddened their minds overflowing with sorrow
Some of them wept tearing at their hair they wept uplifting their arms
As if their feet were cut out from under them they fell down and rolled back  forth crying All too soon the Blessed One will be totally unbound
All too soon the One Wellgone will be totally unbound
All too soon the One with Eyes will disappear from the world
Then the Mallans together with their sons daughters  wives  shocked saddened their minds overflowing with sorrow  went to Ven
Ananda at Upavattana the Mallans' salgrove near Kusinara
In any doctrine  discipline where the noble eightfold path is not found no contemplative of the first second third fourth order is found
But in any doctrine  discipline where the noble eightfold path is found contemplatives of the first second third fourth order are found
The noble eightfold path is found in this doctrine  discipline and right here there are contemplatives of the first second third fourth order
Other teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplatives
And if the monks dwell rightly this world will not be empty of arahants
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks Now then monks I exhort you All fabrications are subject to decay
Bring about completion by being heedful Those were the Tathagata's last words
Then the Blessed One entered the first jhana
Emerging from that he entered the second jhana
Emerging from that he entered the third the fourth jhana the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
Emerging from that he entered the cessation of perception  feeling
Then the Blessed One emerging from the cessation of perception  feeling entered the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
Emerging from that he entered the dimension of nothingness the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of the infinitude of space the fourth jhana the third the second the first jhana
Emerging from the first jhana he entered the second the third the fourth jhana
Emerging from the fourth jhana he immediately was totally Unbound
Here are a few of the many epithets that appear in the suttas in reference to the Buddha
The indicated sutta passages contain examples
I tell you the ending of the mental fermentations depends on the first jhana the second jhana the third the fourth the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness
I tell you the ending of the mental fermentations depends on the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
'I tell you the ending of the mental fermentations depends on the first jhana' Thus it has been said
In reference to what was it said
There is the case where a monk secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perception fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness notself
He turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness 'This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding'
Suppose that an archer or archer's apprentice were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay so that after a while he would become able to shoot long distances to fire accurate shots in rapid succession and to pierce great masses
In the same way there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perception fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness notself
He turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness 'This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding'
Staying right there he reaches the ending of the mental fermentations
Or if not then  through this very dhammapassion this very dhammadelight and from the total wasting away of the first five of the fetters  he is due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that world
'I tell you the ending of the mental fermentations depends on the first jhana' Thus was it said and in reference to this was it said
'I tell you the ending of the mental fermentations depends on the dimension of the infinitude of space' Thus it has been said
In reference to what was it said
There is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity 'Infinite space' enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space
He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with feeling perception fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness notself
He turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness 'This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding'
Suppose that an archer or archer's apprentice were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay so that after a while he would become able to shoot long distances to fire accurate shots in rapid succession and to pierce great masses

'I tell you the ending of the mental fermentations depends on the dimension of the infinitude of space' Thus was it said and in reference to this was it said
Thus as far as the perceptionattainments go that is as far as gnosispenetration goes
As for these two dimensions  the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception  the attainment of the cessation of feeling  perception  I tell you that they are to be rightly explained by those monks who are meditators skilled in attaining skilled in attaining  emerging who have attained  emerged in dependence on them
The King Pasenadi of Kosala dined off a tubful of rice
Then the King replete and puffing went to see the Blessed One saluted him and sat down to one side
And the Blessed One observing how he was replete and puffing at once uttered this verse
Now just then Prince Sudassana was standing behind the king
And the king said to him
Come my dear Sudassana learn this verse from the Blessed One and recite it to me when you bring me my dinner and I will arrange for you to be paid a daily allowance of a hundred pence in perpetuity
Very well Your Majesty said Sudassana 
After that the king made it a rule to eat no more than a quarter of a tubful of rice
Thus it came about that on a later occasion King Pasenadi his body in good shape stroked his healthy limbs and fervently exclaimed Truly the Blessed One has doubly shown compassion for my welfare both in this life and in the life to come
Once when the Buddha was living at Savatthi King Pasenadi of Kosala ate a whole bucketful of food and then approached the Buddha engorged and panting and sat down to one side
The Buddha discerning that King Pasenadi was engorged and panting took the occasion to utter this verse
Now at that time the brahman youth Sudassana was standing nearby and King Pasenadi of Kosala addressed him Come now my dear Sudassana and having thoroughly mastered this verse in the presence of the Buddha recite it whenever food is brought to me
And I will set up for you a permanent offering of a hundred kahaapanas every day So be it your majesty the brahman youth Sudassana replied to the king
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala gradually settled down to no more than a cupfull of rice
At a later time when his body had become quite slim King Pasenadi stroked his limbs with his hand and took the occasion to utter this utterance
Who would have thought weightloss could be so easy
In this brief exchange the Buddha is suggesting that overeating is the root of obesity which hastens the aging process and threatens one's life and that this only occurs when mindfulness is weak or absent
If we eat slowly and with a great deal of attention it can more easily become apparent when an adequate amount of food has been consumed
Interestingly he seems to be saying that wisdom will provide what is needed to refrain from further eating rather than the modern conventional view that it requires willpower or self restraint
Always one to play on words the Buddha says that all our afflictions and not just our bodies will become more slender Perhaps this is what Pasenadi is referring to when he says the Buddha's teaching has not only helped him slim down his body but the general increase of mindfulness and diminishing of greed will help with all aspects of the spiritual life
The commentary to this text informs us that the king did not engage Sudassana to utter the verse throughout the entire meal but only once he had started eating
The idea is not to cultivate an aversion to food for food itself is not an evil
As with so much else in the Buddha's teaching it is a matter of understanding cause and effect and of using food skillfully as a tool for awakening rather than allowing oneself to be caught by the latent tendencies of attachment aversion and confusion that might be evoked by our relationship to food
Notice the language of the last line of the Buddha's verse
The word for life is the same one as in the Indian medical tradition of Ayurveda and is regarded as something that can be squandered or carefully guarded
When approached with care the preservation of life also slows down the aging process
The image is not one of conquering illness or death but of treating the precious resource of one's own vitality with wisdom
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Kosalans in a certain forest thicket
Now at that time the brahman Navakammika Bharadvaja was getting some work done in that forest thicket
He saw the Blessed One sitting under a sala tree  his legs folded crosswise his body held erect with mindfulness set to the fore
On seeing him the thought occurred to the brahman Here I am taking delight in getting work done in this forest thicket
But what does this contemplative take delight in getting done
So he went to the Blessed One and on arrival recited this verse
When this was said the brahman Navakammika Bharadvaja said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to point out the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monks
May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for life
See also Sn Thig
As you see friends my body has become as if drugged I have lost my bearings the teachings are not clear to me my heart is beset with sloth and torpor I take no pleasure in the holy life and I have doubts about the teachings
Suppose Tissa there are two men one of whom does not know his way and the other does
And the man who does not know his way asks the other to direct him
He replies 'Yes friend this is the way
Go on for a while and you will see that the road forks
Don't go to the left but take the righthanded path
Go on for a while and you will see a dense jungle
Keep going and you will see a great sunken swamp
Keep going and you will see a steep precipice
Go a bit further and you will see a delightful stretch of level ground'
I have made this parable Tissa to help you to understand
This is the explanation
'The man who does not know his way' denotes the worldling
'The man who knows the way' is the Tathaagata the Arahant the Fully Selfenlightened One
'The roadfork' is the state of wavering
'The lefthand path' is the false eightfold path that is wrong view wrong concentration
'The righthand path' is the Noble Eightfold Path that is Right View Right Concentration
'The dense jungle' means ignorance 'the great sunken swamp' denotes sensedesires 'the steep precipice' denotes anger and despair 'the delightful stretch of level ground' Tissa denotes Nibbaana
Cheer up Tissa cheer up
I am here to advise you help you and teach you
So said the Blessed One and the Venerable Tissa was cheered by his words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Kosambi at Ghosita's monastery
Then in the early morning having put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe he went into Kosambi for alms
Having gone for alms in Kosambi after the meal returning from his alms round he set his own lodging in order and  without calling his attendant or informing the community of monks  set out wandering alone  without a companion
Then not long after the Blessed One had left a certain monk went to Ven
Ananda and on arrival said to him Just now my friend Ananda the Blessed One set his own lodging in order and  without calling his attendant or informing the community of monks  set out wandering alone  without a companion
Whenever the Blessed One sets his own lodging in order and  without calling his attendant or informing the community of monks  sets out wandering alone  without a companion he wants to live alone
He is not to be followed by anyone at such times
Then after wandering by stages the Blessed One came to Parileyyaka
There he stayed at the root of the Auspicious Sal Tree
Then a large number of monks went to Ven
Ananda and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings
After an exchange of friendly courtesies  greetings they sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to Ven
Ananda It has been a long time since we heard a Dhamma talk in the Blessed One's presence
We want to hear a Dhamma talk in the Blessed One's presence
Then Ven
Ananda went with those monks to where the Blessed One was staying in Parileyyaka at the root of the Auspicious Sal Tree and on arrival after bowing down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged them with a talk on Dhamma
Now on that occasion this train of thought appeared in the awareness of one of the monks Now I wonder  knowing in what way seeing in what way does one without delay put an end to the effluents
The Blessed One perceiving with his awareness the train of thought in the monk's awareness said to the monks I have analyzed  taught you the Dhamma monks
I have analyzed  taught you the four frames of reference the four right exertions the four bases of power the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors for Awakening  the noble eightfold path
And yet even though I have analyzed  taught you the Dhamma still there appears this train of thought in the awareness of one of the monks 'Now I wonder  knowing in what way seeing in what way does one without delay put an end to the effluents'
Well then  knowing in what way seeing in what way does one without delay put an end to the effluents
There is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self
That assumption is a fabrication
Now what is the cause what is the origination what is the birth what is the comingintoexistence of that fabrication
To an uninstructed runofthemill person touched by that which is felt born of contact with ignorance craving arises
That fabrication is born of that
And that fabrication is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen
That craving That feeling That contact That ignorance is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen
It is by knowing  seeing in this way that one without delay puts an end to the effluents
Or he doesn't assume form to be the self but he assumes the self as possessing form form as in the self self as in form or feeling to be the self the self as possessing feeling feeling as in the self self as in feeling or perception to be the self the self as possessing perception perception as in the self self as in perception or fabrications to be the self the self as possessing fabrications fabrications as in the self self as in fabrications or consciousness to be the self the self as possessing consciousness consciousness as in the self self as in consciousness
Now that assumption is a fabrication
What is the cause what is the origination what is the birth what is the comingintoexistence of that fabrication
To an uninstructed runofthemill person touched by the feeling born of contact with ignorance craving arises
That fabrication is born of that
And that fabrication is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen
That craving That feeling That contact That ignorance is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen
It is by knowing  seeing in this way that one without delay puts an end to the effluents
Or he doesn't assume form to be the self but he may have a view such as this 'This self is the same as the cosmos
This I will be after death constant lasting eternal not subject to change' This eternalist view is a fabrication Or he may have a view such as this 'I would not be neither would there be what is mine
I will not be neither will there be what is mine' This annihilationist view is a fabrication Or he may be doubtful  uncertain having come to no conclusion with regard to the true Dhamma
That doubt uncertainty  comingtonoconclusion is a fabrication
What is the cause what is the origination what is the birth what is the comingintoexistence of that fabrication
To an uninstructed runofthemill person touched by what is felt born of contact with ignorance craving arises
That fabrication is born of that
And that fabrication is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen
That craving That feeling That contact That ignorance is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen
It is by knowing  seeing in this way that one without delay puts an end to the effluents
Suppose monks that a sheaf of barley were thrown down at a large fourway intersection and six men were to come along with flails in their hands
They would thrash the sheaf of barley with their six flails
Thus the sheaf of barley would be thoroughly thrashed with the six flails
Then a seventh man would come along with a flail in his hand
He would thrash the sheaf of barley with a seventh flail
Thus the sheaf of barley would be even more thoroughly thrashed with the seventh flail
In the same way the uninstructed runofthemill person is thrashed in the eye by charming  pleasurable forms thrashed in the ear by charming  pleasurable sounds thrashed in the nose by charming  pleasurable aromas thrashed in the tongue by charming  pleasurable flavors thrashed in the body by charming  pleasurable tactile sensations thrashed in the intellect by charming  pleasurable ideas
And if that uninstructed runofthemill person forms intentions for the sake of further becoming in the future then he  that foolish person  is even more thoroughly thrashed just like the sheaf of barley thrashed with the seventh flail
Once monks the devas  asuras were arrayed for battle
Then Vepacitti the lord of the asuras addressed the asuras 'If dear sirs in the battle of the devas arrayed against the asuras the asuras win and the devas are defeated bind Sakka the lord of the devas neck hand  foot and bring him before me in the city of the asuras'
As for Sakka lord of the devas he addressed the devas of the Thirtythree 'If dear sirs in the battle of the devas arrayed against the asuras the devas win and the asuras are defeated bind Vepacitti the lord of the asuras neck hand  foot and bring him before me in the righteous assembly of the devas'
Now in that battle the devas won
So the devas of the Thirtythree bound Vepacitti the lord of the asuras neck hand  foot and brought him before Sakka in the righteous assembly of the devas
So there was Vepacitti the lord of the asuras bound neck hand  foot
When the thought occurred to him 'The devas are in the right and the asuras are in the wrong
I'm now going over to the city of the devas' then he viewed himself as freed from that fivefold bond
He was fully provided with the fivefold strings of heavenly sensuality
But when the thought occurred to him 'The asuras are in the right and the devas are in the wrong
I will go over to the city of the asuras' then he viewed himself as bound with that fivefold bond deprived of the fivefold strings of heavenly sensuality
That's how subtle the bonds of Vepacitti were
But the bonds of Mara are even more subtle
Anyone who construes is bound by Mara
Anyone who doesn't construe is freed from the Evil One
'I am' is a construing
'I am this' is a construing
'I shall be' is a construing
'I shall not be''I shall be possessed of form' 'I shall not be possessed of form' 'I shall be percipient' 'I shall not be percipient' 'I shall be neither percipient nor nonpercipient' is a construing
Construing is a disease construing is a cancer construing is an arrow
Therefore monks you should train yourselves 'We will dwell with an awareness free of construings'
'I am' is a perturbation
'I am this' is a perturbation
'I shall be' is a perturbation
'I shall not be' 'I shall be possessed of form' 'I shall not be possessed of form' 'I shall be percipient' 'I shall not be percipient' 'I shall be neither percipient nor nonpercipient' is a perturbation
Perturbation is a disease perturbation is a cancer perturbation is an arrow
Therefore monks you should train yourselves 'We will dwell with an awareness free of perturbations'
'I am' is a wavering
'I am this' is a wavering
'I shall be' is a wavering
'I shall not be' 'I shall be possessed of form' 'I shall not be possessed of form' 'I shall be percipient' 'I shall not be percipient' 'I shall be neither percipient nor nonpercipient' is a wavering
Wavering is a disease wavering is a cancer wavering is an arrow
Therefore monks you should train yourselves 'We will dwell with an awareness free of waverings'
'I am' is a objectification
'I am this' is a objectification
'I shall be' is a objectification
'I shall not be' 'I shall be possessed of form' 'I shall not be possessed of form' 'I shall be percipient' 'I shall not be percipient' 'I shall be neither percipient nor nonpercipient' is a objectification
Objectification is a disease objectification is a cancer objectification is an arrow
Therefore monks you should train yourselves 'We will dwell with an awareness free of objectifications'
'I am' is an act of conceit
'I am this' is an act of conceit
'I shall be' is an act of conceit
'I shall not be' 'I shall be possessed of form' 'I shall not be possessed of form' 'I shall be percipient' 'I shall not be percipient' 'I shall be neither percipient nor nonpercipient' is an act of conceit
An act of conceit is a disease an act of conceit is a cancer an act of conceit is an arrow
Therefore monks you should train yourselves 'We will dwell with an awareness free of acts of conceit'

I tell you this Nandaka not having heard it from any other brahman or contemplative
Instead I tell you this having known seen and realized it for myself
When this was said a certain man said to Nandaka the chief minister of the Licchavis It is now time for your bath sir
Enough I say with this external bath
I am satisfied with this internal bath confidence in the Blessed One
I have heard that on one occasion Ven
Sariputta was staying near Savatthi at Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Now at that time this evil supposition had arisen to Ven
Yamaka As I understand the Teaching explained by the Blessed One a monk with no more effluents on the breakup of the body is annihilated perishes  does not exist after death A large number of monks heard They say that this evil supposition has arisen to Ven
Yamaka 'As I understand the Teaching explained by the Blessed One a monk with no more effluents on the breakup of the body is annihilated perishes  does not exist after death' So they went to Ven
Yamaka and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies they sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to Ven
Yamaka Is it true friend Yamaka that this evil supposition has arisen to you 'As I understand the Teaching explained by the Blessed One a monk with no more effluents on the breakup of the body is annihilated perishes  does not exist after death'
Yes friends
As I understand the Teaching explained by the Blessed One a monk with no more effluents on the breakup of the body is annihilated perishes  does not exist after death
Don't say that friend Yamaka
Don't misrepresent the Blessed One
It's not good to misrepresent the Blessed One for the Blessed One would not say 'A monk with no more effluents on the breakup of the body is annihilated perishes  does not exist after death' But even though Ven
Yamaka was thus rebuked by those monks he  from stubbornness  attachment  maintained his adherence to that evil supposition 'As I understand the Teaching explained by the Blessed One a monk with no more effluents on the breakup of the body is annihilated perishes  does not exist after death'
When those monks could not pry Ven
Yamaka loose from his evil supposition they got up from their seats and went to Ven
Sariputta
On arrival they said to him Friend Sariputta this evil supposition has arisen to Ven
Yamaka 'As I understand the Teaching explained by the Blessed One a monk with no more effluents on the breakup of the body is annihilated perishes  does not exist after death' It would be good if you would go to Ven
Yamaka out of sympathy for his sake
Ven
Sariputta consented by remaining silent
Then in the evening Ven
Sariputta left his seclusion went to Ven
Yamaka and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Yamaka Is it true my friend Yamaka that this evil supposition has arisen to you 'As I understand the Teaching explained by the Blessed One a monk with no more effluents on the breakup of the body is annihilated perishes  does not exist after death'
Yes my friend Sariputta
As I understand the Teaching explained by the Blessed One a monk with no more effluents on the breakup of the body is annihilated perishes  does not exist after death
What do you think my friend Yamaka Is form constant or inconstant
Inconstant my friend
And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful
Stressful my friend
And is it proper to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No my friend
Is feeling constant or inconstant
Inconstant my friend
Is perception constant or inconstant
Inconstant my friend
Are fabrications constant or inconstant
Inconstant my friend
Is consciousness constant or inconstant
Inconstant my friend
And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful
Stressful my friend
And is it proper to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No my friend
Thus friend Yamaka any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near Every form is to be seen with right discernment as it has come to be 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Any feeling whatsoever
Any perception whatsoever
Any fabrications whatsoever
Any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near Every consciousness is to be seen with right discernment as it has come to be 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness
Disenchanted he becomes dispassionate
Through dispassion he is released
With release there is the knowledge 'Released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world' How do you construe this my friend Yamaka Do you regard form as the Tathagata
No my friend
Do you regard feeling as the Tathagata
No my friend
Do you regard perception as the Tathagata
No my friend
Do you regard fabrications as the Tathagata
No my friend
Do you regard consciousness as the Tathagata
No my friend
What do you think Do you regard the Tathagata as being in form Elsewhere than form In feeling Elsewhere than feeling In perception Elsewhere than perception In fabrications Elsewhere than fabrications In consciousness Elsewhere than consciousness
No my friend
What do you think Do you regard the Tathagata as formfeelingperceptionfabricationsconsciousness
No my friend
Do you regard the Tathagata as that which is without form without feeling without perception without fabrications without consciousness
No my friend
And so my friend Yamaka  when you can't pin down the Tathagata as a truth or reality even in the present life  is it proper for you to declare 'As I understand the Teaching explained by the Blessed One a monk with no more effluents on the breakup of the body is annihilated perishes  does not exist after death'
Previously my friend Sariputta I did foolishly hold that evil supposition
But now having heard your explanation of the Dhamma I have abandoned that evil supposition and have broken through to the Dhamma
Then friend Yamaka how would you answer if you are thus asked A monk a worthy one with no more mental effluents what is he on the breakup of the body after death
Thus asked I would answer 'Form is inconstant Feeling Perception Fabrications Consciousness is inconstant
That which is inconstant is stressful
That which is stressful has ceased and gone to its end
Very good my friend Yamaka
Very good
In that case I will give you an analogy for the sake of taking your understanding of this point even further
Suppose there were a householder or householder's son  rich wealthy with many possessions  who was thoroughly wellguarded
Then suppose there came along a certain man desiring what was not his benefit desiring what was not his welfare desiring his loss of security desiring to kill him
The thought would occur to this man 'It would not be easy to kill this person by force
What if I were to sneak in and then kill him'
So he would go to the householder or householder's son and say 'May you take me on as a servant lord' With that the householder or householder's son would take the man on as a servant
Having been taken on as a servant the man would rise in the morning before his master go to bed in the evening only after his master doing whatever his master ordered always acting to please him speaking politely to him
Then the householder or householder's son would come to regard him as a friend  companion and would fall into his trust
When the man realizes 'This householder or householder's son trusts me' then encountering him in a solitary place he would kill him with a sharp knife
Now what do you think my friend Yamaka
When that man went to the householder or householder's son and said 'May you take me on as a servant lord' wasn't he even then a murderer
And yet although he was a murderer the householder or householder's son did not know him as 'my murderer' And when taken on as a servant he would rise in the morning before his master go to bed in the evening only after his master doing whatever his master ordered always acting to please him speaking politely to him wasn't he even then a murderer
And yet although he was a murderer the householder or householder's son did not know him as 'my murderer' And when he encountered him in a solitary place and killed him with a sharp knife wasn't he even then a murderer
And yet although he was a murderer the householder or householder's son did not know him as 'my murderer' Yes my friend
In the same way an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He assumes feeling to be the self
He assumes perception to be the self
He assumes fabrications to be the self
He assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
He does not discern inconstant form as it actually is present as 'inconstant form' He does not discern inconstant feeling as it actually is present as 'inconstant feeling' He does not discern inconstant perception He does not discern inconstant fabrications He does not discern inconstant consciousness as it actually is present as 'inconstant consciousness'
He does not discern stressful form as it actually is present as 'stressful form' He does not discern stressful feeling He does not discern stressful perception He does not discern stressful fabrications He does not discern stressful consciousness as it actually is present as 'stressful consciousness'
He does not discern notself form as it actually is present as 'notself form' He does not discern notself feeling He does not discern notself perception He does not discern notself fabrications He does not discern notself consciousness as it actually is present as 'notself consciousness'
He does not discern fabricated form as it actually is present as 'fabricated form' He does not discern fabricated feeling He does not discern fabricated perception He does not discern fabricated fabrications He does not discern fabricated consciousness as it actually is present as 'fabricated consciousness'
He does not discern murderous form as it actually is present as 'murderous form' He does not discern murderous feeling He does not discern murderous perception He does not discern murderous fabrications He does not discern murderous consciousness as it actually is present as 'murderous consciousness'
He gets attached to form clings to form  determines it to be 'my self' He gets attached to feeling He gets attached to perception He gets attached to fabrications He gets attached to consciousness clings to consciousness  determines it to be 'my self' These five clingingaggregates  attached to clung to  lead to his longterm loss  suffering
Now the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma  does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He does not assume feeling to be the self
He does not assume perception to be the self
He does not assume fabrications to be the self
He does not assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
He discerns inconstant form as it actually is present as 'inconstant form' He discerns inconstant feeling He discerns inconstant perception He discerns inconstant fabrications He discerns inconstant consciousness as it actually is present as 'inconstant consciousness'
He discerns stressful form as it actually is present as 'stressful form' He discerns stressful feeling He discerns stressful perception He discerns stressful fabrications He discerns stressful consciousness as it actually is present as 'stressful consciousness'
He discerns notself form as it actually is present as 'notself form' He discerns notself feeling He discerns notself perception He discerns notself fabrications He discerns notself consciousness as it actually is present as 'notself consciousness'
He discerns fabricated form as it actually is present as 'fabricated form' He discerns fabricated feeling He discerns fabricated perception He discerns fabricated fabrications He discerns fabricated consciousness as it actually is present as 'fabricated consciousness'
He discerns murderous form as it actually is present as 'murderous form' He discerns murderous feeling He discerns murderous perception He discerns murderous fabrications He discerns murderous consciousness as it actually is present as 'murderous consciousness'
He does not get attached to form does not cling to form does not determine it to be 'my self' He does not get attached to feeling He does not get attached to perception He does not get attached to fabrications He does not get attached to consciousness does not cling to consciousness does not determine it to be 'my self' These five clingingaggregates  not attached to not clung to  lead to his longterm happiness  wellbeing
Even so my friend Sariputta are those who have people like you as their fellows in the holy life teaching them admonishing them out of sympathy desiring their welfare
For now that I have heard this explanation of the Dhamma from you my mind  through lack of clingingsustenance  has been released from the effluents
In times long past fully twentyfive hundred years ago where are now the borderlands between Nepal and the northern parts of the provinces of Oudh and North Bihar there were a number of little kingdoms inhabited by different races of people each ruled over by its own Raja or King
One of these little kingdoms which lay some distance north of the presentday town of Gorakhpore on the north side of the river Rapti was the land of a race called the Sakyas the king who ruled over them at that time being called Suddhodana
The family to which King Suddhodana of the Sakyas belonged was called the Gotama family so that his full name was King Suddhodana Gotama and the name of the chief city in his kingdom where he had his chief palace was Kapilavatthu
This King Suddhodana had a chief queen whose name was Mahamaya
And after they had lived together for some time in married happiness the Queen became aware that the day was drawing near when she should bring forth a child
So before time came upon her she asked her husband to give her leave to go and pay a visit to her own people who belonged to a city not very far away called Devadaha
King Suddhodana very willingly granted his chief Queen her wish and sent out his men with orders to prepare the way for her and do everything needed to make the journey to her father's house a pleasant and comfortable one for her
Now half way between Kapilavatthu and the town of Devadaha there was a very fine forest garden called Lumbini where the people of both places used to go in the hot weather to enjoy the cool shade of the great Sal trees of which there were many in the grove
Here in the month of May these great trees were covered from top to bottom with lovely blossoms
In among their long branches flew many kinds of birds singing their sweetest songs so that the whole air was full of the sound of their warbling
And over and through the myriads of flowers swarms of bees went cheerfully humming busily gathering honey on every hand
When as her bearers carried her along the road to Devadaha in her royal litter Queen Mahamaya came to this pleasant place she thought she would like to rest there a while in the cool shade for it was a hot day and so she told her bearers to carry her in among the trees
But she had not been there long walking about and enjoying the pleasing sights and sounds all round her when suddenly and unexpectedly the pangs of childbirth came upon her and in a little while there in the Lumbini Grove under the Sal trees among the birds and bees and flowers she brought forth a son
The place where this Lumbini Grove stood at that far off time can still be seen today
For a great king called Asoka who ruled over a large part of India about three or four hundred years after King Suddhodana's time caused a tall pillar to be set up in the forestgarden where thus was born the son of King Suddhodana and Queen Maya of Kapilavatthu in order to mark the place and on it he had a writing carved in deepcut letters which can still be read saying that he had put it there in order that men in the future should know where the great event had taken place
And although in the course of the two thousand and more years that have passed since King Asoka set up this pillar the upper half of it has been broken off and the half that is left leans all on one side it still stands to this day in the place where King Asoka put it with his inscription on it for any one to see
And many people go to see it every day
Now on the hills outside Kapilavatthu there lived many hermits and among them there was one old hermit whom every one in Kapilavatthu admired and esteemed for his goodness King Suddhodana himself being especially fond of him and showing his esteem and affection for him in many ways
This old hermit when he heard that his great friend the King now had a little son came down to the King's palace in the city to see the babe and when he had come the King asked him to give the babe his blessing and as he made his request he held the infant out toward the hermit in a posture of doing homage to the old man
But the hermit said
Nay Maharaja it is not your son who should bow his head to me but I who ought to bow my head before your son
For I see well that he is no ordinary child
I see well that as he grows up to manhood's years he will become a very great religious teacher
Yes I believe he will become the greatest religious teacher the world has yet seen
Having said this the old man sat silent for a little while smiling to himself with a pleased and happy look
Then his eyes slowly filled with tears and he began to weep the tears trickling down his cheeks
Why said the King in great bewilderment and some alarm What is the matter with you
Just a moment ago you were smiling and now you are weeping
Is anything wrong
Do you foresee some evil thing that is going to happen to my boy
No no Maharaja said the hermit do not be alarmed
No evil thing will ever come near your son
Allprosperous shall be his name and allprosperous he will be
Then why do you weep asked the King
I weep said the hermit to think that I am now so old I must soon pass away and I shall not live to see your son become the great teacher I know he one day will be
You Maharaja will live to see that great and happy day and so will many another person now alive but I shall not live to see it
That Maharaja is why I cannot help weeping
With these words the old man rose from his seat and putting his two hands together palm to palm be bowed down before the little infant
King Suddhodana was very much astonished at all the hermit had said and to see him bowing down his old grey head before the little baby but he thought so much of him that he felt that he himself must do the same as the hermit had done so he too bowed down and with folded hands did obeisance to his own baby son
Now in India in those days it was the custom when a boybaby was born to gather together the wise men and on the fifth day after the boy's birth to bathe his head and give him the name that had been chosen for him by the wise men
And this was done with King Suddhodana's son also
The name the wise men chose for him was Siddhattha a word which means allprosperous or allsuccessful one who will prosper or succeed in everything he sets out to do
For they said they could see that this boy was not going to be like any ordinary boy
They said they could see that if he followed the ordinary life of the world and in due time became king like his father before him then he would become a very great king indeed
But they said if he did not follow his father on the throne of his country but instead turned to follow the religious life then he would become a very great religious teacher
One of the wise men however spoke a little differently from the others
He said that he for his part was quite sure that when the boy grew up he would be certain not to follow the worldly life and take his father's place but would leave throne and kingdom and everything behind him and following the religious life become the very greatest religious teacher in the world
This particular wise man thus said the very same thing that the old hermit had said about the boy's future
The king of course was very much pleased that so many people and these the wisest and most learned in his kingdom should think that his little son was going to grow up to be a very great man
But he was not so highly pleased at the thought that he might not follow him upon the throne but only become a great hermit
He wanted his son to grow up living the ordinary life of the world that every body lives he wanted him to marry and get children and when he himself was too old to govern the kingdom any longer he wanted to see his son mount the throne after him and rule the people as he had done wisely and well
And then after a time he thought to himself who knows
Perhaps my son may become as great a king as any that have ever been and rule not only over little Kapilavatthu but over the whole of India Thus did King Suddhodana consider within himself and the bare thought of such a thing happening to a son of his filled him with the greatest delight and he resolved to do all in his power to make sure that Siddhattha should live the ordinary worldly life and never think about anything else
But in the meantime he had cause to be anxious about something else
Ever since she had given birth to Siddhattha Queen Mahamaya had been ill
She had never recovered her former strength
She received all the best care that a queen could get all the best doctors all the most skilled attendants and nurses but in spite of everything she died just two days after the day on which her baby had been given his name and seven days after she had brought him into the world
Every one especially her husband the king grieved very much at her death for she had been a good woman and a good queen beyond most women and queens
So now the sorrowful king had to give his motherless baby into the care of his mother's sister Princess Mahapajapati and she took care of him now and brought him up just as if he had been her own son
Thus the little boy Siddhattha never knew his own real mother
The old hermit and the wise men who gathered together on Siddhattha's namegiving day had agreed in saying that King Suddhodana's son was no ordinary boy and their words were very soon proved true
After being brought up under the kind care of his aunt Mahapajapati who nursed and attended to her dead sister's child as if he had been her own until he reached the age of eight years teachers then were got for the young prince in order that he might learn reading and writing and arithmetic
Under these teachers' instructions he quickly learned all each had to teach in his own subject
Indeed he learned so quickly and well that every one was astonished his teachers and his father and fostermother as well at the rapid progress he made
For no matter what subject he was being taught as soon as he was told anything at once his mind took hold of what he was told and he never again forgot it in this way showing himself particularly apt at arithmetic
Thus it was easily seen by all that as regarded the power of his mind he was well endowed indeed very much beyond the common
Yet with all his so superior ability in learning and the high position he held in the country as the heir to the throne he never failed to show to his teachers that respect which a pupil always should show seeing that it is through them they gain
The prince was always gentle and dignified in his usual bearing towards every one about him and towards his teachers in particular ever modest and deferent and respectful
In bodily attainments also he was no less well endowed than he was in mind and character
Notwithstanding the gentleness of his manners notwithstanding that he was a gentle man in the very best sense of the words he was bold and fearless in the practice of all the manly sports of his country
He was a cool and daring horseman and an able and skillful chariotdriver in this latter sport winning many chariot races against the best drivers in the country
Yet for all his keenness in trying to win a race he was kind and compassionate towards the horses who helped him to win so often and frequently would let a race be lost rather than urge his weary panting horses beyond their strength
And not only towards his horses but towards all creatures he seemed to have a heart full of tenderness and compassion
He was a king's son and had never himself had to suffer hardship or distress yet in his kind heart he seemed to know by sympathy how others felt when they were afflicted or in pain whether these others were men or animals and when he was quite to others as far as he could and where it was possible tried to relieve any suffering they already were enduring
Thus once when he was out walking in the country with his cousin Devadatta who had his bow and arrows with him Devadatta shot a swan that was flying over their head
His arrow hit the swan and it fluttered down painfully wounded to the ground
Both boys ran forward to pick it up but Siddhattha reached it first and holding it gently he pulled the arrow out of its wing put some cool leaves on the wound to stop it from bleeding and with his soft hand stroked and soothed the hurt and frightened bird
But Devadatta was very much annoyed to see his cousin take the swan from him in this way and he called to Siddhattha to give the swan to him because he had brought it down with his arrow
Siddhattha however refused to give it to him saying that if the bird had been killed then it would have been his but as it was alive and not dead it belonged to the one who actually secured possession of it and so he meant to keep it
But still Devadatta maintained that it should belong to him because it was his arrow that had brought it down to the ground
So Siddhattha proposed and Devadatta agreed that their dispute should be sent for settlement to a full council of the wise men of the country
The council accordingly was called and the question put before them and some in the council argued one way and some the other some said the bird should be Devadatta's and others said that Siddhattha was quite right to keep it
But at last one man in the council whom nobody had ever seen before rose and said A life certainly must belong to him who tries to save it a life cannot belong to one who is only trying to destroy it
The wounded bird by right belongs to the one who saved its life
Let the swan be given to Siddhattha All the others in the council agreed with these wise words and Prince Siddhattha was allowed to keep the swan whose life he thus had saved
And he cared for it tenderly until it was quite cured of its wound then he set it free and let it fly back once more well and happy to its mates on the forestlake
In those days in India everybody knew that everything man needs for his life comes out of the ground and that therefore the man who cultivates the ground and makes it bring forth food without which men cannot live at all is the man who does the most useful and necessary work in any nation
So once a year it was the custom in those days for the king of the country himself along with his ministers to go out to the fields and with his own royal hands plow a field and so set an example to all his people not to be ashamed of honest honorable labor
And one day in the spring at the beginning of the plowing season King Suddhodana went out from Kapilavatthu in full regal state to carry through this yearly observance of the Royal Plowing as it was called
And all the people of the city went out after him for this was their great annual holiday festival in order to see their King plowing and to share in the feasting and merrymaking that always followed
And the King took his young son with him out to the fields and leaving him in the care of some attendants he went to the plowing place and taking hold of the shafts of his own plow which was all decorated with gold he plowed up and down the fallow field followed by his ministers with their plows and oxen ornamented with silver the ordinary farmers coming last with their common plows and yokes of oxen all of them turning over the rich fat brown soil so that it might be made ready for the seed
After a time when the feasting began Prince Suddhodana's attendants went off to share in it and by and by all of them had gone away quite forgetting the young prince and leaving him alone by himself
Then seeing himself thus left alone the prince felt rather pleased for already he was a thoughtful boy and he wanted to get a chance to think quietly about what he had seen on this day of feasting and rejoicing so he wandered away quietly by himself till he came to a nice shady apple tree and there he sat down and began to turn everything over in his mind
First so his thoughts ran there was his father the king and all his ministers and the cultivators after them plowing the land and all were very happy and pleased looking but he had noticed that the oxen did not look as if they were very happy
They had to pull their very hardest to make the plow go through the tough turfy soil they had to tug and strain at it till they were all perspiring and panting for breath
Evidently life was not easy for them not even on a holiday like this when everybody else was making merry
They had to work hard and often when they did not do exactly as their masters wished they had to take harsh words and harsher blows
And young Prince Siddhattha thought that even amid the pleasures of a great holiday there is always something that is not so pleasant
And then from under his apple tree he looked at the movements of the birds and beasts and insects around him and he noticed a lizard ran out near his feet and with its quick darting tongue begin to lick up and eat the little harmless busy ants
And then in a little while a sly snake came along and caught the lizard in its jaws and swallowed it
And then a hawk swooped down from the sky and picked up and killed and devoured the snake
And again the prince began to think deeply and ask himself if it really was so that all the prettiness and beauty of the shows of life have all got some thing at the back of them that is not pretty and beautiful at all
In all his own young life yet he himself had not suffered anything but as he looked round him now and pondered on what he saw he perceived that there was a good deal of suffering going on all the time for somebody or something even though he himself happened to be free from it
And he sat there intently until he became so wrapped up in his thoughts that he forgot everything else forgot all about the day's festival and his father and the plowing and everything
In the meantime the Royal Plowing was done and the feasting that followed it was all over
But when the young prince's attendants came back to where they had left him they could not find him he was not there
Very much frightened they started looking for him everywhere for soon his father the king would be asking for him in order to take him home with him
At last they found him sitting as quiet and still as a stone statue under his apple tree so completely absorbed in his thoughts that at first he did not know they were speaking to him
But when at length they succeeded in making him understand that his father was calling for him that the hour was getting late and it was time to go home then he rose and went back with them to his father but all the way home his heart and thoughts were filled with pity and concern for all living things that love their lives so much and yet find it so hard to live
But the king was far from pleased to find that his son was beginning so early to think seriously about life and what it really means
He began very much to fear that what the old hermit had said was already beginning to come true that his son's thoughts already were turning in the direction of the religious life and that if they were not soon turned away from it what he was so much afraid of would come to pass and Siddhattha would leave his father's house and he would have no son left to follow him on the throne of the country
So he resolved at once to do something to turn his son's mind away from such serious thoughts
He resolved to make life in every possible way so pleasant and comfortable for his son that in his own pleasure and enjoyment he would stop thinking so much about how other beings fared in life
So he ordered his workmen to build three splendid palaces for his son
The first one was built of good stout blocks of wood outside and lined inside with fine sweetsmelling cedar
In this warm comfortable palace he meant his son to live during the cold winter season
The second palace was built of cool polished marble so as to be nice and pleasant to live in during the hot season when everything outside was burning in the hot sun
And the third palace was built of good hard bricks and had a roof of blue tiles on it to keep out the heavy monsoon rains
In this last palace the king meant his son to pass the rainy season safe from its damp and chills
Round each of these palaces also he caused to be laid out a splendid pleasuregarden planted with every kind of shady and flowering tree with many ponds and running streams in it where there grew lotuses of all colors so that the prince might be able to go out walking or riding in it when he chose and always find coolness and shade and flowering beauty wherever he looked
But all these pleasant things palaces gardens ponds walks and rides and the hosts of pleasant companions that were provided along with them were all of no use to stop the young prince from thinking
And the king saw this
He saw that all he had contrived to turn his son's thoughts towards his own pleasure only had completely failed and he called his ministers to him and asked them what else he could do to make sure that the old hermit's prophecy should not come true
His ministers replied that in their opinion the best way to occupy a young man's mind so that he would not think about such things as leaving the worldly life would be to get him married to a nice pretty young wife
Then so they said he would be so taken up with her that he would have no time or inclination to think of anything else and in due time when his father wished it he would take his place on the throne in the regular way and live in the world just like everybody else
This seemed to the king to be very good advice but how could he make sure of getting for his son a wife so lovely and attractive that once he was married he would be completely to her altogether charmed with her loveliness and henceforth live with no other object but to make her perfectly happy
After considering the matter for some time the king hit upon a good plan
He sent out an order that all the most beautiful maidens in the country were to come to Kapilavatthu on a certain day and pass before Prince Siddhattha in order that he might say which of them was the most beautiful and give her a prize for her beauty while each of the others who came and showed themselves would receive each one a gift from the hand of the Prince great or small according as he thought her to come near or fall below the chief of them all in beauty
Now when King Suddhodana gave this order he also arranged that some of his ministers should keep a close watch on his son as the procession of beautiful maidens passed before him and if they saw him show any sign of special pleasure when any particular maiden came forward to receive her gift then they were to take note who she was and come and let him know
So the day came for the beauty competition and all the fairest most beautiful girls in the kingdom passed in a brilliant dazzling procession of loveliness before the prince one after another and each received from his hands the gift which he thought her beauty deserved
But instead of being pleased thus to come close and touch the hand of their sovereign's son each girl seemed to be almost afraid as she approached him and glad when having got her gift she was at liberty to pass on and run back among her companions again
And there was a good reason for their behaving in this unusual way
For this prince of theirs was not at all like any other young man they knew
He did not seem to be looking at them or indeed thinking of them at all
He handed each girl her gift but he seemed to be thinking of something else altogether something great and solemn it seemed far far beyond their smiling faces and dainty ways
Indeed some of them said that as he sat there on his prince's throne he seemed to them to be more like a god than a human being
And the ministers who by the king's command were watching him felt almost afraid at the thought that they would have to go back and tell King Suddhodana that his and their plan had failed that his son had not shown the least pleasure at the sight of a single one of all the beauties who had passed before him
For now nearly all the girls had passed nearly all the prizes had been given away and the prince still sat there unmoved his mind evidently far away from this scene of delight for everybody else this gay procession of one beauty after another
But now just as the last girl took the last prize from the prince's hand and curtsied and passed on there came along hastily a little late one more girl and those who were watching the prince noticed that he gave a little start as she drew near
The girl too on her part instead of passing him with her eyes timidly turned on the ground as all the other girls before her had done looked Prince Siddhattha straight in the face and with a smile asked Is there no gift left for me too
Sorry am I said the prince smiling back to her that all the gifts I had to give out are finished but take this And with that he took a string of splendid jewels from his neck and clasped them round the girl's waist
Then the king's ministers when they saw this were very glad and after they had found out that the name of this young girl who had come last was Yasodhara and had learned where her father Suppabuddha lived they went back to king and told him all about it and they very next day the king sent off messengers to Suppabuddha asking that his daughter Yasodhara might be given in marriage to Prince Siddhattha
Now it was the custom among the Sakya people who were a strong vigorous mountain folk that when any young man wanted to marry he first must show himself as clever and skillful in horseriding shooting with the bow and arrow and wielding the sword as any other young man in the kingdom and Prince Siddhattha although he was the heir to the throne had to follow this custom just the same as every other young man
So one day there came to the maiden of Kapilavatthu all the strongest and cleverest young men of the Sakya kingdom all the best horsemen and archers and swordsmen
And each of them before the assembled crowd of ministers and people showed what he could do with horse with bow and arrow and with sword
And Prince Siddhattha mounted on his white horse Kanthaka showed what he could do also and in the contest with the others he showed that he was as good as and even better than the best in the country
At shooting with the bow and arrow he sent an arrow farther than the young man who up till then had been considered the best archer in the kingdom his own cousin Devadatta
At the exercise or test with the sword he cut a young growing tree through so neatly and cleanly at one stroke that after his sword had passed through it it still remained standing for several moments so that those who were judging the contest at first thought it had not been cut through at all
But then there came a puff of wind and the tree fell over to the ground and everybody saw that it had been cut through as smooth and even as a piece of butter
At this test Prince Siddhattha beat his own halfbrother Nanda who so everybody thought could not be beaten at swordsmanship by anyone in the country
The next test was in horseracing and on his fast white horse Kanthaka Prince Siddhattha easily left all the others behind
But they were not satisfied to see him win this test so easily
They said O if we had a swift horse like that to ride we could win a race to
This is only the merit of the horse it is not the merit of the man
But we have here a wild black stallion which has never yet allowed any man to get on his back
Let us now see which of us can mount him and stay on his back longest
So all the youths tried hard one after another to catch hold of the stallion and swing himself on to its back but all of them were flung to the ground by the proud fierce animal until it came to the turn of Arjuna the best rider in the kingdom
After a little struggle this Arjuna managed to get on the stallion's back and stay there while he whipped it once round the racecourse
Then before anybody knew what it was going to do the savage animal bent its head round quickly and catching Arjuna by the foot with its big strong teeth it pulled him by force out of the saddle and dashed him to the ground and if some of the syces had not run forward quickly and dragged him away while others beat off the stallion it would have trampled Arjuna to death
Then it Siddhattha's turn to try to ride the stallion and everybody thought he would be sure to be killed since Arjuna the best rider in the country had just missed being killed by it
But Prince Siddhattha just walked quietly up to the stallion laid one hand on its neck and the other on its nose as he spoke a few soft gentle words to it then he patted it on its sides and to the surprise of everybody it stood still and allowed the prince to mount it and ride backward and forward just as he wished subdued entirely to his will
It was the first time anybody had come near it who was not afraid of it and did not want to beat it but instead spoke and acted kindly to it and in its surprise at this new kind of treatment the stallion allowed the prince who was neither afraid of nor angry at it to do as he pleased with it
Then every one admitted that Prince Siddhattha was the best horseman in the kingdom too and well worthy to be the husband of so fair a maiden as beautiful Yasodhara
And Suppabuddha Yasodhara's father also agreed that this was so and he willingly gave his daughter as wife to so handsome and manly a young prince
And so Prince Siddhattha was married amid scenes of great rejoicing to beautiful Yasodhara and went with her to live in a new and splendid palace which the king had caused to be built for them surrounded by everything delightful and pleasing that any young man's heart could desire
And now King Suddhodana was beginning to feel satisfied that his son would no longer think about giving up his chance of getting a throne and becoming a religious man
But in order to make quite sure that his thoughts would never turn in this direction the king ordered that nobody about the prince none of his servants or attendants within the palace walls or grounds were ever to speak a single word about such things as old age or sickness or death
They were always to act as if there were no such unpleasant things in the world
More than that
The king sent away from his son's palace all the servants and attendants who showed the least sign of getting old or weak or sickly
He arranged that there should be nobody in the palace and the gardens round it but young happy pleasant smiling people
Those who happened to fall ill were at once taken away and not allowed to come back until they were perfectly well again
The king also gave strict orders that no one when at the princes' presence was to show any sign of weariness or sadness
Everybody round him was required to be cheerful and merry and bright all day long
And at night too when his attendants danced and sang before the prince they were never to show any signs of weariness or fatigue with their exertions
In short King Suddhodana tried so to arrange everything and everybody around the prince that he should not know or even suspect that there was anything else in the world but smiles and laughter and joyous happy youth
For to complete his arrangements he caused a high wall to be build round the prince's palace and gardens and gave strict command to the keepers of the gates that on no account were they to allow the prince to pass outside
In these ways did King Suddhodana think to make sure that his son would never come to see anything but the pleasing sight of youth and beauty never hear anything but the pleasant sounds of songs and laughter and so be content to live as his father had done before him and never wish to become a religious ascetic or seek any other higher good than the life of a King's favorite son
But in spite of all the luxury with which he was surrounded and the pains that were taken too keep from him anything that might make him think the least unhappy thought the young prince Siddhattha did not feel altogether as happy as his father wished him to feel
He wanted to know what lay outside these palace walls he was never allowed to pass
To distract his attention from any such questions about the outside world his father planned new festivals and merrymakings of all kinds but it was all of no use
The prince continued to become more and more dissatisfied with his shutin life
He wanted to see more of the world than was contained within his own palace and pleasuregrounds even though the life he led there was full of delights
He wanted to see how other people who were not princes lived their lives and told his father again and again that he could not be really happy until he had seen this
Until a day came when the king annoyed by his continual request to be allowed to go outside the palace grounds could refuse his wish no longer and said to him Very well my son
You shall go outside the palace walls and see how our people live but first I must prepare things so that everything may be made fit and proper for my noble son's eyes to look at
So the king sent out his messengers through the city to tell the people that on a certain day his son was coming out to see the city and that everybody must hang flags and banners and gay bunting out of all their windows and clean up their houses and paint them afresh and put flowers over their doors and in front of them and make everything as bright and gay as they possibly could
He also gave strict orders that nobody was to show himself in the streets who had anything in the least the matter with him
Nobody who was blind or lame or sick in any way no old folk and no lepers were to appear in the streets of the city anywhere that day but all such people must stay at home indoors all the time the prince was riding through the streets
Only the young the strong the healthy and happy looking people were to come out and give the prince a welcome to the city
Orders were also given that on this day no dead were to be carried through the streets on their way to the burning place but all dead bodies were to be kept till the next day
And the people did as the king commanded them
They swept all the streets and watered them to keep the dust from rising
They put new coats of whitewash on their houses and made them bright with wreaths and festoons of flowers hung in front of their doors
They hung streamers of many colored cloth from the trees that grew along the road by which the prince would come
In short they did all they could think of to make their city look to the eyes of their prince as if it were not a city of this world at all but one of the cities of the gods in the heaven worlds
Then when everything was all ready Prince Siddhattha came forth from his palace and mounting his splendid car passed slowly through all the streets of the city looking everywhere about him and everywhere seeing nothing but the glad smiling faces of the people all pleased to see their prince come among them some of the crowd standing and shouting as he passed Victory victory to our Prince while others ran in front of his chariot throwing flowers before the horses' feet
And the king as he saw how well the people had obeyed his commands felt highly pleased and thought that now that his son had seen the city and had seen nothing but what was pleasant and happylooking now surely he would feel more contented in mind and once for all give up his brooding thoughts
And then suddenly all that he had planned so well was completely spoiled all his hopes and desires for his son brought to nothing
From a little hut by the roadside before any one could prevent him there tottered out a man with grey hair and nothing on him but a few wretched rags
His face was all withered and wrinkled his eyes dim and bleary there were no teeth in his mouth
And as he learned trembling and half doubled up on a staff he had to hold it hard with his two skinny hands to save himself from falling
Then dragging himself along the street and paying no attention to the scenes of rejoicing all round him he let a few weak stammering sounds come from between his pale lips
He was begging the people to give him something to eat or else he would die that very day
Of course everybody round him was very angry at him for daring to come out of his house on this day when the king's son was visiting the city for the first time and the king had commanded that people like him were not to show themselves in the street and they tried to drive him back into his house before the prince should see him
But they were not quick enough
Prince Siddhattha saw the man and he was horrified at the sight
He hardly knew what he was looking at
What is that Channa he hurriedly said to his favorite attendant at his elbow
Surely that cannot be a man
Why is he all bent
Why does he not stand up straight like you and me
What is he trembling for
Why is his hair that strange color and not black like mine
What is wrong with his eyes
Where are his teeth
Is this how some men are born
Tell me good Channa what does this mean
Then Channa spoke to his master and said
My Prince this man is what is called an old man
He was not born like this
He was born like everybody else and at one time when he was young he was straight and strong and blackhaired and cleareyed
But now he has been a long time in the world and so he has become like this
Do not concern yourself about him my Prince
This is just old age
What do you mean Channa said the Prince
Do you mean that this is quite common
Do you mean that everybody who has been a long time in the world becomes like this
Surely no
I never saw anything like this before
Old age
What is old age
My Prince said Channa the charioteer every one in the world who lives a long time becomes just like this man
Everybody Channa
You
I
My father
My wife
Shall we all become like this and have no teeth or black hair and be bowed and trembling and have to lean on a stick when we want to move about instead of standing up straight
Yes my Prince said Channa
Everybody in the world if they live long enough become just like this man
It cannot be stopped
It is old age
Then Prince Siddhattha ordered Channa to drive him home again at once
He did not want to see any more of the city that day
He could not take any more pleasure in the sight of the laughing crowds and the gaily decorated streets
He wanted to get away by himself and think about this terrible thing he had just heard for the first time that he a prince heir to a throne he and everybody he loved one day must grow weak and feeble and have no more joy in living because they would be old and there was nothing that could stop this from happening to them no matter who they were no matter how rich and great and powerful
And when he got home to his palace although his servants set out before him a royal feast of everything delightful to eat he could not eat for he was thinking all the time Some day I will grow old And then when the dishes he had hardly tasted were taken away and the dancers and singers came before him to try to please him with their songs and dances he hardly could bear to look at their graceful poses or listen to their instruments and voices for he was thinking Some day you will all grow old every one of you even the prettiest And when at length he had sent them all away and lay down to rest he could not sleep but lay awake all night thinking of himself and his beautiful wife Yasodhara and how that one day they would both grow grey and wrinkled and toothless and ugly like that man he had seen today in the streets of the city and have no more pleasure in one another
And as he thought of this he began to wonder if out of all the millions and millions of men in the world somebody or another among them all had not found some way of escaping this terrible thing old age
More than that he began to wonder if supposing he tried tried very hard stopped trying to do anything else and gave all his thoughts and energies to this one thing might he not himself find out such a way for the benefit of himself and Yasodhara and his father and everybody in the world
Of course the King was told about what had happened and was very much distressed to hear it
And he to lay awake all that night trying to think of some new pleasures with which to distract his son's attention from these thoughts which if they were not soon stopped would surely lead him to leave his home behind and go and live the lonely life of a religious hermit or wanderer
And the King did devise and offer his son new pleasures but it was all useless
The young Prince refused them
Instead he pleaded with his father that he might be allowed to go out and visit the city another time without any one being told that he was coming so that he might be able to see it just as everybody else saw it following its usual everyday life
As first King Suddhodana was very unwilling to give his son his wish for he feared now more than ever that if once Siddhattha saw the kind of life that is lived by people who are not fortunate enough to be king's or rich men's sons but have to earn all they get by the sweat of their brow then the old hermit's prophecy would come true and Siddhattha would not succeed him on his throne
However he knew quite well that having seen so much his son would never be happy again until he had seen more whatever the result might be
So once more though very unwillingly he gave permission for his son to leave the palace and see the life of the city and once more Prince Siddhattha went forth beyond the walls that were meant to shut out from him all knowledge of any unpleasant thing
This time so that the people would not know him as he passed among them he did not go out dressed like a prince and nobody was told he was coming
This time too he went on foot not in his chariot and dressed just like a young man of good family
And nobody went with him but Channa he also in a dress different from his ordinary one so that the people would not know him either and through him recognize his master
No huzzaing crowds no flowerdecked houses no waving flags did the eyes of the young Prince look upon this time but just the ordinary sights of a city full of common folk all busy about the various occupations by which men earn their bread
Here a blacksmith was perspiring over his anvil as he hammered and beat out a plowshare or a sickle or a cartwheel tire
There in a richer quarter in their little shops sat the jewelers and goldsmiths cunningly fitting jewels and precious stones into chasings of silver and gold skillfully fashioning out of the yellow metal necklaces and bangles and anklets
There in another street the dyers were hanging out to dry in long lines lengths of newly dyed brilliantly colored cloths blue and rosered and green and many another pretty color that one day would drape the form of beauty making it yet more beautiful
And there too were the bakers busily baking their cakes and serving them out to customers waiting to get and eat them while they were yet fresh and warm from the baking
At these and similar sights the young Prince now looked with the keen interest of one who had never seen such sights before and his heart found pleasure in seeing how busy every one seemed and so interested and seemingly contented and happy in their work
And then again something happened that spoiled all his pleasure in this day of new and interesting sights and sent the Prince home a second time sad and sorrowful at heart
For as he was passing along one of the streets with Channa a little way behind him he heard a cry as of some one calling for help
He looked around to see what was the matter and there on the ground near him he saw a man lying twisting his body about in the dust in a very strange way
And all over his face and his body there were ugly looking purple blotches and his eyes were rolling queerly in his head and he gasped for breath as he tried to get on to his feet and every time he got up a little way he fell helplessly down again
In the kindness of his heart the Prince at once ran forward to the man and picked him up and resting his head on his knee tried to comfort the man asking him what was wrong with him and why he did not stand up
The man tried to speak but he could not
He had no breath left for speaking he could only moan
You Channa said the Prince to his servant who had now come up to him tell my why this man is like this
What is the matter with his breath
Why does he not answer me
O my Prince cried Channa do not hold the man like that
This man is ill
His blood is poisoned
He has the plaguefever and it is burning him up so that he cannot do anything but just draw hard breath until his breath too is burnt up by the fever
But are there any other men who become like this
Might I become like this the Prince asked Channa
Indeed you may my Prince
If you hold the man so close as that
Pray put him down and do not touch him or the plague will come out from him and go into you and then you will become the same as he is
Are there any other bad things that come on men besides this plague Channa
Yes my Prince there are others  many many others  of many different kinds and all of them painful as this is
And can no one help it
Does sickness like this come on men without their knowing it by surprise
Yes Prince that is what it does
Nobody knows what day he may fall ill like this
It may happen at any time to anybody
To anybody Channa
To Princes too
To me
Yes even to you my Prince
Then everybody in the world must be afraid all the time since nobody knows when he goes to bed at night if he may not awake in the morning ill like this poor man
That is so my Prince
No one in the world knows what day he may fall ill and after much suffering die
Die
That is a strange word
What is 'die' Channa
Look my Prince said Channa
The Prince looked where Channa pointed and saw a little crowd of people coming along the street weeping while behind them came four men carrying on a board a terribly leanlooking man who lay there flat and still his cheeks fallen in his mouth set in a strangely ugly grin but never turning never saying anything in complaint to those who were carrying him when they gave him a hard jolt on his hard board as they stumbled over a stone in their way
The Prince looked after the little crowd as it passed him wondering why they were all crying and why the man on the board did not tell those who were carrying him to be more careful and not shake him so much
And when they had gone a little further to his astonishment he saw the man's bearers lay him on a pile of wood and then put a light to the wood so that it blazed up in a fierce flame and still the man did not move though the flames were licking all round his head and feet
But what is this Channa
Why does that man lie there so still and let these people burn him
Why does he not get up and run away asked the Prince in horror and bewilderment
My Prince said Channa that man has died
He has feet but he cannot run with them
He has eyes but they do not see anything now
He has ears but he will never hear anything with them again
He cannot feel anything any more neither heat nor cold neither fire nor frost
He does not know anything any more
He is dead
Dead Channa
Is this what it means to be dead
And I  shall I too a king's son one day be dead like this
And my father and Yasodhara and every one I know  shall we every one of us some day lie dead like that poor man on that pile of burning wood
Yes my Prince said Channa
Everybody who is alive must some day die
There is no help for it
There is nothing more sure and certain
No one can stop death from coming
The Prince was struck dumb
He could say no more
It seemed to him such a terrible thing that there should be no way of escape from this devouring monster death who ate up everybody even kings and the sons of kings
He turned home in silence and going to his room in the palace sat there by himself thinking and brooding hour after hour about what he had seen that day
But this is awful said the Prince to himself as he sat pondering alone
Every single person in the world must some day die and there is no help for it so Channa says
O there must be help somewhere for such a state of things
I must find help I will find help for myself and my father and Yasodhara and everybody
I must find some way by which we shall not always be under the power of these hateful things old age and sickness and death
On another occasion as the Prince was driving to the Royal Gardens he came face to face with a man garbed in the flowing orangecolored robes of the recluse
The Prince observed the Monk closely and feeling an inward pleasure at the calm and the dignified mien and the noble bearing of the man he questioned Channa about the life led by such a person
The charioteer replied that the man belonged to the class of people who had left the world to seek a remedy for the sufferings and sorrows of the world
The Prince was highly elated over this and going to the Gardens spent the day happily himself having made up his mind to leave home
As the Prince thus sat thinking and talking to himself news was brought to him that his wife had given birth to a fine baby boy
But the Prince showed no signs of gladness at the tidings
He only murmured with distracted look A Rahula has been born to me a fetter has been born to me And because this was what his father had said when he heard that he was born the baby was called on his namegiving day Prince Rahula
After this day King Suddhodana saw that it was of no more use trying to shut Prince Siddhattha up in his pleasant palace and keep him occupied only with his own pleasure and delight so now he allowed him to go out into the city as much as he pleased
And very often the Prince drove round the city seeing everything and thinking always thinking about what he saw and trying to make up his mind what to do
After one of these drives through the city as on his way home again he was passing the rooms of the palace where the ladies lived one of the Princesses called Kisagotami happened to be looking out of her window and seeing the Prince she was much struck by his handsome noble appearance and exclaimed to herself O how happy how cool how content must be the mother and the father and the wife of such a splendid young Prince
But she spoke louder than she thought she was speaking and the Prince as he passed heard what she was saying
And he thought to himself Yes mother and father and wife have happiness and comfort and content in their hearts at having such a son and husband
But what is real true happiness and comfort and content
And the Prince's mind being already turned away from delight in worldly things by the sights he had seen and the thoughts about them that filled his mind all the time he said low to himself Real true happiness and comfort and content come when the fever of craving and of hating and of delusion is cured
When the fires of pride and false notions and passions are all put out then comes real true happiness and coolness and content
And that is what I and all men need to get
That is what I must now go forth and seek
I cannot stay any longer in this palace leading this life of pleasure
I must go forth at once and seek and go on seeking till I find it  that real true happiness which will put me and all men beyond the power of old age and sickness and death
This lady had taught me a good lesson
Without meaning it she has been a good teacher to me
I must send her a teacher's fee
So he took from his neck a fine pearl necklace he was wearing at the time and sent it with his compliments to Princess Kisagotami
And the princess accepted it from the Prince's messenger and sent him back with her warmest thanks to the Prince for she thought it was meant for a token that the handsome and clever young Prince Siddhattha had fallen in love with her and wished to make her his second wife
But the Prince's thoughts were very far indeed from any such thing and his father and his wife knew it very well
Indeed every one about the Prince could see that he was now completely changed more serious and thoughtful than he had ever been when he came home from this day's ride about the city
But the father could not bear to lose his son without making one more one last attempt to keep him
So he caused all the cleverest and most entrancingly beautiful singers and dancers in the kingdom to be brought to his son's palace and they sang and danced before Prince Siddhattha as King Suddhodana commanded doing their very best with their gayest sweetest songs their most enchanting and alluring postures to draw from his son smiles of approval and pleasure
And for a time the Prince looked at and listened to them not wishing to disappoint his father by a flat refusal to see them
But his eyes only half saw the beautiful enticing forms before him for his mind was taken up with something else that never left it alone now he was thinking of the one only thing that now seemed worth thinking about at all  how old age and sickness and death might be escaped by him and by all men for ever
And at last weary with so much thinking worn out with so much brooding in the midst of the music and loveliness that no longer now had power to charm or please he fell into a dozing sleep
The singers and dancers soon noticed that he whom they were supposed to be amusing cared so little for their efforts that he did not even take the trouble to keep awake and look at and listened to them
So they stopped their dancing and singing and lay down just where they were to wait till the Prince woke again
And soon they too like the Prince fell asleep without knowing it leaving the lights in the room all burning
After some time the Prince woke from his doze and looked round him in astonishment and also in disgust for what did he see
All those girls who were supposed to be the prettiest and most charming in the country and only a little while before had been posing before him in the most enchanting attitudes now were scattered about the floor of the apartment in the ugliest the most ungainly positions imaginable some snoring like so many pigs some with their mouths gaping wide open some with the spittle oozing from the corners of their lips dribbling down over their dresses some grinding their teeth in their sleep like hungry demons
So ugly so repulsive did they look one and all that the Prince wondered how he ever could have taken any pleasure in them
The sight of all this that he once had thought loveliness so completely turned to loathsomeness was the last thing needed to fill his mind with complete disgust for the life he was leading
His mind was now fully made up to leave all this repulsiveness behind him and to go forth immediately to look for that real happiness which would bring to an end all evil things
Rising quietly so as not to disturb and wake any of the sleeping girls he stole out of his room and called his servant Channa to him and told him to saddle his favorite white horse Kanthaka for now at once he was going out on a long journey
While Channa was away getting ready Kanthaka Siddhattha thought he would go and take a last look at his little son before he left
So he went to the room where his wife lay sleeping with her babe beside her
But when he opened the door and looked in he saw that his wife was sleeping with her hand so placed that it rested on and was covering the baby's head
If I try to move her hand said the Prince to himself so as to see my boy's face I fear I may wake her
And if she wakes she will not let me go away
No I must go now without seeing my son's face this time but when I have found what I am going forth to seek I shall come back and see him and his mother again
Then very quietly so as to wake nobody the Prince slipped out of the palace and in the stillness of the midnight hour mounted his white horse Kanthaka who also kept quite quiet and neither neighed nor made any other sound that might wake any one
Then with faithful Channa holding on to Kanthaka's tail Siddhattha came to the city gate and passing through without any one trying to stop him rode away from all who knew and loved him
When he had gone a little distance he pulled up Kanthaka and turning round took a last look at the city of Kapilavatthu sleeping there so calm and quiet in the moonlight while he its Prince was leaving it like this not knowing when he should see it again
It was the city of his fathers the city where he was leaving behind him a young and beloved wife and a precious infant son but he did not weaken in his resolve one jot no thought of turning back to them entered his mind
That mind was now thoroughly made up
Again he turned his face in the direction he had to go and rode on till he came to the banks of a river called the Anoma
Here he dismounted and standing on the sandy beach that on both hands stretched away white as silver in the moonlight he took off all his jewels and ornaments and giving them to Channa said Here good Channa
Take these adornments of mine and white Kanthaka and take them back home
The hour has now come for me to give up the worldly life
O my dear master cried Channa do not go away like this all by yourself
Let me too leave the world and come with you
But although Channa again and yet once more asked to be allowed to stay with his master and to go with him wherever he went the Prince was firm and refused to take him with him
It is not yet the time for you to retire from the worldly life he said to Channa
Go back to the city at once and tell my father and mother from me that I am quite well And he forced him to take all his jewelry from him and also his horse Kanthaka
Channa could not now refuse to do what his master commanded him so with a heavy heart and weeping sorely he turned back along the white moonlit road to the city leading Kanthaka by the bridle to take the sad news to Kapilavatthu that his beloved master their prince at last as he long had threatened had left parents and wife and children and kingdom behind him and had gone away to be a wanderer without a home
In this way it was that at the age of twentynine in the full flush of early manhood while still blackhaired and young and strong Prince Siddhattha Gotama of the noble house of the Sakya race went forth from home into homelessness in order to seek for himself and for all men some way whereby he and they might win forever beyond the reach of all ill all distress all grief all sorrow all despair
After a short period of quiet reflection in a grove near the river bank where he had parted from Channa the young Prince who was now only a wandering beggar turned his steps southward towards the Magadha country and in due time reached the chief city of that country Rajagaha by name where the King of the country Bimbisara had his principal palace
Here with begging bowl in hand Siddhattha went round the streets of the city begging his food from door to door like any other religious mendicant
But he did not look like a common beggar
Those who saw him pass along could see by his very look that he was no ordinary religious mendicant and they put into his bowl the best food they had
When he had gathered enough the princebeggar left the city again and in a retired spot outside the walls sat down to eat what he had collected
But O what a meal it was
Never in his life before had he a prince by birth and accustomed to the best of food served up in the most attractive and tempting way had such a mixed mess as this set before him
His stomach simply turned in disgust at the sight of that bowl full of scraps and portions of all kinds of different foods all flung together into one dish
He simply could not bring himself to eat the repulsive mixture
He wanted to throw it away and eat nothing rather than such a mess
And then he stopped and began to think and this is what he thought and said to himself
Siddhattha you were born of a good family in a king's house where you got everything good to eat that you could wish the very best of rice the richest and tastiest of curries in all abundance
But in spite of this you made up your mind deliberately to live the life of a homeless beggar and fare the same as every such beggar fares on whatever was given you by the charitable
And you carried out your resolve you became a homeless beggar yet now what are you doing
You do not want to eat the food proper for homeless beggars to eat  the food that is given them whatever it may be
Do you think that is a right thing to do
In these and in other words the princebeggar reasoned with himself chiding and scolding himself for his daintiness and fastidiousness in the matter of food so unfitting in a beggar
And in the end after a struggle with himself he succeeded in overcoming his repugnance to the food lying in his bowl before him and he ate it up without further ado and never afterwards had any more trouble about eating what was given him to eat
Meanwhile the people of Rajagaha King Bimbisara's city were all talking about the new religious mendicant who had been begging in their streets that morning he had looked so different from the common run of religious mendicants so refined so noble looking
The talk even reached the ears of King Bimbisara in his palace and he sent his servants to make enquiries and find out who the stranger mendicant could be
Very soon his messengers learned all about Siddhattha and came back and told their master that he was the eldest son of the King of the Sakyas the heir to the throne and that he had left everything behind him in order to become a beggar and try to discover if he could some way that would lead men beyond the reach of old age and sickness and death
As his servants told King Bimbisara this he listened to them very much perplexed
Never before had he heard of a religious mendicant looking for anything so strange so extraordinary
But it sounded great and grand and worthy of a prince's looking for it and perhaps is was not so impossible as it seemed he thought
So he sent his men to ask the princebeggar to stay in his city and he would provide a place for him to live in and food and everything else he required for his comfort and he could settle down there and study and meditate and carry on his search
But Siddhattha declined the King's kind offer saying that he could not stay still anywhere until he had found what he sought
After he had found it perhaps then he might be able to stay in one place
So then the King made him promise that when he had found what he was seeking he would come and stay in his city and let him and his people know about it first
So the princebeggar left Rajagaha behind him and passed upon his wandering way into the open country towards a hill on which a great many hermits were living from whom he thought he might be able to learn something about life and death and how all the ills connected with them might be overcome
And as he went along the road he saw a cloud of dust coming down the mountain side and heard the patter of feet and then out of the dust there came into sight a herd of sheep and goats making their way to the plain
But behind them all painfully limping along came a little lamb its leg hurt and bleeding but still trying hard to keep up with its mates
And when Siddhattha saw it and noticed how anxious about it the mother sheep was his heart was filled with pity
He picked up the little creature and walked alongside the rest of the sheep carrying the lame lamb in his arms
Poor little thing he said speaking to the lamb I was going to join the hermits on the hills but it is at least as good a deed to ease your little heart of suffering as to sit up there with these praying hermits
Then he saw the men who were driving the herd and he asked them where they were going and why they were driving their flocks away from pasture in the heat of the day instead of in the cool of the evening
They answered him that they had been ordered to bring a hundred sheep and a hundred goats down to the city during the day in order that they might be on hand and ready for the great sacrifice that was going to be offered that night by the King
I will go with you said the princebeggar and he walked along with them and their flock still carrying the lame lamb in his arms
And now as he came near to the riverside a young woman came up to him and after saluting him with great respect said to him O Reverend Lord have pity on me and tell me where I shall be able to find that seed which keeps away death
Siddhattha looked at her as if he would ask her what she meant
The woman noticed his look and went on
Do you not remember Lord
Yesterday I brought you my little son who was sick so sick that he was near to dying and asked your reverence if there was no medicine at all that would keep him alive for he is my only son
And your reverence said yes there was something that might save him from dying if I could get it  a tola's weight of black mustard seed got from a house in which no one ever had died
And did you get that seed sister said Siddhattha with a tender wistful smile
Nay Lord I did not said the woman sadly
I went round all our village to every house asking for black mustard seed and everybody was very willing to give me some but when I told them that I only wanted it from them if no one had ever died in their house they said that that was a queer thing for me to say for everybody knew there had been a death in their house and sometimes more then one death
Some said a slave had died with them
In some houses it was the father who had died in some the son in some the mother in some the daughter
But in every home every house some one had died
I could not get my seed
O Reverend Sir tell me where I may get that seed before my little son dies
Are there no homes at all where death has not been
You have said it Siddhattha answered the now weeping woman
In all the wide world there are no homes where death has not been
Now you have found this out for yourself
Now you know that yours is not the only grief in the world
Now you know with your own knowledge that all the world weeps along with you for some dear one dead
Go home and bury your child
As for me sister I go to find if I can what will put an end to your and all men's sorrow and if I find it I will come again and tell it to you
So Siddhattha passed on his way and entered the city along with the herd of animals that were going to be killed and still went with them right up to the palace where the sacrifice was to be made
Here the King was standing with the priests all round him chanting their hymns to the gods and soon the altar fires were lit and the priests made ready to kill the animals that had now arrived
But just as the chief priest was about to plunge his knife into the throat of the first goat that had been picked for the sacrifice Siddhattha stepped forward and stopped him
No Maharaja' he said to King Bimbisara do not let the priest strike that poor goat And before any one knew what he was going to do he untied the rope of grass with which it was fastened and let it go back to its mates
And no one not even the King nor the chief priest thought of trying to stop him from doing it so great and noble did he look as he set the goat free and allowed it to run back to the rest of its fellows
Then the Princebeggar began to speak to the King and the priests and all who had gathered there to see the great sacrifice of blood about what a wonderful thing life is how anybody can destroy it but how impossible it is for any one to restore it once it has been destroyed
Every creature that lives so he told those round him is fond of its life fears to die just as much as men do
Why then should men use their power over these poor brothers of theirs only to rob them of what man himself is most fond of  the wonderful thing life
If men wish to receive mercy he said they ought to show mercy
If men kill then according to the law that rules in the world they will be killed
And what kind of gods he asked them can they be who are pleased with and take delight in blood
Certainly not good gods he said
Rather they must be demons to take pleasure in suffering and death
No he ended if men wish to taste happiness themselves in the hereafter they must not cause unhappiness to any living creature even the meanest here in this world
Those who sow the seed of unhappiness of pain and suffering will certainly have to reap a fullgrown crop of the same in the future
In this way did Siddhattha speak to the King and the priests and people of Rajagaha and did it so gently and kindly and yet so powerfully that the minds and hearts of the King and the priests were quite changed
There and then the King issued an order that henceforth throughout the whole of his Kingdom there were to be no more sacrifices in which living creatures were deprived of life
After this day everybody in his realm King and priests and people alike were to offer to the gods only such gifts as did not involve the taking of any living creature's life
They were only to offer as sacrifices to gods flowers and fruits and cakes and other similarly bloodless offerings
And now once more King Bimbisara begged Siddhattha to stay in his kingdom and teach him and his people the good way of kindliness and pity and compassion towards everything that has life
The princebeggar thanked him for his kind offer but told him that he had not yet found what he was seeking and until he had found it he could not rest but must still go on searching for it everywhere among all the wise men of India in case any of them knew or in any way could help him in his search
In those days in ancient India there were very many different teachers of religion the same as there are now who took pupils and taught these pupils all they themselves knew
One of these religious teachers well known for his knowledge and attainments was called Alara Kalama and to this teacher Siddhattha now went in order to learn what he had to teach
And Siddhattha stayed with Alara Kalama a long time and studied under him and practiced the practices his master taught him so diligently that at length he had learned and practiced everything his master knew and practiced
And his master Alara Kalama thought so highly of him and of his great ability that one day he said to him Now you know everything I know
Whether you teach my doctrine or whether I teach it it is all the same
You are the same as I I am the same as you
There is no difference between us
Stay with me and take my place as teacher to my disciples along with me
But have you nothing more you can teach me said Siddhattha
Can you not teach me the way to get beyond the reach of life and death
No said Alara Kalama
That is a thing I do not know myself so how can I teach it to you
I do not believe that anybody in the whole world knows that
Alara Kalama only knew what he had already taught Siddhattha  the way to a state of consciousness called the realm of neither perception nor nonperception which was a very high state of consciousness but one which does not save the man who reaches it from the necessity of being born and therefore of growing old and falling ill and eventually dying over and over again
So very much disappointed Siddhattha left his master Alara Kalama and went away again to wander this way and that throughout the country looking for some one who knew and could teach him more than he had learned from Alara Kalama
And after a time he came to hear of another famous teacher of the name of Uddaka who was said by everybody to possess great knowledge and powers
So Siddhattha now went to this Uddaka and became his pupil and diligently studied and practiced under him until as with Alara Kalama he was as clever and learned as his master and knew and practiced all that his master knew and practiced
And Uddaka also just like Alara Kalama was so pleased with Siddhattha's quickness and ability that he also wanted him to stay with him and along with him become the leader and teacher of his band of disciples
And Siddhattha asked him the same question that he had asked of Alara Kalama
He asked him if he had no more to teach him if he could not teach him how to overcome birth and death and all the disagreeable things connected with the same
But Uddaka was in the same position as Alara Kalama in this matter
He did not know how men could get out of the round of birth and death altogether and had never heard of any one who did know such a thing
So disappointed once more Siddhattha took leave of Uddaka too and made up his mind that he would not go to any more teachers to ask about what he wanted to know but henceforth would try to find it out for himself by his own labor and efforts
Now it was quite a common thing then in India as indeed it still is today for those men who leave their homes and follow a religious life to imagine that by going without food and making their bodies uncomfortable and miserable in a number of other ways that they would earn the right to a long period of peace and happiness hereafter in the world of the gods
They thought that if only a man made himself unhappy enough here he would make sure of being happy hereafter and that the more unhappy he made himself now the more happy he would be in the future
And they carried out this belief of theirs in actual practice just as many of them still do in India today
Some of them reduced the quantity of food they ate little by little day after day until at last they were eating hardly anything at all so that their poor bodies became mere skin and bones
Some practiced standing on one leg all the time until it turned stiff and lifeless with the continual strain
Others held one arm up in the air all the time until it withered and dried up through the blood not flowing into it properly in that unnatural position
Others again held their fists tightly clenched never letting them loose until the nails at the ends of their fingers actually grew into the palms of their hands and through the flesh and out at the backs of their hands
Others never lay down at night except on a bed of thorns or else on a board with sharp nails all over it their points sticking upwards
And Siddhattha because he was anxious and determined to find out what he wanted to know and did not care how much trouble and pain he had to go through if only at last he might succeed did very much the same as these other ascetics who were seeking religious truth
He did not know any better way than to do just as the others did
He honestly hoped and believed that if only he tortured and tormented his body enough at last as reward he would obtain enlightenment of mind
Here is part of the story of what he did in those days as he told it himself in after years to one of his foremost disciples the Thera Sariputta
I practiced the holding in of my breath said the Buddha to Sariputta until it made a great roaring in my ears and gave me a pain in my head as if some one was boring into it with a sharp sword or lashing me over the head with a leather whip
In my body also I suffered pains as if a butcher were ripping me up with a knife or some one had flung me into a pit of redhot coals
And then I practiced loneliness
On the nights of the new moon and of the full moon I went out to lonely places among the trees where the dead lay buried and stayed there all the night through hearing the leaves rustling and the twigs dropping when a breeze blew with my hair all standing on end with fright
When a bird came and lighted on a bough or a deer or other animal came running past I shook with terror for I did not know what it was that was coming up to me in the dark
But I did not run away
I made myself stay there and face the fear and terror I felt until I had mastered it
I also went without food
I practiced eating only once a day then only once in two days then only once in three days and so on until I was only eating once in fourteen days
I have lived eating nothing but grass nothing but moss wild fruits and roots wild herbs and mushrooms wild rice and the dust I scraped up of thrashing floors
I covered my body only with garments made out of rags from graveyards and dustheaps with old skins of animals that had died in the fields with woven grass with patches made of birds' wings and tails that I found lying here and there
In the lonely forests I lived alone never seeing a human being for weeks and months
In winter when it was cold at night I stayed out in the open without a fire to keep me warm
And in the daytime when the sun came out I hid myself among the cold trees
And in the burning heat of summer I stayed out by day in the open under the hot sun and at night I went into the close stifling thickets
I also practiced what was called 'purification by food'
I lived on nothing but beans then on nothing but sesamum seed then on nothing but rice
And I reduced the quantity I ate of these day by day until at last I was eating only one bean a day one sesamum seed a day one grain of rice a day
And through eating so little food my body became terribly thin and lean
My legs became like reeds my hips like camel's hoofs
My backbone stood out on my back like a rope and on my sides my ribs showed like the rafters of a ruined house
My eyes sank so far in my head that they looked like water at the bottom of a deep well and almost disappeared altogether
The skin of my head grew all withered and shrunken like a pumpkin that has been cut and laid out in the sun
And when I tried to rub my arms and legs to make them feel a little better the hair on them was so rotted at the roots that it all came away in my hands
And yet Sariputta in spite of all these pains and sufferings I did not reach the knowledge I wanted to reach because that knowledge and insight was not to be found that way but could only be got by profound reasoning and reflection and by turning away from everything in the world
In this way for six or seven long years Siddhattha put his body to all kinds of torment thinking that by doing this if only he went on long enough at last he would get to know what he wanted all the while wandering about here and there through the country of Northern India
At length in the course of these wanderings he came to the land of Magadha again to a nice quiet place in a bamboo grove beside a broad smoothflowing river with a good bathingplace and a village close by where he could easily go and beg food
He liked the look of this place as soon as he saw it
This is a good place to stay in he said to himself for any ascetic like myself who wants to strive and struggle for knowledge
Here I will stay
So in this place called Uruvela Siddhattha now took up his fixed residence under the trees meditating and striving hard fasting and otherwise treating his poor body very badly all in the hope that by such pains and endeavors he would gain a knowledge of the truth he sought
Meanwhile there had gathered round him a little band of disciples who admired him very much as they saw how he starved himself and otherwise made himself undergo severe hardships
And these disciples five in number waited upon him and attended to his few wants for they thought that an ascetic who could make himself suffer such pains and privations and persevere in them as did Siddhattha must be no common man
They thought indeed they felt sure that an ascetic with so much endurance and determination must be certain to get what he was looking for and that when he had found it then he would tell it to them his pupils and followers
But one day it happened that as he sat alone under a tree the poor princeascetic all worn out with fasting and hardships and added to that the strain of intense and prolonged meditation fell down in a dead faint and lay there on the ground so completely exhausted and without strength that perhaps he would never have risen again but died there just where he lay
Fortunately however a boy who was watching some goats near by happened to come along by the tree under which Siddhattha lay in a swoon and when he saw the holy man lying there the boy at once guessed that he was dying for want of proper food for everybody round about knew that he was a very holy man and went without food for days and days
So the boy ran back to his goats and brought up one of them and milked some milk from its teats into the halfopen mouth of the holy man without touching him with his hands for he did not dare he a common herdboy to lay his hands on a saint
Very soon the good fresh milk began to produce its effect upon the halfdead Siddhattha
After a little while he was able to sit up feeling very much better than he had felt for a long time
And he began to think about why it was he had fainted and why he was now feeling so much refreshed in body and mind
And these are the thoughts that passed through his mind
O how foolish I have been
I left my wife and family and home and everything and became a homeless wanderer because I wanted to get to know the truth about man's life and how he must live it to the best purpose
But in order to gain a knowledge so difficult to gain as this I needed to have a brain and a mind as strong and vigorous as I possibly could get so that I might be able to think and meditate steadily and strongly
And then I went and made my body weak and wretched with starvation and those other practices I practiced
But how can a man have a strong and healthy mind if his body is weak and miserable and unhealthy
O how foolish I have been to make myself weak just when I need all the strength I can get to carry through the great task I have set myself to perform
After this I shall eat all the food my body requires to keep it in god condition
I shall not eat too much for that will make me dull and heavy and sleepy and then I shall not be able to think and meditate properly
But I shall eat enough to keep me well and strong so that I may have a clear unclouded mind and so perhaps at last I shall be able to gain the truth I want to reach
So with thoughts like this in his mind Siddhattha turned to the goatherd boy who now was kneeling before him in veneration and asked him if he would kindly give him a little more of his goat's milk in a dish as it was doing him very much good
O Reverend Lord said the boy I cannot do that
I cannot give you milk in a dish that has been touched by my hand
I am only a common herdboy of low caste and you are a holy man a Brahmin
If I were to touch you with anything I had touched it would be a crime
But Siddhattha replied My dear boy I am not asking you for caste I am asking you for milk
There is no real difference between us two even although you are a goatherd and I am a hermit
It is blood that flows in the veins of both of us
If some robbers were to come and cut us both with swords the blood that would flow from both our bodies would be of the same red color
And if it went on running and nobody stopped it we should both of us die with no difference between us
If a man does high and noble deeds then he is a high and noble man
And if a man does low and ignoble deeds then he is a low and ignoble man
That is all the real caste there is
You have done a good kind deed in giving me milk when I was almost dead for want of food therefore you are of good caste to me
Give me some more milk in a dish
The herdboy did not know what to say to these strange but so very pleasant words from this extraordinary hermit who did not send him away from him because he was a lowcaste herdboy but instead wanted more milk from him and would take it out of a dish
But he went off and soon came back with a bowl full of his best goat's milk which he joyfully offered to the kind hermit who had told him that he was of as good a caste to him
Then he took back his empty bowl and after bowing down before the hermit and asking his blessing went back glad and happy to his goats
But the princeascetic now thoroughly refreshed with the good drink of milk sat on beneath the tree meditating more successfully than he had done for a long time
And as he still sat there in the dark after the sun had gone down he heard the sound of girls' voices singing
It was a band of professional singers and dancers going to a neighboring town to give an entertainment and as they passed along close to where he sat he distinctly heard the words of their song which was about the instrument they played when they sang called a lute
They were saying in their song that if the strings of the lute were hung too slack they made very poor music and if they were stretched too tight then they broke and made no music at all
Therefore so they sang it was best to stretch the strings neither too slack nor too tight but just medium and then they would give proper music
That is true what these girls sing thought the princeascetic as he heard them
These girls have taught me something
I have been stretching the strings of my poor body far too tight this long time and they have come very near to breaking altogether
If that boy had not come and brought me the milk today I should have died and then what would have become of my search for the Truth
There and then it would have come to an end
My search for that which I and all men need to know would have failed miserably just for want of a little food for my body
This harsh way of treating the body cannot be the proper way to find Truth
I will give it up at once and treat my body with proper care and attention henceforth
So when next day a young woman called Sujata who lived near by came to him in his hermitage among the trees with a bowl full of extra good rice boiled with very good rich milk which she had specially prepared for him saying as she gave it to him May you be successful in obtaining your wishes as I have been He did not refuse her gift but accepted it with pleasure and felt the benefit of it at once in a greatly strengthened body and mind
After this Siddhattha went out again every morning to the village to beg food and eating what he got there each day he soon became strong again and his skin became a good color almost as clear and golden as it used to be in the old days when he lived in his father's palace
But although he himself now saw that the pains and hardships to which he subjected himself were just like trying to tie air into knots or weave ropes out of soft sand for all the help it was to him in his search for the Truth the five disciples who believed in him and had hitherto stayed with him through everything did not think this at all
They still believed like everybody else in India in those days that the one only way to find the Truth in religious matters was to make yourself miserable in body
So when they saw the master and teacher they had hitherto admired so much for the way in which he starved and in other ways illtreated and tormented his body beginning to eat all his body required of the rice and curry he got when he went out begging they were very much disappointed with him and they said among themselves Ah this Sakya ascetic has given up striving and struggling
He has gone back to a life of ease and comfort And the whole five of them turned away from their old master and left him for they felt sure that there was no use in staying any longer with a teacher who did not starve himself and in other ways make himself miserable
Such an ascetic they were sure could never possibly attain to any great knowledge of religious truth
How very much mistaken how very far wrong these five disciples of the princeascetic were was soon made clear to them
Their master and teacher far from having turned back from his goal was now on the very point of reaching it
Any one today who wishes to see the very spot where twentyfive hundred years ago Prince Siddhattha of the Sakya race at last found the Truth he had sought so long and with such painful efforts need only go to the town of Buddha Gaya in Behar and from there walk six or seven miles along a road which more or less follows the course of a broad sandy stream now called the river Phalgu but which in those days was called the Neranjara
As he comes near his destination he will see rising above the neighboring flat fields on a slight elevation a tall solid structure of dark stone with a few terraces running round its oblong form which rises into the air growing smaller and smaller towards the top where there is a small open platform from which rises a spire of stone of the solid Hindu pattern the whole structure being decorated with a great variety of sculptured work of all descriptions
This is the celebrated monument of Buddha Gaya
And in the shadow of this great memorial structure surrounded by a low stone wall the visitor yet may see the tree beneath whose branches Prince Siddhattha at last obtained the light he sought for it was towards this tree that he turned his steps one evening having resolved to make one last mighty effort of mind and will and penetrate the final secret of life and all existence
And as he went towards that tree  in memory of Siddhattha's great achievement ever since called the Bodhi Tree or Tree of Enlightenment  Sujata's words to him must have been in his ears May you be successful in obtaining your wishes as I have been For now he sat down beneath the tree and made a solemn vow to himself that even if all the blood in his veins dried up and all his flesh wasted away and nothing was left of his body but skin and sinews and bones from this seat he would not rise again until he had found what he sought reached his goal discovered for himself and for all men the way by which they might gain the highest happiness be delivered once and for all from the need to be born and to die again and again in a wearisome neverending round of the same pleasures and pains over and over again
He sat down there under the Bodhi Tree resolved to sit there no matter what might happen to him until he had discovered the way that leads out of Samsara the world of birth and death and change to the constant lasting deathless state called Nibbana
This was a tremendous resolve to make
It had never been made before by any mortal man of our epoch of the world
There were indeed many other ascetics and hermits in Siddhattha's native land of India who had spent long years of bodily hardship and severe mental labor in order to obtain what they thought was the highest good possible
But what they won after all their years of toil and struggle of mind and will was the attainment of a very great happiness only it was not a constant lasting happiness
It was not permanent
It was not for ever secure against all chance and change
After a time when the energy they had put forth in order to bring them to these high states of bliss in the heavenworlds was all exhausted all spent then these people these ascetics and hermits fell down again from these blissful states to lower states of existence to life on this earth again with all its unpleasantness and disappointments
It was with them as it might be with a man who had gathered together a lot of money in a box and started spending it all
Very soon it would all be spent the box would be empty and he would have to begin getting more
And so with these hermits and ascetics if they wanted to enjoy great happiness again they had to begin all over again the painful things they had done before so as to get to the heavenworld again and enjoy its delights
And this they would have to do again and again as long as they wanted such delights
Again and again they would have to go through a course of misery endured on earth so as to get happiness in heaven and then the same again always and always without any end
Their way of doing was like that of a man who with great trouble rolls a heavy ball to the top of a high hill only to find it roll back to the bottom again whereupon he has to go through all the labor of rolling it up the hill again and has to do this over and over again without any end to his labor
But what Siddhattha wanted was to find some way by which he and all men would not need any more to be for ever rolling the ball of life to the top of some high peak of happiness see it roll down again into the valley of unhappiness and then have all their work to do over again if they wanted happiness again and this for ever and ever without any end to it
He wanted to find some state that would be permanent and lasting some kind of wellbeing that would not be lost again so that those who reached it once would not need any more to be always striving and struggling to get it again
And on this great night under the Bodhi Tree at Uruvela he was determined to find such a state of lasting wellbeing or perish in trying to find it
And now when Siddhattha wished to give the whole force of his mind to this great work his mind fought against his will and turned itself to dwell upon all the unlasting all the passing temporary delights and pleasure of life that he ever had tasted
He wanted to leave aside whole thoughts of worldly things and concentrate all his attention upon trying to find out how all things arise but his thoughts in spite of all he could do turned back to his former pleasant life and brought before his mind's eye the most attractive pictures of the happy life he used to live in his father's palace before he came out on this painful search for Truth
Again he saw before the eye of his mind the splendid rooms and halls of his palace its beautiful grounds and gardens its lovely lotusponds and bowers of delight and the many attendants who had nothing else to do but wait upon his will and minister to his pleasure
And then he saw his beautiful young wife her lovely pleading eyes her pleasant charming ways rose before him in vision her very voice so low and sweet sounded in his ears
And then he saw his little son his only child a merry little babe who might grow up to be a son of which any father might be proud
And he saw his father too greyhaired now and getting on in years and grieving that his eldest son was not beside him to help him to govern the country and take his place when soon he would have to give it up through sheer old age
With his mind's eye the princeascetic Siddhattha Gotama saw all this and his heart misgave him as the thought he did not wish to think forced itself into his mind
You might have had great glory and power as a famous king if you had stayed in household life like everybody else
But you have gone and left behind you all that sensible people prize and value in search of something nobody but yourself has ever even thought about something that perhaps never can be found at all perhaps does not even exist for anybody to find
How do you know you are not a fool or a madman to leave behind all these real solid things you certainly once had and enjoyed to look for something you cannot even be sure exists for you to find
But even if you so want to leave the good things of the world behind you and go in search of something beyond them which you think is better why could you not continue to search for it in the same way that other religious men search by fasting and mortification and the other religious practices all the other ascetics and religious men of the country follow
Is it likely that they are all wrong in their way of looking for religious truth and that only you are right
And any way why cannot you be content to gain the same kind of happiness they are content to gain even if it is not as lasting as you would like it to be
Life is short
Men soon die soon you too will die
Why do you not use the little time you have to live in getting all the pleasure you can out of it before the night of death comes on when you cannot have pleasure any more
There is love there is fame there is glory there is the praise of man all to be had if you try for them all solid certain things all of them things you can feel not dreams and visions made out of thin air
Why should you make yourself wretched in this lonely forest looking for something nobody has ever found
Thus did Siddhattha's thoughts torment him on that great night when he sat down beneath the Bodhi Tree to seek the way of deliverance from birth and death tormenting him with the keen memory of the pleasures he had left behind with doubts about his power ever to find what he sought with uncertainty about whether he was seeking it in the right way
But he did not allow himself to be turned from his purpose
Rather did he the more strenuously pull his mind together for a yet stronger effort to discover what he wanted
Begone Mara Evil One he cried
I know you who you are
You are the evil spirit that would keep men back from everything that is good and great and noble
Try no more to keep me back from what I have set out and am determined to do
My mind is made up
Here I sit until I have found what I seek even if I have to sit until all the blood in my body dries up and my flesh wastes all away and nothing is left of my but dry skin and bone
And there Siddhattha sat and still continued sitting striving and struggling laboring and wrestling with all his mind and will to find what would bring to an end all infelicity all undesirable and unpleasant things searching for what would end all evil things for ever and bring in their place a wellbeing a happiness that would not pass away a felicity that would be sure and lasting eternally beyond the reach of any change
And he was successful
After a time as he still persisted in his meditations putting away out of his thoughts all evil things that were trying to disturb him and distract his mind at length his mind became still and quiet like a still and quiet lake
It ceased to trouble him with memories and suggestions of pleasures he once had owned and enjoyed
It vexed him no more with doubts and uncertainties about what he now was seeking
In the calm close concentration of his mind now wholly calmed and collected in the intense power of his will now directed towards one thing only there where he sat under the Bodhi Tree Prince Siddhattha the ascetic of the face of the Sakyas of the family of Gotama became the Enlightened One the Awakened One the AllKnowing One he became Gotama the Buddha the bringer of the light of truth to the men of this epoch of the world to the whole human race that now lives on the earth
For now He was enlightened in a way compared with which all other men were stumbling and groping in the dark
Now He was awake in a way compared with which all other men are asleep and dreaming
Now He knew with a knowledge compared with which all that other men know is but a kind of ignorance
For now He had penetrated the real true meaning of life through and through from its root upward
Now He knew how and why men were born and died again and again and how they might cease thus to suffer repeated birth and death
But the first thing He saw clearly with His new and penetrating insight this night as He sat meditating under the Bodhi Tree was the long line of His own lives and deaths through ages after ages in all kinds of bodies in all kinds of conditions of life low and high humble and exalted gross and refined until at last He was born in this present life as the son of King Suddhodana and Queen Mahamaya
Then with His keen penetrating power of mind He next perceived how all men are born and pass away again to be born elsewhere anew strictly according to the deeds they do
He saw how some are born to happy lives because their deeds were good deeds and He saw how others were born to lives of unhappiness because the deeds they did were evil
He saw as plainly as anything that it is men's own actions and nothing else whatever which make them happy or unhappy in this and in all worlds
And then last and greatest of all He saw on this great night He saw and understood clearly beyond all doubt that is it not well for men always to be at the mercy of the continual changes of the world that it is not good that they should be now happy and now unhappy now up and now down like boats tossed on a sea
He perceived that the reason why men come in to existence to be thus tossed about on the waves of the changing world is because they are fond of and cling to all the little bits of happiness that existence in the world provides at times
He saw that men are caught in the snare of existence in the world because like deer they fling themselves greedily upon any little bit of pleasure they see
Then He saw that if men do not want to be caught in the snare of existence the only way for them to do is not to jump heedlessly upon every scrap of pleasure they see not to abandon themselves recklessly to its enjoyment not to set their hearts so eagerly upon the things existence offers
And then He saw the Way by following which men at length would be able to refrain from flinging themselves recklessly into enjoyment of pleasure because they would have learnt to know and like something better and so they would no longer be bound to come back to the world where such pleasures are found to the world of change and disappointment and uncertain happiness and would be able to attain the true and certain happiness of Nibbana
And this Way or Path He called the Noble Eightfold Path because it is the Path followed by everybody who has noble aims and desires and it has eight distinct branches or parts or members
The first branch or part or member of this Noble Eightfold Path to deliverance from all things evil taught by the Buddha is called  Right Seeing
This Right Seeing means to see that everything in the world even one's own existence is changeable not really solid and lasting and so only leads to disappointment and pain when we cling to it too closely
Right Seeing also means to see that good deeds always lead to happiness and evil deeds to unhappiness both here and hereafter
The second member of the Noble Eightfold Path was called by the Buddha  Right Mindedness
This means an attitude which because it sees rightly the nature of the world and everything in it turns away from clinging tightly to it
Right Mindedness also means a right attitude of mind in which we have pity and compassion for all beings who through clinging too close to worldly things are suffering distress of body or mind while at the same time we have a keen desire to relieve their suffering and help them as far as possible
Right Speaking the third part of the Buddha's Noble Eightfold Path means speaking only what is true and kindly and sensible
It means to avoid lying and rude and slanderous and silly talk
Right Doing the fourth part of the Noble Eightfold Path means to refrain from killing and stealing and impurity and the drinking of intoxicating liquors which make men mad and reckless so that they do things they otherwise would never have done
Right Living the fifth part of the Eightfold Path means earning one's living in any way that does not cause hurt or harm to any other living creature
Right Endeavor the sixth part of the Noble Eightfold Path means endeavoring trying to control one's thoughts and feelings in such a way that bad harmful thoughts and feelings may not arise and that those which unhappily may have arisen may die out
It also means trying to keep alive and strong in our minds all good and helpful thoughts and feelings that already are there and causing to arise in our minds and hearts as many as we can of new good and helpful thoughts and feelings
Right Remembering the seventh member of the Noble Eightfold Path means always remembering never forgetting what our bodies really are not thinking of them as finer and grander than they are actually
It also means remembering all the movements and actions and functions of the body as being just the movements and actions and functions of the body and nothing else beside
Right Remembering also means remembering what our minds are a constantly changing succession of thoughts and feelings in which nothing is the same for two moments together
And it means lastly bearing in mind and never forgetting the various steps Buddha has taught us we must take in order to set the mind free from all bondage and bring it at last to the state of perfect freedom  Nibbana
And Right Concentration the eight and last member of this Noble Eightfold Way to Nibbana made known by the Buddha means not allowing our minds to wander about as they like but fixing them firmly upon whatever we are thinking about so as to arrive in this way at a correct understanding of whatever we are trying to understand
Such are all the eight parts or members of the Noble Eightfold Path which Prince Siddhattha Gotama who now became the Buddha Gotama discovered under the Bodhi Tree at Uruvela twentyfive hundred years ago
The last three parts or members Right Endeavoring Right Remembering and Right Concentration in their full and perfect meaning are mainly intended to be practiced by men who are trying to follow the Buddha closely and in order to do this better and more easily have left the household life and become Bhikkhus
But every one whether he is a Bhikkhu or not can practice them to a certain extent as they are here described
The first two members of the Eightfold Path also Right Seeing and Right Mindedness in their full perfection are only possessed by those men who after many years of training and practice of meditations at last have come very near to understanding and realizing the true nature of things in the same way that the Buddha did
Yet still every one who wishes to follow the Buddha must have a little of Right Seeing and a little of Right Mindedness
They must think sometimes how all things round them are not really so fine and splendid as they often seem to be
And they must sometimes entertain in their minds the thought that some day they will turn away from the transient things of the world to something better to something more sure and lasting
But the three middle members of the Noble Eightfold Path are for everybody to practice to the fullest extent of their powers
Everyone ought to try to live without doing harm to any one either in word or in act
Every one ought to try and can try to avoid wrongspeaking and wrongdoing and according as they do this they prepare the way for some day controlling their thoughts and properly training their minds and so coming at last to true knowledge and insight that knowledge and insight which the Buddha discovered and teaches which is truly called Wisdom
And when they come to this true wisdom then the mind is delivered from clinging any more to anything in any world
And because it does not cling any more to such things therefore it does not any more for ever take shape or form in any world
That is to say For if there is no more being born into the world and so no more of all the troubles and unpleasant things that follow men who are born into the world and so the whole mass of distress of any kind is brought to an end for ever
All this the Buddha discovered beneath the Bodhi Tree He discovered the Noble Eightfold Path of Right Seeing and Right Mindedness of Right Speaking and Doing and Living of Right Endeavoring and Remembering and Concentration which is also called by the name of the Triple Path of Right Behavior Mindculture and Wisdom or in the Pali Sila Samadhi and Pañña
As a man who long has struggled to swim across a wide and stormy water and at length after much effort reaches the safe shore lies down awhile to rest his wearied limbs and look back with satisfaction on the dangers he has safely passed as a man who has climbed into the cool pleasant air of a high mountain slope when he gets there turns round pleased and contented and looks down upon the hot dusty plain whose stifling air he had left behind so now his long toil past his labors successfully accomplished there in the quiet wood of Uruvela the victor in this fierce fight rested Himself for a time enjoying the relief of release from toil and labor tasting in peace wellwon the fruits of truth and knowledge He had gained
Then having rested Himself sufficiently beneath the tree of victory Siddhattha Gotama now and henceforth Gotama the Buddha passed from under that tree and went towards another near by under which the goatherds of the place were accustomed to take shelter from the sun while they watched their flocks
As He sat resting here a Brahmin happened to come past that way and after the usual greetings to the ascetic under the goatherd's tree he said to Him Gotama what makes a man a real Brahmin
What qualities does he require to possess in order really to be a man of the highest caste
And the Buddha taking no notice of the proud Brahmin's rudeness in addressing Him by His family name of Gotama without any title of courtesy before it such as reverend Sir or the like pointedly replied to him in this verse
The Brahmin who has put away all evil Has put off pride is selfrestrained and pure Has learning follows out the Holy life He alone has the light to be called Brahmin He nothing has to do with worldly thing
And the Brahmin went away muttering to himself This ascetic Gotama knows me this ascetic Gotama knows me
A few days after this while the Buddha was still staying under the goatherd's tree two merchants who were going about the country selling their wares came along the road and seeing the ascetic sitting there under the goatherd's tree so calm and content enjoying its fruits in the peace and quietude it has brought him they offered Him an offering of the best food they had and struck by His noble and majestic look asked Him to accept them as believers in Him
These two merchants whose names were Tapussa and Bhallika were thus the first persons in the world who became the followers of the Buddha Gotama
But now having rested long enough the Buddha began to think about what He should do next
He had found the Truth He sought and now it seemed to Him that He ought not to keep such precious knowledge to Himself but that He ought to tell it to others so that they too might taste the comfort it brought
This was what He thought at first
But then other thoughts came into His mind
This doctrine of mine is not a very easy doctrine to understand he said to himself
It is deep and subtle
Only the thoughtful and reflective can grasp it fully so that it will do them good
But there are not many men who are thoughtful and reflective
The great majority of men do not want to take the trouble to think and reflect
They want something easy something that will amuse and entertain them
Their minds are inclined only to what promises to give them pleasure and delight
They are altogether given over to love of pleasure
If I were to preach this doctrine to them they would not know what I was talking about
They would not pay attention to me
I should only be giving myself trouble all for nothing
Thus did the Buddha consider within himself almost making up his mind not to tell the Truth He had found to anybody but just to keep it and enjoy it by Himself since it did not seem to Him that anybody else in the world would want to hear it or thank Him for telling them
However He did not stop at this point in His reflections or else the world would not know as it does today the Truth He taught
He went on to consider the matter further and this is what He next thought
Yes it is true that most of the people in the world will not want to hear this Truth I have found and would not understand it even if they did hear me tell about it they are so fond of what is easy and pleasant and comfortable and costs them no trouble
But still everybody in the world is not alike
There are sure to be some not very many but still some who are not satisfied with the way they are living now who want to know more than they know now who are not content to follow pleasure wherever it may lead them
What a pity it would be that I should know this Truth which would bring to these few comfort and happiness if only they heard it and yet never give them a chance to hear it
No I shall not do like that
I shall go forth now and make known to all men I meet these Four Noble Truths these Four Great Facts I have discovered of Ill and its Cause and its Cure and the Way in which it can be cured and among the many I speak to there will always be a few who will listen and listening understand me
Just as in a lotus pond where all kinds of lotus lilies are growing pink and blue and white many of them have grown only a little way about the muddy bottom of the pond and some have grown half way up through the water and some have reached the top of the water and rest there but a few grown up so as to lift their blossoms right out of and above the mud and water into the open air and the sunshine
So there are some beings whose minds are much sunk in the mud of passions and desires and there are some that are not so much sunk in that mud while some a few are only a little touched with the mud of passion
These last will be able to understand my teaching when they hear it
I will let them hear it
I will go forth now and preach it to all men everywhere
And then the Buddha began to consider who would be the best people to whom to tell His doctrine first who would be the most likely to listen to Him and quickly understand what He said
Then He thought about His old teacher Alara Kalama and how learned and thoughtful how quick in the brain how pure in his life he was
And He said to himself I will go and tell Alara Kalama first
He will very quickly understand
But as He was getting ready to go to Alara Kalama some one came and told Him that Alara Kalama was dead
The Buddha was very sorry to hear this for He felt sure that so good and so wise a man as His old teacher would have been sure to understand His doctrine as soon as he heard it
Then He began to think who else there was who would be likely to understand His doctrine
And the thought came to Him that perhaps the other teacher He had studied under in former days Uddaka the disciple of Rama would be a good person to whom to tell it for Uddaka too like Alara Kalama was quick to understand anything new when he was told it
But when He made enquiry where Uddaka was staying then He learned that he had died just the night before
So once more He had to consider who among all those He once had known would be most likely to listen to Him and understand the Truth He wanted to tell them
And then He remembered the five hermits who had waited upon Him and attended to Him so faithfully during the time when He was striving by Himself at Uruvela
After enquiring where they had gone to when they had left Him He learned that they were staying in a deerpark near the city of Benares
So rising up and leaving Uruvela the Buddha set out to walk to Benares about a hundred and fifty miles away to find His former attendants and disciples and tell them what He had found
And wandering on day after day from place to place at length one evening He drew near to the grove in the deerpark where those five ascetics were staying
And they say Him approaching in the distance and said to one another
Look yonder
There is that ascetic Gotama coming here  a luxurious fellow who gave up striving and fell back into a life of ease and comfort
Don't let us speak to Him
Don't let us show Him any respect
Let nobody go and offer to take His bowl or His extra robe from Him
We'll just leave a mat there for Him to sit on if He wants to and if He doesn't want He can stand
Who is going to attend on a goodfornothing ascetic like Him
However as the Buddha came nearer and nearer they began to notice that somehow He was not the same as He used to be in the days when they had lived with Him and studied under Him
There now was something about Him something noble and majestic such as they never had seen before
And almost in spite of themselves before they well knew what they were doing they had forgotten all they had just agreed on as to how they were going to receive Him
And one was hastening forward to meet Him and respectfully taking His bowl and robe from Him another busily preparing a seat for Him while a third hurried off and brought Him water for His feet
Then after He had taken the seat offered Him the Buddha spoke to them and said
Listen ascetics
I have found the way to deathlessness
Let me tell you
Let me teach you
And if you listen and learn and practice as I instruct you very soon you will know for yourselves not in some future life but here and now in this present lifetime that what I say is true
You will realize for yourselves the state that is beyond all lives and deaths
Naturally the five ascetics were very much astonished to hear their old master and teacher talking like this
They had seen Him give His hard life of going without proper food and rest they had seen Him cease as they thought from all efforts to find the Truth and here He was actually coming to them and telling them that He had found the Truth
They simply did not believe Him and they told Him so
Why friend Gotama they said when we were living with you you practiced all sorts of stern austerities and bodily mortifications such as were practiced by no other ascetic we ever heard of in the whole of India and that was why we took you for our master and teacher
Yet with all you did you never found out the Truth you wanted to find
How is it possible you can have found it now when you are living a life of luxury have ceased from striving and turned to live in ease and comfort
But the Buddha replied You are mistaken ascetics
I have not given up all efforts
I am not living a life of selfindulgence and idle comfort and ease
Listen to me
I really have attained supreme knowledge and insight
And I can teach it to you so that you also may attain to it and possess it for yourselves
But still the five ascetics could not believe what their old teacher now was telling them
It seemed to them impossible that such a thing could be true even though He begged them once more to listen to Him and believe what He said
Then when He saw that they did not believe Him when He said He found the Deathless He looked at them very earnestly very seriously and said
Listen ascetics
In all the time that you used to be with me did I ever say anything like this to you before
Did I ever before tell you that I had found the supreme knowledge and insight that leads beyond birth and death
Come answer me
The five ascetics had to answer the Buddha that it was true He had never said anything like this to them before
Very well urged the Buddha
Listen to me now when I tell you that I really have found the way to deathlessness
And let me show you what I have found
So gravely and impressively did the Buddha speak these words so gravely and impressively did He look at them as He spoke that the five ascetics found themselves unable any longer to refuse to listen to Him
They invited their old master and teacher to stay with them and teach them
So day after day during the next few months the Buddha taught these five old disciples of His the new Truth He had discovered
First He taught two out of the five while the other three went out with their begging bowls to the city and collected enough food for the whole six of them
Then these three stayed at the deerpark and were taught by the Buddha while the other two went out begging and brought back sufficient for them all
Thus the little party of the five pupils and their teacher lived happily together He teaching the other five busily learning and practicing until in a short time the whole five of them one after another reached and realized for themselves the Truth their Master had found
They came to know even while alive in this body the state that is called Nibbana
Out of these five ascetics the one who was the first thus to learn and realize for himself what his Master taught was called Kondañña
The names of the other four were Bhaddaka Assaji Vappa and Mahanama
These five ascetics were the first five Arahants that appeared in the world for Arahant is the name that is given to one who in this life in the body he now is in comes to realize the state that cannot be touched by birth and death the state that is called Nibbana
These five Arahants were the first members of the Sangha or Brotherhood of Bhikkhus who acknowledged the Buddha as master and teacher and guide for all their life
While the Buddha thus was staying in the deerpark at Isipatana there came to see Him a rich young man of the neighborhood called Yasa
And after the young man Yasa had heard the Buddha explain his teaching and what it led to he was so well pleased with what he heard that he became a Bhikkhu there and then and stayed on with the Buddha in order to hear and learn more
But towards evening that day an elderly man came to where the Buddha was and told Him that his son had left home that morning saying he was going to visit the Buddha but he had not come again and his mother was crying for him thinking that he must have been killed by robbers on the way
Then the Buddha told the man that his son had become a Bhikkhu and He began to explain His doctrine to the new Bhikkhu's father
And so well did He speak that when He had ended the father also asked to be allowed to become a Bhikkhu the same as his son had done and he too stayed with the Buddha and did not return home
And next morning when the Buddha and the new young Bhikkhu went to his mother's house for food she was quite pleased to learn that her son and her husband had become disciples of so great a teacher and she herself became a layfollower of the Buddha
After this four close friends of young Yasa when they saw what their companion had done also did the same and became Bhikkhus also disciples of the Buddha Gotama members of His Sangha
And in this way more and more young men became Bhikkhus until at last the Buddha had gathered round Him there at Isipatana a body of about sixty young Bhikkhus all of the best families and all of them eager and diligent in study and strenuous and persevering in practice under their Master's training so that in no very long time all of them had realized for themselves the supreme knowledge and insight and become Arahants
But the Buddha did not allow them to stay there with Him
Now that they had learned all He had to teach He told them that now they must go out and teach others so that these others who were ready to accept His teaching might hear It and learn It and be saved from all trouble and distress
Go forth He said to them and make known the Teaching which is excellent in its beginnings excellent in its progress and excellent in its goal
Proclaim the perfect life holy and pure
There are in the world beings not altogether blinded with the dust of passion and desire and if they do not learn my doctrine they will perish
They will listen to you they will understand
And the Buddha sent out these first sixty disciples not in pairs nor in groups of three or four
He sent them out one by one and each of them in a different direction so as to make sure that His teaching should be spread as far and wide as possible
And these sixty Arahants did as their Master told them to do and carried a knowledge of His Teaching and Discipline North and South and East and West
They were the first men in the world who went abroad into foreign countries for the sole purpose of spreading a knowledge of the religious truth they believed in
They were in fact the first duly appointed missionaries of a religion the world has seen
And they were brave men these first missionaries of the Buddha's religion
One of them came to the Buddha and told Him that he wanted to be sent to a certain country where everybody knew the people were very wild and rough
But what will you do there Bhikkhu said the Buddha when He heard his request if the people of the country abuse you and say all sorts of bad things about you
Then answered the Bhikkhu I shall say to myself 'These people are very good people they only use their tongues to me they do not beat me with their fists' But suppose they beat you with their fists Bhikkhu what will you do then asked the Buddha
Then I shall say to myself 'These people are very good people they do not thrash me with sticks' replied the Bhikkhu
But if they thrash you with sticks what then
Then I shall say that they are very good people they do not cut me with swords
And if they cut you with swords
Then I shall say they are very good they do not kill me
But if they make to kill you O Bhikkhu what will you do then said the Buddha
Then Lord said the Bhikkhu calmly I shall say to myself 'These people are doing me a great favor for this body of mine is an evil thing of which I shall be glad to be rid and these good people are going to rid me of it' Then the Buddha said
Go O Bhikkhu and make known my Teaching among these people
Bhikkhus like you are the proper kind of Bhikkhus to publish abroad my Doctrine among all the peoples and nations of the world
In the meantime the two merchants Tapussa and Bhallika the first men in the world to call themselves the followers of the Buddha had traveled on and in the course of their journeying come to Kapilavatthu
There they told everybody that they had seen Siddhattha the son of their king at Uruvela and that He had actually become as had been prophesied a very great religious teacher indeed the greatest religious teacher in the world an Awakened One a Buddha
And they said they had heard that He was coming soon to Kapilavatthu
And shortly after the Buddha had sent out the sixty Arahants to preach His Doctrine everywhere He himself also left the deerpark at Isipatana and turning Southwards in the direction of the Magadha country at length came back to Uruvela
Here he stayed for a time and entered into talk and discussions with a number of hermits who were living there under a leader called Kassapa
And after He had explained His Doctrine to them Kassapa himself their leader and teacher accepted the Buddha's doctrine as true and asked the Buddha to receive him into the Order of His Bhikkhus
And later on by meditating and practicing as the Buddha taught him he became an Arahant and after the Buddha had passed away he was one of the leading Arahants who maintained the doctrine in its original purity
But now leaving Uruvela the Buddha wandered on through the country towards Rajagaha the capital city of Magadha to keep His promise to its king Bimbisara that when He had found the Truth He would come and let him and his people know it
And King Bimbisara and his people received Him with great gladness now that He had become a Buddha
And in a grove of bamboo trees a little way outside the city He stayed many days teaching and preaching so kindly and so persuasively that the king and all his people accepted His teaching entirely and became His declared followers
And the king to show the respect in which he held the Buddha and His Teaching and the Brotherhood of Bhikkhus made Him a gift of the Bamboo Grove and of a fine Vihara he caused to be build there so that He and His Sangha would always have a comfortable place to live in during the rainy season
Now one morning as the Buddha left the Bamboo Grove to go into Rajagaha to beg alms of food He saw a young man all dripping wet as if he had just come from bathing standing in the roadway and bowing in each of the four directions East South West and North as well as to the sky overhead and to the ground beneath his feet at the same time throwing rice in each of these directions
The Buddha looked at the young man as he went through this strange performance on the public street and then He stopped and asked the young man why he was acting like that
The young man replied that he was only doing what his old father had asked him to do each morning so as to keep any evil from coming to him during each day from any of the four directions or from the gods above or from the demons below
It was his father's last wish spoken on his deathbed so he could not deny him his wish
And every day since his father had died he had faithfully observed his promise without missing a single morning
It is very right of you said the Buddha when He heard the young man's answer to keep the promise you made to your dying father and carry out his wish faithfully but what you are doing is not really what your father meant
When your father told you that you were to bow down to and make an offering of rice to the East he meant that you were to show respect and honor to those through whom you have come into life namely to your parents
By worshiping the South he meant worshiping and honoring your teachers through whom you get knowledge
By worshiping the West he meant cherishing and supporting wife and children
By worshiping the North he meant holding in esteem all relatives and friends and helping them where they have need of help
By worshiping the sky he meant worshiping and reverencing all that is good and holy and high
And by worshiping the earth he meant respecting the rights of every creature even the smallest and meanest that lives upon it
This is the way in which your father wished you to behave so that no harm would come to you any day from any quarter whatsoever
And there and then the Lord Buddha went on to give Sigala  for that was the name of the young man He was speaking to  some good counsel as to how he should live so as to make his own and other people's lives happy and fortunate here and now and in the future earn an equally happy and fortunate lot
He told Sigala to abstain from killing and stealing and lying and lewdness and the using of intoxicating drinks or hurtful drugs
He told him to avoid bad companions and cultivate the acquaintance of good people
He told him to work diligently so as to get wealth and then to take care of the wealth he earned but yet not to be greedy in keeping it all to himself nor yet foolish in throwing it away again on foolish objects but to use a fourth part of it in supporting himself and all depending on him his wife and family another fourth part in building up and extending his business further another fourth part in helping any one in need of help and the last fourth part he was to lay aside and keep in case misfortune should come to him and he should need help himself
Young Sigala listened respectfully to all the good counsel the Lord Buddha thus gave him
Then he confessed that when his father was living he had often told him about the Buddha and what a great and good teacher He was and had tried to get him to go and see the Buddha and hear Him preach but he always refused to go saying that is was too much trouble and would only weary him and that he had neither time nor money to spend on wandering ascetics like Gotama
And Sigala now asked the Buddha kindly to pardon him for his former neglect and to accept him as a follower for so he promised the Lord Buddha he meant to worship the six directions of space exactly in this right way which the Buddha had just taught him for all the rest of his life
The full account of all the Buddha said to Sigala that morning in the streets of Rajagaha can be read in the Sigalovada Sutta of the Samyutta Nikaya
Now about this time there was staying near Rajagaha a famous religious teacher called Sañjaya along with a large following of disciples and pupils numbering about two hundred in all
And among these twohundred disciples of Sañjaya there were two very close friends who were not at all satisfied with the teaching their master gave them
These two friends whose names were Upatissa and Kolita wanted to know something more than their teacher knew and taught they wanted to find that state which is beyond the power of death
They wanted to find what they called The Deathless And these two friends were so fond of one another that they always shared together what ever either of them got
And they made a solemn promise to each other that they would both search and study and meditate with all their power and try to find The Deathless and whichever of them found it first he would let the other know
Your coming and going brother are so serene and placid he said your face is so clear and bright very much would I like to know who is that teacher to follow whom you have left home and friends behind
What is your teacher's name
What is the doctrine he preaches
Upatissa however knew that it was not proper to ask questions of a stranger ascetic while he was busy begging his morning meal so he patiently walked on some way behind him as he passed in and out among the houses with his begging bowl but at last when the ascetic had gone round all the houses and now was going out of the city gate Upatissa went up to him and greeting him with respect humbly asked him if he would kindly tell him who was the teacher at whose feet he sat and learned
Your coming and going brother are so serene and placid he said your face is so clear and bright very much would I like to know who is that teacher to follow whom you have left home and friends behind
What is your teacher's name
What is the doctrine he preaches
I can soon tell you that brother said the ascetic pleasantly
There is a great ascetic of the Sakya race who has left his home and country behind in order to follow the homeless life
And it is to follow him that I have left the household life
It is that Blessed One who is my teacher
It is His teaching that I follow and practice
And what is that teaching Venerable Sir
What is it that your master teaches
I also would like to know it said Upatissa eagerly thinking that perhaps at last now he was going to hear from this ascetic about that Deathless for which he and his friend Kolita had been looking for so long
I am only a novice a newcomer into the Brotherhood of the Blessed One replied the ascetic modestly
It is only a little while ago since I began to study under the Blessed One and to follow His rules of discipline so I do not know very much yet about His Teaching
I cannot explain it to you in every little point
But if it is only the pith of His teaching that you want I can give you that just in a few words
That is all I want brother said Upatissa quickly
Tell me the substance
The substance is just what I want
What need to make a lot of words about it
Very well then said the ascetic
Listen
How all things here through Cause have come He hath made known the Awakened One
And how again they pass away That too the Great Recluse doth say
That was all the ascetic said
But as Upatissa stood there listening to him by the city gate in one great flash of insight there burst upon his mind in all its force and verity the great truth taught by all the Buddhas  the truth that everything that ever has come into existence or ever will come into existence inevitably unfailingly without exception must and will again Pass out of existence
Upatissa in this great moment saw clearly with his whole heart and mind that only whatever has not arisen never had come into existence can be free from the law that it must pass out of existence again must die
And he said to the ascetic If this is the doctrine you have learned from your teacher then indeed you have found the state that is free from sorrow free from death the state of the Sorrowless the Deathless which has not been made known to men for ages and ages Then with expressions of joyful gratitude he took leave of the ascetic who thus in a moment had brought light to his mind and he went off to find his friend Kolita and bring him the great news that at last he had found The Deathless
But just as he had seen the unknown ascetic from a distance and wondered at his impressive walk and behavior so now Kolita saw his friend Upatissa coming near and wondered what had made such a change in his whole appearance
And he said to him
Why brother how clear and shining your face is
Can it be brother that at last you have found The Deathless we both have been seeking so long
It is so brother it is so was Upatissa's glad reply
I have found the Deathless
But how brother how Kolita asked eagerly
Then Upatissa told his bosom friend Kolita about the unknown ascetic he had seen that morning begging in the streets  an ascetic all dressed in yellow and looking so calm and collected as he never had seen an ascetic look before
And how he had followed him out of the city gate and then asked him to tell him the secret of his peace and serenity
Then he repeated to Kolita the four line stanza the ascetic of the happy countenance had repeated to him
And there and then in a flash of perception Kolita also saw the Truth that the Deathless is that which never has arisen in this world of sights and sounds and scents and tastes and touches and ideas and because it never has so arisen therefore cannot pass away again cannot die
So these two friends with minds now happy and joyful went to the place where the Buddha was and asked to be allowed to take Him as their master and teacher henceforth instead of Anaya whom they now left
And the Buddha accepted them into the Brotherhood of His Bhikkhus and within a very short time they became the very foremost of the Buddha's disciples for their learning and practical knowledge
In fact these two friends Upatissa and Kolita became the two great Theras known to the world as Sariputta and Moggallana
And the name of the ascetic who told them the Doctrine of the Buddha in one little stanza or gatha of four lines only was Assaji
And ever afterwards this little stanza was known as Assaji's stanza
But it was not only Upatissa and Kolita who joined the Buddha's Order of Bhikkhus while he was staying at Rajagaha at this time
Many of the youths of the best families of Magadha left their homes their fathers and mothers and all their relations behind them and became the Bhikkhu disciples of the great Sakya teacher who was so different from the ordinary religious teachers of the country  so great and noble by birth and attainments and whose Teaching if followed to its end brought about the ceasing of all things evil
Indeed so many young men left their homes to follow the Sakya Sage the Buddha Gotama that the people of the country began to get alarmed and annoyed and some of them even got angry
And they went to the Buddha and complained saying that if things went on much longer as they were doing soon there would be no young men at all left in the country to live the household life
Soon they said there would be no more families no more wives and children and the whole country would go to ruin and become an empty wilderness for all the young men in the country would be Bhikkhus
So when the Buddha heard this complaint of the people He gave orders that after this no one was to come and follow Him as a Bhikkhu without first getting permission to do so from his father or mother or if his father and mother were dead then from his nearest relation whoever that might be
And when the people of Magadha heard of this new rule of the Buddha they were once more pleased and contented to have a Buddha in their midst and they gave Him and His Bhikkhus the best of everything they had got
And this new rule which the Buddha thus first gave out at Rajagaha with regard to Bhikkhus joining the Order is the one we find in the Vinaya Rules of the Sangha to this day
When the Buddha's father King Suddhodana heard that his son was now at Rajagaha he sent a messenger to tell Him that His father was now getting old and begged that He would come and let him see his son once more before he died
But the messenger he sent happened to arrive at Rajagaha just when the Buddha was preaching to the people
So he sat down and listened to the preaching till it was finished before trying to deliver his message
But what the Buddha said seemed to him so good and so true as he listened to it that when the discourse was ended in his pleasure and delight with it he had forgotten all about what he had come for he had forgotten the message King Suddhodana had sent him to take to his son the Buddha and instead of delivering it he remained with the Buddha so as to hear Him preach some more
King Suddhodana at Kapilavatthu meanwhile waited a long time for his messenger to come back and tell him what his son had said in reply to his message but no messenger came
Then he sent another messenger to take the same message to his son the Buddha and to see what had happened to his first messenger
But this second messenger also when he arrived found the Buddha preaching listened to His preaching became converted to His doctrine and remained with Him
Then King Suddhodana sent out a third messenger with his message and to see what had happened to the first two he had sent but the same thing happened to him as to the other two before him he did not come back with any answer
And so one after another King Suddhodana sent out other messengers until he had sent out nine altogether but none of them came back
They were also charmed by the Buddha's words that they forgot what they had been sent to say and stayed with the Buddha so as to hear more of His preaching
The King thought it was very strange that none of his messengers had come back with any answer
He asked Yasodhara his son's wife to try do what she could to get an answer from Him and to bring Him to Kapilavatthu
So now Yasodhara sent a messenger asking her husband to come and see her and Rahula who was a fine little boy seven years old
But the same thing happened to her messenger as happened to King Suddhodana's he was so pleased with the Buddha's preaching that he forgot the message he had been sent with and did not return
Then another and another messenger was sent by Yasodhara but none of them returned
All were captivated by the Buddha's words and remained with Him
And now Yasodhara did not know what more she could do to get her husband to come and see her and His son
Then King Suddhodana remembered that there was a young man about the court called Udayi who had formerly been the Buddha's favorite playmate when they both were boys together
And he thought that if he sent Udayi to tell his son that His old father wanted to see Him once more before he died perhaps He would listen to this old friend of His boyhood's days and come to Kapilavatthu
For of course neither the King nor Yasodhara knew that all the messengers they had sent before had never delivered their message at all
So now the friend of His youth Udayi was sent to ask the Buddha to come to Kapilavatthu and let everyone there see His face once more  His father His wife His son and all the people of the country who would have called Him their king one day if He had not gone away to become a religious teacher
And when Udayi came to Rajagaha he soon learned the real reason why King Suddhodana's and Princess Yasodhara's messengers had never come back
So Udayi stopped his ears while the preaching was going on for fear that he too might do as the others had done
But when the preaching was over he went to the Buddha and after greeting Him with profound reverence he told Him that His father and wife and son as well as all the people of Kapilavatthu were very very anxious to see the Buddha that had appeared in the world and asked Him out of compassion to come and visit them soon
Then the Buddha very kindly said that He would not refuse to gratify the wish of those who were His own people and that very soon He would go to Kapilavatthu and see them all
So Udayi hurried back to King Suddhodana bearing the news that He who before was Prince Siddhattha and now was the great the universally honored Buddha soon would be coming to the city to do the duty of a son to his father
Then every one in Kapilavatthu from the King downward was filled with joy to know that their prince who had left them seven long years ago and become a homeless beggar in order to follow the religious life had succeeded in His efforts to find the Truth and was now a Buddha a teacher not only of men but of the very gods and soon would be back among His own folk again to tell them what he had found
So they swept up all the streets of the city and made them clean as they never had been made clean before
They decorated all their houses with flowers and hung flags and streamers of many colored cloth along the streets and prepared to give their prince a reception worthy of the eldest son of their Raja and a great Buddha as well
And on the day when the Buddha was expected to arrive in the city the king sent out his best elephants decorated with all their royal ornaments along the road by which he thought his son would come in order that they might meet Him and conduct Him in regal state into the city of His fathers
Yasodhara also on this great day ordered her bearers to carry her litter out to the borders of the city so that she might meet her husband at the city gate
But as they were carrying her along the main street she saw ahead of her an ascetic dressed all in yellow who was going round from door to door with a bowl in his hand begging alms of fool
Who can that ascetic be she thought to herself
Never before have I seen a begging ascetic look so noble an dignified as this one does
He must be a very good and holy man But as she came nearer what was her surprise to find that the yellowrobed beggar was her own husband the father of her child the handsome Prince Siddhattha of former days
He was not handsome now in the way that he used to be handsome
About Him now there was something that was better than handsomeness something great and high and holy that made her get down out of her litter and bow low before His feet as He passed upon His silent way His eyes fixed on the ground not seeing her
But when she returned to the Palace and told the king her fatherinlaw in what way his son and her husband had come into the city as a beggar King Suddhodana was filled with humiliation and anger at the news
At once he ordered his charioteer to get the chariot ready and he drove furiously through the streets of the city towards the place where Yasodhara had told him she had seen her husband begging
When the king got there he found the Buddha calmly pacing along towards the Palace with a worshiping crowd all round Him
But the king's indignation and anger at his son's behavior in begging where He had the right to take all He wanted without asking leave remained as great as ever and he at once began to scold and upbraid Him
What is this I hear about you my son he cried
Was it for this that you left your father's home to come back begging your daily food like the commonest beggar in the kingdom  you the son of the king the heir to the throne
O my son you have this day disgraced me and the royal house to which you belong
When did any of your race and lineage do a thing like this
When did any of our family before beg his food like a common beggar
But the Buddha quietly answered his grieved indignant father Indeed my father this is how my race and lineage have always done
Your race have always been kings for as long as men can remember said King Suddhodana proudly
Not one of them ever did a thing like this
That is true my father the Buddha gently answered
But now I do not think of my earthly descent
Now I belong to the race of the Buddha of all time
It is of them that I speak when I say that I only do as my race has always done
For the Buddhas have always done like this and now as is only right and proper I do the same
And as the Buddha walked along beside his father towards the Palace He told him that He was not coming back to the home of His fathers by any means poor or empty handed
He told him that He was bringing back with Him a precious jewel the richest most precious jewel in the world the jewel of the security of Nibbana
And then He went on to tell His father all about that great security Nibbana and about the way in which it can be reached
And when He had come to the Palace He sat down and explained the Truth He had discovered so simply and persuasively that not only His father and Yasodhara and His son Rahula but all the people of Kapilavatthu became his followers and accepted His Teaching as true
And after a short time His son Rahula was ordained and became a member of the Order of Bhikkhus
The Buddha now began that career of continual teaching and preaching which lasted for fortyfour years during which time He wandered about principally in that part of Northern India where are now Oudh Bihar and the North Bengal
Except during the rainy season He very seldom stayed more than a day or two at any one place
And during the rainy season of each year He generally lived at the Bamboo Grove or Veluvana Vihara at Rajagaha that had been given Him by King Bimbisara or else at the Jetavana Vihara near Savatthi in the Kosala country which had been presented to Him by a very generous supporter of the Buddha and His Sangha whose name was Anathapindika
During these years the daily habits of the Buddha were somewhat as follows
He rose early in the morning before dawn and after making His toilet sat down and engaged in meditation for some time
Then when daylight was fully come He used to put His robe on decently over both shoulders and taking His almsbowl in hand go out to the village or town near which He happened to be staying at the time and with His eyes fixed on the ground pass from door to door waiting for and accepting in silence whatever the charitable might put into His bowl
Sometimes He went out on this round for alms alone by Himself sometimes he went accompanied by a body of His disciples who passed along in single file behind Him their bowls in their hands also and with the same modest and subdued demeanor
Occasionally when begging alone some supporter to whose door He came would invite Him to come in and eat His meal in their house
Such invitations He usually accepted taking the seat that had been prepared for Him and partaking of what was put in His bowl by the people of the house who meantime had taken it from Him and filled it with the best of everything they had
Then after finishing His meal and washing His hands He would speak to those present about His doctrine telling them about the benefit and advantage of doing good and the disadvantage and harm of doing evil both now and in the future and then He would rise and go back to the place where He happened to be staying at the time
There He would sit quiet waiting in a resthouse or under a tree near by until all the Bhikkhus living with Him at the time had finished their meal also and then He would retire to His own chamber where He would wash His feet coming out again afterwards to give an address to the Bhikkhus who meanwhile had assembled together in order to listen to Him and to exhort them to be diligent in learning the Doctrine and practicing the Discipline so as to attain to a realization of Nibbana here and now in this present life
After He had finished speaking some of the Bhikkhus would ask Him to give them a subject to meditate upon suitable to their individual character and the state of progress at which they had arrived and then the Buddha would tell them what would be best for them to meditate on that day giving them an easy or a difficult subject according as they were beginners or far advanced in their study and practice
Then the Bhikkhus would break up their gathering and each would go away by himself under a tree or to some retired spot in the fields and spend the afternoon there meditating upon the subject the Master had given each for meditation
The Buddha would now go back to His private room and if it was the hot season and by reason of the great heat He felt inclined to lie down for a little and rest He would do so with His mind composed and collected
Then being refreshed He would rise from His couch which simply consisted of His robe folded in four and laid on the floor of His room and He would begin to consider the people in the world and how best He could help them to gain final deliverance from everything evil
By this time the people from the village or town near which he was living perhaps would come to Him with offerings of one kind or another wishing at the same time to hear Him preach
So He would sit down and after accepting their gifts speak to them in such a nice easy way in a way so suited to the understanding of each person present whether rich or poor learned or unlearned that each of them would think that the Great Teacher was speaking specially to them to nobody else and when He had ended speaking they would all go away pleased and delighted with everything they had heard
When these visitors had thus gone the Buddha would then go and bathe in the Vihara somewhere or if there was a good bathingtank or pond near by go and bathe there and afterwards retire again to His private room and sitting down alone engage in meditation
By this time it would be coming on towards evening and now any Bhikkhus who did not belong to the company who were living with Him but were living somewhere else were free to come and see Him and get advice from him about their practice of meditation or ask Him to explain to them some points about the Doctrine which they did not fully understand
Such Bhikkhus were now received by Him and He gave them the counsel and advice they required and cleared up for them their difficulties in understanding with kind and helpful answers which sent them away cheered and encouraged and strengthened
And this the Buddha always did in the kindest and most patient and courteous manner
During all the fortyfour years of His life when He thus received Bhikkhus from other places nearly every day and answered their questions and solved their difficulties for them never once was He known to lose patience with any questioner or become annoyed or angry at anything any one said whether they were friendly or hostile still less did He ever become confused and confounded or unable to answer any question asked Him
He was always prepared to speak with all who came to Him whether honestly ask His help or only to try to trap Him in what He said
To those who really wanted help in their difficulties He gave helpful satisfying answers
And those who came to try to confuse and puzzle Him and trip Him up in His words very often came away full of admiration for His ready knowledge and wisdom some of them even becoming there and then His devoted followers for the rest of their life
The evening and the earlier part of the night is this was given to visitors
But now being a little weary of so much sitting all day the Buddha used to get to His feet and spend some time just pacing up and down to relieve and refresh His limbs
Then after walking back and forward like this for a while He would retire to His room and go to rest for the night
Thus during the fortyfour years of His career of teaching and preaching His doctrine did the Buddha spend each day when not actually engaged in traveling from one place to another always ready to help and instruct any one who desired His help and instructions in religious matters
But it was not only in religious but also in every day worldly affairs that He was sometimes able to do good with His practical wisdom to the people among whom He freely moved during these fortyfour years of active beneficent life
Thus once when He was staying at the Jetavana Vihara at Savatthi the people of Kapila and Koliya fell into a great and bitter dispute about the watering of their paddy fields
It was a time of drought
No rain had fallen for a long time and as a result the stream that ran between the fields of the Kapila folk on one side and the fields of the Koliya people on the other was almost dried up
There was only a very little water left in it
And each of these two peoples the Kapilas and the Koliyas wanted to get all the water there was for their own fields and to leave the others none
And they began to get ready to fight about it each party prepared to kill the people on the other side of the stream so as to get all the water in it for themselves
Now the Kapila people were the Buddha's own people and when He heard about this quarrel of theirs with the Koliyas He felt very sorry to think that they were going to kill other people and perhaps get killed themselves all for the sake of a little water
So He set out for the place where the angry people were gathered together all ready to fight with their weapons in their hands
And when He got there He spoke to them like this
Princes and warriors listen to what I am going to say and answer what I ask you truthfully
What is it you are getting ready to kill one another about
About the water in the stream here which we both want for our dry fields said the people of both banks of the stream
Yes said the Buddha but tell me truly
Which do you think is the more valuable  the little water in this stream or the blood in the veins of the many men especially that in the veins of princes and kings
The blood of men and especially the blood of princes and kings the people at once replied of course is much more valuable than the water of the stream
That being so the Buddha now said is it fit and proper to risk what is more precious and valuable for the sake of what is less precious and valuable
Nay indeed Lord the people replied it would not be fit and proper to risk what is more valuable for the sake of what is less valuable
If that is so concluded the Buddha go and conquer your anger put away your murderous weapons and come to a peaceable agreement among yourselves
And both the Kapila and the Koliya people now heartily ashamed of their foolishness and lack of good sense thus pointed out to them by the Lord Buddha did as He told them and agreed to share equally between them what water was in the stream and ever afterwards lived at peace with one another
Meanwhile the Buddha's father King Suddhodana fell very ill so like a good son the Buddha taking with Him His halfbrother Nanda who now was one of His Bhikkhus and Ananda and Sariputta and Moggallana went to visit and console His father in his illness
At first in his pleasure at seeing his beloved son again King Suddhodana grew a little better and everyone thought that he was going to get well altogether but the improvement lasted only a little while
He was getting too old now to have much strength for resisting sickness and a few days later the king became very ill again and to the grief of the whole kingdom passed away in death
Her husband now being dead Queen Mahapajapati the Buddha's own mother's sister who had brought Him up the same as if He had been her own child did not want to stay living in household life any longer
Mourning for her husband who had just died she wished henceforth to live a religious life just like a Bhikkhu under the guidance and instruction of her fosterson the Buddha
So along with a number of her ladies who did not want to part from their mistress but wished to go with her wherever she might go she went to the Buddha and asked Him if out of pity and compassion He would not allow women also to leave the household life the same as men and live under His guidance and instruction the same as the Bhikkhus
But although she entreated the Buddha three separate times to accept her and her ladies as female Bhikkhus under Him He begged her not to ask such a thing from him
And Queen Mahapajapati was very much grieved that her great wish should thus have been refused and bursting into tears she and her ladies left the Buddha's presence weeping
And now having waited at Kapilavatthu until the funeral ceremonies for his father were over the Buddha left the city and wandering on from place to place at length came to Vesali and took up His residence in the Vihara in the Great Wood there
Then Mahapajapati cut off her hair and putting on yellow robes along with a lot of her ladies she took the road to Vesali proceeding on foot from village to village until in due time she arrived at the Vihara in the Great Wood where the Buddha was staying
Then with her feet all swollen with her long walk and with the dust of the road still upon her sad and dejected she stood weeping outside the Vihara
And Ananda saw her standing there in such a pitiful condition and asked her what was the matter why she was crying
And she answered It is because O Ananda the Blessed One will not allow women to retire from the household life and live the homeless life under His Doctrine and Discipline
If that is so O daughter of the Gotama family said Ananda wait a moment and I will plead with the Blessed One that He may be pleased to allow women to live under His Doctrine and Discipline the same as the Bhikkhus do
And Ananda did as he promised Mahapajapati and going into the room where the Buddha was he humbly and respectfully asked the Buddha to have compassion on women and allow them to follow the homeless life under His guidance the same as men
Enough Ananda enough
Do not ask me any such thing was the Buddha's reply to him
But Ananda was not in the least daunted or discouraged
A second time and a third time he asked the Buddha the very same thing and each time he received the very same answer
Then Ananda thought to himself The Blessed One will not give permission for women to withdraw from household life under Him when He is asked direct but perhaps He may give permission if He is approached in another way
So he said to his Master
If women were to be allowed Reverend Lord to retire from the household life and follow the life of homelessness under the Doctrine and Discipline of the Tathagata would they be able to reach the four stages one after another of the Path of Holiness that leads to the Deathless to Nibbana
Yes Ananda was the Buddha's reply if women were to withdraw from household life and follow my Doctrine and Discipline they could reach Nibbana in this life they could become Arahants
If that is so said Ananda consider Reverend Lord what a great benefactress Mahapajapati of the Gotama family has been
She is the sister of the mother of the Blessed One and as fostermother as nurse as giver of mother's milk she reared and nurtured the Blessed One when His own mother died
Pray Reverend Lord allow women to withdraw from household life and live the homeless life under the Doctrine and Discipline made known to the world by the Tathagata
Well Ananda said the Buddha if Mahapajapati of the Gotama family is willing to accept and keep strictly these eight rules let this be considered as her ordination
And then the Buddha went on to tell Ananda that every women who wished to follow His Discipline must show respect to any Bhikkhu no matter how lately he may have been in the Order or how long she may have been in the Order and she must not live in any district where there are no Bhikkhus must listen to an admonition from an appointed Bhikkhu every Sabbath day must invite criticism of her behavior both from Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunis at the end of each Vassa if guilty of a serious offense must do penance towards both Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunis must spend a period of testing as a novice for two years before being fully ordained by a chapter composed of both Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunis must not speak evil in any way about any Bhikkhu and must not officially administer admonition to a Bhikkhu but must accept such admonition from a Bhikkhu
If Ananda said the Buddha in conclusion Mahapajapati is willing to obey these eight rules and to keep them as long as she lives then she may consider herself ordained as a female Bhikkhu or Bhikkhuni
Then Ananda took leave of the Buddha and went and told Mahapajapati all that the Buddha had said
And Mahapajapati glad and happy answered Ananda
O Ananda Reverend Sir just as a young woman or young man fond of personal adornment having bathed their head and got a wreath of beautiful sweetsmelling flowers would lift it up with both hands and place it on their head on that the noblest part of the body even so do I O Ananda Reverend Sir take up these eight rules never to break them as long as my life shall last
Then Ananda went back to where the Buddha was and greeting his Master respectfully he spoke to Him and said Mahapajapati of the Gotama family Reverend Lord accepts the eight strict rules laid upon her by the Blessed One
The sister of the mother of the Blessed One is now ordained a Bhikkhuni
But the Buddha said
Ananda not for long will this Doctrine and Discipline of mine endure among women who withdraw from the household life
Only for five hundred years will it so endure Ananda just as families in which there are many women and few men do not long hold out against thieves and robbers so where women take to the homeless life under a Doctrine and Discipline like mine it does not long endure
It will be with it as with a field of rice or sugarcane when mildew falls on it it will not flourish very long
And things happened exactly as the Buddha had foreseen
The proper ordination of women Bhikkhus or as they are correctly called Bhikkhunis died out about five hundred years after Mahapajapati thus became the first Bhikkhuni in the world there being no longer any Bhikkhunis then living who had been ten years in the Order and so able to confer ordination properly
As the Buddha went wandering here and there about the country along with His Bhikkhus everywhere He went the people came in crowds to see Him and to hear Him teach and preach and many were converted to belief in Him and in His Doctrine
But there were also going about the country in the same way that He did other religious teachers and some of these by doing very wonderful and extraordinary things sometimes attracted many people to go and see them do such things
And then these people stayed and listened to their preaching and sometimes believed in what they preached and became their followers
Now when the Buddha's Bhikkhus saw what was happening in this way they went to their Master and asked Him if He too would not do some wonderful and extraordinary thing just to show the simple jungle people that He was not inferior to these other religious teachers they were admiring because of the wonderful things they could do and so induce them to follow Him instead of the other religious teachers
But the Buddha answered the Bhikkhus who asked Him this that He would be ashamed to attract people to listen to Him and believe in Him just because He could do something extraordinary that would make them gape with astonishment something of the nature of what they would call a miracle
The only miracle said the Buddha which the Tathagatas perform is this  that when they find a man full of passion and craving they leave him free from passion and craving
When they find a man a slave to anger and hatred they leave him delivered from anger and hatred
When they find a man blinded with delusion and ignorance they open his eyes and leave him rid of delusion and ignorance
This is the only miracle They perform
Any other miracle They loathe and despise and shun
But now some one came and told the Buddha that Moggallana by the use of extraordinary power which he possessed more than any other of the Arahants had gone up to a high place difficult to get at and from it had brought down a very fine specially good bowl which a certain man had put on that high place in order to test Moggallana's power and see if he would be able to go there and get it
But the Buddha was very much displeased to hear about this that Moggallana had been doing and He sent for Moggallana and told him to bring with him the bowl he had got in this way by the exercise of his abnormal powers
And when Moggallana came with the bowl the Buddha took it from his hand and broke it into pieces before Moggallana and all the assembled Bhikkhus and strictly charged him that he must never on any account do such a thing again as show off his powers and that none of His Bhikkhus must ever do any kind of wonderful thing just to make simple ignorant people admire at them or if they did then they must at once leave His Brotherhood of Bhikkhus they could not be allowed to remain with Him as His followers
And this particular command of the Buddha about wonderworking remains to this day as one of the Vinaya rules for the breaking of which a Bhikkhu is at once put out of the Order and cannot be taken back into it
For a Bhikkhu to perform or even claim to be able to perform any supernormal feat is a Parajika or Great Offense as seriously looked upon as murder or theft or unchastity and if he does such a thing he must leave the Order at once
Thus the Buddha never tried to astonish the people by doing any wonderful deeds and after this affair with Moggallana neither he nor any other of the Bhikkhus ever tried to do any
Yet in spite of this the people clearly saw and felt that the Buddha was a great teacher and they showed their respect and veneration for Him wherever He went by providing plentifully for the wants of Himself and His company of Bhikkhus who went about everywhere with Him
And many of the followers of the other religious teachers did not like to see this at all
They were very much annoyed to see how the people went to these new yellowrobed ascetics of the Sakya ascetic Gotama to hear them preach and to give them the best of food and medicines while they neglected them and their teachers
Thus once when the Buddha and His Bhikkhus came to the town of Kosambi where there lives a wellknown religious teacher along with a large company of disciples these latter began to abuse and revile the Bhikkhus and followers of the Buddha in the most outrageous manner calling them all sorts of abusive and wicked names
Then Ananda came to the Buddha and told his Master what these other ascetics were saying about the Buddha's Bhikkhus and how they used the most shameful language about them and heaped the coarsest abuse upon them whenever they met them anywhere but especially when they met them going out with their beggingbowls to collect alms of food
And on behalf of all the Bhikkhus who had asked him to speak to the Buddha about the matter he asked the Buddha if He did not think it would be better for Him and them to leave Kosambi and go somewhere else where they would not have to listen to such abuse every day when they went out begging
The Buddha quietly listened to all Ananda had to say
Then He spoke and said
But suppose Ananda that we are illtreated and abused in the next place we go what shall we do then
Then we shall go to some other place said Ananda
And if we are reviled and miscalled in that new place too what shall we do then
Then we shall go to some other place replied Ananda
The Buddha sat silent for a little while then with a gently glance at Ananda He said
O Ananda a little patience properly exercised now will save us all the trouble of so much moving about
We cannot say for certain that we shall find the peace we want in any new place we may go to but we are sure to find it just where we are if only we practice patience
By patience and forbearance those that are wise overcome all their enemies
Look at the elephant that men use in war Ananda
He plunges into the thick of the fighting and pays no attention to the darts and arrows and javelins that are hurled at him from all sides but rushes on sweeping away everything from before him
And I Ananda am going to imitate that elephant
I shall stay here in this town and preach my excellent doctrine with all my force and power and labor without ceasing to deliver wretched men from the net of passion in which they are entangled and caught fast
I shall not pay the least attention to the abuse these other ascetics hurl at me and my disciples
Like men who spit up at the sky thinking they are going to dirty it only to find that their spit does not touch the sky at all or dirty it but only falls back on and dirties themselves so these poor men who spit abuse at us will only find their abuse come back on themselves if we pay no attention to it
So notwithstanding the request and wishes of Ananda and all the other Bhikkhus the Buddha still stayed on at Kosambi and the good result of His practice of patience and forbearance was soon seen
For when the people of Kosambi saw how meekly He and His Bhikkhus endured the bad language of the other ascetics without ever answering them back in the same way they became displeased with the other ascetics for abusing men who never abused them
And many of the young men of Kosambi admired the behavior of the Buddha and His Bhikkhus in this respect so much that they became His followers and joined the Order of Bhikkhus
Unfortunately however these Kosambi youths did not in becoming Bhikkhus at once get rid of their quarrelsome dispositions and very soon they were involved in a bitter dispute among themselves about some small point in what they considered correct Bhikkhu behavior
Some maintained one thing and some maintained another and although the Buddha repeatedly admonished them to live at peace with one another and not quarrel they still kept on wrangling
They paid no attention to the Buddha when He told them that quarreling and illwill were greater evils than the little fault in behavior about which all their disputing arose
So when the Buddha saw that they were not going to listen to Him or take His advice He went away from Kosambi by Himself leaving all the Bhikkhus there behind Him
Then the people of Kosambi when they saw that the Great Teacher had gone away by Himself and that the Bhikkhus He had left behind were behaving just like common worldly people who had not left the household life t become ascetics quarreling and wrangling no different from householders they stopped putting any food in the bowls of the quarrelsome Bhikkhus when they came round begging in the mornings
This step very quickly brought the squabbling Bhikkhus to their senses
They made up their quarrel came to peace again with one another and the Buddha once more allowed them to join Him and go with Him wherever He went
As the son of a king and so accustomed to the manners of a royal court the Buddha was perfectly at home entirely at his ease in the company of the greatest kings and warriors and priests and could hold His own in conversation with any of them even the most learned and send them away pleased and delighted with what they had heard from Him
But He was equally as well able to speak in a manner common people could understand and as He wandered about the country on foot was always ready to talk to any one He happened to meet  farmers blacksmiths wheelwrights barbers anybody who liked to speak to Him
Thus one day as he was traveling through a district covered with paddy fields He fell in with a farmer at work in his field and stopped and began talking to him about his cattle and plowing and seed and about how he expected his crop to turn out this year
You know He said to the farmer I am a farmer too and I have got all the things needed for working my fields and the seed as well
You a farmer said the surprised cultivator
Where then have you left your bullocks your plow and the other things you need
I have got them all with me here said the Buddha calmly
Listen to me and I'll tell you all about it
My seed is the warm desire and feeling of compassion which caused me to resolve to become a Buddha as also the knowledge which I obtained under the Bodhi Tree
The rain that watered my seed and made it grow richly and abundantly was the constant good deeds I did until I became a Buddha
My knowledge is the yoke and wisdom the shaft of my plow
My heart is the reins with which I guide my bullocks
My plowshares is the diligence with which I get rid of all evil things in me
The handle of my plow is the Doctrine which enables me to remove all that is bad and promote all that is good
When you go plowing you cut up and overthrow all bad weeds so he who has learned the Four Noble Truths cuts up and overthrows all evil inclinations within him
At night when your day's work is done you unyoke your bullocks and let them go wherever they like
In the same way the wise men in cleaving to what is perfect lets go whatever is not perfect
Your bullocks have to strain and toil in order to do their work of plowing your fields and in the same way the wise man has to strive with all his strength and turn over the soil of his own nature so as to reach Nibbana
The cultivator works hard in order to prepare his field for the seed and in the same way the wise man has to work hard to get rid of the ills of existence
But the man who works in the paddy fields is often disappointed in the size of the crops he gets as the outcome of his toil and sometimes he has to go hungry
But whoever works in the fields of wisdom never is disappointed he is sure to reap the full results of his labors he is entirely happy perfectly satisfied when he comes in sight of Nibbana
In this way it is O farmer that I am a farmer also
And this too is the way in which I do my work
And the cultivator to whom the Buddha spoke this little sermon was so well pleased with it that he asked the Buddha there and then to accept him as a cultivator in the field of His Good Doctrine and he became a follower of the Buddha for the rest of his life
To another person who came to the Buddha and asked to be told the way in which common people might reach the best and happiest state the state of Nibbana the Buddha gave these simple instructions
Avoid the company of the foolish cultivate the companionship of the wise
Show respect to those who are worthy of respect
Remain in a position that is in accordance with your abilities
Always perform meritorious deeds
Constantly aim at perfect behavior
Take pleasure in hearing and seeing all you can so as to acquire knowledge
Study everything that is not evil
Acquire a knowledge of what ought to be shunned
Speak only what is true kindly and profitable
Be kind to and support father and mother
Care for and cherish wife and children
Resist temptation to do evil
Give alms
Observe the rules of right conduct
Assist relatives and friends when they are in need of assistance
Do nothing that is not permitted by the law of good
Abstain from intoxicating drinks or drugs
Do not be slow in doing good deeds when an opportunity to do them arises
Be courteous to all men
Be humble
Be easily satisfied
Acknowledge kindness received with gratitude
Listen to the preaching of the Doctrine in proper season
Be patient and forbearing
Take pleasure in profitable conversation
From time to time visit those who lead the holy life
Converse with them on religious subjects
Practice virtuous behavior
Bear in mind the Four Noble Truths
Keep ever before the mind's eye the goal of Nibbana
In the midst of every affliction be unshaken unperturbed fearless and composed
Who observes these perfect rules shall never be overcome by evil he will always enjoy perfect peace of mind
On another day when the Buddha was resting in a little village the people of the place came to him and said
Reverend Sir we know that you are a great religious teacher and have taught much that is good to those disciples of your who follow you about and live the homeless life just as you do yourself
But we are not ascetics
We are just common folk who love our wives and children and earn our living cultivating our fields and breeding cattle and we take whatever innocent enjoyment comes our way
We use gold and silver
We like to ornament ourselves on holidays and feast days with jewelry and flowers
We use oils and perfumes to make our bodies pleasant to us
We follow the ordinary ways of the world
Now Reverend Sir if there is anything in your teaching that would be good for us to know anything that would help us to be happy here and now as well as in the future be pleased Reverend Sir to let us hear that part of your teaching so that we may follow it and get the benefit of it
Well villagers said the Buddha there are four things which a teacher like myself has to teach which are good for you and everybody who is not an ascetic to know and observe
Listen and I will tell you about them
First Whatever may be the employment by which you earn your living in that business you ought always to do your best to make yourselves efficient
If you are a farmer you should try to be a good farmer and make your fields grow all they can
If you are a merchant you should try to be a wideawake and enterprising merchant
If you are a servant you should try to be a reliable and trustworthy servant
Be active and energetic always so as to get the best and fullest results from what you do whatever it may be
In this way you will acquire wealth and be able to do good with it  to help any one who may need help
For it you do not acquire wealth by working for it you will not be able to do good deeds and help others for you will have nothing with which to help them
Second You ought to take proper care of your wealth after you have got it and not waste it in foolish ways
It is of no use to put water in a jar out of which it is allowed to run away again through a hold in the jar
It is good to get wealth but it is every bit as necessary to see to it that when it is got it is not lost again in all sorts of foolish and wasteful ways
Third People in worldly life should choose only good people for their friends and associates
People mostly become like the kind of people they mix with
If a man goes with good men he has a good chance of becoming a good man himself
And if he goes with bad men he is very likely to become bad too
You cannot touch black things without getting your fingers made black
So household folk should frequent the company of others who are good and wise and liberal and full of faith in what is good and then they also will be likely to become good and wise and liberal and full of faith in what is good
Fourth The householder should follow a regular and moderate way of living
He should not be extreme or extravagant in his way of life
He should not spend or give more than what he gets as income
If he does his wealth will be like a pond that has more streams running out of it than it has running into it
Such a pond very soon will run dry and have no water in it at all
And very soon a man who pays out more then comes in to him will have no more wealth
But if a man takes care to spend on himself and his family or give away in charity always a little less than his income then the pond of his wealth will never run dry
There will always be some water that is some wealth in it for use when any sudden need for it arises
But this does not mean that he is not to make full use of his wealth
It does not mean that he is to heap it up and hide it away and not use it
A man who does that is like one who has a tree full of fruit in his garden but instead of eating the fruit when it becomes ripe puts it all away in a box to keep it there
Such a man will find that all his fruit will go rotten and he will get no good of it at all
These then O householders said the Buddha in concluding this sermon are the four things that will promote your success and wellbeing in this world if you observe them
And now I will tell you what are the four things which will promote your best good in the future
They are first Faith in the teaching that the doing of good will bring good results and the doing of evil evil results
Second The constant practice of good deeds and the avoiding of evil deeds such as killing stealing lying lewdness and drinking intoxicating drinks
Third The practice of liberality in giving so as to learn not to cling too closely to the things of the world
Fourth The acquiring of wisdom so as to know and follow the path that leads to Nibbana
Such was the sermon which the Lord Buddha delivered to these country villagers who wanted to know what ordinary household folk not Bhikkhus or ascetics could do to make sure of their wellbeing both here and hereafter
And they were all very much pleased with the plain practical advice which the Buddha gave them
One of the longest discourses ever delivered was spoken not to common folk nor yet to His Bhikkhus but to no less a person than a king King Ajatasattu of Magadha
This King Ajatasattu was not a good man he was indeed a murderer
He caused his own father King Bimbisara who had been one of the first friends of the Buddha when he became Buddha to be starved to death and in this cruel and unrighteous manner came to the throne himself
It happened that one night of the full moon King Ajatasattu sitting on the terrace of his palace did not know what to do for entertainment and decided that he would go and visit the Buddha who was then staying in a garden not too far away that had been given to Him and His Bhikkhus by the good physician Jivaka
When the king got to where the Buddha was he found Him sitting quietly with all his Bhikkhus round Him in the preaching hall
The king exchanged the usual greetings of courtesy with the Buddha and after taking a seat asked the Great Teacher if he could tell what was the benefit or advantage of living like an ascetic
What profit is it to a man to live like a Bhikkhu said King Ajatasattu
I have asked several other leaders of ascetics this question but I have never received a satisfying answer from any one of them
They always answered by telling me about something else I did not ask about
It was as if a person should enquire about breadfruit and in reply be told all about mangoes
So I shall be highly pleased Reverend Sir to hear what you will say in reply to this question of mine
Then the Buddha after a few words exchanged back and forth proceeded to tell King Ajatasattu at great length all the benefits that come to a man both in this life and afterwards through becoming a Bhikkhu and He did it so well that when He had ended His long discourse Ajatasattu declared himself entirely satisfied that what the Buddha had answered was true and that it was the best thing in the world to be a Bhikkhu if a man could be one honestly and sincerely and follow so great and good a teacher as the Buddha
And he asked the Buddha to look upon him henceforth as a follower of His and not of any other religious teacher
After the King had gone away again the Buddha said to the Bhikkhus round Him
O Bhikkhus this king was much moved in his mind just now as I was speaking to him
If O Bhikkhus this king had not done that evil deed had not caused the death of his father the just king there where he sat just now he would have seen the Truth with clear eyes and left his throne and everything behind him and become a Bhikkhu and an Arahant
This the longest sermon the Buddha ever spoke can be read in its complete form in the Digha Nikaya of the Sutta Pitaka
It is called the Samaññaphala Sutta or the Discourse concerning the fruit of the life of an ascetic
And here is the shortest sermon the Lord Buddha ever delivered
Some one once asked the Buddha What is the best thing anybody can give as alms
What thing has the best taste
What thing gives the most pleasure
What thing is best fitted to bring passion to and end And the Buddha replied to all these four questions with just this one word Dhamma
Of course His questioner then asked Him to explain a little more what He meant and the Buddha then said
The giving of alms though it is a good thing to do cannot by itself bring a man on to the Path that leads to Deliverance only the Dhamma can do this
Therefore the making known of the Dhamma the trouble a man takes to give a knowledge of the Dhamma to others  this is the best kind of giving this is the best kind of alms
Also through learning the Dhamma the heart is filled with joy and the mind delighted with its sweet taste because it destroys all those passions in men which cause them suffering and brings them at last to the final end of all sufferings  to supreme Nibbana
Therefore the Dhamma is the most sweet tasting of all things and the most pleasing of all things and the best thing in the world for putting passion to an end
And so my disciples preach the Dhamma to all mankind and thus you will be giving the very best of alms to all beings that live on the earth or in the heavens
Upon one occasion when the Buddha was known to be going to deliver a discourse in a village where he had rested overnight a poor farmer  a Brahmin  living nearby made up his mind to be present and hear the Great Teacher speak
But to his dismay on the morning of the day when the Buddha was to preach he found that one of his bullocks was missing
He was only a poor man and could not afford to lose it so he set off at once into the jungle all round to look for it hoping that he would soon find it and be able to get back to the village before the time when the preaching was to begin
But the bullock had wandered further away than he expected and although he made all the haste he could searching here there and everywhere wherever he thought his bullock might have got to it was some time after midday before he found it and got back to the village
He was very hungry and very tired with running about all the morning under the hot sun but he did not want to miss hearing the Great Teacher speak so without waiting to take a rest or get anything to eat he hurried to the place where the Buddha was hoping he would still be in time to hear the end of the sermon at least
But when he got to the preaching place what was his surprise to find that the sermon had not even begun
There in the preaching hall the Buddha sat silent with all the people round Him patiently waiting for Him to begin
Pleased and thankful to find that he was still in time the farmer crept quietly in at the back of the hall to look for a seat there
But as soon as he came in at the door the Buddha saw him and kindly asked him if he had had anything to eat
The farmer replied that he had only just come back from looking for a bullock he had lost and he had not stopped to eat anything because he did not want to miss the sermon
On hearing this the Buddha ordered one of His supporters near Him to give the farmer some food and He would wait for him to finish his breakfast before beginning the sermon
Then when the farmer had satisfied his hunger and taken a seat near Him the Buddha began His discourse and the farmer knew that the Buddha had somehow heard that he wanted to hear Him preach and had sat silent in the preaching hall keeping everybody waiting until he should arrive
Some of the people and the Bhikkhus thought it was very strange and not quite right that the Buddha should concern Himself about the food of a person who was only a householder not a Bhikkhu and not even a follower of His at all but a Brahmin
But the Buddha's kindness and thoughtfulness for the Brahmin who wanted so much to hear Him preach was well rewarded for the Brahmin's heart was touched by the Buddha's consideration for him and when the sermon was over he became the Buddha's follower for the rest of his life
On another occasion the Buddha again showed His kind consideration for common people this time for a young girl
In the town near which He then was staying there lived a weaver with one daughter who used to help him with his work
This girl was very anxious to hear the Buddha preach but on the very day when the Buddha was to give His discourse it happened that she and her father had an urgent piece of work which they had to get finished that very day for an important customer
So the girl made up her mind to hurry with her part of the work so that she might be able both to finish it and also hear the Great Teacher's sermon
Instantly she set to her task and wound up all her yarn on a quill and took it along intending to carry it to the shed where her father had his loom
But on the way to the shed she had to pass near the place where the crowd sat motionless waiting for the words that were to fall from the Teacher's lips
And the girl laid her quill of yarn down and timidly took a seat behind the last row of the assembled congregation
But the Buddha saw that the young girl was ready to understand and follow His teaching and He called to her to come nearer where she could hear better so that she might not miss anything He said
The girl came forward and to put her at ease the Buddha encouragingly asked her where she was coming from and where she was going to
The young girl thus questioned replied that she knew where she was coming from and also where she was going to but at the same time said she I am ignorant Reverend Sir of the place where I came from and the place to which I am going
When the people present heard her give this strange answer to the Buddha's question they became very indignant for they thought she was trying to make fun of the Great Teacher and they began to murmur and talk about putting her out of the hall for what they thought her gross impertinence
But the Buddha saw what the young girl was really thinking about in making this strange reply to His question and He told the people to keep still
Then turning to the girl He asked her what she meant
And the girl spoke and said I know that I was coming from my father's house and that I was going to our weavingshed
But what existence I have come from into this present existence  that I do not know at all
Neither am I sure about the existence that will follow after this one
Of these two things I am quite ignorant
My mind can discover nothing about either the one or the other
Then the Buddha and every one present praised the wisdom and insight of the young girl and the Buddha began His sermon
And when it was finished the young girl having listened eagerly and attentively to it all she became one who has taken the first step on the Higher Path she became what is called a Sotapanna  that is one who has entered the stream that eventually without fail will carry her on to Nibbana
On another day as the Buddha was walking through a wood He happened to come upon a deer struggling in a snare that had been set by a hunter
The Buddha at once went forward and released the struggling animal and let it run away
Then He sat down under a tree near by to rest
And by and by the hunter came along and saw at a glance that a deer had been caught in his snare and that somebody had released it letting it get away again
And when he looked round to see who it might be his eye fell on the ascetic dressed all in yellow who was sitting under a tree near by
The hunter knew at once that this must be the person who had caused him to lose his deer
There are getting to be too many of these holy men he said to himself in great anger
They are always sneaking about everywhere spoiling honest men's business with their pious ways And in his rage he lifted his bow fitted an arrow to the bowstring and taking good aim at the Buddha who meanwhile sat perfectly quite let fly
I am going now to make one less of them anyway said the hunter
But his hand trembled so much as he took aim at this so strangely serene ascetic that his arrow missed
Never in his life before had he missed anything he aimed at so close and full of anger at himself now he aimed another arrow at the Lord Buddha and missed again
Astounded at his sudden poor skill in shooting once more he shot an arrow at the Buddha and once more missed
Then with a feeling very much like fear he dropped his bow and arrows and going up to the Buddha humbly asked Him who He was
The Buddha told him and then very mildly and gently began to talk to him about the evil of taking life which it is so very easy to take but so very hard to give back again once it is taken
And the hunter listened to the Lord Buddha's words and was so much impressed by them that he there and them promised never again to kill any living thing at all but henceforth as the Buddha wished him to do earn his living in some way that did not involve the hurting of any living creature
Another man who took life and was turned from that evil way of doing by the Buddha was called Angulimala
The life that this man took however was human life
And he had received his name of Angulimala which means garland of fingers because he had killed ninetynine people and cut a finger off each person he killed and strung it on a chain of fingers that he had hung around his neck
And now he was waiting by the roadside for another person to come along whom he also meant to kill so as to get the hundredth finger he wanted for his ghastly necklace
And it happened that the Buddha came along the road as he was waiting thus
He thought it was just an ordinary ascetic and he meant to kill Him and get the hundredth finger he wanted
And he too Angulimala just like the hunter three times tried to get at the Buddha to kill Him and three times just like the hunter he failed
Then very much astonished he went up to the Buddha and began to speak to Him
And the Buddha did not utter a single word of reproach to him for trying to kill Him but instead told him about the Doctrine
And after thus hearing about the Doctrine from the Buddha's own lips Angulimala confessed his wickedness in killing so many people and became a Bhikkhu
And not long after through diligent study and practice he became an Arahant
But this did not free him from having to suffer the consequences of his evil deeds
For when he went into the town of Savatthi with his begging bowl to gather alms of food the people of the town pelted him with stones and hurt him so severely that in a short time he died
But he was not dejected or sorrowful at this that had happened to him
Neither was he angry at all at the people who had stoned him
He knew quite well that he was only suffering the results of his own ill deeds and that it was far better to suffer like this at once and be done with it than to have the consequences of his wrongdoing always hanging over his head in the future
So Angulimala died calmly and serenely and passed away to Nibbana
The Buddha had one disciple whom He particularly loved and who in return had a specially warm affection for his Master and that was His own cousin Ananda
Indeed when the Buddha had reached the age of fiftyone and was beginning to feel the burden of His advancing years He chose Ananda to be His special private attendant giving out through Ananda any orders He wished made known to the other Bhikkhus
The other Bhikkhus also when they wished to see the Buddha about any special matter always asked first through Ananda
And often when there was something they wanted from the Buddha which they did feel very sure they would not get if they asked for it themselves they used to get Ananda to ask it from the Buddha on their behalf for they knew that He was fond of Ananda and would be more likely to do what they wanted if Ananda spoke in favor of it
But the Buddha had another cousin who also had become a Bhikkhu under Him but in his disposition towards is teacher and master was the very opposite of Ananda
Far from taking delight in waiting upon the Buddha and serving Him faithfully he was envious and jealous of Him and wished to break up the Brotherhood of Bhikkhus He gathered round Him
The evildisposed cousin of the Buddha was Devadatta
Being of the royal family of Kapilavatthu he was inclined to be proud of himself and of the royal blood in his veins
So when some time after he had become a Bhikkhu Sariputta and Moggallana joined the Order and on account of their great learning and ability every one began to take much notice of them and call them the right and the left hand of the Buddha Devadatta became very jealous of them now and annoyed and angry at the attention received by these two Bhikkhus who had not been in the Order as long as he and were just of a common family while he was of royal blood and the Buddha's cousin to boot
Indeed Devadatta became so angry at what he considered the unjust neglect of himself in favor of these two newcomers that he left the company of Bhikkhus who went with the Buddha everywhere He went and set off for Rajagaha where he expected to make friends with the young Prince Ajatasattu the son of King Bimbisara of Magadha and heir to the throne
When he got to Rajagaha he put on a look of great gravity and solemnity so that young Prince Ajatasattu was quite struck with his appearance and thought How serious and solemn he looks
This must be a very good Bhikkhu indeed And in his great admiration for the seriouslooking Devadatta he built for him a fine Vihara near the city and Devadatta took up his residence there and the Prince became his obedient and devoted supporter
Time passed and a few years after this when in the course of His continual wanderings the Buddha came again to Rajagaha Devadatta went to pay Him a visit and asked to be allowed to form a company of Bhikkhus of his own separate from those who accepted the Buddha as their Master
The Buddha however refused to give Devadatta the permission he asked for saying that it was not a good thing for the Sangha to be divided
But Devadatta was bent upon having his own way and he asked and asked again for permission to have a Sangha of his own but each time the Buddha refused to grant him his wish
Then Devadatta's jealousy and envy turned to bitter hatred of the Buddha and he made up his mind to start a Sangha of his own whether the Buddha gave him permission to do so or not
In this resolve of his he succeeded in getting Prince Ajatasattu to support him but the Prince's father King Bimbisara altogether refused to have anything to do with his plan for a new Sangha and firmly took the side of the Buddha in the matter
And now Devadatta pretending to be very pious and strict in his life worked his way completely into the confidence of Prince Ajatasattu and gained such an influence over him that he was ready to do anything Devadatta told him to do
And when Devadatta saw that he could do anything he liked with Ajatasattu he told him to put his father out of the way and then he himself would be the King of Magadha and be able to do what he pleased with no one to hinder him and he could help him Devadatta to carry out his scheme for a new Sangha
And Ajatasattu did what his evil counselor Devadatta thus advised him to do but not suddenly with an arrow or a sword for he still felt afraid to shed his father's blood
Yet he did kill his father and in a very cruel way
For he caused his father to be captured and shut up in a prison and given no food so that King Bimbisara died a slow miserable death by starvation in spite of all his griefstricken wife did to try to get the jailers to take food to him
It was in the thirtyseventh year of the Buddha's preaching career that Ajatasattu did this cruel deed and took the throne of Magadha in the place of his father Bimbisara whom he thus murdered
Devadatta now had all the power he wanted
The new king of the country was his devoted friend and supporter and would do anything for him that he asked him to do
So very soon he got King Ajatasattu to gather together for him a band of bowmen and he paid them well to go where the Buddha was staying and shoot the Buddha dead
But when these hired assassins came to the place where the Buddha was and saw him sitting there so calm so mild and yet so majestic looking they simply could not do what they had come to do and had been well paid to do
Completely overawed by the bearing and manner of the Great Teacher instead of letting loose their arrows at Him they came up to Him and sat down at His feet in an attitude of reverence and worship
And the Buddha began to talk to them and after a little they confessed what they had come to do and asked Him to forgive them for their evil intention
Of course the Buddha pardoned them at once and they promised to Him that they would be His followers for all the remainder of their lives
But when Devadatta learned that the men he had sent out to kill the Buddha instead of killing Him had actually become His followers he was furious with rage and resolved next time not to send any one else but to go himself and take the Buddha's life
Now there was a hill near the palace where the Buddha was staying and the Buddha used often to take a walk along a path at its foot
So one evening as the Buddha was taking a walk along this road Devadatta who was all the time on the look out for a good chance to kill Him without being seen by the Buddha climbed up the hill to a place just above the road where there was a big rock
Devadatta loosened this rock from the soil round it and waited till the Buddha was passing right below it
Then he gave the rock a big push and sent it rolling and bounding down the hillside intending it to fall on the Buddha and crush Him to a jelly
But as the rock was rolling down straight for the Buddha's head it struck against another big one that happened to lie in its way and instead of falling straight on the Buddha's head it broke into a lot of little pieces and only one little splinter of it struck the Buddha on the foot and lamed Him for a little while
But it did not hurt Him very much and He was able to walk back to the Vihara
And when He got there the good and skillful physician Jivaka put a bandage on it with some healing ointment and by the next morning the foot was quite well again
So once more Devadatta was defeated in his evil designs
But he was not yet finished with his endeavors to bring about the death of the Great Teacher
He was going to make one more attempt to get the Buddha out of the way so that he himself might be the leader whom the Bhikkhus would follow
For that was what he thought
He thought that if once the Buddha was dead then he would become the leader of the Sangha and all of the Bhikkhus would follow him as their master
This time he arranged that when the Buddha went out as He did every morning through the streets of Rajagaha begging alms of food a wild raging elephant should be let loose in the particular street where He was at the time so that it might rush at Him and trample Him to death
And this was done
The raging elephant was brought to the street where the Buddha was then engaged in passing quietly from door to door begging His morning meal and then let loose
But instead of rushing at the Buddha and crushing Him under its huge hoofs it became quite quiet and subdued and allowed the calm figure in the yellow robe to pass on unharmed
Thus for the third time the attempt of Devadatta to bring about the Buddha's death was defeated
Devadatta now gave up the idea of killing the Buddha after failing these three times but he was still as determined as ever one way or another to bring about a break in the Sangha
So now he went to visit the Buddha and pretending to be friendly with Him told Him that he thought the Bhikkhus did not live strictly enough he thought it would be better if they lived a harder life like the ascetic followers of other religious teachers because the common people were inclined to look down on the Buddha's Bhikkhus saying that they seemed to have rather an easy and comfortable life compared with other ascetics
Devadatta therefore suggested to the Buddha that He should make it a strict and fixed Vinaya rule that all His Bhikkhus henceforth should live no longer in any kind of roofed dwelling but should sleep at night at the foot of a tree in the jungle or in some open place without a roof
He also wanted the Buddha to order his Bhikkhus not to eat food specially prepared for them and brought to them in the place where they were staying but to live strictly on such food as they got when round begging with their bowls and to eat nothing else
Devadatta also wanted the Buddha to command the Bhikkhus not to wear any of the neat clean readymade robes which the people used to give them but only to cover their bodies with robes which they themselves had put together out of rags picked up on refuseheaps and in tombs and burial places
And last he wanted the Buddha to make it a fixed rule that His Bhikkhus should not eat fish or meat of any kind
These four things Devadatta wished the Buddha to make binding rules of the Vinaya which every member of His Sangha would have to observe or leave the Order
The Buddha however flatly refused to make any one of these rules he suggested a binding command upon His Bhikkhus
But the Buddha said if any Bhikkhu wishes to live always at the foot of trees or in places open to the sky he can do so
But those who do not wish to do this may live in places provided for them by benefactors so long as they are not built too close to houses where the lay people live And the Buddha said the same about the other three rules proposed by Devadatta
He said that any of his Bhikkhus who wished to do so could live solely on what was put into their begging bowl when they went through the streets for alms wear only what robes they made for themselves out of dirty castoff rags and abstain from eating fish and meat
But those who did not wish to observe such practices need not do so unless they liked
And the Buddha ended by warning Devadatta that he must not try in this cunning way to cause a split in the Sangha or in the end the consequences would be very had for him
But paying no heed to the Buddha's warning Devadatta went away disappointed and angry and going to Ananda tried to get him to side with his views about having a stricter rule for the Bhikkhus
But Ananda refused to agree with him and sided with his Master the Buddha
Then Devadatta went away to a part of the country where the Bhikkhus had not seen the Buddha for a long time and succeeded in winning over a lot of them to believe in him and in his new rules for the Sangha
But the Buddha came to hear of this
And one afternoon when Devadatta was asleep in his Vihara He sent Sariputta to Devadatta's place to speak to the Bhikkhus who had gone wrong and were following Devadatta and tell them what the Buddha had really said on the matter
And Sariputta did as his Master told him and spoke to the erring Bhikkhus so well that in a little while they said they wanted to be the Buddha's disciples again and they all rose up and followed Sariputta back to the Buddha's Vihara
When Devadatta woke again from his sleep that afternoon he thought the Vihara seemed strangely quiet as if there were nobody in it and he went out to see what was the matter
And when he went out he found that there was not a single Bhikkhu about the place
And soon he learned that Sariputta had been there while he was sleeping and had spoken to his Bhikkhus so that now they had all left him every one and gone back to the Buddha
Then Devadatta was filled with rage and fury and ordered his servants to prepare his litter and take him at once to the Buddha's Vihara he was going to see what the Buddha meant by taking all his disciples from him
But when Sariputta and the other Bhikkhus heard of Devadatta's rage and that he was on his way to the Buddha's Vihara they advised the Buddha to go away for they feared that when Devadatta came this time for sure he would kill the Buddha in his fury
But the Buddha was not in the least disturbed at the news that Devadatta was coming and told Sariputta that he knew that Devadatta could not do Him any harm
But he is full of anger at the Blessed One said Sariputta and again he urged his Master to save Himself while there was time for Devadatta was coming nearer
But the Buddha still refused to move saying again that He felt quite safe against anything Devadatta could do
And the Buddha proved to be right
For the next thing the Bhikkhus heard was that Devadatta's bearers had stopped on the way
Then came the news that Devadatta was dead
And it was quite true
Death struck down Devadatta himself at the very time when he was on his way to bring death to the Buddha
After this there was no more trouble in the Sangha as long as the Buddha was alive
The only distressing thing that happened in connection with the Buddha was that the king and the princes of the royal houses of Kapilavatthu and of Kosala both were all killed in war by the cruel Ajatasattu after once before having been saved from that fate by the efforts of the Buddha
This blotting out of the Buddha's family happened in the year before that in which He Himself passed away into Nibbana
The Lord Buddha now began to feel that His days in this world were coming to a close but before He passed away He wished to give His Bhikkhus some last advice which should serve to guide them in their general conduct after He was gone and could advise and guide them no more with His living voice
So He told Ananda to gather the Bhikkhus together in the Preaching Hall at Rajagaha and when all the Bhikkhus had assembled He addressed them as follows
O Bhikkhus as long as you remain united and meet together frequently so long the Sangha will continue to flourish and prosper
So long as you meet together and decide all important questions in union and harmony one with another and do not make new and oppressive rules hard to keep where I have made none but strictly adhere to the observance of those rules which I have given you for your help and protection  so long as you do this the Sangha will never decay and die out
Always treat with respect those who have been longer in the Sangha than yourselves and pay attention to their counsel and admonition
Be ever on the watch against the beginnings of anything that tends to evil in order that you may not become the slaves of evil before you are aware
Do not seek company seek solitude
When Bhikkhus from other places come to visit you attend to their wants and treat them well and hospitably
When any among you are sick let the others wait upon them and care for them
He who thus waits upon and cares for a sick brother it is the same as if he waited upon and cared for me
Shun pride vain show
Seek the companionship of the good avoid the company of the bad
Think and reflect frequently upon the nature of all things here that they do not last that they cause suffering to him who clings closely to them that they are empty of any solid substance
So long as you do these things and follow the rules of conduct I have given you for your guidance you will always be respected and esteemed by the householders and everyone and the Sangha will prosper and you will be safe from falling into anything low and vulgar and ignoble you will be shielded from everything unbecoming everything unworthy of those who have left the household life to live in homelessness
This was the last sermon the Buddha preached to the whole Sangha
After this He went to the city of Nalanda and then to the city of Patali and at this latter place He preached this His last sermon to the householder folk
Dayakas whoever breaks the precepts of right conduct which I have taught for the guidance of householders or is careless and slack in his observance of them such a person will lose his good name among men and his wellbeing and happiness in this world will grow less and less and finally dwindle away and disappear altogether
He will have no certainty he will feel no confidence of mind but wretched and unhappy at death he will pass away to a fate of misery and suffering
But those who faithfully keep these precepts of good conduct which I have laid down those who are not careless in the observance of them such persons will gain honor and enjoy a high reputation among men
They will enjoy health and wealth and all prosperity
They will be welcomed wherever they may go
They will be received with pleasure even in the company of the great among princes and king's counselors among the good and the learned and the wise
Their minds will be free from any kind of doubt or anxiety and after death they will pass to a state of happiness
And now the Buddha is getting to be an old man
He is eighty years of age
For nearly fortyfive years He has been traveling about on foot up and down His native land of India teaching and preaching without any rest except during the rainy season of each year
And now He is feeling His years
He is weary and worn out in body though His mind remains as strong as ever
He feels that He is not going to live much longer and His thoughts turn to the north towards the lands that lie at the foot of the great snowy mountains where His youthful days were passed
It is in that country that He wishes to pass away from the world He has served so ungrudgingly these many years
So leaving Rajagaha
He turns His now feeble steps northwards intending to go to the little town of Kusinara and there await death
On the way to it He passes through the city that is now called Patna and then still going north through the rich town of Vesali where He once was splendidly entertained by the courtesan Ambapali and given a Vihara by her much to the annoyance of the young princes of the place who wanted to have the honor of doing this themselves
When He had arrived at the little village of Beluva He sent away all the Bhikkhus who had been coming with Him so far all except his faithful attendant Ananda who never left Him night or day telling the other Bhikkhus that they had better spend the Vassa or rainy season at some place where they would have a better chance of getting support than a little place like Beluva which could not provide food for so many of them
So most of the Bhikkhus went back to Vesali to spend the rainy season near that large and rich city
Meanwhile the Buddha resolved to spend this last Vassa of His life at Beluva
But He had not been staying there very long when He was seized with severe illness accompanied by violent pain
And the sickness increased and the pain grew worse until Ananda began to think that his Master was going to die
But the Buddha did not want to die at Beluva
He did not want to die until He had seen His Bhikkhus once more and encouraged them and strengthened them in the good life they are trying to live
So with a great effort of will He managed to master His sickness being determined to live and see and speak to His Bhikkhus once more before He passed away
And after a time feeling better again He went outside and took a seat on the shady side of the little house He was living in out of the hot sun on a mat Ananda had made ready for Him
And Ananda sat down near Him and said
How glad I am to see that the Blessed One is better again
I almost fainted away when I saw how ill the Blessed One was a little while ago
I very nearly swooned
But then I thought 'No most surely the Blessed One will not pass away to Nibbana till He has left full instructions about the future of the Sangha and how it is to be conducted when He is gone' But Ananda said the Buddha what more can the Bhikkhus ask of me
I have taught them the whole doctrine I have not hidden from them anything they ought to know in order to be able to reach Nibbana
I have been a faithful teacher to them and told them all they need to know so that they may bring suffering to an end
One who wanted to rule the Sangha and keep it under his own control might well leave orders about its future government
But I Ananda do not wish to rule over the Sangha or to keep it under My control
What instructions then should I leave about its future
I am now an old man feeble and worn out
My days are at an end
I am eighty years of age
I have only one thing I want to say to you all
Be to yourselves your own light
Be to yourselves your own refuge
Do not go looking for any other light or refuge
Whoever Ananda when I am gone shall be to himself his own light his own refuge looking for no other light or refuge  whosoever shall take the truth I have taught as his light and his refuge  that disciple Ananda now and always will be my true disciple will be walking in the right way
Next morning the Buddha was feeling so well again that He was able to go into Vesali on His usual begging round and in the evening He sent Ananda to bring the Bhikkhus who were living in Vesali to Him so that He might speak to them all once more
When the Bhikkhus had all come He exhorted them earnestly as His last parting admonition to them to follow faithfully the good way He had taught them for the sake of the world for the sake of the benefit the advantage the welfare of the world of men which need to have kept before it the example of the holy life perfect and pure
All that belongs to this world is changeable and unlasting He said
Exert yourselves
Strive earnestly
Follow the Good Way
Keep close watch over your minds
So shall you find certain deliverance from the round of birth and death and all things evil
Then the next morning the Buddha started out direct for Kusinara and on the way at a little village called Pava He was invited by the son of the village goldsmith whose name was Cunda to partake of a meal of sukaramaddavam a kind of mushroom which wild boars much delight to eat hence its name which means boar's delight
The Buddha partook of the meal Cunda offered Him and after He had eaten felt very much refreshed and strengthened
Indeed He thought He had quite got over His illness and He praised Cunda for having given Him a meal that had done Him so much good and said that the good deed Cunda thus had done would make for his wellbeing both here and hereafter both now and in the future
Unfortunately the improvement produced in the Buddha's condition by the meal Cunda had just given Him did not last very long
The illness that had first attacked Him at Beluva came on Him again
But again by a great effort of will He mastered it and getting to His feet with failing strength struggled on once more towards Kusinara and after a painful journey at length reached the grove of Sal trees outside the town which belonged to the princes of the place
Go Ananda said the Buddha when He came in sight of the grove and saw that His journey was now ended go and make ready a place for Me to lie down on between those two big Sal trees
I am very weary Ananda and would like to lie down and rest
So Ananda took the Buddha's robe and folding it in four spread it on the ground between the two big Sal trees so that his Master could lie on it with His head towards the North
Then the Buddha lay down on the couch thus prepared for Him not to sleep but only to rest His sick and weary body while His mind remained calm and collected as ever
For did He not once tell Sariputta in the years when He was still hale and well that if He were to live to become so old and weak that He could not walk but had to be carried about in a litter still for all that He would be able to expound His Teaching and answer any question about it that might be asked even by the wisest and cleverest scholars as long as they could stay awake to ask questions
He would never be tired in His mind
But now when Ananda saw that his beloved Master was really going to leave him he was filled with grief he could not help it
And he went into the Vihara close by and hiding himself from the Buddha's eyes behind the door he began to weep saying to himself I am not like the other Bhikkhus
I am still only a learner
I have not yet reached the state of Arahant
And now my Teacher is going to pass away and leave me he who has always been so kind to me And the hot tears rolled down poor Ananda's cheeks
Then the Buddha opened His eyes and seeing that Ananda was not beside Him as usual He said to the other Bhikkhus who were round Him Where is Ananda
Reverend Lord replied one of the Bhikkhus the venerable Ananda has gone into the Vihara and is now standing behind the door there weeping and saying that he is only a learner not perfect yet and now is losing his teacher who was always kind to him
Go O Bhikkhu said the Buddha and tell Ananda that his teacher is calling for him
So the Bhikkhu went and told Ananda that the Buddha wanted to see him
And Ananda came and sat down near the Blessed One
And the Blessed One spoke to him and said
Enough now Ananda
Do not grieve do not weep
Have I not told you many and many a time that it must be that some day we shall be separated cut off sundered parted from all that is dear to us
This must be Ananda
There is no help for this
How is it possible that anything that has been born has had a beginning should not again die come to an end
Such a thing Ananda is not possible
For a long time now Ananda you have waited upon the Tathagata and served him with body and speech and mind in deed and word and thought kindly devotedly cheerfully ungrudgingly and beyond measure
You have done much that is good by your faithful service of me Ananda
Now exert yourself to get rid of all the things that hinder you from becoming an Arahant and in a very short time you will become one
Then the Buddha spoke to the other Bhikkhus round Him and said
All the Buddhas before me have each had a favorite disciple and bodyservant just as I have had Ananda
And all the Buddhas to come will each have a favorite attendant like Ananda
A wise and faithful servant has Ananda been to me
He always knew when it was a suitable time to let visitors see me
He has always been pleasant to them in all his words and ways and they have always been pleased with his manners towards them
When he has addressed them they have always wanted to hear more from his lips
Such an excellent disciple and servant has Ananda always been to me
Then Ananda spoke and said to the Buddha
Pray Reverend Lord do not pass away to Nibbana from this little mudbuilt place this jungle town this outoftheway corner
There are great cities like Rajagaha and Savatthi and Vesali and others
Let the Blessed One be pleased to pass away from one of these places
In these cities there are many wealthy and highplaced believers in the Blessed One who will see to His funeral rites in a manner worthy of the Tathagata
Nay Ananda said the Buddha do not talk like that
Do not call this a little outoftheway mudbuilt jungle place
For at one time Ananda in days gone by this was a great and flourishing city the capital of the country where a great king lived in his golden palace
But go now Ananda and tell the chief men and the people of Kusinara that tonight in the last watch of the night the Tathagata will pass away to Nibbana
Therefore let them come and see the Tathagata before He passes away
So Ananda taking with him another Bhikkhu did as his Master bid him and went to Kusinara and told the elders of the town that the Buddha was going to pass away that night
And when they heard it they were much grieved and cried Alas too soon too soon is the Blessed One passing away to Nibbana
Too soon too soon is the light of the world vanishing from the sight of men And all the people of Kusinara men women and children grieving and sorrowing came to the Sal Tree grove where the Buddha lay to take a last farewell of Him
And family by family they bowed low before Him in reverence and so bade Him farewell
Now it happened that a certain wandering ascetic called Subhadda was staying near Kusinara at this time and when he heard that the Buddha was about to pass away he resolved to go and see Him at once and ask Him about a certain matter that puzzled him before He passed away
For he felt sure that the Lord Buddha could answer the question he wished to ask and clear up all his doubts about it
So Subhadda went to the Sal Tree grove and told Ananda about his question and asked him kindly to give him an opportunity of speaking to the Buddha and putting his question to Him before He passed away
But Ananda said Enough Subhadda enough
The Blessed One is very weary
Do not trouble Him with questions now
But Subhadda was too anxious to have his doubts settled by the Buddha before He passed away to take a refusal from Ananda and he pressed Ananda again and again to let him see the Buddha and Ananda again and again told him that his Master was far too ill and could not be disturbed by any one
However the Buddha where He lay caught a word or two of the talk that was passing between Ananda and Subhadda and He called Ananda to Him and said Come Ananda
Do not keep Subhadda from seeing me
Let Subhadda come and see me if he wishes
What he asks will be for the sake of learning from me and not merely in order to trouble me
He is quick of wit and will readily understand what I say to him Ananda
Then Ananda allowed the wandering ascetic Subbhada to approach the Buddha
And after greeting the Buddha with all respect Subhadda said
Gotama have all the famous leaders of ascetics of other schools than yours discovered the Truth as they say they have
Or have they not discovered the Truth
Or have some of them discovered the Truth and others not
Enough O Subhadda said the Buddha
Never mind that question
But listen to me and pay close attention to what I say and I will make known to you the Teaching
In whatever doctrine or discipline the Noble Eightfold Path is not found there also are not to be found those have become Sotapanna or Sakadagami or Anagami or Arahant
But wherever the Noble Eightfold Path is found there also is found the Sotapanna and the Sakadagami and the Anagami and the Arahant
And in this Doctrine and Discipline of mine O Subhadda is to be found the Noble Eightfold Path and in it alone the Sotapanna and the Sakadagami and the Anagami and the Arahant
In no other schools of ascetics are these to be found
And if only my Bhikkhus live rightly and follow my precepts the world will never be without true and genuine Arahants
Then Subhadda asked to be admitted to the Order of Bhikkhus and the Buddha granted his request and told Ananda to give him ordination
In this way Subhadda became the very last Bhikkhu whom the Buddha admitted to the Order just as Konkani in the deer park near Benares was the first
And by earnest and diligent labor in the Doctrine and Discipline Subhadda very shortly became an Arahant
Then the Buddha spoke to Ananda again and said
Perhaps Ananda some of the Bhikkhus may be thinking 'The Teacher's words we shall hear no more
We have no teacher now' But Ananda that is not the right way to look at the matter
The doctrine and the discipline which I have taught you and counseled you to follow while I was with you these will be your teacher when I am gone
And now while I am alive you all address one another as 'Brother' but when I am gone the older Bhikkhus are to address those younger than themselves in the Order by their simple name or as 'Brother' but those that are younger must always address those that are older than themselves in the Order as 'Reverend Sir' or 'Venerable Sir' and after I am gone Ananda the Order if it wishes may do away with all the lesser and minor rules of the Order
Then the Buddha addressing the other Bhikkhus said
If any among you has any doubts or perplexities regarding the Buddha or the Dhamma or the Sangha or the Path or about what is Right Conduct ask about these now O Bhikkhus so that afterwards you may not have cause to regret that you did not have your doubts settled while the Teacher was with you to do so
But at these words of the Buddha none of the Bhikkhus said anything none of them had any questions to ask none of them had any doubts or perplexities
Then a second and a third time the Buddha asked any of the Bhikkhus who had any question they would like to put to Him to do so now while He was with them to answer it but still no Bhikkhu spoke
Then Ananda spoke and said It is wonderful it is admirable
Reverend Lord
I do believe that in all this great company of Bhikkhus there is not a single one who has any doubts or perplexities about the Buddha or the Dhamma or the Sangha or the Path or the Right Rule of Conduct
With you Ananda said the Buddha this may be a matter of faith and belief
But I Ananda I know that not a single Bhikkhu here has any doubts or perplexities about these things
Of all the Bhikkhus here present Ananda even the most backward of them is not liable to fall back into any lower state of existence but is certain to attain wisdom supreme
Then the Blessed One once more addressed the assembled Bhikkhus and these were the very last words He spoke on this earth
O Bhikkhus He said this is now my last admonition to you
Sabbe sankhara anicca Appamadena sampadetha
All the constituents of existence are unlasting
By earnestness work out your liberation
Then the Blessed One sank into trance ever deeper and deeper
Then He came out of trance again
Then He again passed into trance a little way and from this trance passed away with that passing away which leaves nothing whatever behind that can cause birth again in this or any other world
The Blessed One passed away to Parinibbana
It is twentyfive centuries ago since Siddhattha Gotama the Sakya Prince who became Gotama the Buddha thus passed away in far Kusinara
But His words His Teachings have not passed away
These still remain the guide through life to what is beyond life of millions of the human race
For after His passing away the Arahants and other disciples of that Blessed One spread the tidings of His great Teaching all through His native land of India and passing beyond its boundaries carried it far away to the West into Egypt and to the East into Tibet and China and Japan
To Lapland in the cold North the Message was borne by them and to Java and the isles of the southern seas
So that today two and a half millennia since He passed away from the earth nearly a third part of those that dwell upon it revere the name of the Exalted One the Blessed One the Buddha Supreme the Instructor of gods and men the Teacher unique without a peer who taught Nibbana and the Way Thither
In a Scotsman in his thirtyfifth year known as JF
McKechnie was admitted to the Sangha by the Thera U Kumara at Kyun Daw Gone Kyaung Kemmendine Rangoon Burma
He was given the Bhikkhu's name of Silacara
The new monk had come to the country about the beginning of this century having whilst in Glasgow read about Buddhism in a copy of the magazine Buddhism which he found in the public library and answered an advertisement of its editor the Bhikkhu Ananda Metteyya for one with literary ability to assist him in the editorial work in Rangoon
McKechnie remained with the British Buddhist monk until the magazine ceased publication
Then prior to his own entering the Sangha as noted above he taught for a year in the Buddhist boys' school of Mme Hla Oung
The future Bhikkhu was born in Hull Yorkshire on October nd
His father was a famous baritone singer Sir Charles Santley and his mother was Caroline Mavis
After the years of schooling till he was he worked as apprentice to the trade of Stockcutter in a clothing factory emigrating therefrom to America to work for four years on a fruit and dairy farm
The Bhikkhu Silacara worked untiringly writing preaching traveling
He once went on a mission to Sikkim on the Maharajah's invitation but the mission bore hardly any fruit owing to the point of view of the lamas who thought that pure Buddhism would be corrupted if in the hands of the ignorant peasant
He broke down in health contracting nervous asthma complicated with heart trouble and on the advice of the German Buddhist Dr
P
Dahlke left the robes and for England late in
Here he worked with the Anagarika Dharmapala at the Mahabodhi Society's British branch lecturing and editing the British Buddhist
His health suffered again and in when he had to leave London to live in Surrey
But he never ceased to work for he wrote to Buddhist Magazines in the country in Ceylon Burma Germany etc
During World War II his little retreat Wisboro Green having been sold he entered an Old Persons' Home at Bury where he who had led the austere life of a Buddhist monk bore the hard way of a state charitable institution with equanimity until his death three years ago
Of the books on Buddhism which he wrote those perhaps best known to Ceylon Buddhists are The Four Noble Truths The Eightfold Path Kamma Lotus Blossoms
In the early twenties Ceylon readers of the Buddhist Chronicle a paper started by Mr
P
de
S
Kularatne the Principal of Ananda College Colombo were greatly encouraged by the vigorous contribution which the Bhikkhu made regularly
The interest of these articles was heightened specially by the fact that there was a controversy going on at that time the leader on the Buddhist side being American Buddhist Scholar of Mahayana Dr
W
Y
EvansWentz Buddhist Annual of Ceylon
The Bhikkhu also contributed a number of articles to the Buddhist Annual of Ceylon an illustrated magazine of a high order which the firm Messrs
W
E
Bastain  Co
of Colombo were publishing with great acceptance to places and people all over the world wherever Orientalia found welcome and these were a formidable tally
For this Firm he specially wrote the Young People's Life of the Buddha the popularity of which remains undimmed throughout the decades in which it is being reprinted
Colombo th January 
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks replied
The Blessed One said Monks speech endowed with four characteristics is wellspoken not poorly spoken  faultless  not to be faulted by the wise
Which four
There is the case where a monk says only what it wellspoken not what is poorly spoken only what is just not what is unjust only what is endearing not what is unendearing only what is true not what is false
Speech endowed with these four characteristics is wellspoken not poorly spoken  faultless  not to be faulted by the wise
That is what the Blessed One said
Having said this the One WellGone the Teacher said further
Then Ven
Vangisa rising from his seat arranging his robe over one shoulder faced the Blessed One with his hands palmtopalm in front of his heart and said An inspiration has come to me Blessed One
An inspiration has come to me One WellGone
Let the inspiration come to you Vangisa the Blessed One said
Then Ven
Vangisa praised the Blessed One to his face with these attractive verses
I have heard that on one occasion while the Blessed One was wandering among the Magadhans with a large community of monks he arrived at Pāṭali Village
The lay followers of Pāṭali Village heard The Blessed One they say while wandering among the Magadhans with a large community of monks has reached Pāṭali Village So they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were was sitting there they said to him Lord may the Blessed One acquiesce to the resthouse hall
The Blessed One acquiesced with silence
Sensing his acquiescence the lay followers of Pāṭali Village got up from their seats bowed down to him circled him to the right and then went to the resthouse hall
On arrival they spread it all over with felt rugs arranged seats set out a water vessel and raised an oil lamp
Then they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down stood to one side
As they were standing there they said to him Lord the resthouse hall has been covered all over with felt rugs seats have been arranged a water vessel has been set out and an oil lamp raised
May the Blessed One do what you think it is now time to do
So the Blessed One adjusting his under robe and  carrying his bowl  robes  went together with a community of monks to the resthouse hall
On arrival he washed his feet entered the hall and sat with his back to the central post facing east
The community of monks washed their feet entered the hall and sat with their backs to the western wall facing east ranged around the Blessed One
The lay followers of Pāṭali Village washed their feet entered the hall and sat with their backs to the eastern wall facing west ranged around the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One addressed the lay followers of Pāṭali Village Householders there are these five drawbacks coming from an unvirtuous person's failure in virtue
Which five
There is the case where an unvirtuous person by reason of heedlessness undergoes the lossconfiscation of great wealth
This is the first drawback coming from an unvirtuous person's failure in virtue
Furthermore the bad reputation of the unvirtuous person failing in virtue gets spread about
This is the second drawback coming from an unvirtuous person's failure in virtue
Furthermore whatever assembly the unvirtuous person failing in virtue approaches  whether of noble warriors brahmans householders or contemplatives  heshe does so without confidence  abashed
This is the third drawback coming from an unvirtuous person's failure in virtue
Furthermore the unvirtuous person failing in virtue dies confused
This is the fourth drawback coming from an unvirtuous person's failure in virtue
Furthermore the unvirtuous person failing in virtue  on the breakup of the body after death  reappears in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm a hell
This is the fifth drawback coming from an unvirtuous person's failure in virtue
These householders are the five drawbacks coming from an unvirtuous person's failure in virtue
Householders there are these five rewards coming from a virtuous person's consummation in virtue
Which five
There is the case where a virtuous person by reason of heedfulness acquires a great mass of wealth
This is the first reward coming from a virtuous person's consummation in virtue
Furthermore the fine reputation of the virtuous person consummate in virtue gets spread about
This is the second reward coming from a virtuous person's consummation in virtue
Furthermore whatever assembly the virtuous person consummate in virtue approaches  whether of noble warriors brahmans householders or contemplatives  heshe does so with confidence  unabashed
This is the third reward coming from a virtuous person's consummation in virtue
Furthermore the virtuous person consummate in virtue dies unconfused
This is the fourth reward coming from a virtuous person's consummation in virtue
Furthermore the virtuous person consummate in virtue  on the breakup of the body after death  reappears in a good destination a heavenly world
This is the fifth reward coming from a virtuous person's consummation in virtue
These householders are the five rewards coming from a virtuous person's consummation in virtue
Then the Blessed One  having instructed urged roused  encouraged the lay followers of Pāṭali Village for a large part of the night with Dhammatalk  dismissed them saying The night is far gone householders
Do what you think it is now time to do
So the lay followers of Pāṭali Village delighting in  approving of the Blessed One's words got up from their seats bowed down to him and left circling him to the right
Then the Blessed One not long after they had left entered an empty building
Now on that occasion Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha were building a city at Pāṭali Village to preempt the Vajjians
And on that occasion many devas by the thousands were occupying sites in Pāṭali Village
In the area where devas of great influence occupied sites there the minds of the king's royal ministers of great influence were inclined to build their homes
In the area where devas of middling influence occupied sites there the minds of the king's royal ministers of middling influence were inclined to build their homes
In the area where devas of low influence occupied sites there the minds of the king's royal ministers of low influence were inclined to build their homes
The Blessed One with the divine eye  purified and surpassing the human  saw many devas by the thousands occupying sites in Pāṭali Village
In the area where devas of great influence occupied sites there the minds of the king's royal ministers of great influence were inclined to build their homes
In the area where devas of middling influence occupied sites there the minds of the king's royal ministers of middling influence were inclined to build their homes
In the area where devas of low influence occupied sites there the minds of the king's royal ministers of low influence were inclined to build their homes
Then getting up in the last watch of the night the Blessed One addressed Ven
nanda nanda who is building a city at Pāṭali Village
Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha lord are building a city at Pāṭali Village to preempt the Vajjians
nanda it's as if they had consulted the devas of the Thirtythree That's how Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha are building a city at Pāṭali Village to preempt the Vajjians
Just now nanda  with the divine eye  purified and surpassing the human  I saw many devas by the thousands occupying sites in Pāṭali Village
In the area where devas of great influence occupy sites there the minds of the king's royal ministers of great influence are inclined to build their homes
In the area where devas of middling influence occupy sites there the minds of the king's royal ministers of middling influence are inclined to build their homes
In the area where devas of low influence occupy sites there the minds of the king's royal ministers of low influence are inclined to build their homes
Then Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies they stood to one side
As they were standing there they said to him May Master Gotama acquiesce to our meal today together with the community of monks The Blessed One acquiesced with silence
Then Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha understanding the Blessed One's acquiescence went to their resthouse
On arrival after having exquisite staple  nonstaple food prepared in their resthouse they announced the time to the Blessed One It's time Master Gotama
The meal is ready
Then the Blessed One early in the morning adjusted his under robe and  carrying his bowl  robes  went together with the community of monks to the resthouse of Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha
On arrival he sat down on the seat laid out
Sunīdha  Vassakāra with their own hands served  satisfied the community of monks with the Buddha at its head with exquisite staple  nonstaple food
Then when the Blessed One had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl Sunīdha  Vassakāra taking a low seat sat to one side
As they were sitting there the Blessed One gave his approval with these verses
Then the Blessed One having given his approval to Sunīdha  Vassakāra with these verses got up from his seat and left
And on that occasion Sunīdha  Vassakāra followed right after the Blessed One By whichever gate Gotama the contemplative departs today that will be called the Gotama Gate
And by whichever ford he crosses over the Ganges River that will be called the Gotama Ford
So the gate by which the Blessed One departed was called the Gotama Gate
Then he went to the Ganges River
Now on that occasion the Ganges River was full up to the banks so that a crow could drink from it
Some people were searching for boats some were searching for floats some were binding rafts in hopes of going from this shore to the other
So the Blessed One  just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm  disappeared from the near bank of the Ganges River and reappeared on the far bank together with the community of monks
He saw that some people were searching for boats some were searching for floats some were binding rafts in hopes of going from this shore to the other
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Archeological evidence from what may have been part of Asoka's palace in Pāṭaliputta shows burnt wooden posts buried in mud  perhaps a sign that the palace burned and then was buried in a flood
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was journeying along a road in the Kosalan country with Ven
Nāgasamāla as his junior companion
Ven
Nāgasamāla while going along the road saw a fork in the path
On seeing it he said to the Blessed One That lord Blessed One is the route
We go that way When this was said the Blessed One said This Nāgasamāla is the route
We go this way
A second time A third time Ven
Nāgasamāla said to the Blessed One That lord Blessed One is the route
We go that way And for a third time the Blessed One said This Nāgasamāla is the route
We go this way
Then Ven
Nāgasamāla placing the Blessed One's bowl  robes right there on the ground left saying This lord Blessed One is the bowl  robes
Then as Ven
Nāgasamāla was going along that route thieves  jumping out in the middle of the road  pummeled him with their fists  feet broke his bowl and ripped his outer robe to shreds
So Ven
Nāgasamāla  with his bowl broken his outer robe ripped to shreds  went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now lord as I was going along that route thieves jumped out in the middle of the road pummeled me with their fists  feet broke my bowl and ripped my outer robe to shreds
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery
Now at that time Ven
Mahā Kaccāyana was sitting not far from the Blessed One his legs crossed his body held erect having mindfulness immersed in the body wellestablished to the fore within
The Blessed One saw Ven
Mahā Kaccāyana sitting not far away his legs crossed his body held erect having mindfulness immersed in the body wellestablished to the fore within
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
This passage can also be translated as
In AN the Buddha recommends this view as conducive to developing dispassion for becoming
However in MN he warns that it can lead to the refined equanimity of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception which can become an object of clinging
Only if that subtle clinging is detected can all clinging be abandoned
The Canon's most extended discussion of this theme of meditation is in SN
See Appendix Two
For more on this topic see The Paradox of Becoming chapter
At one time the Blessed One was staying at Kosambii in Simsapaa Grove
Then the Blessed One taking a few Simsapaa leaves in his hand said to the monks What do you think monks
Which are the more numerous the few leaves I have here in my hand or those up in the trees of the grove
Lord the Blessed One is holding only a few leaves those up in the trees are far more numerous
In the same way monks there are many more things that I have found out but not revealed to you
What I have revealed to you is only a little
And why monks have I not revealed it
Because monks it is not related to the goal it is not fundamental to the holy life does not conduce to disenchantment dispassion cessation tranquillity higher knowledge enlightenment or Nibbaana
That is why I have not revealed it
And what monks have I revealed
What I have revealed is 'This is Suffering this is the Arising of Suffering this is the Cessation of Suffering and this is the Path that leads to the Cessation of Suffering' And why monks have I revealed it
Because this is related to the goal fundamental to the holy life conduces to disenchantment dispassion cessation tranquillity higher knowledge enlightenment and Nibbaana therefore I have revealed it
Therefore monks your task is to learn 'This is Suffering this is the Arising of Suffering this is the Cessation of Suffering this is the Path that leads to the Cessation of Suffering' That is your task
It has occasionally been urged that if the Buddha was really allenlightened he must have been able to foresee modern scientific discoveries
In fact he probably could have done so but that was not his task and he will certainly have been more aware than such critics of the dangers inherent in modern discoveries with their power not only to destroy but also to corrupt
As a matter of fact he did not even utilize a very basic technical device which was known in his time  the art of writing
He clearly preferred that his teachings should be preserved orally by those attempting to practice them and indeed the oral tradition has continued to this day
There is however one modern science which the Buddha not only anticipated but far surpassed psychology
The superiority of Buddhist psychological insights to the findings of the West can be readily verified

We may compare the saying quoted here with another no less famous one occurring at SN
as well as in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta Dialogues of the Buddha II Desito Aananda mayaa dhammo anantaram abaahiram katvaa
natth'Aananda Tathaagatassa dhammesu aacariyamutthi I have taught Dhamma Ananda making no 'inner' and 'outer' the Tathaagata has no 'teacher's fist' in respect of the doctrines There is of course no contradiction between the two statements which in fact point once again to the middle way between the extremes
Both equally imply that whatever else the Buddha may have been aware of about the world he taught just what was needed for the gaining of enlightenment holding back nothing but refraining from imparting irrelevant information
As the life of the monks was pared down to essentials so was the teaching
It is fair to suggest that here in the Pali Canon we have the Buddhist teaching presented in its purest and simplest form in the words of the Teacher himself
This statement is not meant to be in any way polemical or to claim that doctrines developed in the later socalled Mahaayaana schools are necessarily wrong
Recent research indeed has conclusively shown that the germ of many such doctrines can be traced back to the Pali Canon
For instance there is little real conflict between the ideas expressed by Naagaarjuna founder of the Madhyamika school and the Theravaada
Likewise while the proposition recently put forward that Zen is the Theravaada of Japan can scarcely be literally maintained the idea nevertheless contains a strong element of truth since Zen visibly represents and effort to rid later Buddhism of some of the accretions that had tended to obscure the original message
Zen too inclines more to something like the Arahant ideal of Theravaada than to that of the Bodhisattva
On the other hand it should not be overlooked that the Bodhisattva career is one that is open to followers of the Theravaada school
And as indicated in SN n even the apparently extremist Pure Land schools with their emphasis on faith receive rather more support from the Pali Canon than is sometimes thought
In this context K
Mizuno Primitive Buddhism tranl

Yamamoto is of interest
Finally in connection with the relation of Buddhism and Science the wise words of an American astronaut Ed Mitchell in a recent TV program may be quoted
He said Science is a methodology
As a belief system it is disastrous Buddhism it may be urged is a spiritual methodology analogous to that of physical science which makes the acceptance of any pure belief system superfluous
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery
And on that occasion the Blessed One was sitting contemplating his own abandoning of the perceptions  categories of objectification
Then the Blessed One realizing his own abandoning of the perceptions  categories of objectification on that occasion exclaimed
No single English word adequately captures the full depth range and subtlety of the crucial Pali term dukkha
Over the years many translations of the word have been used
Each has its own merits in a given context
There is value in not letting oneself get too comfortable with any one particular translation of the word since the entire thrust of Buddhist practice is the broadening and deepening of one's understanding of dukkha until its roots are finally exposed and eradicated once and for all
One helpful rule of thumb as soon as you think you've found the single best translation for the word think again for no matter how you describe dukkha it's always deeper subtler and more unsatisfactory than that
Birth is dukkha aging is dukkha death is dukkha sorrow lamentation pain grief  despair are dukkha association with the unbeloved is dukkha separation from the loved is dukkha not getting what is wanted is dukkha
In short the five clingingaggregates are dukkha
Now what friends is the noble truth of stress
Birth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are stressful association with the unbeloved is stressful separation from the loved is stressful not getting what is wanted is stressful
In short the five clingingaggregates are stressful
And what is birth
Whatever birth taking birth descent comingtobe comingforth appearance of aggregates  acquisition of spheres of the various beings in this or that group of beings that is called birth
And what is aging
Whatever aging decrepitude brokenness graying wrinkling decline of lifeforce weakening of the faculties of the various beings in this or that group of beings that is called aging
And what is death
Whatever deceasing passing away breaking up disappearance dying death completion of time break up of the aggregates casting off of the body interruption in the life faculty of the various beings in this or that group of beings that is called death
And what is sorrow
Whatever sorrow sorrowing sadness inward sorrow inward sadness of anyone suffering from misfortune touched by a painful thing that is called sorrow
And what is lamentation
Whatever crying grieving lamenting weeping wailing lamentation of anyone suffering from misfortune touched by a painful thing that is called lamentation
And what is pain
Whatever is experienced as bodily pain bodily discomfort pain or discomfort born of bodily contact that is called pain
And what is distress
Whatever is experienced as mental pain mental discomfort pain or discomfort born of mental contact that is called distress
And what is despair
Whatever despair despondency desperation of anyone suffering from misfortune touched by a painful thing that is called despair
And what is the stress of association with the unbeloved
There is the case where undesirable unpleasing unattractive sights sounds aromas flavors or tactile sensations occur to one or one has connection contact relationship interaction with those who wish one ill who wish for one's harm who wish for one's discomfort who wish one no security from the yoke
This is called the stress of association with the unbeloved
And what is the stress of separation from the loved
There is the case where desirable pleasing attractive sights sounds aromas flavors or tactile sensations do not occur to one or one has no connection no contact no relationship no interaction with those who wish one well who wish for one's benefit who wish for one's comfort who wish one security from the yoke nor with one's mother father brother sister friends companions or relatives
This is called the stress of separation from the loved
And what is the stress of not getting what is wanted
In beings subject to birth the wish arises 'O may we not be subject to birth and may birth not come to us' But this is not to be achieved by wanting
This is the stress of not getting what is wanted
In beings subject to aging illness death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair the wish arises 'O may we not be subject to aging illness death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair and may aging illness death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair not come to us' But this is not to be achieved by wanting
This is the stress of not getting what is wanted

 Francis Story in Suffering in Vol
II of The Three Basic Facts of Existence 
Both formerly  now it is only dukkha that I describe and the cessation of dukkha
There are these three forms of stressfulness my friend the stressfulness of pain the stressfulness of fabrication the stressfulness of change
These are the three forms of stressfulness

What is the path what is the practice for the full comprehension of these forms of stressfulness
Precisely this Noble Eightfold Path my friend  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
This is the path this is the practice for the full comprehension of these forms of stressfulness
Which is greater the tears you have shed while transmigrating  wandering this long long time  crying  weeping from being joined with what is displeasing being separated from what is pleasing  or the water in the four great oceans This is the greater the tears you have shed
Long have you experienced the death of a mother
The tears you have shed over the death of a mother while transmigrating  wandering this long long time  crying  weeping from being joined with what is displeasing being separated from what is pleasing  are greater than the water in the four great oceans
Long have you experienced the death of a father the death of a brother the death of a sister the death of a son the death of a daughter loss with regard to relatives loss with regard to wealth loss with regard to disease
The tears you have shed over loss with regard to disease while transmigrating  wandering this long long time  crying  weeping from being joined with what is displeasing being separated from what is pleasing  are greater than the water in the four great oceans
Why is that
From an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration
A beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating  wandering on
Long have you thus experienced stress experienced pain experienced loss swelling the cemeteries  enough to become disenchanted with all fabricated things enough to become dispassionate enough to be released
Monks suppose that this great earth were totally covered with water and a man were to toss a yoke with a single hole there
A wind from the east would push it west a wind from the west would push it east
A wind from the north would push it south a wind from the south would push it north
And suppose a blind seaturtle were there
It would come to the surface once every one hundred years
Now what do you think would that blind seaturtle coming to the surface once every one hundred years stick his neck into the yoke with a single hole
It would be a sheer coincidence lord that the blind seaturtle coming to the surface once every one hundred years would stick his neck into the yoke with a single hole
It's likewise a sheer coincidence that one obtains the human state
It's likewise a sheer coincidence that a Tathagata worthy  rightly selfawakened arises in the world
It's likewise a sheer coincidence that a doctrine  discipline expounded by a Tathagata appears in the world
Now this human state has been obtained
A Tathagata worthy  rightly selfawakened has arisen in the world
A doctrine  discipline expounded by a Tathagata appears in the world
Therefore your duty is the contemplation 'This is stressThis is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stressThis is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress'
It's because of not understanding and not penetrating four things that we have wandered  transmigrated on such a long long time you  Which four
It's because of not understanding and not penetrating noble virtue that we have wandered  transmigrated on such a long long time you  I
It's because of not understanding and not penetrating noble concentration that we have wandered  transmigrated on such a long long time you  I
It's because of not understanding and not penetrating noble discernment that we have wandered  transmigrated on such a long long time you  I
It's because of not understanding and not penetrating noble release that we have wandered  transmigrated on such a long long time you  I
But when noble virtue is understood  penetrated when noble concentration noble discernment noble release is understood  penetrated then craving for becoming is destroyed the guide to becoming is ended there is now no further becoming
Jhana is a meditative state of profound stillness and concentration in which the mind becomes fully immersed and absorbed in the chosen object of attention
It is the cornerstone in the development of Right Concentration
There is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters and remains in the first jhana rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought and evaluation
He permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal
Just as if a skilled bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together sprinkling it again and again with water so that his ball of bath powder  saturated moistureladen permeated within and without  would nevertheless not drip even so the monk permeates suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of withdrawal
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal
Furthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters and remains in the second jhana rapture and pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation  internal assurance
He permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composure
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born of composure
Just like a lake with springwater welling up from within having no inflow from east west north or south and with the skies periodically supplying abundant showers so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate and pervade suffuse and fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so the monk permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composure
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born of composure
And furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' He permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture
Just as in a blue white or redlotus pond there may be some of the blue white or red lotuses which born and growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated and pervaded suffused and filled with cool water from their roots to their tips and nothing of those blue white or red lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water even so the monk permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture
And furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure and stress  as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress  he enters and remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain
He sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awareness
Just as if a man were sitting wrapped from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating his body with a pure bright awareness
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awareness
I declare a person endowed with four qualities to be one of great discernment a great man
Which four
There is the case brahman where he practices for the welfare  happiness of many people and has established many people in the noble method ie the rightness of what is admirable the rightness of what is skillful
He thinks any thought he wants to think and doesn't think any thought he doesn't want to think
He wills any resolve he wants to will and doesn't will any resolve he doesn't want to will
He has attained mastery of the mind with regard to the pathways of thought
He attains  whenever he wants without strain without difficulty  the four jhanas that are heightened mental states pleasant abidings in the herenow
With the ending of mental fermentations  he remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known  realized them for himself right in the herenow
I declare a person endowed with these four qualities to be one of great discernment a great man
Then Ven
Ananda together with Tapussa the householder went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Tapussa the householder here has said to me 'Venerable Ananda sir we are householders who indulge in sensuality delight in sensuality enjoy sensuality rejoice in sensuality
For us  indulging in sensuality delighting in sensuality enjoying sensuality rejoicing in sensuality  renunciation seems like a sheer dropoff
Yet I've heard that in this doctrine  discipline the hearts of the very young monks leap up at renunciation grow confident steadfast  firm seeing it as peace
So right here is where this doctrine  discipline is contrary to the great mass of people ie renunciation' So it is Ananda
So it is
Even I myself before my Awakening when I was still an unawakened Bodhisatta thought 'Renunciation is good
Seclusion is good' But my heart didn't leap up at renunciation didn't grow confident steadfast or firm seeing it as peace
The thought occurred to me 'What is the cause what is the reason why my heart doesn't leap up at renunciation doesn't grow confident steadfast or firm seeing it as peace' Then the thought occurred to me 'I haven't seen the drawback of sensual pleasures I haven't pursued
I haven't understood the reward of renunciation I haven't familiarized myself with it
That's why my heart doesn't leap up at renunciation doesn't grow confident steadfast or firm seeing it as peace'
Then the thought occurred to me 'If having seen the drawback of sensual pleasures I were to pursue that theme and if having understood the reward of renunciation I were to familiarize myself with it there's the possibility that my heart would leap up at renunciation grow confident steadfast  firm seeing it as peace'
So at a later time having seen the drawback of sensual pleasures I pursued that theme having understood the reward of renunciation I familiarized myself with it
My heart leaped up at renunciation grew confident steadfast  firm seeing it as peace
Then quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities I entered  remained in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
Is it true Bhaddiya that on going to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling you repeatedly exclaim 'What bliss
What bliss'
Yes lord
What meaning do you have in mind that you repeatedly exclaim 'What bliss
What bliss'
Before when I was a householder maintaining the bliss of kingship I had guards posted within and without the royal apartments within and without the city within and without the countryside
But even though I was thus guarded thus protected I dwelled in fear  agitated distrustful and afraid
But now on going alone to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling I dwell without fear unagitated confident and unafraid  unconcerned unruffled my wants satisfied with my mind like a wild deer
This is the meaning I have in mind that I repeatedly exclaim 'What bliss
What bliss' Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Now what do you think Suppose a householder or householder's son has a house with a gabled roof plastered inside  out draftfree with closefitting door  windows shut against the wind
Inside he has a horsehair couch spread with a longfleeced coverlet a white wool coverlet an embroidered coverlet a rug of kadalideer hide with a canopy above  red cushions on either side
And there a lamp would be burning and his four wives with their many charms would be attending to him
Would he sleep in ease or not
Or how does this strike you
Yes lord he would sleep in ease
Of those in the world who sleep in ease he would be one
But what do you think young man
Might there arise in that householder or householder's son any bodily fevers or fevers of mind born of passion so that  burned with those passionborn fevers  he would sleep miserably
Yes lord
As for those passionborn fevers  burned with which the householder or householder's son would sleep miserably  that passion has been abandoned by the Tathagata its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Therefore he sleeps in ease
Now what do you think young man
Might there arise in that householder or householder's son any bodily fevers or fevers of mind born of aversion so that  burned with those aversionborn fevers  he would sleep miserably
Yes lord
As for those aversionborn fevers  burned with which the householder or householder's son would sleep miserably  that aversion has been abandoned by the Tathagata its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Therefore he sleeps in ease
Now what do you think young man
Might there arise in that householder or householder's son any bodily fevers or fevers of mind born of delusion so that  burned with those delusionborn fevers  he would sleep miserably
Yes lord
As for those delusionborn fevers  burned with which the householder or householder's son would sleep miserably  that delusion has been abandoned by the Tathagata its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Therefore he sleeps in ease
There is the case of the person who has abandoned passion desire fondness thirst fever and craving for sensuality
Then he comes down with a serious disease
As he comes down with a serious disease the thought does not occur to him 'O those beloved sensual pleasures will be taken from me and I will be taken from them' He does not grieve is not tormented does not weep beat his breast or grow delirious
This is a person who subject to death is not afraid or in terror of death

There are these five gifts five great gifts  original longstanding traditional ancient unadulterated unadulterated from the beginning  that are not open to suspicion will never be open to suspicion and are unfaulted by knowledgeable contemplatives  brahmans
Which five
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones abandoning the taking of life abstains from taking life
In doing so he gives freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings
In giving freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings he gains a share in limitless freedom from danger freedom from animosity and freedom from oppression
This is the first gift the first great gift  original longstanding traditional ancient unadulterated unadulterated from the beginning  that is not open to suspicion will never be open to suspicion and is unfaulted by knowledgeable contemplatives  brahmans
Furthermore abandoning taking what is not given the disciple of the noble ones abstains from taking what is not given
In doing so he gives freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings
In giving freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings he gains a share in limitless freedom from danger freedom from animosity and freedom from oppression
This is the second gift
Furthermore abandoning illicit sex the disciple of the noble ones abstains from illicit sex
In doing so he gives freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings
In giving freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings he gains a share in limitless freedom from danger freedom from animosity and freedom from oppression
This is the third gift
Furthermore abandoning lying the disciple of the noble ones abstains from lying
In doing so he gives freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings
In giving freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings he gains a share in limitless freedom from danger freedom from animosity and freedom from oppression
This is the fourth gift
Furthermore abandoning the use of intoxicants the disciple of the noble ones abstains from taking intoxicants
In doing so he gives freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings
In giving freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings he gains a share in limitless freedom from danger freedom from animosity and freedom from oppression
This is the fifth gift the fifth great gift  original longstanding traditional ancient unadulterated unadulterated from the beginning  that is not open to suspicion will never be open to suspicion and is unfaulted by knowledgeable contemplatives  brahmans
And this is the eighth reward of merit reward of skillfulness nourishment of happiness celestial resulting in happiness leading to heaven leading to what is desirable pleasurable  appealing to welfare  to happiness
Five blessings householders accrue to the righteous person through his practice of virtue great increase of wealth through his diligence a favorable reputation a confident deportment without timidity in every society be it that of nobles brahmans householders or ascetics a serene death and at the breaking up of the body after death rebirth in a happy state in a heavenly world
And what is meant by admirable friendship
There is the case where a lay person in whatever town or village he may dwell spends time with householders or householders' sons young or old who are advanced in virtue
He talks with them engages them in discussions
He emulates consummate conviction in those who are consummate in conviction consummate virtue in those who are consummate in virtue consummate generosity in those who are consummate in generosity and consummate discernment in those who are consummate in discernment
This is called admirable friendship
Furthermore there is the case where you recollect your own virtues ' untorn unbroken unspotted unsplattered liberating praised by the wise untarnished conducive to concentration' At any time when a disciple of the noble ones is recollecting virtue his mind is not overcome with passion not overcome with aversion not overcome with delusion
His mind heads straight based on virtue
And when the mind is headed straight the disciple of the noble ones gains a sense of the goal gains a sense of the Dhamma gains joy connected with the Dhamma
In one who is joyful rapture arises
In one who is rapturous the body grows calm
One whose body is calmed experiences ease
In one at ease the mind becomes concentrated
Monks these four types of individuals are to be found existing in the world
Which four
The one who practices for his own benefit but not for that of others
The one who practices for the benefit of others but not for his own
The one who practices neither for his own benefit nor for that of others
The one who practices for his own benefit and for that of others
And how is one an individual who practices for his own benefit but not for that of others
There is the case where a certain individual himself abstains from the taking of life but doesn't encourage others in undertaking abstinence from the taking of life
He himself abstains from stealing but doesn't encourage others in undertaking abstinence from stealing
He himself abstains from sexual misconduct but doesn't encourage others in undertaking abstinence from sexual misconduct
He himself abstains from lying but doesn't encourage others in undertaking abstinence from lying
He himself abstains from intoxicants that cause heedlessness but doesn't encourage others in undertaking abstinence from intoxicants that cause heedlessness
Such is the individual who practices for his own benefit but not for that of others
And how is one an individual who practices for the benefit of others but not for his own
There is the case where a certain individual himself doesn't abstain from the taking of life but encourages others in undertaking abstinence from the taking of life
Such is the individual who practices for the benefit of others but not for his own
And how is one an individual who practices neither for his own benefit nor for that of others
There is the case where a certain individual himself doesn't abstain from the taking of life and doesn't encourage others in undertaking abstinence from the taking of life
Such is the individual who practices neither for his own benefit nor for that of others
And how is one an individual who practices for his own benefit and for that of others
There is the case where a certain individual himself abstains from the taking of life and encourages others in undertaking abstinence from the taking of life
Such is the individual who practices for his own benefit and for that of others
These are the four types of individuals to be found existing in the world
In Buddhist cosmology the heaven realms are blissful abodes whose present inhabitants gained rebirth there through the power of their past meritorious actions
Like all beings still caught in samsara however these deities eventually succumb to aging illness and death and must eventually take rebirth in other realms  pleasant or otherwise  according to the quality and strength of their past kamma
The devas are not always especially knowledgable or spiritually mature  in fact many are quite intoxicated by their sensual indulgences  and none are considered worthy of veneration or worship
Nevertheless the devas and their happy realms stand as important reminders to us both of the happy benefits that ensue from the performance of skillful and meritorious deeds and finally of the ultimate shortcomings of sensuality
I have seen beings who  endowed with bodily good conduct verbal good conduct  mental good conduct who did not revile Noble Ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  at the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destination the heavenly world
It is not from having heard this from other brahmans  contemplatives that I tell you that I have seen beings who  endowed with bodily good conduct verbal good conduct  mental good conduct who did not revile noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  at the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destination the heavenly world
It is from having known it myself seen it myself realized it myself that I tell you that I have seen beings who  endowed with bodily good conduct verbal good conduct  mental good conduct who did not revile noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  at the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destination the heavenly world
Furthermore you should recollect the devas 'There are the devas of the Four Great Kings the devas of the Thirtythree the devas of the Hours the Contented Devas the devas who delight in creation the devas who have power over the creations of others the devas of Brahma's retinue the devas beyond them
Whatever conviction they were endowed with that  when falling away from this life  they rearose there the same sort of conviction is present in me as well
Whatever virtue they were endowed with that  when falling away from this life  they rearose there the same sort of virtue is present in me as well
Whatever learning they were endowed with that  when falling away from this life  they rearose there the same sort of learning is present in me as well
Whatever generosity they were endowed with that  when falling away from this life  they rearose there the same sort of generosity is present in me as well
Whatever discernment they were endowed with that  when falling away from this life  they rearose there the same sort of discernment is present in me as well' At any time when a disciple of the noble ones is recollecting the conviction virtue learning generosity and discernment found both in himself and the devas his mind is not overcome with passion not overcome with aversion not overcome with delusion
His mind heads straight based on the devas
And when the mind is headed straight the disciple of the noble ones gains a sense of the goal gains a sense of the Dhamma gains joy connected with the Dhamma
In one who is joyful rapture arises
In one who is rapturous the body grows calm
One whose body is calmed experiences ease
In one at ease the mind becomes concentrated
Once Kevatta this train of thought arose in the awareness of a certain monk in this very community of monks 'Where do these four great elements  the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property  cease without remainder' Then he attained to such a state of concentration that the way leading to the gods appeared in his centered mind
So he approached the gods of the retinue of the Four Great Kings and on arrival asked them 'Friends where do these four great elements  the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property  cease without remainder'
When this was said the gods of the retinue of the Four Great Kings said to the monk 'We also don't know where the four great elements cease without remainder
But there are the Four Great Kings who are higher and more sublime than us
They should know where the four great elements cease without remainder'
So the monk approached the Four Great Kings and on arrival asked them 'Friends where do these four great elements cease without remainder'
When this was said the Four Great Kings said to the monk 'We also don't know where the four great elements cease without remainder
But there are the gods of the Thirtythree who are higher and more sublime than us
They should know'
So the monk approached the gods of the Thirtythree Sakka the Yama gods Santusita the Nimmanarati gods Sunimmita the Paranimmitavasavatti gods Paranimmita Vasavatti the gods of the retinue of Brahma
Then the monk attained to such a state of concentration that the way leading to the gods of the retinue of Brahma appeared in his centered mind
So he approached the gods of the retinue of Brahma and on arrival asked them 'Friends where do these four great elements  the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property  cease without remainder'
When this was said the gods of the retinue of Brahma said to the monk 'We also don't know where the four great elements cease without remainder
But there is Brahma the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Sovereign Lord the Maker Creator Chief Appointer and Ruler Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be
He is higher and more sublime than we
He should know'
'But where friends is the Great Brahma now'
'Monk we also don't know where Brahma is or in what way Brahma is
But when signs appear light shines forth and a radiance appears Brahma will appear
For these are the portents of Brahma's appearance light shines forth and a radiance appears'
Then it was not long before Brahma appeared
So the monk approached the Great Brahma and on arrival said 'Friend where do these four great elements  the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property  cease without remainder'
When this was said the Great Brahma said to the monk 'I monk am Brahma the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Sovereign Lord the Maker Creator Chief Appointer and Ruler Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be'
A second time the monk said to the Great Brahma 'Friend I didn't ask you if you were Brahma the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Sovereign Lord the Maker Creator Chief Appointer and Ruler Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be
I asked you where these four great elements  the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property  cease without remainder'
A second time the Great Brahma said to the monk 'I monk am Brahma the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Sovereign Lord the Maker Creator Chief Appointer and Ruler Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be'
A third time
Then the Great Brahma taking the monk by the arm and leading him off to one side said to him 'These gods of the retinue of Brahma believe There is nothing that the Great Brahma does not know
There is nothing that the Great Brahma does not see
There is nothing of which the Great Brahma is unaware
There is nothing that the Great Brahma has not realized That is why I did not say in their presence that I too don't know where the four great elements cease without remainder
So you have acted wrongly acted incorrectly in bypassing the Blessed One in search of an answer to this question elsewhere
Go right back to the Blessed One and on arrival ask him this question
However he answers it you should take it to heart'
Then  just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm  the monk disappeared from the Brahma world and immediately appeared in front of me
Having bowed down to me he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to me 'Venerable sir where do these four great elements  the earth property the liquid property the fire property and the wind property  cease without remainder'
When this was said I said to him 'Once monk some seafaring merchants took a shoresighting bird and set sail in their ship
When they could not see the shore they released the shoresighting bird
It flew to the east south west north straight up and to all the intermediate points of the compass
If it saw the shore in any direction it flew there
If it did not see the shore in any direction it returned right back to the ship
In the same way monk having gone as far as the Brahma world in search of an answer to your question you have come right back to my presence'
And this monks is the noble truth of the cessation of dukkha the remainderless fading  cessation renunciation relinquishment release  letting go of that very craving
Among whatever qualities there may be fabricated or unfabricated the quality of dispassion  the subduing of intoxication the elimination of thirst the uprooting of attachment the breaking of the round the destruction of craving dispassion cessation the realization of Unbinding  is considered supreme
Those who have confidence in the quality of dispassion have confidence in what is supreme and for those with confidence in the supreme supreme is the result
This is peace this is exquisite  the stilling of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding
Monks the ending of the effluents is for one who knows  sees I tell you not for one who does not know  does not see
For one who knows what  sees what is there the ending of effluents
'Such is form such its origination such its disappearance
Such is feeling such its origination such its disappearance
Such is perception such its origination such its disappearance
Such are fabrications such their origination such their disappearance
Such is consciousness such its origination such its disappearance' The ending of the effluents is for one who knows in this way  sees in this way
The knowledge of ending in the presence of ending has its prerequisite I tell you
It is not without a prerequisite
And what is its prerequisite
Release Release has its prerequisite I tell you
It is not without a prerequisite
And what is its prerequisite
Dispassion Disenchantment Knowledge  vision of things as they actually are presentConcentration Pleasure Serenity Rapture Joy Conviction Stress Birth Becoming Clinging Craving Feeling Contact The six sense media Nameform Consciousness Fabrications Fabrications have their prerequisite I tell you
They are not without a prerequisite
And what is their prerequisite
Ignorance
Just as when the gods pour rain in heavy drops  crash thunder on the upper mountains The water flowing down along the slopes fills the mountain clefts  rifts  gullies
When the mountain clefts  rifts  gullies are full they fill the little ponds
When the little ponds are full they fill the big lakes the little rivers the big rivers
When the big rivers are full they fill the great ocean
In the same way
From the remainderless fading  cessation of that very ignorance there no longer exists the body on account of which that pleasure  pain internally arise
There no longer exists the speech the intellect on account of which that pleasure  pain internally arise
There no longer exists the field the site the dimension or the issue on account of which that pleasure  pain internally arise
And what is the noble method that is rightly seen and rightly ferreted out by discernment
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones notices
In other words
From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications
From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness
From consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameandform
From nameandform as a requisite condition come the six sense media
From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact
From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling
From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving
From craving as a requisite condition comes clingingsustenance
From clingingsustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming
From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth
From birth as a requisite condition then old age and death sorrow lamentation pain distress and despair come into play
Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress and suffering
Now from the remainderless fading and cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications
From the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness
From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of nameandform
From the cessation of nameandform comes the cessation of the six sense media
From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact
From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling
From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving
From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clingingsustenance
From the cessation of clingingsustenance comes the cessation of becoming
From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth
From the cessation of birth then old age and death sorrow lamentation pain distress and despair all cease
Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress and suffering
This is the noble method that is rightly seen and rightly ferreted out by discernment
Suppose a dog overcome with weakness  hunger were to come across a slaughterhouse and there a dexterous butcher or butcher's apprentice were to fling him a chain of bones  thoroughly scraped without any flesh smeared with blood
What do you think Would the dog gnawing on that chain of bones  thoroughly scraped without any flesh smeared with blood  appease its weakness  hunger
No lord
And why is that
Because the chain of bones is thoroughly scraped without any flesh  smeared with blood
The dog would get nothing but its share of weariness  vexation
In the same way householder a disciple of the noble ones considers this point 'The Blessed One has compared sensuality to a chain of bones of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks' Seeing this with right discernment as it actually is then avoiding the equanimity coming from multiplicity dependent on multiplicity he develops the equanimity coming from singleness dependent on singleness where sustenanceclinging for the baits of the world ceases without trace
Now what is the allure of sensuality
There are monks these five strings of sensuality
Which five
Forms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
Sounds cognizable via the ear Aromas cognizable via the nose Flavors cognizable via the tongue Tactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
Now whatever pleasure or joy arises in dependence on these five strings of sensuality that is the allure of sensuality
And what is the drawback of sensuality
There is the case where on account of the occupation by which a clansman makes a living  whether checking or accounting or calculating or plowing or trading or cattle tending or archery or as a king's man or whatever the occupation may be  he faces cold he faces heat being harassed by mosquitoes flies wind sun and creeping things dying from hunger and thirst
Now this drawback in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here and now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
If the clansman gains no wealth while thus working and striving and making effort he sorrows grieves and laments beats his breast becomes distraught 'My work is in vain my efforts are fruitless' Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here and now has sensuality for its reason
If the clansman gains wealth while thus working and striving and making effort he experiences pain and distress in protecting it 'How shall neither kings nor thieves make off with my property nor fire burn it nor water sweep it away nor hateful heirs make off with it' And as he thus guards and watches over his property kings or thieves make off with it or fire burns it or water sweeps it away or hateful heirs make off with it
And he sorrows grieves and laments beats his breast becomes distraught 'What was mine is no more' Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here and now has sensuality for its reason
Furthermore it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source sensuality for the cause the reason being simply sensuality that kings quarrel with kings nobles with nobles brahmans with brahmans householders with householders mother with child child with mother father with child child with father brother with brother sister with sister brother with sister sister with brother friend with friend
And then in their quarrels brawls and disputes they attack one another with fists or with clods or with sticks or with knives so that they incur death or deadly pain
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here and now has sensuality for its reason
Furthermore it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that taking swords and shields and buckling on bows and quivers charge into battle massed in double array while arrows and spears are flying and swords are flashing and there they are wounded by arrows and spears and their heads are cut off by swords so that they incur death or deadly pain
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here and now has sensuality for its reason
Furthermore it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that taking swords and shields and buckling on bows and quivers charge slippery bastions while arrows and spears are flying and swords are flashing and there they are splashed with boiling cow dung and crushed under heavy weights and their heads are cut off by swords so that they incur death or deadly pain
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here and now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
And what is the emancipation from sensuality
Whatever is the subduing of passion and desire the abandoning of passion and desire for sensuality that is the emancipation from sensuality
Now what monks is the allure of forms
Suppose there were a maiden of the noble caste the brahman caste or the householder class fifteen or sixteen years old neither too tall nor too short neither too thin nor too plump neither too dark nor too pale
Is her beauty  charm at that time at its height
Yes lord
Whatever pleasure  joy arise in dependence on that beauty  charm That is the allure of forms
And what is the drawback of forms
There is the case where one might see that very same woman at a later time when she's eighty ninety one hundred years old aged roofrafter crooked bentover supported by a cane palsied miserable brokentoothed grayhaired scantyhaired bald wrinkled her body all blotchy
What do you think Has her earlier beauty  charm vanished and the drawback appeared
Yes lord
This monks is the drawback of forms
Again one might see that very same woman sick in pain  seriously ill lying soiled with her own urine  excrement lifted up by others laid down by others
What do you think Has her earlier beauty  charm vanished and the drawback appeared
Yes lord
This too monks is the drawback of forms
Again one might see that very same woman as a corpse cast away in a charnel ground  one day two days three days dead bloated livid  oozing
What do you think Has her earlier beauty  charm vanished and the drawback appeared
Yes lord
This too monks is the drawback of forms
Again one might see that very same woman as a corpse cast away in a charnel ground picked at by crows vultures  hawks by dogs hyenas  various other creatures a skeleton smeared with flesh  blood connected with tendons a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood connected with tendons a skeleton without flesh or blood connected with tendons bones detached from their tendons scattered in all directions  here a hand bone there a foot bone here a shin bone there a thigh bone here a hip bone there a back bone here a rib there a breast bone here a shoulder bone there a neck bone here a jaw bone there a tooth here a skull the bones whitened somewhat like the color of shells piled up more than a year old decomposed into a powder
What do you think Has her earlier beauty  charm vanished and the drawback appeared
Yes lord
This too monks is the drawback of forms
And what monks is the escape from forms
The subduing of desirepassion for forms the abandoning of desirepassion for forms That is the escape from form
That any brahmans or contemplatives who do not discern as it actually is the allure of forms as allure the drawback of forms as drawback the escape from forms as escape would themselves comprehend form or would rouse another with the truth so that in line with what he has practiced he would comprehend form That is impossible
But that any brahmans or contemplatives who discern as it actually is the allure of forms as allure the drawback of forms as drawback the escape from forms as escape would themselves comprehend form or would rouse another with the truth so that in line with what he has practiced he would comprehend form That is possible
Now what monks is the allure of feelings
There is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
At that time he does not intend his own affliction the affliction of others or the affliction of both
He feels a feeling totally unafflicted
The unafflicted I tell you is the highest allure of feelings
Again the monk with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
At that time he does not intend his own affliction the affliction of others or the affliction of both
He feels a feeling totally unafflicted
The unafflicted I tell you is the highest allure of feelings
And what is the drawback of feelings
The fact that feeling is inconstant stressful subject to change This is the drawback of feelings
And what is the escape from feelings
The subduing of desirepassion for feelings the abandoning of desirepassion for feelings That is the escape from feelings
That any brahmans or contemplatives who do not discern as it actually is the allure of feelings as allure the drawback of feelings as drawback the escape from feelings as escape would themselves comprehend feeling or would rouse another with the truth so that in line with what he has practiced he would comprehend feeling That is impossible
But that any brahmans or contemplatives who discern as it actually is the allure of feelings as allure the drawback of feelings as drawback the escape from feelings as escape would themselves comprehend feeling or would rouse another with the truth so that in line with what he has practiced he would comprehend feeling That is possible
And what is the perception of drawbacks
There is the case where a monk  having gone to the wilderness to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling  reflects thus 'This body has many pains many drawbacks
In this body many kinds of disease arise such as seeingdiseases hearingdiseases nosediseases tonguediseases bodydiseases headdiseases eardiseases mouthdiseases teethdiseases cough asthma catarrh fever aging stomachache fainting dysentery grippe cholera leprosy boils ringworm tuberculosis epilepsy skindisease itch scab psoriasis scabies jaundice diabetes hemorrhoids fistulas ulcers diseases arising from bile from phlegm from the windproperty from combinations of bodily humors from changes in the weather from uneven care of the body from attacks from the result of kamma cold heat hunger thirst defecation urination' Thus he remains focused on drawbacks with regard to this body
This is called the perception of drawbacks
Now these four are noble searches
Which four
There is the case where a person being subject himself to aging realizing the drawbacks of what is subject to aging seeks the unaging unsurpassed rest from the yoke Unbinding
Being subject himself to illness realizing the drawbacks of what is subject to illness he seeks the unailing unsurpassed rest from the yoke Unbinding
Being subject himself to death realizing the drawbacks of what is subject to death he seeks the undying unsurpassed rest from the yoke Unbinding
Being subject himself to defilement realizing the drawbacks of what is subject to defilement he seeks the undefiled unsurpassed rest from the yoke Unbinding
In one who keeps focusing on the drawbacks of clingable phenomena craving ceases
From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clingingsustenance
From the cessation of clingingsustenance comes the cessation of becoming
From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth
From the cessation of birth then aging illness  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair all cease
Such is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering  stress
And this monks is the noble truth of the origination of dukkha the craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion  delight relishing now here  now there  ie craving for sensual pleasure craving for becoming craving for nonbecoming
Monks any desire  passion with regard to craving for forms is a defilement of the mind
Any desire  passion with regard to craving for sounds craving for aromas craving for flavors craving for tactile sensations craving for ideas is a defilement of the mind
When with regard to these six bases the defilements of awareness are abandoned then the mind is inclined to renunciation
The mind fostered by renunciation feels malleable for the direct knowing of those qualities worth realizing
Now this monks is the Noble Truth of dukkha Birth is dukkha aging is dukkha death is dukkha sorrow lamentation pain grief  despair are dukkha association with the unbeloved is dukkha separation from the loved is dukkha not getting what is wanted is dukkha
In short the five clingingaggregates are dukkha
Now what friends is the noble truth of stress
Birth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are stressful association with the unbeloved is stressful separation from the loved is stressful not getting what is wanted is stressful
In short the five clingingaggregates are stressful
And what is birth
Whatever birth taking birth descent comingtobe comingforth appearance of aggregates  acquisition of spheres of the various beings in this or that group of beings that is called birth
And what is aging
Whatever aging decrepitude brokenness graying wrinkling decline of lifeforce weakening of the faculties of the various beings in this or that group of beings that is called aging
And what is death
Whatever deceasing passing away breaking up disappearance dying death completion of time break up of the aggregates casting off of the body interruption in the life faculty of the various beings in this or that group of beings that is called death
And what is sorrow
Whatever sorrow sorrowing sadness inward sorrow inward sadness of anyone suffering from misfortune touched by a painful thing that is called sorrow
And what is lamentation
Whatever crying grieving lamenting weeping wailing lamentation of anyone suffering from misfortune touched by a painful thing that is called lamentation
And what is pain
Whatever is experienced as bodily pain bodily discomfort pain or discomfort born of bodily contact that is called pain
And what is distress
Whatever is experienced as mental pain mental discomfort pain or discomfort born of mental contact that is called distress
And what is despair
Whatever despair despondency desperation of anyone suffering from misfortune touched by a painful thing that is called despair
And what is the stress of association with the unbeloved
There is the case where undesirable unpleasing unattractive sights sounds aromas flavors or tactile sensations occur to one or one has connection contact relationship interaction with those who wish one ill who wish for one's harm who wish for one's discomfort who wish one no security from the yoke
This is called the stress of association with the unbeloved
And what is the stress of separation from the loved
There is the case where desirable pleasing attractive sights sounds aromas flavors or tactile sensations do not occur to one or one has no connection no contact no relationship no interaction with those who wish one well who wish for one's benefit who wish for one's comfort who wish one security from the yoke nor with one's mother father brother sister friends companions or relatives
This is called the stress of separation from the loved
And what is the stress of not getting what is wanted
In beings subject to birth the wish arises 'O may we not be subject to birth and may birth not come to us' But this is not to be achieved by wanting
This is the stress of not getting what is wanted
In beings subject to aging illness death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair the wish arises 'O may we not be subject to aging illness death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair and may aging illness death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair not come to us' But this is not to be achieved by wanting
This is the stress of not getting what is wanted
And what are the five clingingaggregates that in short are stressful
The clingingaggregate of form the clingingaggregate of feeling the clingingaggregate of perception the clingingaggregate of fabrications the clingingaggregate of consciousness These are called the five clingingaggregates that in short are stressful
This friends is called the noble truth of stress
And what is the noble truth of dukkha
'The six internal sense media' should be the reply
Which six
The medium of the eye the ear the nose the tongue the body the intellect
This is called the noble truth of dukkha
The All is aflame
What All is aflame
The eye is aflame
Forms are aflame
Consciousness at the eye is aflame
Contact at the eye is aflame
And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye  experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain  that too is aflame
Aflame with what
Aflame with the fire of passion the fire of aversion the fire of delusion
Aflame I tell you with birth aging  death with sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs
The ear is aflame
Sounds are aflame
The nose is aflame
Aromas are aflame
The tongue is aflame
Flavors are aflame
The body is aflame
Tactile sensations are aflame
The intellect is aflame
Ideas are aflame
Consciousness at the intellect is aflame
Contact at the intellect is aflame
And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the intellect  experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain  that too is aflame
Aflame with what
Aflame with the fire of passion the fire of aversion the fire of delusion
Aflame I say with birth aging  death with sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs
'Dukkha should be known
The cause by which dukkha comes into play should be known
The diversity in dukkha should be known
The result of dukkha should be known
The cessation of dukkha should be known
The path of practice for the cessation of dukkha should be known' Thus it has been said
In reference to what was it said
Birth is dukkha aging is dukkha death is dukkha sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are dukkha association with what is not loved is dukkha separation from what is loved is dukkha not getting what is wanted is dukkha
In short the five clingingaggregates are dukkha
And what is the cause by which dukkha comes into play
Craving is the cause by which dukkha comes into play
And what is the diversity in dukkha
There is major dukkha  minor slowly fading  quickly fading
This is called the diversity in dukkha
And what is the result of dukkha
There are some cases in which a person overcome with pain his mind exhausted grieves mourns laments beats his breast  becomes bewildered
Or one overcome with pain his mind exhausted comes to search outside 'Who knows a way or two to stop this pain' I tell you monks that dukkha results either in bewilderment or in search
This is called the result of dukkha
And what is the cessation of dukkha
From the cessation of craving is the cessation of dukkha and just this noble eightfold path  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration  is the path of practice leading to the cessation of dukkha
Now when a disciple of the noble ones discerns dukkha in this way the cause by which dukkha comes into play in this way the diversity of dukkha in this way the result of dukkha in this way the cessation of dukkha in this way  the path of practice leading to the cessation of dukkha in this way then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of dukkha
Right Concentration is the last of the eight path factors in the Noble Eightfold Path and belongs to the concentration division of the path
And what is right concentration
There is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
This is called right concentration
I tell you the ending of the mental fermentations depends on the first jhana the second jhana the third the fourth the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness
I tell you the ending of the mental fermentations depends on the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
These are the four developments of concentration
Which four
There is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to a pleasant abiding in the here  now
There is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to the attainment of knowledge  vision
There is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to mindfulness  alertness
There is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to the ending of the effluents
And what is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to a pleasant abiding in the here  now
There is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
This is the development of concentration that leads to a pleasant abiding in the here  now
And what is the development of concentration that leads to the attainment of knowledge  vision
There is the case where a monk attends to the perception of light and is resolved on the perception of daytime
Day is the same as night night is the same as day
By means of an awareness open  unhampered he develops a brightened mind
This is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to the attainment of knowledge  vision
And what is the development of concentration that leads to mindfulness  alertness
There is the case where feelings are known to the monk as they arise known as they persist known as they subside
Perceptions are known to him as they arise known as they persist known as they subside
Thoughts are known to him as they arise known as they persist known as they subside
This is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to mindfulness  alertness
And what is the development of concentration that leads to the ending of the effluents
There is the case where a monk remains focused on arising  falling away with reference to the five clingingaggregates 'Such is form such its origination such its passing away
Such is feeling Such is perception Such are fabrications Such is consciousness such its origination such its disappearance' This is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to the ending of the effluents
These are the four developments of concentration
Now what monks is noble right concentration with its supports  requisite conditions
Any singleness of mind equipped with these seven factors  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort  right mindfulness  is called noble right concentration with its supports  requisite conditions
Over there are the roots of trees over there empty dwellings
Practice jhana monks

This is our message to you
And what is the treasure of generosity
There is the case of a disciple of the noble ones his awareness cleansed of the stain of stinginess living at home freely generous openhanded delighting in being magnanimous responsive to requests delighting in the distribution of alms
This is called the treasure of generosity
Without abandoning these five qualities one is incapable of entering  remaining in the first jhana the second jhana the third jhana the fourth jhana incapable of realizing the fruit of streamentry the fruit of oncereturning the fruit of nonreturning arahantship
Which five
Stinginess as to one's monastery stinginess as to one's family stinginess as to one's gains stinginess as to one's status and ingratitude
Without abandoning these five qualities one is incapable of entering  remaining in the first jhana the second jhana the third jhana the fourth jhana one is incapable realizing the fruit of streamentry the fruit of oncereturning the fruit of nonreturning arahantship
With the abandoning of these five qualities one is capable of entering  remaining in the first jhana the second jhana the third jhana the fourth jhana capable of realizing the fruit of streamentry the fruit of oncereturning the fruit of nonreturning arahantship
These are the five rewards of generosity One is dear and appealing to people at large one is admired by good people one's good name is spread about one does not stray from the rightful duties of the householder and with the breakup of the body at death one reappears in a good destination in the heavenly worlds
Then there is the case where a certain person refrains from taking life refrains from taking what is not given refrains from sensual misconduct refrains from false speech refrains from divisive speech refrains from abusive speech refrains from idle chatter is not covetous bears no ill will and has right views
And he gives food drink cloth vehicles garlands scents creams bed lodging  lamps to brahmans  contemplatives
With the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of human beings
There he experiences the five strings of human sensuality
It's because he refrained from taking what is not given refrained from sensual misconduct refrained from false speech refrained from divisive speech refrained from abusive speech refrained from idle chatter was not covetous bore no ill will and had right views that he reappears in the company of human beings
And it's because he gave food drink cloth vehicles garlands scents creams bed lodging  lamps to brahmans  contemplatives that he experiences the five strings of human sensuality
It's because he refrained from taking what is not given and had right views that he reappears in the company of devas
And it's because he gave food drink cloth vehicles garlands scents creams bed lodging  lamps to brahmans  contemplatives that he experiences the five strings of divine sensuality
But at any rate brahman the donor does not go without reward
It's amazing Master Gotama it's astounding how it's enough to make one want to give a gift enough to make one want to make an offering where the donor does not go without reward
That's the way it is brahman
That's the way it is
The donor does not go without reward
Even if a person throws the rinsings of a bowl or a cup into a village pool or pond thinking 'May whatever animals live here feed on this' that would be a source of merit
If beings knew as I know the results of giving  sharing they would not eat without having given nor would the stain of miserliness overcome their minds
Even if it were their last bite their last mouthful they would not eat without having shared if there were someone to receive their gift
But because beings do not know as I know the results of giving  sharing they eat without having given
The stain of miserliness overcomes their minds
Even if a person throws the rinsings of a bowl or a cup into a village pool or pond thinking 'May whatever animals live here feed on this' that would be a source of merit to say nothing of what is given to human beings
But I do say that what is given to a virtuous person is of great fruit and not so much what is given to an unvirtuous person
And the virtuous person has abandoned five factors and is endowed with five
Which five has he abandoned
He has abandoned sensual desire ill will sloth  drowsiness restlessness  anxiety uncertainty
These are the five factors he has abandoned
And with which five is he endowed
He is endowed with the aggregate of virtue of one beyond training the aggregate of concentration of one beyond training the aggregate of discernment of one beyond training the aggregate of release of one beyond training the aggregate of knowledge  vision of release of one beyond training
These are the five factors with which he is endowed
I tell you What is given to one who has abandoned these five factors and is endowed with these five bears great fruit
There are these eight individuals who are worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of reverential salutation the unsurpassed field of merit for the world

These are the eight individuals who are worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of reverential salutation the unsurpassed field of merit for the world
These five are a person of integrity's gifts
Which five
A person of integrity gives a gift with a sense of conviction
A person of integrity gives a gift attentively
A person of integrity gives a gift in season
A person of integrity gives a gift with an empathetic heart
A person of integrity gives a gift without adversely affecting himself or others
Is it possible lord to point out a fruit of generosity visible in the here  now
It is possible Siha
One who gives who is a master of giving is dear  charming to people at large
And the fact that who gives who is a master of giving is dear  charming to people at large this is a fruit of generosity visible in the here  now
Furthermore good people people of integrity admire one who gives who is a master of giving
And the fact that good people people of integrity admire one who gives who is a master of giving this too is a fruit of generosity visible in the here  now
Furthermore the fine reputation of one who gives who is a master of giving is spread far  wide
And the fact that the fine reputation of one who gives who is a master of giving is spread far  wide this too is a fruit of generosity visible in the here  now
Furthermore when one who gives who is a master of giving approaches any assembly of people  noble warriors brahmans householders or contemplatives  heshe does so confidently  without embarrassment
And the fact that when one who gives who is a master of giving approaches any assembly of people  noble warriors brahmans householders or contemplatives  heshe does so confidently  without embarrassment this too is a fruit of generosity visible in the here  now
Furthermore at the breakup of the body after death one who gives who is a master of giving reappears in a good destination the heavenly world
And the fact that at the breakup of the body after death one who gives who is a master of giving reappears in a good destination the heavenly world this is a fruit of generosity in the next life
When this was said General Siha said to the Blessed One As for the four fruits of generosity visible in the here  now that have been pointed out by the Blessed One it's not the case that I go by conviction in the Blessed One with regard to them
I know them too
I am one who gives a master of giving dear  charming to people at large
I am one who gives a master of giving good people people of integrity admire me
I am one who gives a master of giving and my fine reputation is spread far  wide 'Siha is generous a doer a supporter of the Sangha' I am one who gives a master of giving and when I approach any assembly of people  noble warriors brahmans householders or contemplatives  I do so confidently  without embarrassment
But when the Blessed One says to me 'At the breakup of the body after death one who gives who is a master of giving reappears in a good destination the heavenly world' that I do not know
That is where I go by conviction in the Blessed One
So it is Siha
So it is
At the breakup of the body after death one who gives who is a master of giving reappears in a good destination the heavenly world
Sariputta there is the case where a person gives a gift seeking his own profit with a mind attached seeking to store up for himself 'I'll enjoy this after death' He gives his gift  food drink clothing a vehicle a garland perfume  ointment bedding shelter  a lamp  to a brahman or a contemplative
What do you think Sariputta
Might a person give such a gift as this
Yes lord
Having given this gift seeking his own profit  with a mind attached seeking to store up for himself 'I'll enjoy this after death'  on the breakup of the body after death reappears in the company of the Four Great Kings
Then having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this world
Then there is the case of a person who gives a gift not seeking his own profit not with a mind attached not seeking to store up for himself nor 'I'll enjoy this after death' Instead he gives a gift with the thought 'Giving is good' He gives his gift  food drink clothing a vehicle a garland perfume  ointment bedding shelter  a lamp  to a brahman or a contemplative
What do you think Sariputta
Might a person give such a gift as this
Yes lord
Having given this gift with the thought 'Giving is good' on the breakup of the body after death reappears in the company of the Devas of the Thirtythree
Then having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this world
Or instead of thinking 'Giving is good' he gives a gift with the thought 'This was given in the past done in the past by my father  grandfather
It would not be right for me to let this old family custom be discontinued' on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of the Devas of the Hours
Then having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this world
Or instead he gives a gift with the thought 'I am welloff
These are not welloff
It would not be right for me being welloff not to give a gift to those who are not welloff' on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of the Contented Devas
Then having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this world
Or instead he gives a gift with the thought 'Just as there were the great sacrifices of the sages of the past  Atthaka Vamaka Vamadeva Vessamitta Yamataggi Angirasa Bharadvaja Vasettha Kassapa  Bhagu  in the same way will this be my distribution of gifts' on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of the devas who delight in creation
Then having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this world
Or instead he gives a gift with the thought 'When this gift of mine is given it makes the mind serene
Gratification  joy arise' on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of the devas who have power over the creations of others
Then having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this world
Or instead of thinking 'When this gift of mine is given it makes the mind serene
Gratification  joy arise' he gives a gift with the thought 'This is an ornament for the mind a support for the mind' He gives his gift  food drink clothing a vehicle a garland perfume  ointment bedding shelter  a lamp  to a brahman or a contemplative
What do you think Sariputta
Might a person give such a gift as this
Yes lord
Having given this not seeking his own profit not with a mind attached not seeking to store up for himself nor 'I'll enjoy this after death'
  nor with the thought 'Giving is good'
  nor with the thought 'This was given in the past done in the past by my father  grandfather
It would not be right for me to let this old family custom be discontinued'
  nor with the thought 'I am welloff
These are not welloff
It would not be right for me being welloff not to give a gift to those who are not welloff' nor with the thought 'Just as there were the great sacrifices of the sages of the past  Atthaka Vamaka Vamadeva Vessamitta Yamataggi Angirasa Bharadvaja Vasettha Kassapa  Bhagu  in the same way this will be my distribution of gifts'
  nor with the thought 'When this gift of mine is given it makes the mind serene
Gratification  joy arise'
  but with the thought 'This is an ornament for the mind a support for the mind'  on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of Brahma's Retinue
Then having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a nonreturner
He does not come back to this world
This Sariputta is the cause this is the reason why a person gives a gift of a certain sort and it does not bear great fruit or great benefit whereas another person gives a gift of the same sort and it bears great fruit and great benefit
Right Mindfulness is the seventh of the eight path factors in the Noble Eightfold Path and belongs to the concentration division of the path
And what is right mindfulness
There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelings in  of themselves the mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
This is called right mindfulness
This is the direct path for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow  lamentation for the disappearance of pain  distress for the attainment of the right method  for the realization of Unbinding  in other words the four frames of reference
One is mindful to abandon wrong view  to enter  remain in right view This is one's right mindfulness
One is mindful to abandon wrong resolve  to enter  remain in right resolve This is one's right mindfulness
One is mindful to abandon wrong speech  to enter  remain in right speech This is one's right mindfulness
One is mindful to abandon wrong action  to enter  remain in right action This is one's right mindfulness
One is mindful to abandon wrong livelihood  to enter  remain in right livelihood This is one's right mindfulness
Suppose monks that a large crowd of people comes thronging together saying 'The beauty queen
The beauty queen' And suppose that the beauty queen is highly accomplished at singing  dancing so that an even greater crowd comes thronging saying 'The beauty queen is singing
The beauty queen is dancing' Then a man comes along desiring life  shrinking from death desiring pleasure  abhorring pain
They say to him 'Now look here mister
You must take this bowl filled to the brim with oil and carry it on your head in between the great crowd  the beauty queen
A man with a raised sword will follow right behind you and wherever you spill even a drop of oil right there will he cut off your head' Now what do you think monks Will that man not paying attention to the bowl of oil let himself get distracted outside
No lord
I have given you this parable to convey a meaning
The meaning is this The bowl filled to the brim with oil stands for mindfulness immersed in the body
Thus you should train yourselves 'We will develop mindfulness immersed in the body
We will pursue it hand it the reins and take it as a basis give it a grounding steady it consolidate it and undertake it well' That is how you should train yourselves
Mindfulness of death when developed  pursued is of great fruit  great benefit
It plunges into the Deathless has the Deathless as its final end
Therefore you should develop mindfulness of death
Mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued is of great fruit of great benefit
Mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued brings the four frames of reference to their culmination
The four frames of reference when developed  pursued bring the seven factors for Awakening to their culmination
The seven factors for Awakening when developed  pursued bring clear knowing  release to their culmination
Now how is mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefit
There is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore
Always mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
 Breathing in long he discerns 'I am breathing in long' or breathing out long he discerns 'I am breathing out long' Or breathing in short he discerns 'I am breathing in short' or breathing out short he discerns 'I am breathing out short' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication'
 He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to rapture and to breathe out sensitive to rapture
He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to pleasure and to breathe out sensitive to pleasure
He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to mental processes and to breathe out sensitive to mental processes
He trains himself to breathe in calming mental processes and to breathe out calming mental processes
 He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the mind and to breathe out sensitive to the mind
He trains himself to breathe in satisfying the mind and to breathe out satisfying the mind
He trains himself to breathe in steadying the mind and to breathe out steadying the mind
He trains himself to breathe in releasing the mind and to breathe out releasing the mind
 He trains himself to breathe in focusing on inconstancy and to breathe out focusing on inconstancy
He trains himself to breathe in focusing on dispassion and to breathe out focusing on dispassion
He trains himself to breathe in focusing on cessation and to breathe out focusing on cessation
He trains himself to breathe in focusing on relinquishment and to breathe out focusing on relinquishment
Right Livelihood is the fifth of the eight path factors in the Noble Eightfold Path and belongs to the virtue division of the path
And what is right livelihood
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones having abandoned dishonest livelihood keeps his life going with right livelihood This is called right livelihood
Herein Vyagghapajja a householder knowing his income and expenses leads a balanced life neither extravagant nor miserly knowing that thus his income will stand in excess of his expenses but not his expenses in excess of his income
Just as the goldsmith or an apprentice of his knows on holding up a balance that by so much it has dipped down by so much it has tilted up even so a householder knowing his income and expenses leads a balanced life neither extravagant nor miserly knowing that thus his income will stand in excess of his expenses but not his expenses in excess of his income
And how is right view the forerunner
One discerns wrong livelihood as wrong livelihood and right livelihood as right livelihood
And what is wrong livelihood
Scheming persuading hinting belittling  pursuing gain with gain
This is wrong livelihood
One tries to abandon wrong livelihood  to enter into right livelihood This is one's right effort
One is mindful to abandon wrong livelihood  to enter  remain in right livelihood This is one's right mindfulness
Thus these three qualities  right view right effort  right mindfulness  run  circle around right livelihood
A lay follower should not engage in five types of business
Which five
Business in weapons business in human beings business in meat business in intoxicants and business in poison

Then Yodhajiva the headman went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord I have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of warriors that 'When a warrior strives  exerts himself in battle if others then strike him down  slay him while he is striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle' What does the Blessed One have to say about that
Enough headman put that aside
Don't ask me that
A second time A third time Yodhajiva the headman said Lord I have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of warriors that 'When a warrior strives  exerts himself in battle if others then strike him down  slay him while he is striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle' What does the Blessed One have to say about that
Apparently headman I haven't been able to get past you by saying 'Enough headman put that aside
Don't ask me that' So I will simply answer you
When a warrior strives  exerts himself in battle his mind is already seized debased  misdirected by the thought 'May these beings be struck down or slaughtered or annihilated or destroyed
May they not exist' If others then strike him down  slay him while he is thus striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the hell called the realm of those slain in battle
But if he holds such a view as this 'When a warrior strives  exerts himself in battle if others then strike him down  slay him while he is striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle' that is his wrong view
Now there are two destinations for a person with wrong view I tell you either hell or the animal womb
When this was said Yodhajiva the headman sobbed  burst into tears
That is what I couldn't get past you by saying 'Enough headman put that aside
Don't ask me that' I'm not crying lord because of what the Blessed One said to me but simply because I have been deceived cheated  fooled for a long time by that ancient teaching lineage of warriors who said 'When a warrior strives  exerts himself in battle if others then strike him down  slay him while he is striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle'
Then Talaputa the head of an acting troupe went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord I have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of actors that 'When an actor on the stage in the midst of a festival makes people laugh  gives them delight with his imitation of reality then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of the laughing devas' What does the Blessed One have to say about that
Enough headman put that aside
Don't ask me that
A second time A third time Talaputa the head of an acting troupe said Lord I have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of actors that 'When an actor on the stage in the midst of a festival makes people laugh  gives them delight with his imitation of reality then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of the laughing devas' What does the Blessed One have to say about that
Apparently headman I haven't been able to get past you by saying 'Enough headman put that aside
Don't ask me that' So I will simply answer you
Any beings who are not devoid of passion to begin with who are bound by the bond of passion focus with even more passion on things inspiring passion presented by an actor on stage in the midst of a festival
Any beings who are not devoid of aversion to begin with who are bound by the bond of aversion focus with even more aversion on things inspiring aversion presented by an actor on stage in the midst of a festival
Any beings who are not devoid of delusion to begin with who are bound by the bond of delusion focus with even more delusion on things inspiring delusion presented by an actor on stage in the midst of a festival
Thus the actor  himself intoxicated  heedless having made others intoxicated  heedless  with the breakup of the body after death is reborn in what is called the hell of laughter
But if he holds such a view as this 'When an actor on the stage in the midst of a festival makes people laugh  gives them delight with his imitation of reality then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of the laughing devas' that is his wrong view
Now there are two destinations for a person with wrong view I tell you either hell or the animal womb
When this was said Talaputa the head of an acting troupe sobbed  burst into tears
That is what I couldn't get past you by saying 'Enough headman put that aside
Don't ask me that' I'm not crying lord because of what the Blessed One said to me but simply because I have been deceived cheated  fooled for a long time by that ancient teaching lineage of actors who said 'When an actor on the stage in the midst of a festival makes people laugh  gives them delight with his imitation of reality then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of the laughing devas'
Right Effort is the sixth of the eight path factors in the Noble Eightfold Path and belongs to the concentration division of the path
And what monks is right effort
There is the case where a monk generates desire endeavors activates persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the nonarising of evil unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen
He generates desire endeavors activates persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the abandonment of evil unskillful qualities that have arisen
He generates desire endeavors activates persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen
He generates desire endeavors activates persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the maintenance nonconfusion increase plenitude development  culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen This monks is called right effort
Abandon what is unskillful monks
It is possible to abandon what is unskillful
If it were not possible to abandon what is unskillful I would not say to you 'Abandon what is unskillful' But because it is possible to abandon what is unskillful I say to you 'Abandon what is unskillful' If this abandoning of what is unskillful were conducive to harm and pain I would not say to you 'Abandon what is unskillful' But because this abandoning of what is unskillful is conducive to benefit and pleasure I say to you 'Abandon what is unskillful'
Develop what is skillful monks
It is possible to develop what is skillful
If it were not possible to develop what is skillful I would not say to you 'Develop what is skillful' But because it is possible to develop what is skillful I say to you 'Develop what is skillful' If this development of what is skillful were conducive to harm and pain I would not say to you 'Develop what is skillful' But because this development of what is skillful is conducive to benefit and pleasure I say to you 'Develop what is skillful'
One tries to abandon wrong view  to enter into right view This is one's right effort
One tries to abandon wrong resolve  to enter into right resolve This is one's right effort
One tries to abandon wrong speech  to enter into right speech This is one's right effort
One tries to abandon wrong action  to enter into right action This is one's right effort
One tries to abandon wrong livelihood  to enter into right livelihood This is one's right effort
As Ven Sona was meditating in seclusion this train of thought arose in his awareness Of the Blessed One's disciples who have aroused their persistence I am one but my mind is not released from the effluents through lack of clingingsustenance
Now my family has enough wealth that it would be possible to enjoy wealth  make merit
What if I were to disavow the training return to the lower life enjoy wealth  make merit
Then the Blessed One as soon as he perceived with his awareness the train of thought in Ven
Sona's awareness  as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or bend his outstretched arm  disappeared from Vulture Peak Mountain appeared in the Cool Wood right in front of Ven
Sona and sat down on a prepared seat
Ven
Sona after bowing down to the Blessed One sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Just now as you were meditating in seclusion didn't this train of thought appear to your awareness 'Of the Blessed One's disciples who have aroused their persistence I am one but my mind is not released from the effluents What if I were to disavow the training return to the lower life enjoy wealth  make merit' Yes lord
Now what do you think Sona
Before when you were a housedweller were you skilled at playing the vina
Yes lord
And what do you think when the strings of your vina were too taut was your vina in tune  playable
No lord
And what do you think when the strings of your vina were too loose was your vina in tune  playable
No lord
And what do you think when the strings of your vina were neither too taut nor too loose but tuned to be right on pitch was your vina in tune  playable
Yes lord
In the same way Sona overaroused persistence leads to restlessness overly slack persistence leads to laziness
Thus you should determine the right pitch for your persistence attune the pitch of the faculties and there pick up your theme
Yes lord Ven
Sona answered the Blessed One
Then having given this exhortation to Ven
Sona the Blessed One  as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or bend his outstretched arm  disappeared from the Cool Wood and appeared on Vulture Peak Mountain
So after that Ven
Sona determined the right pitch for his persistence attuned the pitch of the faculties and there picked up his theme
Dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now
He knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus Ven
Sona became another one of the arahants
Right Action is the fourth of the eight path factors in the Noble Eightfold Path and belongs to the virtue division of the path
And what is right action
Abstaining from taking life abstaining from stealing abstaining from unchastity
This is called right action
One tries to abandon wrong action  to enter into right action This is one's right effort
One is mindful to abandon wrong action  to enter  remain in right action This is one's right mindfulness
Thus these three qualities  right view right effort  right mindfulness  run  circle around right action
Having thus gone forth following the training  way of life of the monks abandoning the taking of life he abstains from the taking of life
He dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous kind compassionate for the welfare of all living beings
Abandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not given
He takes only what is given accepts only what is given lives not by stealth but by means of a self that has become pure
Abandoning uncelibacy he lives a celibate life aloof refraining from the sexual act that is the villager's way
And how is one made pure in three ways by bodily action
There is the case where a certain person abandoning the taking of life abstains from the taking of life
He dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beings
Abandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not given
He does not take in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by them
Abandoning sensual misconduct he abstains from sensual misconduct
He does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their Dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another man
This is how one is made pure in three ways by bodily action
Right Speech is the third of the eight path factors in the Noble Eightfold Path and belongs to the virtue division of the path
And what is right speech
Abstaining from lying from divisive speech from abusive speech  from idle chatter This is called right speech
Monks a statement endowed with five factors is wellspoken not illspoken
It is blameless  unfaulted by knowledgeable people
Which five
It is spoken at the right time
It is spoken in truth
It is spoken affectionately
It is spoken beneficially
It is spoken with a mind of goodwill
For the person who transgresses in one thing I tell you there is no evil deed that is not to be done
Which one thing
This telling a deliberate lie
One should speak only that word by which one would not torment oneself nor harm others
That word is indeed well spoken
One should speak only pleasant words words which are acceptable
What one speaks without bringing evils to others is pleasant
And how is one made pure in four ways by verbal action
There is the case where a certain person abandoning false speech abstains from false speech
When he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty if he is asked as a witness 'Come  tell good man what you know' If he doesn't know he says 'I don't know' If he does know he says 'I know' If he hasn't seen he says 'I haven't seen' If he has seen he says 'I have seen' Thus he doesn't consciously tell a lie for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of any reward
Abandoning false speech he abstains from false speech
He speaks the truth holds to the truth is firm reliable no deceiver of the world
Abandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speech
What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people here
What he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people there
Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concord
Abandoning abusive speech he abstains from abusive speech
He speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing  pleasing to people at large
Abandoning idle chatter he abstains from idle chatter
He speaks in season speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the Dhamma  the Vinaya
He speaks words worth treasuring seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goal
This is how one is made pure in four ways by verbal action
And how is right view the forerunner
One discerns wrong speech as wrong speech and right speech as right speech
And what is wrong speech
Lying divisive talebearing abusive speech  idle chatter
This is wrong speech
One tries to abandon wrong speech  to enter into right speech This is one's right effort
One is mindful to abandon wrong speech  to enter  remain in right speech This is one's right mindfulness
Thus these three qualities  right view right effort  right mindfulness  run  circle around right speech
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be unfactual untrue unbeneficial unendearing  disagreeable to others he does not say them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true unbeneficial unendearing  disagreeable to others he does not say them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true beneficial but unendearing  disagreeable to others he has a sense of the proper time for saying them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be unfactual untrue unbeneficial but endearing  agreeable to others he does not say them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true unbeneficial but endearing  agreeable to others he does not say them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true beneficial and endearing  agreeable to others he has a sense of the proper time for saying them
Why is that
Because the Tathagata has sympathy for living beings
Whenever you want to perform a verbal act you should reflect on it 'This verbal act I want to perform  would it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful verbal act with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it would lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it would be an unskillful verbal act with painful consequences painful results then any verbal act of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do
But if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction it would be a skillful verbal action with happy consequences happy results then any verbal act of that sort is fit for you to do
While you are performing a verbal act you should reflect on it 'This verbal act I am doing  is it leading to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful verbal act with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it is leading to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both you should give it up
But if on reflection you know that it is not you may continue with it
Having performed a verbal act you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful verbal act with painful consequences painful results then you should confess it reveal it lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy life
Having confessed it you should exercise restraint in the future
But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful verbal action with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed and joyful training day and night in skillful mental qualities
Whereas some brahmans and contemplatives living off food given in faith are addicted to talking about lowly topics such as these  talking about kings robbers ministers of state armies alarms and battles food and drink clothing furniture garlands and scents relatives vehicles villages towns cities the countryside women and heroes the gossip of the street and the well tales of the dead tales of diversity the creation of the world and of the sea and talk of whether things exist or not  he abstains from talking about lowly topics such as these
This too is part of his virtue
Whereas some brahmans and contemplatives living off food given in faith are addicted to debates such as these  'You understand this doctrine and discipline
I'm the one who understands this doctrine and discipline
How could you understand this doctrine and discipline
You're practicing wrongly
I'm practicing rightly
I'm being consistent
You're not
What should be said first you said last
What should be said last you said first
What you took so long to think out has been refuted
Your doctrine has been overthrown
You're defeated
Go and try to salvage your doctrine extricate yourself if you can'  he abstains from debates such as these
This too is part of his virtue
Monks do not wage wordy warfare saying 'You don't understand this Dhamma and discipline I understand this Dhamma and discipline' 'How could you understand it
You have fallen into wrong practices I have the right practice' 'You have said afterwards what you should have said first and you have said first what you should have said afterwards' 'What I say is consistent what you say isn't' 'What you have thought out for so long is entirely reversed' 'Your statement is refuted' 'You are talking rubbish' 'You are in the wrong' 'Get out of that if you can'
Why should you not do this
Such talk monks is not related to the goal it is not fundamental to the holy life does not conduce to disenchantment dispassion cessation tranquillity higher knowledge enlightenment or to Nibbana
When you have discussions monks you should discuss Suffering the Arising of Suffering its Cessation and the Path that leads to its Cessation
Why is that
Because such talk is related to the goal it conduces to disenchantment to Nibbana
This is the task you must accomplish
There are these ten topics of conversation
Which ten
Talk on modesty on contentment on seclusion on nonentanglement on arousing persistence on virtue on concentration on discernment on release and on the knowledge  vision of release
These are the ten topics of conversation
If you were to engage repeatedly in these ten topics of conversation you would outshine even the sun  moon so mighty so powerful  to say nothing of the wanderers of other sects
O bhikkhus a bhikkhu who desires to admonish another should do so after investigating five conditions in himself and after establishing five other conditions in himself
What are the five conditions which he should investigate in himself
Am I one who practices purity in bodily action flawless and untainted
Am I one who practices purity in speech flawless and untainted
Is the heart of goodwill free from malice established in me towards fellowfarers in the holy life
Am I or am I not one who has heard much who bears in mind what he has heard who stores up what he has heard
Those teachings which are good alike in their beginning middle and ending proclaiming perfectly the spirit and the letter of the utterly purified holy life  have such teachings been much heard by me borne in mind practiced in speech pondered in the heart and rightly penetrated by insight
Are the Patimokkhas in full thoroughly learned by heart wellanalyzed with thorough knowledge of their meanings clearly divided sutta by sutta and known in minute detail by me
These five conditions must be investigated in himself
And what other five conditions must be established in himself
Do I speak at the right time or not
Do I speak of facts or not
Do I speak gently or harshly
Do I speak profitable words or not
Do I speak with a kindly heart or inwardly malicious
O bhikkhus these five conditions are to be investigated in himself and the latter five established in himself by a bhikkhu who desires to admonish another
There are these three cravings
Which three
Craving for sensuality craving for becoming craving for nonbecoming
These are the three cravings
Craving is an arrow
The poison of ignorance spreads its toxin through desire passion  ill will
There are these six classes of craving craving for forms craving for sounds craving for odors craving for flavors craving for tangibles craving for mindobjects
Monks I don't envision even one other fetter  fettered by which beings conjoined go wandering and transmigrating on for a long long time  like the fetter of craving
Fettered with the fetter of craving beings conjoined go wandering and transmigrating on for a long long time
And what is the cause by which stress comes into play
Craving is the cause by which stress comes into play
And where does this craving when arising arise
And where when dwelling does it dwell
Whatever seems endearing and agreeable in terms of the world that is where this craving when arising arises
That is where when dwelling it dwells
And what seems endearing and agreeable in terms of the world
The eye seems endearing and agreeable in terms of the world
That is where this craving when arising arises
That is where when dwelling it dwells
The ear The nose The tongue The body The intellect

Evaluation of forms Evaluation of sounds Evaluation of smells Evaluation of tastes Evaluation of tactile sensations Evaluation of ideas seems endearing and agreeable in terms of the world
That is where this craving when arising arises
That is where when dwelling it dwells
And what is ignorance what is the origin of ignorance what is the cessation of ignorance what is the way leading to the cessation of ignorance
Not knowing about dukkha not knowing about the origin of dukkha not knowing about the cessation of dukkha not knowing about the way leading to the cessation of dukkha  this is called ignorance
With the arising of the taints there is the arising of ignorance with the cessation of the taints there is the cessation of ignorance
The way leading to the cessation of ignorance is just this Noble Eightfold Path that is right view right concentration

And what are the taints what is the origin of the taints what is the cessation of the taints what is the way leading to the cessation of the taints
There are three taints the taint of sensual desire the taint of being and the taint of ignorance
With the arising of ignorance there is the arising of the taints
With the cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of the taints
The way leading to the cessation of the taints is just this Noble Eightfold Path that is right view right concentration
From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications
From fabrications comes consciousness
From consciousness nameform
From nameform the six sense media
From the six sense media contact
From contact feeling
From feelingcraving
From craving clingingsustenance
From clingingsustenance becoming
From becoming birth
From birth as a requisite condition then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair come into play
Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress  suffering
Now from the remainderless fading  cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications
From the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness
From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of nameform
From the cessation of nameform comes the cessation of the six sense media
From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact
From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling
From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving
From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clingingsustenance
From the cessation of clingingsustenance comes the cessation of becoming
From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth
From the cessation of birth then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair all cease
Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress  suffering
Intention I tell you is kamma
Intending one does kamma by way of body speech  intellect
'I am the owner of my actions heir to my actions born of my actions related through my actions and have my actions as my arbitrator
Whatever I do for good or for evil to that will I fall heir'
 one should reflect on often whether one is a woman or a man lay or ordained
Now based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect that 'I am the owner of my actions heir to my actions born of my actions related through my actions and have my actions as my arbitrator
Whatever I do for good or for evil to that will I fall heir'
There are beings who conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mind
But when they often reflect on that fact that bad conduct in body speech and mind will either be entirely abandoned or grow weaker
A disciple of the noble ones considers this 'I am not the only one who is owner of my actions heir to my actions born of my actions related through my actions and have my actions as my arbitrator who  whatever I do for good or for evil to that will I fall heir
To the extent that there are beings  past and future passing away and rearising  all beings are the owner of their actions heir to their actions born of their actions related through their actions and live dependent on their actions
Whatever they do for good or for evil to that will they fall heir' When heshe often reflects on this the path take birth
Heshe sticks with that path develops it cultivates it
As heshe sticks with that path develops it and cultivates it the fetters are abandoned the obsessions destroyed
'Kamma should be known
The cause by which kamma comes into play should be known
The diversity in kamma should be known
The result of kamma should be known
The cessation of kamma should be known
The path of practice for the cessation of kamma should be known' Thus it has been said
In reference to what was it said
Intention I tell you is kamma
Intending one does kamma by way of body speech  intellect
And what is the cause by which kamma comes into play
Contact is the cause by which kamma comes into play
And what is the diversity in kamma
There is kamma to be experienced in hell kamma to be experienced in the realm of common animals kamma to be experienced in the realm of the hungry shades kamma to be experienced in the human world kamma to be experienced in the world of the devas
This is called the diversity in kamma
And what is the result of kamma
The result of kamma is of three sorts I tell you that which arises right here  now that which arises later and that which arises following that
This is called the result of kamma
And what is the cessation of kamma
From the cessation of contact is the cessation of kamma and just this noble eightfold path  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration  is the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma
Now when a disciple of the noble ones discerns kamma in this way the cause by which kamma comes into play in this way the diversity of kamma in this way the result of kamma in this way the cessation of kamma in this way  the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma in this way then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of kamma
'Kamma should be known
The cause by which kamma comes into play The diversity in kamma The result of kamma The cessation of kamma The path of practice for the cessation of kamma should be known' Thus it has been said and in reference to this was it said
What do you think Rahula What is a mirror for
For reflection sir
In the same way Rahula bodily acts verbal acts and mental acts are to be done with repeated reflection
Whenever you want to perform a bodily act you should reflect on it 'This bodily act I want to perform  would it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it would lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it would be an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then any bodily act of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do
But if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction it would be a skillful bodily action with happy consequences happy results then any bodily act of that sort is fit for you to do
While you are performing a bodily act you should reflect on it 'This bodily act I am doing  is it leading to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it is leading to selfaffliction to affliction of others or both you should give it up
But if on reflection you know that it is not you may continue with it
Having performed a bodily act you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then you should confess it reveal it lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy life
Having confessed it you should exercise restraint in the future
But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful bodily action with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed and joyful training day and night in skillful mental qualities
Rahula all the brahmans and contemplatives in the course of the past who purified their bodily acts verbal acts and mental acts did it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts verbal acts and mental acts in just this way
All the brahmans and contemplatives in the course of the future All the brahmans and contemplatives at present who purify their bodily acts verbal acts and mental acts do it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts verbal acts and mental acts in just this way
Therefore Rahula you should train yourself 'I will purify my bodily acts through repeated reflection
I will purify my verbal acts through repeated reflection
I will purify my mental acts through repeated reflection' Thus you should train yourself
These five things are welcome agreeable pleasant and hard to obtain in the world
Which five
Long life beauty pleasure status rebirth in heaven Now I tell you these five things are not to be obtained by reason of prayers or wishes
If they were to be obtained by reason of prayers or wishes who here would lack them
It's not fitting for the disciple of the noble ones who desires long life to pray for it or to delight in doing so
Instead the disciple of the noble ones who desires long life should follow the path of practice leading to long life
In so doing he will attain long life either human or divine
Monks these four types of kamma have been directly realized verified  made known by me
Which four
There is kamma that is dark with dark result
There is kamma that is bright with bright result
There is kamma that is dark  bright with dark  bright result
There is kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neither dark nor bright result leading to the ending of kamma
And what is kamma that is dark with dark result
There is the case where a certain person fabricates an injurious bodily fabrication fabricates an injurious verbal fabrication fabricates an injurious mental fabrication
Having fabricated an injurious bodily fabrication having fabricated an injurious verbal fabrication having fabricated an injurious mental fabrication he rearises in an injurious world
On rearising in an injurious world he is there touched by injurious contacts
Touched by injurious contacts he experiences feelings that are exclusively painful like those of the beings in hell
This is called kamma that is dark with dark result
And what is kamma that is bright with bright result
There is the case where a certain person fabricates a noninjurious bodily fabrication a noninjurious verbal fabrication a noninjurious mental fabrication He rearises in a noninjurious world There he is touched by noninjurious contacts He experiences feelings that are exclusively pleasant like those of the Everradiant Devas
This is called kamma that is bright with bright result
And what is kamma that is dark  bright with dark  bright result
There is the case where a certain person fabricates a bodily fabrication that is injurious  noninjurious a verbal fabrication that is injurious  noninjurious a mental fabrication that is injurious  noninjurious He rearises in an injurious  noninjurious world There he is touched by injurious  noninjurious contacts He experiences injurious  noninjurious feelings pleasure mingled with pain like those of human beings some devas and some beings in the lower realms
This is called kamma that is dark  bright with dark  bright result
And what is kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neither dark nor bright result leading to the ending of kamma
right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
This is called kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neither dark nor bright result leading to the ending of kamma
Scattered throughout the suttas are references to as many as thirtyone distinct planes or realms of existence into which beings can be reborn during their long wandering through samsara
These range from the extraordinarily grim and painful hell realms all the way up to the most exquisitely refined and blissful heaven realms
Existence in every realm is temporary in Buddhist cosmology there is no eternal heaven or hell
Beings are born into a particular realm according to their past kamma
When they pass away they take rebirth once again elsewhere according to the quality of their kamma wholesome actions bring about a favorable rebirth while unwholesome actions lead to an unfavorable one
And so the wearisome cycle continues
The realms of existence are customarily divided into three distinct worlds listed here in descending order of refinement
The information on this page was assembled from a variety of sources
In the interests of economizing space I have not attributed each fact to its respective source
Among its inhabitants is Brahma Sahampati who begs the Buddha to teach Dhamma to the world

 Generosity
 The development of virtue and wisdom 
You are here

Rebirth as a human being is extraordinarily rare
It is also extraordinarily precious as its unique balance of pleasure and pain facilitates the development of virtue and wisdom to the degree necessary to set one free from the entire cycle of rebirths
 The attainment of streamentry guarantees that all future rebirths will be in the human or higher realms
Read Ajaan Lee's colorful description of this realm
 Lack of virtue holding to wrong views 
 Lack of virtue holding to wrong views
If one is generous to monks and nuns however one may be reborn as an ornamented animal

Bhikkhus it is through not realizing through not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that this long course of birth and death has been passed through and undergone by me as well as by you
What are these four
They are the noble truth of dukkha the noble truth of the origin of dukkha the noble truth of the cessation of dukkha and the noble truth of the way to the cessation of dukkha
But now bhikkhus that these have been realized and penetrated cut off is the craving for existence destroyed is that which leads to renewed becoming and there is no fresh becoming
Friends just as the footprints of all legged animals are encompassed by the footprint of the elephant and the elephant's footprint is reckoned the foremost among them in terms of size in the same way all skillful qualities are gathered under the four noble truths
Under which four
Under the noble truth of stress under the noble truth of the origination of stress under the noble truth of the cessation of stress and under the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress
Vision arose insight arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before 'This is the noble truth of stress' 'This noble truth of stress is to be comprehended' 'This noble truth of stress has been comprehended'
Vision arose insight arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before 'This is the noble truth of the origination of stress' 'This noble truth of the origination of stress is to be abandoned' 'This noble truth of the origination of stress has been abandoned'
Vision arose insight arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before 'This is the noble truth of the cessation of stress' 'This noble truth of the cessation of stress is to be directly experienced' 'This noble truth of the cessation of stress has been directly experienced'
Vision arose insight arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before 'This is the noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress' 'This noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress is to be developed' 'This noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress has been developed'
And monks as long as this knowledge  vision of mine  with its three rounds  twelve permutations concerning these four noble truths as they actually are present  was not pure I did not claim to have directly awakened to the right selfawakening unexcelled in the cosmos with its devas Maras  Brahmas with its contemplatives  brahmans its royalty  commonfolk
But as soon as this knowledge  vision of mine  with its three rounds  twelve permutations concerning these four noble truths as they actually are present  was truly pure then I did claim to have directly awakened to the right selfawakening unexcelled in the cosmos with its devas Maras  Brahmas with its contemplatives  brahmans its royalty  commonfolk
Knowledge  vision arose in me 'Unprovoked is my release
This is the last birth
There is now no further becoming'
The Dhamma the truth taught by the Buddha is uncovered gradually through sustained practice
The Buddha made clear many times that Awakening does not occur like a bolt out of the blue to the untrained and unprepared mind
Rather it culminates a long journey of many stages
Just as the ocean has a gradual shelf a gradual slope a gradual inclination with a sudden dropoff only after a long stretch in the same way this Doctrine and Discipline has a gradual training a gradual performance a gradual progression with a penetration to gnosis only after a long stretch
Monks I do not say that the attainment of gnosis is all at once
Rather the attainment of gnosis is after gradual training gradual action gradual practice
And how is there the attainment of gnosis after gradual training gradual action gradual practice
There is the case where when conviction has arisen one visits
Having visited one grows close
Having grown close one lends ear
Having lent ear one hears the Dhamma
Having heard the Dhamma one remembers it
Remembering one penetrates the meaning of the teachings
Penetrating the meaning one comes to an agreement through pondering the teachings
There being an agreement through pondering the teachings desire arises
When desire has arisen one is willing
When one is willing one contemplates
Having contemplated one makes an exertion
Having made an exertion one realizes with the body the ultimate truth and having penetrated it with discernment sees it
The Buddha's teachings are infused with this notion of gradual development
His method of gradual instruction which appears in various forms in countless suttas always follows the same arc he guides newcomers from first principles through progressively more advanced teachings all the way to the fulfillment of the Four Noble Truths and the full realization of nibbana
Then the Blessed One having encompassed the awareness of the entire assembly with his awareness asked himself Now who here is capable of understanding the Dhamma He saw Suppabuddha the leper sitting in the assembly and on seeing him the thought occurred to him This person here is capable of understanding the Dhamma So aiming at Suppabuddha the leper he gave a stepbystep talk ie a talk on giving a talk on virtue a talk on heaven he declared the drawbacks degradation  corruption of sensual passions and the rewards of renunciation
Then when he saw that Suppabuddha the leper's mind was ready malleable free from hindrances elated  bright he then gave the Dhammatalk peculiar to Awakened Ones ie stress origination cessation  path
And just as a clean cloth free of stains would properly absorb a dye in the same way as Suppabuddha the leper was sitting in that very seat the dustless stainless Dhamma eye arose within him Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation
At each stage of this gradual training the practitioner discovers a new and important dimension of the law of causeandeffect  kamma the cornerstone of Right View
It is thus a very useful organizing framework with which to view the entirety of the Buddha's teachings
The gradual training begins with the practice of generosity which helps begin the long process of weakening the unawakened practitioner's habitual tendencies to cling  to views to sensuality and to unskillful modes of thought and behavior
This is followed by the development of virtue the basic level of senserestraint that helps the practitioner develop a healthy and trustworthy sense of self
The peace of mind born from this level of selfrespect provides the foundation for all further progress along the path
The practitioner now understands that some kinds of happiness are deeper and more dependable than anything that sensegratification can ever provide the happiness born of generosity and virtue can even lead to rebirth in heaven  either literal or metaphorical
But eventually the practitioner begins to recognize the intrinsic drawbacks of even this kind of happiness as good as rebirth in wholesome states may be the happiness it brings is not a true and lasting one for it relies on conditions over which he or she ultimately has no control
This marks a crucial turning point in the training when the practitioner begins to grasp that true happiness will never be found in the realm of the physical and sensual world
The only possible route to an unconditioned happiness lies in renunciation in turning away from the sensual realm by trading the familiar lower forms of happiness for something far more rewarding and noble
Now at last the practitioner is ripe to receive the teachings on the Four Noble Truths which spell out the course of mental training required to realize the highest happiness nibbana
Many Westerners first encounter the Buddha's teachings on meditation retreats which typically begin with instructions in how to develop the skillful qualities of right mindfulness and right concentration
It is worth noting that as important as these qualities are the Buddha placed them towards the very end of his gradual course of training
The meaning is clear to reap the most benefit from meditation practice to bring to full maturity all the qualities needed for Awakening the fundamental groundwork must not be overlooked
There is no shortcutting this process
Here is the Buddha's sixstage gradual training in more detail
In the suttas the word sangha is usually used in one of two ways it refers either to the community of ordained monks and nuns or to the community of noble ones  persons who have attained at least streamentry the first stage of Awakening
The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well who have practiced straightforwardly who have practiced methodically who have practiced masterfully  in other words the four types when taken as pairs the eight when taken as individual types  they are the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect the incomparable field of merit for the world
In this community of monks there are monks who are arahants whose mental effluents are ended who have reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and who are released through right gnosis such are the monks in this community of monks
In this community of monks there are monks who with the total ending of the first set of five fetters are due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that world such are the monks in this community of monks
In this community of monks there are monks who with the total ending of three fetters and with the attenuation of passion aversion  delusion are oncereturners who  on returning only one more time to this world  will make an ending to stress such are the monks in this community of monks
In this community of monks there are monks who with the total ending of three fetters are streamwinners steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for selfawakening such are the monks in this community of monks
Just as the ocean is the abode of such mighty beings as whales whaleeaters and whaleeatereaters asuras nagas and gandhabbas and there are in the ocean beings one hundred leagues long two hundred three hundred four hundred five hundred leagues long in the same way this Doctrine and Discipline is the abode of such mighty beings as streamwinners and those practicing to realize the fruit of streamentry oncereturners and those practicing to realize the fruit of oncereturning nonreturners and those practicing to realize the fruit of nonreturning arahants and those practicing for arahantship This is the eighth amazing and astounding fact about this Doctrine and Discipline
A monk endowed with eight qualities is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect an incomparable field of merit for the world
Which eight
There is the case where a monk is virtuous
He dwells restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha consummate in his behavior  sphere of activity
He trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faults
When given food whether coarse or refined he eats it carefully without complaining
He feels disgust at bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct at the development of evil unskillful qualities
He is composed  easy to live with and doesn't harass the other monks
Whatever tricks or deceits or wiles or subterfuges he has he shows them as they actually are to the Teacher or to his knowledgeable companions in the holy life so that the Teacher or his knowledgeable companions in the holy life can try to straighten them out
When in training he gives rise to the thought 'Whether the other monks want to train or not I'll train here'
When going he goes the straight path here the straight path is this right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
He dwells with his persistence aroused 'Gladly would I let the flesh  blood in my body dry up leaving just the skin tendons  bones but if I have not attained what can be reached through human steadfastness human persistence human striving there will be no relaxing my persistence' Endowed with these eight qualities a monk is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect an incomparable field of merit for the world
Monks this assembly is free from idle chatter devoid of idle chatter and is established on pure heartwood such is this community of monks such is this assembly
The sort of assembly that is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect an incomparable field of merit for the world such is this community of monks such is this assembly
The sort of assembly to which a small gift when given becomes great and a great gift greater such is this community of monks such is this assembly
The sort of assembly that it is rare to see in the world such is this community of monks such is this assembly  the sort of assembly that it would be worth traveling for leagues taking along provisions in order to see
Among whatever communities or groups there may be the Sangha of the Tathagata's disciples is considered supreme  ie the four types when taken as pairs the eight when taken as persons
Those who have confidence in the Sangha have confidence in what is supreme and for those with confidence in the supreme supreme will be the result
At any time when a disciple of the noble ones is recollecting the Sangha his mind is not overcome with passion not overcome with aversion not overcome with delusion
His mind heads straight based on the Sangha
And when the mind is headed straight the disciple of the noble ones gains a sense of the goal gains a sense of the Dhamma gains joy connected with the Dhamma
In one who is joyful rapture arises
In one who is rapturous the body grows calm
One whose body is calmed experiences ease
In one at ease the mind becomes concentrated
When you recollect the Sangha monks any fear terror or horripilation you may have will be abandoned
These training rules are observed by laypeople during periods of intensive meditation practice and during uposatha days
The Eight Precepts are based on the Five Precepts with the third precept extended to prohibit all sexual activity and an additional three precepts that are especially supportive to meditation practice
These training rules are observed by novice monks and nuns

Right Resolve is the second of the eight path factors in the Noble Eightfold Path and belongs to the wisdom division of the path
And what is right resolve
Being resolved on renunciation on freedom from illwill on harmlessness This is called right resolve
And how is one made pure in three ways by mental action
There is the case where a certain person is not covetous
He does not covet the belongings of others thinking 'O that what belongs to others would be mine' He bears no ill will and is not corrupt in the resolves of his heart
'May these beings be free from animosity free from oppression free from trouble and may they look after themselves with ease' He has right view and is not warped in the way he sees things 'There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificed
There are fruits  results of good  bad actions
There is this world  the next world
There is mother  father
There are spontaneously reborn beings there are brahmans  contemplatives who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves' This is how one is made pure in three ways by mental action
And how is right view the forerunner
One discerns wrong resolve as wrong resolve and right resolve as right resolve
And what is wrong resolve
Being resolved on sensuality on ill will on harmfulness
This is wrong resolve
One tries to abandon wrong resolve  to enter into right resolve This is one's right effort
One is mindful to abandon wrong resolve  to enter  remain in right resolve This is one's right mindfulness
Thus these three qualities  right view right effort  right mindfulness  run  circle around right resolve
The Blessed One said Monks before my selfawakening when I was still just an unawakened Bodhisatta the thought occurred to me 'Why don't I keep dividing my thinking into two sorts' So I made thinking imbued with sensuality thinking imbued with ill will  thinking imbued with harmfulness one sort and thinking imbued with renunciation thinking imbued with nonill will  thinking imbued with harmlessness another sort
And as I remained thus heedful ardent  resolute thinking imbued with sensuality arose in me
I discerned that 'Thinking imbued with sensuality has arisen in me and that leads to my own affliction or to the affliction of others or to the affliction of both
It obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to Unbinding'
As I noticed that it leads to my own affliction it subsided
As I noticed that it leads to the affliction of others to the affliction of both it obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to Unbinding it subsided
Whenever thinking imbued with sensuality had arisen I simply abandoned it destroyed it dispelled it wiped it out of existence
And as I remained thus heedful ardent  resolute thinking imbued with ill will arose in me
I discerned that 'Thinking imbued with ill will has arisen in me and that leads to my own affliction or to the affliction of others or to the affliction of both
It obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to Unbinding'
As I noticed that it leads to my own affliction it subsided
As I noticed that it leads to the affliction of others to the affliction of both it obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to Unbinding it subsided
Whenever thinking imbued with ill will had arisen I simply abandoned it destroyed it dispelled it wiped it out of existence
Whenever you want to perform a bodily act you should reflect on it 'This bodily act I want to perform  would it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it would lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it would be an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then any bodily act of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do
But if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction it would be a skillful bodily action with happy consequences happy results then any bodily act of that sort is fit for you to do
While you are performing a bodily act you should reflect on it 'This bodily act I am doing  is it leading to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it is leading to selfaffliction to affliction of others or both you should give it up
But if on reflection you know that it is not you may continue with it
Having performed a bodily act you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then you should confess it reveal it lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy life
Having confessed it you should exercise restraint in the future
But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful bodily action with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed and joyful training day and night in skillful mental qualities
Therefore Rahula you should train yourself 'I will purify my bodily acts through repeated reflection
I will purify my verbal acts through repeated reflection
I will purify my mental acts through repeated reflection' That is how you should train yourself

A facetoface verdict should be given
This means that the formal act settling the issue must be carried out in the presence of the Community in the presence of the individuals and in the presence of the Dhamma and Vinaya
A verdict of mindfulness may be given
This is the verdict of innocence given in an accusation based on the fact that the accused remembers fully that he did not commit the offense in question
A verdict of past insanity may be given
This is another verdict of innocence given in an accusation based on the fact that the accused was out of his mind when he committed the offense in question and so is absolved of any responsibility for it
Acting in accordance with what is admitted
This refers to the ordinary confession of offenses where no formal interrogation is involved
The confession is valid only if in accord with the facts eg a bhikkhu actually commits a pācittiya offense and then confesses it as such and not as a stronger or lesser offense
If he were to confess it as a dukkata or a saṅghādisesa that would be invalid
Acting in accordance with the majority
This refers to cases in which bhikkhus are unable to settle a dispute unanimously even after all the proper procedures are followed and  in the words of the Canon  are wounding one another with weapons of the tongue In cases such as these decisions can be made by majority vote
Acting for his further punishment
This refers to cases where a bhikkhu admits to having committed the offense in question only after being formally interrogated about it
He is then to be reproved for his actions made to remember the offense and to confess it
After that the Community imposes the further punishment of a Community transaction that requires him to forfeit a long list of his normal rights as a bhikkhu for a period of time until they are satisfied that he has taken the lesson to heart
Covering over as with grass
This refers to situations in which both sides of a dispute realize that in the course of their dispute they have done much that is unworthy of a contemplative
If they were to deal with one another for their offenses the only result would be greater divisiveness
Thus if both sides agree all the bhikkhus gather in one place
A motion is made to the entire group that this procedure will be followed
One member of each side then makes a formal motion to the members of his faction that he will make a confession for them
When both sides are ready the representative of each side addresses the entire group and makes the blanket confession using the form of a motion and one announcement
Right View is the first of the eight path factors in the Noble Eightfold Path and belongs to the wisdom division of the path
And what is right view
Knowledge with regard to stress knowledge with regard to the origination of stress knowledge with regard to the cessation of stress knowledge with regard to the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is called right view
And how is right view the forerunner
One discerns wrong view as wrong view and right view as right view
This is one's right view
And what is wrong view
'There is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed
There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions
There is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no brahmans or contemplatives who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves' This is wrong view
One tries to abandon wrong view  to enter into right view This is one's right effort
One is mindful to abandon wrong view  to enter  remain in right view This is one's right mindfulness
Thus these three qualities  right view right effort  right mindfulness  run  circle around right view
In a person of wrong view wrong resolve comes into being
In a person of wrong resolve wrong speech
In a person of wrong speech wrong action
In a person of wrong action wrong livelihood
In a person of wrong livelihood wrong effort
In a person of wrong effort wrong mindfulness
In a person of wrong mindfulness wrong concentration
In a person of wrong concentration wrong knowledge
In a person of wrong knowledge wrong release
This is how from wrongness comes failure not success
When a person has right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration right knowledge  right release whatever bodily deeds he undertakes in line with that view whatever verbal deeds whatever mental deeds he undertakes in line with that view whatever intentions whatever vows whatever determinations whatever fabrications all lead to what is agreeable pleasing charming profitable  easeful
Why is that
Because the view is auspicious
Just as when a sugar cane seed a rice grain or a grape seed is placed in moist soil whatever nutriment it takes from the soil  the water all conduces to its sweetness tastiness  unalloyed delectability
Why is that
Because the seed is auspicious
In the same way when a person has right view right release whatever bodily deeds he undertakes in line with that view whatever verbal deeds whatever mental deeds he undertakes in line with that view whatever intentions whatever vows whatever determinations whatever fabrications all lead to what is agreeable pleasing charming profitable  easeful
Why is that
Because the view is auspicious
There is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person does not discern what ideas are fit for attention or what ideas are unfit for attention
This being so he does not attend to ideas fit for attention and attends instead to ideas unfit for attention This is how he attends inappropriately 'Was I in the past
Was I not in the past
What was I in the past
How was I in the past
Having been what what was I in the past
Shall I be in the future
Shall I not be in the future
What shall I be in the future
How shall I be in the future
Having been what what shall I be in the future' Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present 'Am I
Am I not
What am I
How am I
Where has this being come from
Where is it bound'
As he attends inappropriately in this way one of six kinds of view arises in him The view I have a self arises in him as true  established or the view I have no self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive notself or the view It is precisely by means of notself that I perceive self arises in him as true  established or else he has a view like this This very self of mine  the knower that is sensitive here  there to the ripening of good  bad actions  is the self of mine that is constant everlasting eternal not subject to change and will endure as long as eternity
This is called a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of views
Bound by a fetter of views the uninstructed runofthemill person is not freed from birth aging  death from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair
He is not freed I tell you from suffering  stress
The wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attention
This being so he does not attend to ideas unfit for attention and attends to ideas fit for attention He attends appropriately This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress
As he attends appropriately in this way three fetters are abandoned in him identityview doubt and grasping at precepts  practices
Lord 'Right view right view' it is said
To what extent is there right view
By  large Kaccayana this world is supported by a polarity that of existence  nonexistence
But when one sees the origination of the world as it actually is with right discernment 'nonexistence' with reference to the world does not occur to one
When one sees the cessation of the world as it actually is with right discernment 'existence' with reference to the world does not occur to one
By  large Kaccayana this world is in bondage to attachments clingings  biases
But one such as this does not get involved with or cling to these attachments clingings fixations of awareness biases or obsessions nor is he resolved on 'my self' He has no uncertainty or doubt that when there is arising only stress is arising and that when there is passing away only stress is passing away
In this one's knowledge is independent of others
It is to this extent Kaccayana that there is right view
Don't go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by logical conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought 'This contemplative is our teacher' When you know for yourselves that 'These qualities are unskillful these qualities are blameworthy these qualities are criticized by the wise these qualities when adopted  carried out lead to harm  to suffering'  then you should abandon them
When you know for yourselves that 'These qualities are skillful these qualities are blameless these qualities are praised by the wise these qualities when adopted  carried out lead to welfare  to happiness'  then you should enter  remain in them
And this monks is the noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of dukkha precisely this Noble Eightfold Path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
And are the three aggregates included under the noble eightfold path lady or is the noble eightfold path included under the three aggregates
The three aggregates are not included under the noble eightfold path friend Visakha but the noble eightfold path is included under the three aggregates
Right speech right action  right livelihood come under the aggregate of virtue
Right effort right mindfulness  right concentration come under the aggregate of concentration
Right view  right resolve come under the aggregate of discernment
It is just as if a man traveling along a wilderness track were to see an ancient path an ancient road traveled by people of former times
He would follow it
Following it he would see an ancient city an ancient capital inhabited by people of former times complete with parks groves  ponds walled delightful
He would go to address the king or the king's minister saying 'Sire you should know that while traveling along a wilderness track I saw an ancient path I followed it I saw an ancient city an ancient capital complete with parks groves  ponds walled delightful
Sire rebuild that city' The king or king's minister would rebuild the city so that at a later date the city would become powerful rich  wellpopulated fully grown  prosperous
In the same way I saw an ancient path an ancient road traveled by the Rightly Selfawakened Ones of former times
And what is that ancient path that ancient road traveled by the Rightly Selfawakened Ones of former times
Just this noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration I followed that path
Following it I came to direct knowledge of birth becoming clinging craving feeling contact the six sense media nameform consciousness direct knowledge of the origination of consciousness direct knowledge of the cessation of consciousness direct knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of consciousness
I followed that path
Following it I came to direct knowledge of fabrications direct knowledge of the origination of fabrications direct knowledge of the cessation of fabrications direct knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of fabrications
Knowing that directly I have revealed it to monks nuns male lay followers  female lay followers so that this holy life has become powerful rich detailed wellpopulated widespread proclaimed among celestial  human beings
There are these three things that are motherchildseparating dangers
Which three
The danger of aging the danger of illness the danger of death
A mother can't get with regard to her child who is aging 'I am aging but may my child not age' A child can't get with regard to its mother who is aging 'I am aging but may my mother not age'
A mother can't get with regard to her child who is growing ill 'I am growing ill but may my child not grow ill' A child can't get with regard to its mother who is growing ill 'I am growing ill but may my mother not grow ill'
A mother can't get with regard to her child who is dying 'I am dying but may my child not die' A child can't get with regard to its mother who is dying 'I am dying but may my mother not die'
These are the three things that are motherchildseparating dangers
There is a path there is a practice that leads to the abandoning and overcoming of these three motherchilduniting dangers and these three motherchildseparating dangers
And which is that path which is that practice
Just this very noble eightfold path ie right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
This is the path this the practice that leads to the abandoning and overcoming of these three motherchilduniting dangers and these three motherchildseparating dangers
In any doctrine  discipline where the noble eightfold path is not found no contemplative of the first second third fourth order is found
But in any doctrine  discipline where the noble eightfold path is found contemplatives of the first second third fourth order are found
The noble eightfold path is found in this doctrine  discipline and right here there are contemplatives of the first second third fourth order
Other teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplatives
And if the monks dwell rightly this world will not be empty of arahants
Nibbana names the transcendent and singularly ineffable freedom that stands as the final goal of all the Buddha's teachings
This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Nibbana
There is that dimension where there is neither earth nor water nor fire nor wind neither dimension of the infinitude of space nor dimension of the infinitude of consciousness nor dimension of nothingness nor dimension of neither perception nor nonperception neither this world nor the next world nor sun nor moon
And there I say there is neither coming nor going nor stasis neither passing away nor arising without stance without foundation without support
This just this is the end of stress
There is monks an unborn  unbecome  unmade  unfabricated
If there were not that unborn  unbecome  unmade  unfabricated there would not be the case that emancipation from the born  become  made  fabricated would be discerned
But precisely because there is an unborn  unbecome  unmade  unfabricated emancipation from the born  become  made  fabricated is discerned
Then the Blessed One picking up a little bit of dust with the tip of his fingernail said to the monks What do you think monks
Which is greater the little bit of dust I have picked up with the tip of my fingernail or the great earth
The great earth is far greater lord
The little bit of dust the Blessed One has picked up with the tip of his fingernail is next to nothing
It's not a hundredth a thousandth a one hundredthousandth  this little bit of dust the Blessed One has picked up with the tip of his fingernail  when compared with the great earth
In the same way monks for a disciple of the noble ones who is consummate in view an individual who has broken through the suffering  stress that is totally ended  extinguished is far greater
That which remains in the state of having at most seven remaining lifetimes is next to nothing it's not a hundredth a thousandth a one hundredthousandth when compared with the previous mass of suffering
That's how great the benefit is of breaking through to the Dhamma monks
That's how great the benefit is of obtaining the Dhamma eye
But Master Gotama the monk whose mind is thus released Where does he reappear
'Reappear' Vaccha doesn't apply
In that case Master Gotama he does not reappear
'Does not reappear' Vaccha doesn't apply
both does  does not reappear
doesn't apply
neither does nor does not reappear
doesn't apply
How is it Master Gotama when Master Gotama is asked if the monk reappears does not reappear both does  does not reappear neither does nor does not reappear he says 'doesn't apply' in each case
At this point Master Gotama I am befuddled at this point confused
The modicum of clarity coming to me from your earlier conversation is now obscured
Of course you're befuddled Vaccha
Of course you're confused
Deep Vaccha is this phenomenon hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wise
For those with other views other practices other satisfactions other aims other teachers it is difficult to know
That being the case I will now put some questions to you
Answer as you see fit
What do you think Vaccha If a fire were burning in front of you would you know that 'This fire is burning in front of me'
yes And suppose someone were to ask you Vaccha 'This fire burning in front of you dependent on what is it burning' Thus asked how would you reply
I would reply 'This fire burning in front of me is burning dependent on grass  timber as its sustenance' If the fire burning in front of you were to go out would you know that 'This fire burning in front of me has gone out'
yes And suppose someone were to ask you 'This fire that has gone out in front of you in which direction from here has it gone
East
West
North
Or south' Thus asked how would you reply
That doesn't apply Master Gotama
Any fire burning dependent on a sustenance of grass and timber being unnourished  from having consumed that sustenance and not being offered any other  is classified simply as 'out'
Even so Vaccha any physical form by which one describing the Tathagata would describe him That the Tathagata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Freed from the classification of form Vaccha the Tathagata is deep boundless hard to fathom like the sea
'Reappears' doesn't apply
'Does not reappear' doesn't apply
'Both does  does not reappear' doesn't apply
'Neither reappears nor does not reappear' doesn't apply
Any feeling Any perception Any mental fabrication
Any consciousness by which one describing the Tathagata would describe him That the Tathagata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Freed from the classification of consciousness Vaccha the Tathagata is deep boundless hard to fathom like the sea
Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery
And on that occasion Ven
Bhaddiya the Dwarf following behind a large number of monks was going to the Blessed One
From afar the Blessed One saw Ven
Bhaddiya the Dwarf coming following behind a large number of monks ugly unsightly stunted treated with condescension by most of the monks
On seeing him the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks do you see that monk coming from afar following behind a large number of monks ugly unsightly stunted treated with condescension by most of the monks
Yes lord
That monks is a monk of great power great might
The attainment already attained by that monk is not of a sort easily attained
And by means of it he has reached  remains in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself right in the herenow
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
In SN Citta the householder explains this verse as follows
Faultless stands for virtues
Canopied in white stands for release
Singlespoked stands for mindfulness
Rolls along stands for coming and going
Chariot stands for this body composed of the four elements
Passion is a trouble aversion is a trouble delusion is a trouble
These have been abandoned by a monk whose effluents have ended  their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
That's why the monk whose effluents have ended is said to be untroubled
Him coming stands for the arahant
Stream stands for craving
That has been abandoned by a monk whose effluents have ended  its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
That's why the monk whose effluents have ended is said to be one whose stream is cut
Passion is a bond aversion is a bond delusion is a bond
These have been abandoned by a monk whose effluents have ended  their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
That's why the monk whose effluents have ended is said to be free from bonds
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery
Then Ven
nanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord as long as Tathāgatas  worthy  rightly selfawakened  do not appear in the world that's when the wanderers of other sects are worshipped revered honored venerated and given homage  recipients of robes alms food lodgings  medicinal requisites for the sick
But when Tathāgatas  worthy  rightly selfawakened  appear in the world that's when the wanderers of other sects are not worshipped revered honored venerated or given homage nor are they recipients of robes alms food lodgings  medicinal requisites for the sick
Now only the Blessed One is worshipped revered honored venerated and given homage  a recipient of robes alms food lodgings  medicinal requisites for the sick  along with the community of monks
That's how it is nanda
That's how it is
As long as Tathāgatas  worthy  rightly selfawakened  do not appear in the world that's when the wanderers of other sects are worshipped revered honored venerated and given homage  recipients of robes alms food lodgings  medicinal requisites for the sick
But when Tathāgatas  worthy  rightly selfawakened  appear in the world that's when the wanderers of other sects are not worshipped revered honored venerated or given homage nor are they recipients of robes alms food lodgings  medicinal requisites for the sick
Now only the Tathāgata is worshipped revered honored venerated and given homage  a recipient of robes alms food lodgings  medicinal requisites for the sick  along with the community of monks
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels' refuge
And on that occasion early in the morning of the uposatha Ven
nanda adjusted his under robe and  carrying his bowl  robes  went into Rājagaha for alms
Devadatta saw Ven
nanda going for alms in Rājagaha and on seeing him went to him
On arrival he said to him From this day forward friend nanda I will conduct the uposatha  community transactions apart from the Blessed One apart from the community of monks
Then Ven
nanda  having gone for alms in Rājagaha after the meal returning from his alms round  went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now lord after adjusting my under robe early in the morning and carrying my bowl  robes I went into Rājagaha for alms
Devadatta saw me going for alms in Rājagaha and on seeing me went up to me
On arrival he said to me 'From this day forward friend nanda I will conduct the uposatha  community transactions apart from the Blessed One apart from the community of monks' Lord today Devadatta will split the community
He will conduct the uposatha  community transactions
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery
Now at that time the Blessed One was worshipped revered honored venerated and given homage  a recipient of robes alms food lodgings  medicinal requisites for the sick
The community of monks was also worshipped revered honored venerated and given homage  a recipient of robes alms food lodgings  medicinal requisites for the sick
But the wanderers of other sects were not worshipped revered honored venerated or given homage nor were they recipients of robes alms food lodgings or medicinal requisites for the sick
So the wanderers of other sects  unable to stand the veneration given to the Blessed One and the community of monks  went to Sundarī the female wanderer and on arrival said to her Sundarī would you dare to do something for the benefit of your kinsmen
What shall I do masters
What can I not do
I have given up even my life for the benefit of my kinsmen
In that case sister go often to Jeta's Grove
Responding As you say masters to those wanderers of other sects Sundarī the female wanderer went often to Jeta's Grove
When the wanderers of other sects knew that many people had seen Sundarī the female wanderer going often to Jeta's Grove then  having murdered her and buried her right there in the moatditch surrounding Jeta's Grove  they went to King Pasenadi Kosala and on arrival said to him Great king we can't find Sundarī the female wanderer
But where do you suspect she is
At Jeta's Grove great king
Then in that case search Jeta's Grove
Then those wanderers of other sects having searched Jeta's Grove having dug up what they had buried in the surrounding moatditch having mounted it on a litter took it into Sāvatthī and went from street to street crossroad to crossroad stirring up people's indignation See masters the handiwork of the Sakyanson contemplatives
They're shameless these Sakyanson contemplatives unvirtuous evilnatured liars unholy though they claim to be practicing the Dhamma practicing what is harmonious practicing the holy life speakers of the truth virtuous finenatured
They have no quality of a contemplative no holy quality
Destroyed is their quality of a contemplative
Destroyed is their holy quality
From where is their quality of a contemplative
From where their holy quality
Gone are they from any quality of a contemplative
Gone from any holy quality
How can a man having done a man's business with a woman take her life
So on that occasion people seeing monks in Sāvatthī would insult revile irritate  harass them with discourteous abusive language They're shameless these Sakyanson contemplatives unvirtuous evilnatured liars unholy though they claim to be practicing the Dhamma practicing what is harmonious practicing the holy life speakers of the truth virtuous finenatured
They have no quality of a contemplative no holy quality
Destroyed is their quality of a contemplative
Destroyed is their holy quality
From where is their quality of a contemplative
From where their holy quality
Gone are they from any quality of a contemplative
Gone from any holy quality
How can a man having done a man's business with a woman take her life
Then early in the morning a large number of monks adjusted their under robes and  carrying their bowls  robes  went into Sāvatthī for alms
Then having gone for alms in Sāvatthī after the meal returning from their alms round they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to the Blessed One At present lord people seeing monks in Sāvatthī insult revile irritate  harass them with discourteous abusive language 'They're shameless these Sakyanson contemplatives unvirtuous evilnatured liars unholy
How can a man having done a man's business with a woman take her life' Monks this noise will not last long
It will last only seven days
With the passing of seven days it will disappear
So in that case when those people on seeing monks insult revile irritate  harass them with discourteous abusive language counter their accusation with this verse
So having learned this verse in the Blessed One's presence the monks  whenever people on seeing monks in Sāvatthī insulted reviled irritated  harassed them with discourteous abusive language  countered the accusation with this verse
The thought occurred to those people They're innocent these Sakyanson contemplatives
It wasn't done by them
They're taking an oath these Sakyanson contemplatives And so that noise didn't last long
It lasted only seven days
With the passing of seven days it disappeared
Then a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to him It's amazing lord
It's astounding  how wellsaid that was by the Blessed One 'Monks this noise will not last long
It will last only seven days
With the passing of seven days it will disappear' Lord that noise has disappeared
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Because sarehi can mean either with arrows or with voices this verse can also be translated
The verse thus yields two equally valid interpretations
a The people stabbing the elephant with arrows are enemy soldiers trying to bring it down
b The people goading the elephant with their shouts and voices are soldiers fighting on the same side as the elephant urging it to charge into danger
The Commentary gives only the first interpretation
But if we accept both interpretations the verse contains a more useful double warning When there's a controversy beware of the unrestrained people on both sides
Learn to endure the hurtful words of those on the other side who want to bring you down and the hurtful words of those on your side who try to rouse your anger so that you will say something rash
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Kosambī at Kosita's monastery
And on that occasion the Blessed One lived hemmed in with monks nuns male  female lay followers kings royal ministers sectarians  their disciples
Hemmed in he lived unpleasantly and not in ease
The thought occurred to him I now live hemmed in by monks nuns male  female lay followers kings royal ministers sectarians  their disciples
Hemmed in I live unpleasantly and not in ease
What if I were to live alone apart from the crowd
So early in the morning the Blessed One adjusted his under robe and  carrying his bowl  robes  went into Kosambī for alms
Then having gone for alms in Kosambī after the meal returning from his alms round he set his own lodgings in order and carrying his bowl  robes without telling his attendant without informing the community of monks  alone  without a companion  left on a wandering tour toward Palileyyaka
After wandering by stages he reached Palileyyaka
There he stayed in Palileyyaka in the protected forest grove at the root of the auspicious sal tree
It so happened that a certain bull elephant was living hemmed in by elephants cowelephants calfelephants  baby elephants
He fed off grass with cutoff tips
They chewed up his stash of brokenoff branches
He drank disturbed water
And when he came up from his bathingplace cowelephants went along banging up against his body
Hemmed in he lived unpleasantly and not in ease
The thought occurred to him I now live hemmed in by elephants cowelephants calfelephants  baby elephants
I feed off grass with cutoff tips
They chew up my stash of brokenoff branches
I drink disturbed water
And when I come up from my bathing place cowelephants go along banging up against my body
Hemmed in I live unpleasantly and not in ease
What if I were to live alone apart from the crowd
So the bull elephant leaving the herd went to Palileyyaka to the protected forest grove and the root of the auspicious sal tree  to where the Blessed One was staying
There he kept the grass down in the area where the Blessed One was staying and brought drinking water and washing water for the Blessed One with his trunk
Then when the Blessed One was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to his awareness Before I lived hemmed in by monks nuns male  female lay followers kings royal ministers sectarians  their disciples
Hemmed in I lived unpleasantly and not in ease
But now I live not hemmed in by monks nuns male  female lay followers kings royal ministers sectarians  their disciples
Not hemmed in I live pleasantly and in ease
And this train of thought appeared to the awareness of the bull elephant Before I lived hemmed in by elephants cowelephants calfelephants  baby elephants
I fed off grass with cutoff tips
They chewed up my stash of brokenoff branches
I drank disturbed water
And when I came up from my bathing place cowelephants went along banging up against my body
Hemmed in I lived unpleasantly and not in ease
But now I live not hemmed in by elephants cowelephants calfelephants  baby elephants
I feed off grass with uncut tips
They don't chew up my stash of brokenoff branches
I drink undisturbed water
When I come up from my bathing place cowelephants don't go along banging up against my body
Not hemmed in I live pleasantly and in ease
Then the Blessed One realizing his own seclusion and knowing the train of thought in the bull elephant's awareness on that occasion exclaimed
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was wandering among the Kosalans with a large community of monks
Then coming down from the road he went to a certain tree and on arrival sat down on a seat laid out
A certain cowherd then went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged him with Dhammatalk
The cowherd  instructed urged roused  encouraged by the Blessed One's talk on Dhamma  said to him Lord may the Blessed One together with the community of monks acquiesce to my offer of tomorrow's meal
The Blessed One acquiesced with silence
Then the cowherd understanding the Blessed One's acquiescence got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One and left circling him to the right
Then after the night had passed the cowherd  having prepared in his own home a great deal of thick milkrice porridge  fresh ghee  announced the time of the meal to the Blessed One It's time lord
The meal is ready
So the Blessed One early in the morning adjusted his under robe and  carrying his bowl  robes  went together with the community of monks to the cowherd's home
On arrival he sat down on a seat laid out
The cowherd with his own hand served  satisfied the community of monks headed by the Blessed One with thick milkrice porridge  fresh ghee
Then when the Blessed One had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl the cowherd taking a lower seat sat down to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged him with Dhammatalk then got up from his seat  left
Now not long after the Blessed One's departure the cowherd was killed by a certain man between the boundaries of two villages
A large number of monks then went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they told him The cowherd who today served  satisfied the community of monks headed by the Blessed One with thick milkrice porridge  fresh ghee has been killed it is said by a certain man between the boundaries of two villages
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
This verse also occurs at Dhp where it is paired with Dhp
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Upavattana the Mallan sal grove near Kusinarā
And on that occasion not far from the Blessed One many monks were staying in wilderness huts highstrung rowdy flighty talkative of loose words  muddled mindfulness unalert unconcentrated their minds scattered their faculties left wide open
The Blessed One saw those many monks staying in wilderness huts highstrung rowdy flighty talkative of loose words  muddled mindfulness unalert unconcentrated their minds scattered their faculties left wide open
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
The Bhikkhunī Pāṭimokkha contains rules
Of these are shared with the Bhikkhu Pāṭimokkha four Pārājikas seven Saṅghādisesas Nissaggiya Pācittiyas Pācittiyas all Sekhiyas and all seven Adhikaraṇasamatha rules
In addition the Bhikkhunī Pāṭimokkha contains Pācittiya rules that are identical to rules for bhikkhus that are contained in the Khandhakas one Pārājika rule similar to a Bhikkhus' Saṅghādisesa rule one Pārājika rule similar to a Bhikkhus' Pācittiya rule two Saṅghādisesa rules similar to Bhikkhus' Khandhaka rules two NP rules similar to Bhikkhus' NP rules three Pācittiyas similar to a Bhikkhus' Saṅghādisesa seven Pācittiyas similar to Bhikkhus' Pācittiyas and eight Pācittiyas similar to rules for bhikkhus that are contained in the Khandhakas
Also the eight Pāṭidesanīya rules for the bhikkhunīs are elaborations of a single Bhikkhus' Pācittiya rule
Thus the Bhikkhunī Pāṭimokkha contains rules for which there are no direct correspondences in the rules for the bhikkhus
Some writers have interpreted these added rules as sign of an attempt to oppress the bhikkhunīs unfairly but it should be noted that 
Tellingly these last three exceptions were formulated after complaints initiated by the bhikkhus and they touch directly on the formal subordination of the Bhikkhunī Community to the Bhikkhu Community
However they are counterbalanced by two rules exclusive to the Bhikkhu Pāṭimokkha  NP   that were formulated at the request of bhikkhunīs to prevent bhikkhus from abusing their position in the hierarchy in a way that would interfere with the bhikkhunīs' practice of the Dhamma
For a more detailed discussion of the checks and balances in the relationships between the two Communities see The Buddhist Monastic Code volume II chapter
In the following translation I have marked the correspondences between the bhikkhus' and bhikkhunīs' rules in brackets
Where the brackets follow the number of the bhikkhunī rule and simply contain a number the corresponding bhikkhus' rule is in the same section in the Bhikkhu Pāṭimokkha as in the Bhikkhunī Pāṭimokkha
Thus under the Saṅghādisesa rules means that the Bhikkhunīs' Saṅghādisesa is identical with the Bhikkhus' Saṅghādisesa
If the brackets follow the rule and simply contain a reference to a rule in the Mahavagga or Cullavagga the corresponding bhikkhus' rule is contained in the Khandhakas
If the brackets follow the rule and include the word see followed by a number the corresponding bhikkhus' rule is similar rather than identical
Correspondences in the Sekhiya and Adhikaraṇasamatha sections are not marked as these two sections are completely identical in the two Pāṭimokkhas
Rules marked with an asterisk are identical with  or directly related to  vows included in the Eight Garudhammas or Rules of Respect
On this topic see The Buddhist Monastic Code volume II chapter
Some writers have argued that because the rules in question are all pācittiya rules and because the Rules of Respect impose a more stringent penalty than a simple confession for overstepping the vows we must assume that the vows and their more stringent punishment were added later to the canon in an attempt to oppress the bhikkhunīs
However a standard principle throughout the Vinaya  formulated in Adhikaraṇasamatha in both Pāṭimokkhas  is that an offender cannot be penalized until heshe has confessed to an offense
In light of this principle the confession required by the pācittiya rules would be a first necessary step before imposing the halfmonth penance stipulated in the fifth vow
The translation here is based on the complete Pali Bhikkhunī Pāṭimokkha in Mohan Wijayaratna Buddhist Nuns The Birth and Development of a Women's Monastic Order although there were many spots where I had to rely on the Thai edition of the Pali Canon to correct mistakes in BN
I have also consulted IB
Horner's partial English translation of the Bhikkhunī Pāṭimokkha rules in The Book of Discipline volume three the partial Thai translation included in Mahamakut's complete translation of the Pali Canon the complete English translation in BN and the complete translation in The Pāṭimokkha edited by William Pruitt and translated by K

Where my translation differs from BD I have marked it with a where it differs from BN a where it differs from N a
