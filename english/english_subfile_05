I have said that sensual pleasures are of little satisfaction much stress much despair  greater drawbacksI have compared sensual pleasures to a chain of bones of much stress much despair  greater drawbacksI have compared sensual pleasures to a lump of flesh a grass torch a pit of glowing embers a dream borrowed goods the fruits of a tree a butchers ax and chopping block swords and spears a snakes head of much stress much despair  greater drawbacksBut you worthless man through your own wrong grasp have both misrepresented us as well as injuring yourself and accumulating much demerit for yourself for that will lead to your longterm harm  sufferingThen the Blessed One said to the monks What do you think monksIs this monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers even warm in this Doctrine  DisciplineHow could he be lordNo lordWhen this was said the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers sat silent abashed his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for wordsThen the Blessed One seeing that the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers was sitting silent abashed his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for words said to him Worthless man you will be recognized for your own pernicious viewpointI will crossexamine the monks on this matterThen the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks do you too understand the Dhamma as taught by me in the same way that the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers does when through his own wrong grasp both misrepresents us as well as injuring himself and accumulating much demerit for himselfNo lord for in many ways the Blessed One has described obstructive acts to us and when indulged in they are genuine obstructionsThe Blessed One has said that sensual pleasures are of little satisfaction much stress much despair  greater drawbacksThe Blessed One has compared sensual pleasures to a chain of bones of much stress much despair  greater drawbacksThe Blessed One has compared sensual pleasures to a lump of flesh a grass torch a pit of glowing embers a dream borrowed goods the fruits of a tree a butchers ax and chopping block swords and spears a snakes head of much stress much despair  greater drawbacksIts good monks that you understand the Dhamma taught by me in this way for in many ways I have described obstructive acts to you and when indulged in they are genuine obstructionsI have said that sensual pleasures are of little satisfaction much stress much despair  greater drawbacksI have compared sensual pleasures to a chain of bones of much stress much despair  greater drawbacksI have compared sensual pleasures to a lump of flesh a grass torch a pit of glowing embers a dream borrowed goods the fruits of a tree a butchers ax and chopping block swords and spears a snakes head of much stress much despair  greater drawbacksBut this monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers through his own wrong grasp has both misrepresented us as well as injuring himself and accumulating much demerit for himself and that will lead to this worthless mans longterm harm  sufferingFor a person to indulge in sensual pleasures without sensual passion without sensual perception without sensual thinking That isnt possibleMonks there is the case where some worthless men study the Dhamma dialogues narratives of mixed prose and verse explanations verses spontaneous exclamations quotations birth stories

discernment they dont come to an agreement through ponderingThey study the Dhamma both for attacking others and for defending themselves in debateThey dont reach the goal for which study the DhammaTheir wrong grasp of those Dhammas will lead to their longterm harm  sufferingWhy is thatBecause of the wronggraspedness of the DhammasSuppose there were a man needing a watersnake seeking a watersnake wandering in search of a watersnakeHe would see a large watersnake and grasp it by the coils or by the tailThe watersnake turning around would bite him on the hand on the arm or on one of his limbs and from that cause he would suffer death or deathlike sufferingWhy is thatBecause of the wronggraspedness of the watersnakeIn the same way there is the case where some worthless men study

how you should remember itBut when you dont understand the meaning of any statement of mine then right there you should crossquestion me or the experienced monksMonks I will teach you the Dhamma compared to a raft for the purpose of crossing over not for the purpose of holding ontoListen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord the monks responded to the Blessed OneThe Blessed One said Suppose a man were traveling along a pathHe would see a great expanse of water with the near shore dubious  risky the further shore secure  free from risk but with neither a ferryboat nor a bridge going from this shore to the otherThe thought would occur to him Here is this great expanse of water with the near shore dubious  risky the further shore secure  free from risk but with neither a ferryboat nor a bridge going from this shore to the otherWhat if I were to gather grass twigs branches  leaves and having bound them together to make a raft were to cross over to safety on the other shore in dependence on the raft making an effort with my hands  feet Then the man having gathered grass twigs branches  leaves having bound them together to make a raft would cross over to safety on the other shore in dependence on the raft making an effort with his hands  feetHaving crossed over to the further shore he might think How useful this raft has been to meFor it was in dependence on this raft that making an effort with my hands  feet I have crossed over to safety on the further shoreWhy dont I having hoisted it on my head or carrying it on my back go wherever I like What do you think monks Would the man in doing that be doing what should be done with the raftNo lordAnd what should the man do in order to be doing what should be done with the raftThere is the case where the man having crossed over would think How useful this raft has been to meFor it was in dependence on this raft that making an effort with my hands  feet I have crossed over to safety on the further shoreWhy dont I having dragged it on dry land or sinking it in the water go wherever I like In doing this he would be doing what should be done with the raftIn the same way monks I have taught the Dhamma compared to a raft for the purpose of crossing over not for the purpose of holding ontoUnderstanding the Dhamma as taught compared to a raft you should let go even of Dhammas to say nothing of nonDhammasMonks there are these six viewpositionsWhich sixThere is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes about form This is me this is my self this is what I amHe assumes about feeling This is me this is my

constant permanent eternal not subject to changeI will stay just like that for an eternity This is me this is my self this is what I amThen there is the case where a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma assumes about form This is not me this is not my self this is not what I amHe assumes about feeling This is not me this is not my self this is not what I amHe assumes about perception This is not me this is not my self this is not

might there be agitation over what is externally not presentThere might monk the Blessed One saidThere is the case where someone thinks O it was mineO what was mine is notO may it be mineO I dont obtain it He grieves  is tormented weeps beats his breast  grows deliriousIts thus that there is agitation over what is externally not presentBut lord might there be nonagitation over what is

that for an eternity He hears a Tathagata or a Tathagatas disciple teaching the Dhamma for the elimination of all viewpositions determinations biases inclinations  obsessions for the stilling of all

subject to change that would stay just like that for an eternityBut do you see that possession the possession of which would be constant permanent eternal not subject to change that would stay just like that for an eternityNo lordVery good monksI too do not envision a possession the possession of which would be constant permanent eternal not subject to change that would stay just like that for an eternityMonks you would do well to cling to that clinging to a doctrine of self clinging to which there would not arise sorrow lamentation pain grief  despairBut do you see a clinging to a doctrine

sorrow lamentation pain grief  despairMonks where there is a self would there be belonging to my selfYes lordOr monks where there is what belongs to self would there be my selfYes lordMonks where a self or what belongs to self are not pinned down as a truth or reality then the viewposition  This cosmos is the selfAfter death this I will be constant permanent eternal not subject to changeI will stay just like that for an eternity  Isnt it utterly  completely a fools teachingWhat else could it be lordIts utterly  completely a fools teachingWhat do you think monks  Is form constant or inconstant Inconstant lord And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful Stressful lord And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I amNo lordIs feeling constant or inconstant Inconstant lordIs perception constant or inconstant Inconstant lordAre fabrications constant or inconstant Inconstant lordWhat do you think monks  Is consciousness constant or inconstant Inconstant lord And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful Stressful lord And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I amNo lordThus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amAny feeling whatsoeverAny perception whatsoeverAny fabrications whatsoeverAny consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amSeeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousnessDisenchanted he becomes dispassionateThrough dispassion he is fully releasedWith full release there is the knowledge Fully released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThis monks is called a monk whose crossbar is thrown off whose moat is filled in whose pillar is pulled out whose bolt is withdrawn a noble one with banner lowered burden placed down unfetteredAnd how is a monk one whose crossbar is thrown offThere is the case where a monks ignorance is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingThis is how a monk is one whose crossbar is thrown offAnd how is a monk one whose moat is filled inThere is the case where a monks wanderingon to birth leading on to furtherbecoming is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingThis is how a monk is one whose moat is filled inAnd how is a monk one whose pillar is pulled outThere is the case where a monks craving is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingThis is how a monk is one whose pillar is pulled outAnd how is a monk one whose bolt is withdrawnThere is the case where a monks five lower fetters are abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingThis is how a monk is one whose bolt is withdrawnAnd how is a monk a noble one with banner lowered burden placed down unfetteredThere is the case where a monks conceit I am is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingThis is how a monk is a noble one with banner lowered burden placed down unfetteredAnd when the devas together with Indra the Brahmas  Pajapati search for the monk whose mind is thus released they cannot find that The consciousness of the one truly gone is dependent on this Why is thatThe one truly gone is untraceable even in the here  nowSpeaking in this way teaching in this way I have been erroneously vainly falsely unfactually misrepresented by some brahmans and contemplatives Gotama the contemplative is one who misleadsHe declares the annihilation destruction extermination of the existing being But as I am not that as I do not say that so I have been erroneously vainly falsely unfactually misrepresented by those venerable brahmans and contemplatives Gotama the contemplative is one who misleadsHe declares the annihilation destruction extermination of the existing being Both formerly and now monks I declare only stress and the cessation of stressAnd if others insult abuse taunt bother  harass the Tathagata for that he feels no hatred no resentment no dissatisfaction of heart because of thatAnd if others honor respect revere  venerate the Tathagata for that he feels no joy no happiness no elation of heart because of thatAnd if others honor respect revere  venerate the Tathagata for that he thinks They do me such service at this that has already been comprehended Therefore monks if others insult abuse taunt bother  harass you as well you should feel no hatred no resentment no dissatisfaction of heart because of thatAnd if others honor respect revere  venerate you as well you should feel no joy no gladness no elation of heart because of thatAnd if others honor respect revere  venerate you you should think They do us such service at this that has already been comprehendedTherefore monks whatever isnt yours Let go of itYour letting go of it will be for your longterm welfare  happinessAnd what isnt yoursForm isnt yours Let go of itYour letting go of it will be for your longterm welfare  happinessFeeling isnt yours Perception Thought fabrications Consciousness isnt yours Let go of itYour letting go of it will be for your longterm welfare  happinessWhat do you think monks If a person were to gather or burn or do as he likes with the grass twigs branches  leaves here in Jetas Grove would the thought occur to you Its us that this person is gathering burning or doing with as he likesNo lordWhy is thatBecause those things are not our self nor do they belong to our selfEven so monks whatever isnt yours Let go of itYour letting go of it will be for your longterm welfare  happinessAnd what isnt yoursForm isnt yours Feeling isnt yours Perception Thought fabrications Consciousness isnt yours Let go of itYour letting go of it will be for your longterm welfare  happinessThe Dhamma thus wellproclaimed by me is clear open evident stripped of ragsIn the Dhamma thus wellproclaimed by me  clear open evident stripped of rags  there is for those monks who are arahants  whose mental effluents are ended who have reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and who are released through right gnosis  no cycle for manifestationThis is how the Dhamma wellproclaimed by me is clear open evident stripped of ragsIn the Dhamma thus wellproclaimed by me  clear open evident stripped of rags  those monks who have abandoned the five lower fetters are all due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that worldThis is how the Dhamma wellproclaimed by me is clear open evident stripped of ragsIn the Dhamma thus wellproclaimed by me  clear open evident stripped of rags  those monks who have abandoned the three fetters with the attenuation of passion aversion  delusion are all oncereturners who on returning only one more time to this world will make an ending to stressThis is how the Dhamma wellproclaimed by me is clear open evident stripped of ragsIn the Dhamma thus wellproclaimed by me  clear open

all headed for selfawakeningThis is how the Dhamma wellproclaimed by me is clear open evident stripped of ragsIn the Dhamma thus wellproclaimed by me  clear open evident stripped of rags  those monks who have a measure of conviction in me a measure of love for me are all headed for heavenThis is how the Dhamma wellproclaimed by me is clear open evident stripped of ragsThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsAs for the term existing being SNand SNstate that a being is defined by hisherits objects of clingingSNindicates that one of the ways of overcoming clinging is to focus on how the concept of being arises without assuming the truth of the conceptAnd as MN SN and SNmaintain when clinging is gone one is called not a being but a tathagata  who freed from clinging cannot be classified as or identified with anything at allI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan ParkThen Mahanama the Sakyan went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One For a long time now lord I have understood the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One thus Greed is a defilement of the mind aversion is a defilement of the mind delusion is a defilement of the mind Yet even though I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One that greed is a defilement of the mind aversion is a defilement of the mind delusion is a defilement of the mind there are still times when the mental quality of greed invades my mind and remains when the mental quality of aversion the mental quality of delusion invades my mind and remainsThe thought occurs to me What mental quality is unabandoned within me so that there are times when the mental quality of greed invades my mind and remains when the mental quality of aversion the mental quality of delusion invades my mind and remainsMahanama that very mental quality is what is unabandoned within you so that there are times when the mental quality of greed the mental quality of aversion the mental quality of delusion invades your mind and remainsFor if that mental quality were abandoned in you you would not live the household life and would not partake of sensualityIts because that mental quality is not abandoned in you that you live the household life and partake of sensualityEven though a disciple of the noble ones has clearly seen as it actually is with right discernment that sensuality is of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks still  if he has not attained a rapture  pleasure apart from sensuality apart from unskillful mental qualities or something more peaceful than that  he can be tempted by sensualityBut when he has clearly seen as it actually is with right discernment that sensuality is of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks and he has attained a rapture  pleasure apart from sensuality apart from unskillful mental qualities or something more peaceful than that he cannot be tempted by sensualityI myself before my Awakening when I was still an unawakened bodhisatta saw as it actually was with right discernment that sensuality is of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks but as long as I had not attained a rapture  pleasure apart from sensuality apart from unskillful mental qualities or something more peaceful than that I did not claim that I could not be tempted by sensualityBut when I saw as it actually was with right discernment that sensuality is of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks and I had attained a rapture  pleasure apart from sensuality apart from unskillful mental qualities or something more peaceful than that that was when I claimed that I could not be tempted by sensualityNow what Mahanama is the allure of sensualityThese five strings of sensualityWhich fiveForms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingSounds cognizable via the ear Aromas cognizable via the nose Flavors cognizable via the tongue Tactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingNow whatever pleasure or joy arises in dependence on these five strands of sensuality that is the allure of sensualityAnd what is the drawback of sensualityThere is the case where on account of the occupation by which a clansman makes a living  whether checking or accounting or calculating or plowing or trading or cattle tending or archery or as a kings man or whatever the occupation may be  he faces cold he faces heat being harassed by mosquitoes  flies wind  sun  creeping things dying from hunger  thirstNow this drawback in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensualityIf the clansman gains no wealth while thus working  striving  making effort he sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraught My work is in vain my efforts are fruitless Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensualityIf the clansman gains wealth while thus working  striving  making effort he experiences pain  distress in protecting it How will neither kings nor thieves make off with my property nor fire burn it nor water sweep it away nor hateful heirs make off with it And as he thus guards and watches over his property kings or thieves make off with it or fire burns it or water sweeps it away or hateful heirs make off with itAnd he sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraught What was mine is no more Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensualityAgain it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source sensuality for the cause the reason being simply sensuality that kings quarrel with kings nobles with nobles brahmans with brahmans householders with householders mother with child child with mother father with child child with father brother with brother sister with sister brother with sister sister with brother friend with friendAnd then in their quarrels brawls  disputes they attack one another with fists or with clods or with sticks or with knives so that they incur death or deadly painNow this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensualityAgain it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that taking swords  shields and buckling on bows  quivers charge into battle massed in double array while arrows  spears are flying and swords are flashing and there they are wounded by arrows  spears and their heads are cut off by swords so that they incur death or deadly painNow this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensualityAgain it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that taking swords  shields and buckling on bows  quivers charge slippery bastions while arrows  spears are flying and swords are flashing and there they are splashed with boiling cow dung and crushed under heavy weights and their heads are cut off by swords so that they incur death or deadly painNow this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensualityAgain it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that break into windows seize plunder commit burglary ambush highways commit adultery and when they are captured kings have them tortured in many waysThey flog them with whips beat them with canes beat them with clubsThey cut off their hands cut off their feet cut off their hands  feetThey cut off their ears cut off their noses cut off their ears  nosesThey subject them to the porridge pot the polishedshell shave the Rahus mouth the flaming garland the blazing hand the grassduty the barkdress the burning antelope the meat hooks the coingouging the lye pickling the pivot on a stake the rolledup bed They have them splashed with boiling oil devoured by dogs impaled alive on stakesThey have their heads cut off with swords so that they incur death or deadly painNow this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensualityAgain it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that engaged in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconductHaving engaged in bodily verbal and mental misconduct they  on the breakup of the body after death  reappear in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellNow this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress in the future life has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensualityOnce Mahanama when I was staying near Rajagaha on Vulture Peak Mountain a number of Niganthas were at Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili practicing continuous standing rejecting seats experiencing fierce sharp racking pains due to exertionSo in the evening rising from seclusion I went to the Niganthas at Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili and on arrival asked them Why are you practicing continuous standing rejecting seats experiencing fierce sharp racking pains due to exertion When this was said the Niganthas said to me Friend the Nigantha Nataputta is allknowing allseeing and claims total knowledge  vision thus Whether I am walking or standing sleeping or awake knowledge  vision are continuously  continually established in me He has told us Niganthas there are evil actions that you have done in the pastExhaust them with these painful austeritiesWhen in the present you are restrained in body restrained in speech and restrained in mind that is the nondoing of evil action for the futureThus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the nondoing of new actions there will be no flow into the futureWith no flow into the future there is the ending of actionWith the ending of action the ending of stressWith the ending of stress the ending of feelingWith the ending of feeling all suffering  stress will be exhausted We approve of that prefer it and are gratified by itWhen this was said I asked them But friends do you know that you existed in the past and that you did not not existNo friendAnd do you know that you did evil actions in the past and that you did not not do themNo friendAnd do you know that you did suchandsuch evil actions in the pastNo friendAnd do you know that soandso much stress has been exhausted or that soandso much stress remains to be exhausted or that with the exhaustion of soandso much stress all stress will be exhaustedNo friendBut do you know what is the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities and the attainment of skillful mental qualities in the herenowNo friendSo friends it seems that you dont know that you existed in the past and that you did not not exist you dont know that you did evil actions in the past and that you did not not do them you dont know that you did suchandsuch evil actions in the past you dont know that soandso much stress has been exhausted or that soandso much stress remains to be exhausted or that with the exhaustion of soandso much stress all stress will be exhausted you dont know what is the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities and the attainment of skillful mental qualities in the herenowThat being the case those in the world who are murderers bloodyhanded doers of what is cruel when they are later reborn among human beings go forth with the NiganthasBut friend Gotama its not the case that pleasure is to be attained through pleasurePleasure is to be attained through painFor if pleasure were to be attained through pleasure then King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha would attain pleasure for he lives in greater pleasure than you friend GotamaSurely the venerable Niganthas said that rashly and without reflecting for instead I should be asked Who lives in greater pleasure King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha or venerable GotamaYes friend Gotama we said that rashly and without reflecting but let that beWe now ask you venerable Gotama Who lives in greater pleasure King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha or venerable GotamaIn that case Niganthas I will question you in returnAnswer as you likeWhat do you think Can King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha  without moving his body without uttering a word  dwell sensitive to unalloyed pleasure for seven days  nightsNo friend for six days  nights for five days  nights for a day  a nightNo friendNow I  without moving my body without uttering a word  can dwell sensitive to unalloyed pleasure for a day and a night for two days  nights for three four five six seven days  nightsSo what do you think That being the case who dwells in greater pleasure King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha or meThat being the case venerable Gotama dwells in greater pleasure than King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha That is what the Blessed One saidGratified Mahanama the Sakyan delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi at Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen early in the morning several monks put on their robes and carrying their bowls and outer robes went into Savatthi for almsThe thought occurred to them Its still too early to go into Savatthi for almsWhat if we were to visit the park of the wanderers of other persuasionsSo they headed to the park of the wanderers of other persuasionsOn arrival they exchanged courteous greetings with the wanderers of other persuasionsAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies they sat to one sideAs they were sitting there the wanderers of other persuasions said to them Friends Gotama the contemplative describes the comprehension of sensualityWe too describe the comprehension of sensualityHe describes the comprehension of formsWe too describe the comprehension of formsHe describes the comprehension of feelingsWe too describe the comprehension of feelingsSo what is the difference what the distinction what the distinguishing factor between him and us in terms of his teaching and ours his message and oursThe monks neither delighting nor disapproving of the words of the wanderers of other persuasions got up from their seats We will learn the meaning of these words in the Blessed Ones presenceThen having gone for alms in Savatthi after their meal returning from their alms round the monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs they were sitting there theyMonks when the wanderers of other persuasions say this they are to be told What friends with regard to sensuality is the allure what the drawback what the escapeWhat with regard to forms is the allure what the drawback what the escapeWhat with regard to feelings is the allure what the drawback what the escape When asked this they will not manage an answer and what is more will get themselves into troubleWhy is thatBecause it lies outside their rangeMonks in this world with its devas maras and brahmas in this people with its contemplatives  brahmans its royalty  commonfolk I do not see anyone who can satisfy the mind with an answer to these questions aside from a Tathagata a Tathagatas disciples or someone who has heard it from themNow what monks is the allure of sensualityThese five strings of sensualityWhich fiveForms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingSounds cognizable via the ear Aromas cognizable via the nose Flavors cognizable via the tongue Tactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingNow whatever pleasure or joy arises in dependence on these five strands of sensuality that is the allure of sensualityAnd what is the drawback of sensualityThere is the case where on account of the occupation by which a clansman makes a living  whether checking or accounting or calculating or plowing or trading or cattletending or archery or as a kings man or whatever the occupation may be  he faces cold he faces heat being harassed by mosquitoes  flies wind  sun  creeping things dying from hunger  thirstNow this drawback in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensualityIf the clansman gains no wealth while thus working  striving  making effort he sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraught My work is in vain my efforts are fruitless Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensualityIf the clansman gains wealth while thus working  striving  making effort he experiences pain  distress in protecting it How will neither kings nor thieves make off with my property nor fire burn it nor water sweep it away nor hateful heirs make off with it And as he thus guards and watches over his property kings or thieves make off with it or fire burns it or water sweeps it away or hateful heirs make off with itAnd he sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraught What was mine is no more Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensualityAgain it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source sensuality for the cause the reason being simply sensuality that kings quarrel with kings nobles with nobles brahmans with brahmans householders with householders mother with child child with mother father with child child with father brother with brother sister with sister brother with sister sister with brother friend with friendAnd then in their quarrels brawls  disputes they attack one another with fists or with clods or with sticks or with knives so that they incur death or deadly painNow this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensualityAgain it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that taking swords  shields and buckling on bows  quivers charge into battle massed in double array while arrows  spears are flying and swords are flashing and there they are wounded by arrows  spears and their heads are cut off by swords so that they incur death or deadly painNow this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensualityAgain it is with sensuality for the

with boiling cow dung and crushed under heavy weights and their heads are cut off by swords so that they incur death or deadly painNow this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensualityAgain it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that break into windows seize plunder commit burglary ambush highways commit adultery and when they are captured kings have them tortured in many waysThey flog them with whips beat them with

the abandoning of desirepassion for sensuality That is the escape from sensualityThat any brahmans or contemplatives who do not discern as it actually is the allure of sensuality as allure the

first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluationAt that time he does not intend his own affliction the affliction of others or the affliction of bothHe feels a feeling totally unafflictedThe unafflicted I tell you is the highest allure of feelingsAgain the monk with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations enters  remains in the second jhana

have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThere he addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks repliedThe Blessed One said Monks before my selfawakening when I was still just an unawakened Bodhisatta the thought occurred to me Why dont I keep dividing my thinking into two sorts So I made thinking imbued with sensuality thinking imbued with ill will  thinking imbued with harmfulness one sort and thinking imbued with renunciation thinking imbued with nonill will  thinking imbued with harmlessness another sortAnd as I remained thus heedful ardent  resolute thinking imbued with sensuality arose in meI discerned that Thinking imbued with sensuality has arisen in me and that leads to my own affliction or to the affliction of others or to the affliction of bothIt obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to UnbindingAs I noticed that it leads to my own affliction it subsidedAs I noticed that it leads to the affliction of others to the affliction of both it obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to Unbinding it subsidedWhenever thinking imbued with sensuality had arisen I simply abandoned

season when the crops are ripening a cowherd would look after his cows He would tap  poke  check  curb them with a stick on this side  thatWhy is thatBecause he foresees flogging or imprisonment or a fine or public censure arising from thatIn the same way I foresaw in unskillful qualities drawbacks degradation  defilement and I foresaw in skillful qualities rewards related to renunciation

into the village a cowherd would look after his cows While resting under the shade of a tree or out in the open he simply keeps himself mindful of those cows In the same way I simply kept myself mindful of those mental qualitiesUnflagging persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness establishedMy body was calm  unaroused my mind concentrated  singleQuite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities I entered  remained in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluationWith the stilling of directed

the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past livesI recollected my manifold past lives ie one birth two five ten fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many eons of cosmic contraction many eons of cosmic expansion many eons of cosmic contraction  expansion There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose thereThere too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose here Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes  detailsThis was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away  reappearance of beingsI saw  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech  mind who reviled the Noble Ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellBut these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech  mind who did not revile the Noble Ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  I saw beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kammaThis was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentationsI discerned as it had come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations My heart thus knowing thus seeing was released from the fermentation of sensuality released from the fermentation of becoming released from the fermentation of ignoranceWith release there was the knowledge Released I discerned that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThis was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteSuppose monks that in a forested wilderness there were a large lowlying marsh in dependence on which there lived a large herd of deer and a certain man were to appear not desiring their benefit not desiring their welfare not desiring their rest from bondageHe would close off the safe restful path that led to their rapture and would open up a false path set out a male decoy place a female decoy and thus the large herd of deer would eventually fall into ruin disaster  decimationThen suppose that a certain man were to appear to that same large herd of deer desiring their benefit desiring their welfare desiring their rest from bondageHe would open up the safe restful path that led to their rapture would close off the false path take away the male decoy destroy the female decoy and thus the large herd of deer would eventually come into growth increase  abundanceI have given this simile in order to convey a meaningThe meaning is this The large lowlying marsh stands for sensualityThe large herd of deer stands for beingsThe man not desiring their benefit not desiring their welfare not desiring their rest from bondage stands for Mara the Evil OneThe false path stands for the eightfold wrong path ie wrong view wrong resolve wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness  wrong concentrationThe male decoy stands for passion  delightThe female decoy stands for ignoranceThe man desiring their benefit desiring their welfare desiring their rest from bondage stands for the Tathagata the Worthy One the Rightly Selfawakened OneThe safe restful path that led to their rapture stands for the noble eightfold path ie right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness  right concentrationSo monks I have opened up the safe restful path closed off the false path removed the male decoy destroyed the femaleWhatever a teacher should do  seeking the welfare of his disciples out of sympathy for them  that have I done for youOver there are the roots of trees over there empty dwellingsPractice jhana monksDont be heedlessDont later fall into regretThis is our message to youThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThis discourse plays a central role in the early Buddhist analysis of conflictAs might be expected the blame for conflict lies within in the unskillful habits of the mind rather than withoutThe culprit in this case is a habit called papañcaUnfortunately none of the early texts give a clear definition of what the word papañca means so its hard to find a precise English equivalent for the termHowever they do give a clear analysis of how papañca arises how it leads to conflict and how it can be endedIn the final analysis these are the questions that matter  more than the precise definition of terms  so we will deal with them first before proposing a few possible translation equivalents for the wordThree passages in the discourses  DN MN and Sn map the causal processes that give rise to papañca and lead from papañca to conflictBecause the Buddhist analysis of causality is generally nonlinear with plenty of room for feedback loops the maps vary in some of their detailsIn DN the map reads like thisIn Sn the map is less linear and can be diagrammed like thisperception gt the categories of papañcaperception gt name  form gt contact gt appealing  unappealing gt desire gt dearnotdear gt stinginessdivisivenessquarrelsdisputesIn MN the map is thisIn this last case however the bare outline misses some of the important implications of the way this process is phrasedIn the full passage the analysis starts out in an impersonal toneStarting with feeling the notion of an agent  in this case the feeler  acting on objects is introducedThrough the process of papañca the agent then becomes a victim of hisher own patterns of thinkingWhat are these perceptions  categories that assail the person who papañcizesSnstates that the root of the categories of papañca is the perception I am the thinker From this selfreflexive thought  in which one conceives a self a thing corresponding to the concept of I  a number of categories can be derived beingnotbeing menotme minenotmine doerdoneto signifiersignifiedOnce ones self becomes a thing under the rubric of these categories its impossible not to be assailed by the perceptions  categories derived from these basic distinctionsWhen theres the sense of identification with something that experiences then based on the feelings arising from sensory contact some feelings will seem appealing  worth getting for the self  and others will seem unappealing  worth pushing awayFrom this there grows desire which comes into conflict with the desires of others who are also engaging in papañcaThis is how inner objectifications breed external contentionHow can this process be endedThrough a shift in perception caused by the way one attends to feelings using the categories of appropriate attentionAs the Buddha states in DN rather than viewing a feeling as an appealing or unappealing thing one should look at it as part of a causal process when a particular feeling is pursued do skillful or unskillful qualities increase in the mindIf skillful qualities increase the feeling may be pursuedIf unskillful qualities increase it shouldntWhen comparing feelings that lead to skillful qualities notice which are more refined those accompanied with thinking and evaluation or those free of thinking and evaluation as in the higher stages of mental absorption or jhanaWhen seeing this there is a tendency to opt for the more refined feelings and this cuts through the act of thinking that according to MN provides the basis for papañcaIn following this program the notion of agent and victim is avoided as is selfreflexive thinking in generalThere is simply the analysis of causeeffect processesOne is still making use of dualities  distinguishing between unskillful and skillful  but the distinction is between processes not thingsThus ones analysis avoids the type of thinking that according to DN depends on the perceptions and categories of papañca and in this way the vicious cycle by which thinking and papañca keep feeding each other is cutUltimately by following this program to greater and greater levels of refinement through the higher levels of mental absorption one finds less and less to relish and enjoy in the six senses and the mental processes based on themWith this sense of disenchantment the processes of feeling and thought are stilled and there is a breakthrough to the cessation of the six sense spheresWhen these spheres cease is there anything else leftVenSariputta in AN warns us not to ask for to ask if there is isnt bothisandisnt neitherisnorisnt anything left in that dimension is to papañcize what is free from papañcaHowever this dimension is not a total annihilation of experienceIts a type of experience that DN calls consciousness without feature luminous all around where water earth fire  wind have no footing where longshort coarsefine fairfoul nameform are all brought to an endThis is the fruit of the path of arahantship  a path that makes use of dualities but leads to a fruit beyond themIt may come as cold comfort to realize that conflict can be totally overcome only with the realization of arahantship but its important to note that by following the path recommended in DN  learning to avoid references to any notion of self and learning to view feelings not as things but as parts of a causal process affecting the qualities in the mind  the basis for papañca is gradually undercut and there are fewer and fewer occasions for conflictIn following this path one reaps its increasing benefits all along the wayTranslating papañca As one writer has noted the word papañca has had a wide variety of meanings in Indian thought with only one constant in Buddhist philosophical discourse it carries negative connotations usually of falsification and distortionThe word itself is derived from a root that means diffuseness spreading proliferatingThe Pali Commentaries define papañca as covering three types of thought craving conceit and viewsThey also note that it functions to slow the mind down in its escape from samsaraBecause its categories begin with the objectifying thought I am the thinker I have chosen to render the word as objectification although some of the following alternatives might be acceptable as well selfreflexive thinking reification proliferation complication elaboration distortionThe word offers some interesting parallels to the postmodern notion of logocentric thinking but its important to note that the Buddhas program of deconstructing this process differs sharply from that of postmodern thoughtI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was living among the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan ParkThen in the early morning having put on his robes and carrying his bowl  outer robe he went into Kapilavatthu for almsHaving gone for alms in Kapilavatthu after the meal returning from his alms round he went to the Great Wood for the days abidingPlunging into the Great Wood he sat down at the root of a bilva sapling for the days abidingDandapani the Sakyan out roaming  rambling for exercise also went to the Great WoodPlunging into the Great Wood he went to where the Blessed One was under the bilva saplingOn arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he stood to one sideAs he was standing there he said to the Blessed One What is the contemplatives doctrineWhat does he proclaimThe sort of doctrine friend where one does not keep quarreling with anyone in the cosmos with its devas Maras  Brahmas with its contemplatives  brahmans its royalty  commonfolk the sort where perceptions no longer obsess the brahman who remains dissociated from sensuality free from perplexity his uncertainty cut away devoid of craving for becoming  nonSuch is my doctrine such is what I proclaimWhen this was said Dandapani the Sakyan  shaking his head wagging his tongue raising his eyebrows so that his forehead was wrinkled in three furrows  left leaning on his stickThen when it was evening the Blessed One rose from his seclusion and went to the Banyan ParkOn arrival he sat down on a seat made readyAs he was sitting there heWhen this was said a certain monk said to the Blessed One Lord what sort of doctrine is it where one does not keep quarreling with anyone in the cosmos with its deities Maras  Brahmas with its contemplatives  brahmans its royalty  commonfolk where perceptions no longer obsess the brahman who remains dissociated from sensuality free from perplexity his uncertainty cut away devoid of craving for becoming  nonIf monk with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions  categories of objectification assail a person there is nothing there to relish welcome or remain fastened to then that is the end of the obsessions of passion the obsessions of resistance the obsessions of views the obsessions of uncertainty the obsessions of conceit the obsessions of passion for becoming  the obsessions of ignoranceThat is the end of taking up rods  bladed weapons of arguments quarrels disputes accusations divisive talebearing  false speechThat is where these evil unskillful things cease without remainder That is what the Blessed One saidHaving said it the One Wellgone got up from his seat and went into his dwellingThen not long after the Blessed One had left this thought occurred to the monks This brief statement the Blessed One made after which he went into his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning  ie If with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions  categories of objectification assail a person there is nothing to relish that is where these evil unskillful things cease without remainder now who might analyze the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement Then the thought occurred to them VenMaha Kaccana is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his knowledgeable companions in the holy lifeHe is capable of analyzing the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statementSuppose we were to go to him and on arrival question him about this matterSo the monks went to VenMaha Kaccana and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies they sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they Analyze the meaning VenMaha KaccanaFriends its as if a man needing heartwood looking for heartwood wandering in search of heartwood  passing over the root  trunk of a standing tree possessing heartwood  were to imagine that heartwood should be sought among its branches  leavesSo it is with you who  having bypassed the Blessed One when you were face to face with him the Teacher  imagine that I should be asked about this matterFor knowing the Blessed One knows seeing he seesHe is the Eye he is Knowledge he is Dhamma he is BrahmaHe is the speaker the proclaimer the elucidator of meaning the giver of the Deathless the lord of the Dhamma the TathagataThat was the time when you should have questioned him about this matterHowever he answered that was how you should have remembered itYes friend Kaccana knowing the Blessed One knows seeing he seesHe is the Eye he is Knowledge he is Dhamma he is BrahmaHe is the speaker the proclaimer the elucidator of meaning the giver of the Deathless the lord of the Dhamma the TathagataThat was the time when we should have questioned him about this matterHowever he answered that was how we should have remembered itBut you are praised by the Teacher and esteemed by your knowledgeable companions in the holy lifeYou are capable of analyzing the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statementAnalyze the meaning VenMaha Kaccana without making it difficultIn that case my friends listen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say friend the monks respondedVenMaha Kaccayana said this Friends concerning the brief statement the Blessed One made after which he went into his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning  ie If with

no delineation of thinking it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of being assailed by the perceptions  categories of objectificationSo concerning the brief statement the Blessed One made after which he entered his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning  ie If with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions  categories of objectification assail a person there is nothing there to relish welcome or remain fastened to then that is the end of the obsessions of passion the obsessions of resistance the obsessions of views the obsessions of uncertainty the obsessions of conceit the obsessions of passion for becoming  the obsessions of ignoranceThat is the end of taking up rods  bladed weapons of arguments quarrels disputes accusations divisive talebearing  false speechThat is where these evil unskillful things cease without remainder  this is how I understand the detailed meaningNow friends if you wish having gone to the Blessed One question him about this matterHowever he answers is how you should remember itThen the monks delighting in  approving of VenMaha Kaccanas words got up from their seats and went to the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down to him they sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they Then VenMaha Kaccana analyzed the meaning using these words statements  phrasesMaha Kaccana is wise monksHe is a person of great discernmentIf you had asked me about this matter I too would have answered in the same way he didThat is its meaning and that is how you should remember itWhen this was said VenAnanda said to the Blessed One Lord its as if a man  overcome with hunger weakness  thirst  were to come across a ball of honeyWherever he were to taste it he would experience a sweet delectable flavorIn the same way wherever a monk of capable awareness might investigate the meaning of this Dhamma discourse with his discernment he would experience gratification he would experience confidenceWhat is the name of this Dhamma discourseThen Ananda you can remember this Dhamma discourse as the Ball of Honey Discourse That is what the Blessed One saidGratified VenAnanda delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThus have I heardOnce the Blessed One lived at Saavatthii in Jetas Grove in Anaathapindikas monasteryNow on that occasion a monk called Arittha formerly of the vulture killers had conceived this pernicious view There are things called obstructions by the Blessed OneAs I understand his teaching those things are not necessarily obstructive for one who pursues themSeveral monks hearing about it went to the monk Arittha formerly of the vulture killers and asked him Is it true friend Arittha that you have conceived this pernicious view There are things called by the Blessed OneAs I understand his teaching those things are not necessarily obstructive for one who pursues themYes indeed friendsThen those monks wishing to dissuade Arittha from that pernicious view urged admonished questioned and exhorted him thus Do not say so friend Arittha do not say soDo not misrepresent the Blessed OneIt is not right to misrepresent himNever would the Blessed One speak like thatFor in many ways indeed has the Blessed One said of those obstructive things that they are obstructions indeed and that they necessarily obstruct him who pursues themSense desires so he has said bring little enjoyment and much suffering and disappointmentThe perils in them are greaterSense desires are like bare bones has the Blessed One said they are like a lump of flesh like a torch of straw like a pit of burning coals like a dream like borrowed goods like a fruitbearing tree like a slaughter house like a stake of swords like a snakes head are sense desires has the Blessed One saidThey bring little enjoyment and much suffering and disappointmentThe perils in them are greaterYet though the monk Arittha was thus urged admonished questioned and exhorted by those monks he still clung tenaciously and obstinately to his pernicious view saying There are things called obstructions by the Blessed OneAs I understand his teaching those things are not necessarily obstructive for one who pursues themWhen those monks could not dissuade the monk Arittha formerly of the vulture killers from his pernicious view they went to the Blessed One and after respectfully saluting him they sat down at one sideBeing seated they told the Blessed One and they said Since O Lord we could not dissuade the monk Arittha from his pernicious view we have now reported this matter to the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One addressed a certain monk thus Go O monk and tell the monk Arittha formerly of the vulture killers that the Master calls him  Yes Lord replied the monkHe went to the monk Arittha and spoke to him The Master calls you friend Arittha  Yes friend replied Arittha and he went to meet the Blessed OneHaving arrived he saluted the Blessed One respectfully and sat down at one sideWhen he was seated the Blessed One addressed him thusIs it true Arittha that you have conceived this pernicious view There are things called obstructions by the Blessed OneAs I understand his teaching those things are not necessarily obstructive for him who pursues them  Yes indeed Lord I understand the teaching of the Blessed One in this way that those things called obstructions by the Blessed One are not necessarily obstructive for him who pursues themOf whom do you know foolish man that I have taught to him the teaching in that mannerDid I not foolish man speak in many ways of those obstructive things that they are obstructions indeed and that they necessarily obstruct him who pursues themSense desires so I have said bring little enjoyment and much suffering and disappointmentThe perils in them are greaterSense desires are like bare bones have I said they are like a lump of flesh they are like a snakes head have I saidThey bring much suffering and disappointmentThe perils in them are greaterBut you O foolish man have misrepresented us by what you personally have wrongly graspedYou have undermined your own and have created much demeritThis foolish man will bring you much harm and suffering for a long timeThen the Blessed One addressed the monks thus What do you think O monks has that monk Arittha formerly of the vulture killers produced any spark in this teaching and discipline  How should that be LordCertainly not O LordAfter these words the monk Arittha formerly of the vulture killers sat silent confused with his shoulders drooping and his head bent brooding and incapable of making a rejoinderThen the Blessed One knowing spoke to him You will be known foolish man by what is your own pernicious view I shall now question the monks about thisThen the Blessed One addressed the monks Do you O monks also understand the teaching proclaimed by me in the same manner as this monk Arittha does who misrepresents us by what he personally has wrongly grasped who has undermined his own and created much demeritCertainly not LordFor in many ways has the Blessed One told us of those obstructive things that they are obstructions indeed and that they necessarily obstruct him who pursues them Good monksIt is good that you thus understand the teaching proclaimed by meFor in many ways have I spoken of those obstructive things that they are obstructions indeed and that they necessarily obstruct him who pursues themSense desires so have I said bring little enjoyment and much suffering and disappointmentThe perils in them are greaterSense desires are like bare bones have I said they are like a lump of flesh like a torch of straw like a pit of burning coals like a dream like borrowed goods like a fruitbearing tree like a slaughterhouse like a stake of swords like a snakes head are sense desires have I saidThey bring much suffering and disappointmentThe perils in them are greaterBut this monk Arittha formerly of the vulture killers misrepresents us by what he personally has wrongly grasped he undermines his own and creates much demeritThis will bring to this foolish man much harm and suffering for a long timeMonks it is impossible indeed that one can pursue sense gratification without sensual desire without perceptions of sensual desire without thoughts of sensual desireThere are here O monks some foolish men who study the Teaching having studied it they do not wisely examine the purpose of those teachingsTo those who do not wisely examine the purpose these teachings will not yield insightThey study the Teaching only to use it for criticizing or for refuting others in disputationThey do not experience the purpose for which they study the TeachingTo them these teachings wrongly grasped will bring harm and suffering for a long timeAnd whyBecause of their wrong grasp of the teachingsSuppose monks a man wants a snake looks for a snake goes in search of a snakeHe then sees a large snake and when he is grasping its body or its tail the snake turns back on him and bites his hand or arm or some other limb of hisAnd because of that he suffers death or deadly painAnd whyBecause of his wrong grasp of the snakeSimilarly O monks there are here some foolish men who study the Teaching having studied it they do not wisely examine the purpose of those teachingsTo those who do not wisely examine the purpose these teachings will not yield insightThey study the Teaching only to use it for criticizing or for refuting others in disputationThey do not experience the purpose for which they study the TeachingTo them these teachings wrongly grasped will bring harm and suffering for a long timeAnd whyBecause of their wrong grasp of the teachingsBut there are here O monks some noble sons who study the Teaching and having studied it they examine wisely the purpose of those teachingsTo those who wisely examine the purpose these teachings will yield insightThey do not study the Teaching for the sake of criticizing nor for refuting others in disputationThey experience the purpose for which they study the Teaching and to them these teachings being rightly grasped will bring welfare and happiness for a long timeAnd whyBecause of their right grasp of the teachingsSuppose monks a man wants a snake looks for a snake goes in search of a snakeHe then sees a large snake and with a forked stick he holds it firmly downHaving done so he catches it firmly by the neckThen although the snake might entwine with its body that mans hand or arm or some other limb of his still he does not on that account suffer death or deadly painAnd why notBecause of his right grasp of the snakeSimilarly O monks there are here some noble sons who study the Teaching and having learned it they examine wisely the purpose of those teachingsTo those who wisely examine the purpose these teachings will yield insightThey do not study the Teaching for the sake of criticizing nor for refuting others in disputationThey experience the purpose for which they study the Teaching and to them these teachings being rightly grasped will bring welfare and happiness for a long timeAnd whyBecause of their right grasp of the teachingsTherefore O monks if you know the purpose of what I have said you should keep it in mind accordinglyBut if you do not know the purpose of what I have said you should question me about it or else those monks who are wiseI shall show you monks the Teachings similitude to a raft as having the purpose of crossing over not the purpose of being clung toListen monks and heed well what I shall say  Yes Lord replied the monksand the Blessed One spoke thusSuppose monks there is a man journeying on a road and he sees a vast expanse of water of which this shore is perilous and fearful while the other shore is safe and free from dangerBut there is no boat for crossing nor is there a bridge for going over from this side to the otherSo the man thinks This is a vast expanse of water and this shore is perilous and fearful but the other shore is safe and free from dangerThere is however no boat here for crossing nor a bridge for going over from this side to the otherSuppose I gather reeds sticks branches and foliage and bind them into a raft Now that man collects reeds sticks branches and foliage and binds them into a raftCarried by that raft laboring with hands and feet he safely crosses over to the other shoreHaving crossed and arrived at the other shore he thinks This raft indeed has been very helpful to meCarried by it laboring with hands and feet I got safely across to the other shoreShould I not lift this raft on my head or put it on my shoulders and go where I likeWhat do you think about it O monksWill this man by acting thus do what should be done with a raft  No Lord  How then monks would he be doing what ought to be done with a raftHere monks having got across and arrived at the other shore the man thinks This raft indeed has been very helpful to meCarried by it and laboring with hands and feet I got safely across to the other shoreShould I not pull it up now to the dry land or let it float in the water and then go as I please By acting thus monks would that man do what should be done with a raftIn the same way monks have I shown to you the Teachings similitude to a raft as having the purpose of crossing over not the purpose of being clung toYou O monks who understand the Teachings similitude to a raft you should let go even teachings how much more false onesThere are monks these six grounds for false viewsWhat are the sixThere is here monks an uninstructed worldling who has no regard for Noble Ones who is ignorant of their teaching and untrained in it who has no regard for men of worth who is ignorant of their teaching and untrained in it he considers corporeality thus This is mine this I am this is my self he considers feeling perception mental formations thus This is mine this I am this is my self and what is seen heard sensed and thought what is encountered sought pursued in mind this also he considers thus This is mine this I am this is my self and also this ground for views The universe is the SelfThat I shall be after death permanent stable eternal immutable eternally the same shall I abide in that very condition  that too he considers thus This is mine this I am this is my selfBut monks there is here a wellinstructed noble disciple who has regard for Noble Ones who knows their teaching and is well trained in it who has regard for men of worth who knows their teaching and is well trained in it he does not consider corporeality in this way This is mine this I am this is my self he does not consider feeling perception mental formations in this way This is mine this I am this is my self and what is seen heard sensed and thought what is encountered sought pursued in mind this also he does not consider in this way This is mine this I am this is my self and also this ground for views The universe is the SelfThat I shall be after death permanent stable eternal immutable eternally the same shall I abide in that very condition  that too he does not consider thus This is mine this I am this is my selfConsidering thus he is not anxious about unrealitiesWhen this was said a certain monk asked the Blessed OneLord can there be anxiety about unrealities in the externalThere can be O monk said the Blessed OneIn that case monk someone thinks Oh I had itThat alas I have no longerOh may I have it againBut alas I do not get it Hence he grieves is depressed and laments beating his breast he weeps and dejection befalls himThus monk is there anxiety about unrealities in the externalBut Lord can there be absence of anxiety about unrealities in the externalThere can be O monk said the Blessed OneIn that case monk someone does not think thus Oh I had itThat alas I have no longerOh may I have it againBut alas I do not get it Hence he does not grieve is not depressed does not lament he does not beat his breast nor does he weep and no dejection befalls himThus monk is there absence of anxiety about unrealities in the externalLord can there be anxiety about unrealities in the internalThere can be monk said the Blessed OneIn that case monk someone has this view The universe is the SelfThat I shall be after death permanent stable eternal immutable eternally the same shall I abide in that very condition He then hears a Perfect One expounding the Teaching for the removal of all grounds for views of all prejudices obsessions dogmas and biases for the stilling of all processes for the relinquishment of all substrata for the extirpation of craving for dispassion cessation NibbaanaHe then thinks I shall be annihilated I shall be destroyedNo longer shall I exist Hence he grieves is depressed and laments beating his breast he weeps and dejection befalls himThus monk is there anxiety about unrealities in the internalBut Lord can there be absence of anxiety about unrealities in the internalThere can be monk said the Blessed OneIn that case monk someone does not have this view The universe is the Self eternally the same shall I abide in that very condition He then hears a Perfect One expounding the Teaching for the removal of all grounds for views of all prejudices obsessions dogmas and biases for the stilling of all processes for the relinquishing of all substrata for the extirpation of craving for dispassion cessation NibbaanaHe then does not think I shall be annihilated I shall be destroyedNo longer shall I exist Hence he does not grieve is not depressed does not lament he does not beat his breast nor does he weep and no dejection befalls himThus monk is there absence of anxiety about unrealities in the internalYou may well take hold of a possession O monks that is permanent stable eternal immutable that abides eternally the same in its very conditiondo you see monks any such possession  No Lord  Well monks I too do not see any such possession that is permanent stable eternal immutable that abides eternally the same in its very conditionYou may well accept monks the assumption of a selftheory from the acceptance of which there would not arise sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despairdo you see monks any such assumption of a selftheory  No Lord  Well monks I too do not see any such assumption of a selftheory from the acceptance of which there would not arise sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despairYou may well rely monks on any supporting for views from the reliance on which there would not arise sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despairdo you see monks any such supporting for views  No Lord  Well monks I too do not see any such supporting for views from the reliance on which there would not arise sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despairIf there were a self monks would there be my selfs property  So it is Lord  Or if there is a selfs property would there by my self  So it is Lord  Since in truth and in fact self and selfs property do not obtain O monks then this ground for views The universe is the SelfThat I shall be after death permanent stable eternal immutable eternally the same shall I abide in that very condition  is it not monks an entirely and perfectly foolish idea  What else should it be LordIt is an entirely and perfectly foolish ideaWhat do you think monks is corporeality permanent or impermanent  Impermanent Lord  And what is impermanent is it painful or pleasant  Painful Lord  What is impermanent painful subject to change is it fit to be considered thus This is mine this I am this is my self  Certainly not Lord  What do you think monks Is feeling is perception are mental formations is consciousness permanent or impermanent  Impermanent Lord  And what is impermanent is it painful or pleasant  Painful Lord  And what is impermanent painful subject to change is it fit to be considered thus This is mine this I am this is my self  Certainly not LordTherefore monks whatever corporeality whether past future or present in oneself or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near  all corporeality should with right wisdom thus be seen as it is This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfWhatever feeling whatever perception whatever mental formations whatever consciousness whether past future or present in oneself or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near  all consciousness should with right wisdom thus be seen as it is This is not mine this I am not this is not my selfSeeing this monks the wellinstructed noble disciple becomes disgusted with corporeality becomes disgusted with feeling with perception with mental formations with consciousnessThrough his being disgusted his passion fades awayHis passion having faded he is freedIn him who is freed there is the knowledge of freedom Ceased has rebirth fulfilled is the holy life the task is done there is no more of this to come thus he knowsThis monk is called one who has removed the crossbar has filled the moat has broken the pillar has unbolted a Noble One who has taken down the flag put down the burden become unfetteredAnd how monks is that monk one who has removed the crossbarHerein the monk has abandoned ignorance has cut it off at the root removed it from its soil like a palmyra tree brought it to utter extinction incapable of arising againThus has he removed the crossbarAnd how monks is that monk one who has filled the moatHerein the monk has abandoned the round of rebirths leading to renewed existence he has cut it off at the root removed it from its soil like a palmyra tree brought it to utter extinction incapable of arising againAnd how has he broken the pillarHe has abandoned craving has cut it off at the root removed it from its soil like a palmyra tree brought it to utter extinction incapable of arising againAnd how has he unboltedHe has abandoned the five lower fetters has cut them off at the root removed them from their soil like a palmyra tree brought them to utter extinction incapable of arising againAnd how is the monk a Noble One who has taken down the flag put down the burden become unfetteredHe has abandoned the conceit of self has cut it off at the root removed it from is soil like a palmyra tree brought it to utter extinction incapable of arising againThus is the monk a Noble One who has taken down the flag put down the burden become unfetteredWhen a monks mind is thus freed O monks neither the gods with Indra nor the gods with Brahma nor the gods with the Lord of Creatures when searching will find on what the consciousness of one thus gone is basedWhy is thatOne who has thus gone is no longer traceable here and now so I saySo teaching so proclaiming O monks I have been baselessly vainly falsely and wrongly accused by some ascetics and brahmans A nihilist is the ascetic Gotama He teaches the annihilation the destruction the nonbeing of an existing individualAs I am not as I do not teach so have I been baselessly vainly falsely and wrongly accused by some ascetics and brahmans thus A nihilist is the ascetic Gotama He teaches the annihilation the destruction the nonbeing of an existing individualWhat I teach now as before O monks is suffering and the cessation of sufferingIf for that others revile abuse scold and insult the Perfect One on that account O monks the Perfect One will not feel annoyance nor dejection nor displeasure in his heartAnd if for that others respect revere honor and venerate the Perfect One on that account the Perfect One will not feel delight nor joy nor elation in his heartIf for that others respect revere honor and venerate the Perfect One He will think It is towards this which was formerly fully comprehended that they perform such actsTherefore O monks if you too are reviled abused scolded and insulted by others you should on that account not entertain annoyance nor dejection nor displeasure in your heartsAnd if others respect revere honor and venerate you on that account you should not entertain delight nor joy nor elation in your heartsIf others respect revere honor and venerate you you should think It is towards this which was formerly comprehended that they perform such actsTherefore monks give up whatever is not yoursYour giving it up will for a long time bring you welfare and happinessWhat is it that is not yoursCorporeality is not yoursGive it upYour giving it up will for a long time bring you welfare and happinessFeeling is not yoursGive it upYour giving it up will for a long bring you welfare and happinessPerception is

happinessConsciousness is not yoursGive it upYour giving it up will for a long time bring you welfare and happinessWhat do you think monks if people were to carry away the grass sticks branches and leaves in this Jeta Grove or burnt them or did with them what they pleased would you think These people carry us away or burn us or do with us as they please  No Lord  Why not Because Lord that is neither our self nor the property of our self  So too monks give up what is not yoursYour giving it up will for a long time bring you welfare and happinessWhat is it that is not yoursCorporeality feeling perception mental formations consciousness are not yoursGive them upYour giving them up will for a long time bring you welfare and happinessMonks this Teaching so well proclaimed by me is plain open explicit free of patchworkIn this Teaching that is so well proclaimed by me and is plain open explicit and free of patchwork for those who are arahants free of taints who have accomplished and completed their task have laid down the burden achieved their aim severed the fetters binding to existence who are liberated by full knowledge there is no round of existence that can be ascribed to themMonks in this Teaching that is so well proclaimed by me and is plain open explicit and free of patchwork those monks who have abandoned the five lower fetters will all be reborn spontaneously and there they will pass away finally no more returning from that worldMonks in this Teaching that is so well proclaimed by me and is plain open explicit and free of patchwork those monks who have abandoned three fetters and have reduced greed hatred and delusion are all oncereturners and returning only once to this world will then make an end of sufferingMonks in this Teaching that is so well proclaimed by me and is plain open explicit and free of patchwork those monks who have abandoned three fetters are all streamenterers no more liable to downfall assured and headed for full EnlightenmentMonks in this Teaching that is so well proclaimed by me and is plain open explicit and free of patchwork those monks who are mature in Dhamma mature in faith are all headed for full EnlightenmentMonks in this Teaching that is so well proclaimed by me and is plain open explicit and free of patchwork those who have simply faith in me simply love for me are all destined for heavenThis said the Blessed OneSatisfied the monks rejoiced in the words of the Blessed OneThings called obstructionsComy gives here a list of ideas and actions that obstruct either heavenly rebirth or final deliverance or bothArittha so says Comy being a learned exponent of the Teaching was quite familiar with most of these obstructions but being unfamiliar with the Code of Discipline he conceived the view that sex indulgence was not necessarily an obstruction for a monkArittha is said to have used a rather sophistic argument saying If some of the five sense enjoyments are permissible even for lay adherents who are streamenterers etc why is an exception made as to the visible shape voice touch etc of women According to Comy Arittha goes so far as to charge the Buddha with exaggerating the importance of the first grave offence for a monk saying that the emphasis given to it is like the effort of one who tries to chain the oceanThe similes about sensedesires given in the following section of the discourse seem to support the commentarial reference to sexual intercourseThe similes about sensedesiresOf the ten similes the first seven were explained in detail in the Potaliya SuttaA summary of these explanations follows here and after each of these and also for the remaining three similes and expansion is given of the oneword explanation found in the Comy to our present textBare bones fleshless bloodsmeared are thrown to a starving dog but cannot satisfy the animals hungerSimilarly sensedesires give no lasting satisfactionA lump of flesh for which birds of prey fight each other if the bird that has seized the lump of flesh does not yield it it may meet death or deadly pain from the beaks and claws of the other birdsSimilarly the sensedesires are common to many ie the same sense objects may be claimed by many and may become the cause of deadly conflictA torch of straw carried against the wind may cause severe burns to the careless man if not quickly discardedSimilarly sensedesires will severely burn ie greatly harm him who thoughtlessly and unaware of the great danger partakes of them in the belief that they will bring light and joy to his lifeA pit of burning coals towards which a man is dragged by others if he cannot free himself from the grip he will be thrown into the fire and consumed by itSimilarly sensedesires are like a vast conflagration into which the victim is dragged by bad company or by his own deeds causing his rebirth in miserable states of woeA dream of a beautiful landscape that vanishes on awakeningSimilarly sensedesires are a brief illusion like a dream and disappointing after one awakens from infatuation to realityBorrowed goods on which the borrower foolishly prides himself in public but which are withdrawn by the owners when they see the boastful manSimilarly sensedesires are temporary and not a true and lasting possession of him who enjoys them filled with vain gloryA fruit tree climbed by one who craves for the fruits but another man likewise greedy for them but unable to climb chooses another method and fells the tree and unless the first man quickly descends he will break his limbsSimilarly in the blind pursuit of sense pleasures one may break all ones limbs may suffer severe injury of body and mindThe SubComy refers also to punishment and torture incurred by reckless deeds to which people are driven by sense infatuationA slaughter house because sensedesires are like a butchers blockThis may mean that sensedesires kill much that is noble in man and cut off his higher developmentA stake of swords sensedesires are piercing penetrating deep within causing wounds where there had been noneUnfulfilled or frustrated desire or the pains of jealousy are indeed like that ancient torture of the state of swordsA snakes head sensedesires are a grave risk and peril for the present and future welfare if one walks unwarilyDhammaa na ni jjhaanam khamantiComy The teachings do not become clear do not come into the range so that one cannot discern whether in the respective place of the exposition morality is spoken of or concentration insight the paths the fruits the round of existence or its endingSubComy That is once cannot understand that the purpose of morality is the attaining of concentration the purpose of concentration the winning of insight etcNijjhaana has here the meaning of insight or comprehensionThis phrase appears with the same meaning and in the same context in the Kiitaagiri Sutta and the Cankii Sutta that is likewise preceded by an examination of purpose Also SNconfirms our rendering Yassa khobhikkhave imedhammaa evam paññaaya mattaso nijjhaanam khamanti ayam vuccati dhammaanusaariiThe three ways of studying the teachingComy They the noble sons study the Teaching for the sake of crossingThere are to wit three manners of studying the Teaching studying it in the manner of the Snakesimile studying it for the sake of crossing over and studying in a treasurers positionHe who studies the Buddhas word for getting robes and other requisites or for becoming widely known that is he who learns for the sake of fame and gain his study is that of the Snakesimile but better than such a study would be for him to sleep and not to study at allBut there is one who studies the Buddhas word and when morality is the subject he fulfills morality when concentration is the subject he lets it take deep root when insight is the subject he establishes himself well in insight when the paths and fruitions are the subject he studies with the intention I shall develop the path I shall realize the fruition Only the studying of such a one is studying for the sake of crossing overBut the studying by one who has extinguished the taints is studying in the Treasurers position For him indeed there remains nothing unpenetrated nothing unrelinquished nothing undeveloped and nothing unrealizedHe is one who has penetrated the aggregates of existence who has relinquished the defilements developed the path and realized the fruitionHence in studying the Buddhas Word he studies it as a keeper of the scriptures as a guardian of the tradition as a preserver of the continuityThus his study is like a treasurerNow when those proficient in the books cannot live at one place being afraid of starvation etc if there is one who while himself going the alms round with very great fatigue as an unliberated worlding takes up studies with the thought Lest the exceedingly sweet Buddhaword may perish I shall keep the scriptures shall preserve the continuity and guard the tradition in that case is his study of the Treasurers type or is it not It is notAnd why notBecause his study is not applied to his own situation cross overAn unliberated worldlings study will either be of the type of the Snakesimile or for the sake of crossing over while for the seven who have entered the higher training the study is only for the sake of crossing over for the saint it is only of the Treasurers typeGrounds for false viewsComy By the words There are monks these six grounds for false views the Master wishes to show this He who takes the five aggregates of existence as I and Mine by way of a threefold wrong grasp he flings mud and refuse into my dispensation like this AritthaComy and SubComy False views themselves are grounds for subsequently arising false views like personality belief eternalism etcFurther the grounds are the subjectmatter of the views ie the five aggregates the visual objects etcFinally they are also the conditioning factors of the false views eg ignorance senseimpression perceptions and thoughts unwisely directed attention bad company others speech etcThese with the aggregates as the first are the eight grounds for false views as mentioned in the Patisambhidaa MaggaThe term ditthitthaana also occurs in the Brahmajaala Sutta and in the commentary to itEncountered after having been sought for or not sought for sought encountered or not encountered mentally pursued resorted to by consciousness  what was encountered or not encountered without being sought forThe terms thought encountered etc refer to the fifth aggregate ie consciousness which was not mentioned in the first part of The universe is the Self lit This the world this the selfThat in fact an identification of the two terms is intended here will be shown in the following commentsThe best explanation of the passage is furnished in the Brahmajaala Sutta where a similar phraseology is used There are monks some ascetics and brahmans who are eternalists and who proclaim self and world to be eternal subsequently the theorist is introduced as stating his view in similar terms Eternal are self and world they exist as eternally the sameThe last term appears likewise in our text see NoteFrom this we may safely conclude that it is the identity or unity of the Self with the universe which is conveyed by our textIn the Commentary specific to our text this eternalistic view is rendered and classified in the terminology of the DhammaThe Commentary saysThis statement refers to the view He considers corporeality etc as the self The canonical quotation included here in the Commentary has two implications which are of importance for understanding the reason why it was cited in this contextAs very often in the commentaries the term world is explained as truly referring to the five aggregates singly or in totoThis quotation is the formula for the first of the twenty types of personalitybeliefIn the first five of these twenty the self is said to be identical with each of the five aggregatesHence the application of this quote to our textual passage signifies that the theorist conceives the world as identical with the selfThe double So so  in our text should therefore be taken as standing for yo so lit what is the world that is the selfIn the Comy to MN we find a similar phrase Someone considers corporeality as self what is corporeality that is I what is I that is corporealityThus he considers corporeality and self as nondual According to this interpretation the phrase has been translated here by This universe is the SelfMostly the first five types of personalitybelief are explained as referring to the wrong view of annihilationismBut their being quoted in our context shows that they may also apply to eternalismWe have come to this conclusion since it is improbable that in our textual passage two mutually exclusive views should have been combined in a single statement formulating the sixth ground for false views that is in the first part of that statement annihilationism and in the second eternalismEternally the same an Upanishadic term see BrhadaranyakaUpanisad saasvatiih samaahThis entire statement of the sixth ground for views may well have been the original creed of an eternalistic doctrineThe phrasing appears rather vague in the first part and in general it is rather loosely wordedTo contemporaries however the meaning may have been quite clear since it was perhaps the stock formula for teachings that were well knownHence in this translation we have left the first part of the statement in its rather cryptic and ambiguous original form while giving the interpretations in the notes onlyHe is not anxious about unrealities or about the nonexistingThe verb paritassati has according to Comy the twofold connotation of fear and cravingHence this passage may also be rendered he has no fears nor cravings concerning the nonexistent Comy and SubComy to the Brahmaajala Sutta have a long disquisition about the corresponding noun paritassana occurring also in MN SN SN SN and SNComy By showing herewith the taintfree saint who has no anxiety at the destruction of his own aggregates the Blessed One concludes his expositionAttavaadupaadaanam upadiyethaWhile in most translations the term upaadaana has been rendered by clinging we have followed here a suggestion of the late Bhikkhu anamoli rendering it by assumptionIn this context the word assumption should be understood in the sense of a supposition in the literal sense of its Latin source adsumere to take up which closely parallels the derivation of our Paali term upaaadaana taking up strongly In this sense we have used it when translating the derivative verb upaadiyetha by you may accept Attavaadupaadaana is one of the four types of clinging conditioned by cravingThis term comprises according to Comy the twenty types of personalitybeliefQuoting this passage of our text the VenDrWalpola Rahula remarks If there had been any soultheory which the Buddha had accepted he would certainly have explained it here because he asked the monks to accept that soultheory which did not produce sufferingBut in the Buddhas view there is no such soultheoryDitthinissayam nissayethaNissaya lit support basisComy explains this phrase as the sixtytwo false views headed by personalitybeliefThey form the theoretical or ideological basis or support for the various creeds and speculative doctrines derived from themSubComy The view itself is a support for views because for one with incorrect conceptions the view will serve as a prop for his firm adherence to and the propagation of his ideas Alternative renderings You may well place reliance on a view or may derive conviction from itSee Satipatthaana Sutta where in explanation of anissito the Comy mentions tanhaanissaya and ditthinissaya dependence on craving and viewsThe two supplementary statements in this section suggest the following implications The concepts of I and Mine are inseparably linked so also in philosophical terms are substance and attributeIf there is personalitybelief or selftheory there will be necessarily acquisitiveness or possessiveness in some form or other at least these views themselves will be held with strong tenacity and be regarded as an inalienable propertyThere is no pure abstract self or substance without its determination property or attributeOn the other hand acquisitiveness and possessiveness  even if of a quite unphilosophical character  cannot be without at least a tacit assumption of a proprietary self this applies also to materialistic doctrinesSince in truth and fact neither an abiding property can be established nor an abiding self either of these terms is left without its essential referentHence the conception of individual immortality as formulated in the sixth ground for views is found to be devoid of any basis and is therefore rejected by the Buddha as a fools doctrine being outside of serious considerationComy Here a twofold voidness is shown that of self and of property belonging to a selfThis section appears also in the Anguttara Nikaaya The Fives NoandComy explains the metaphorical expressions as followsThere are two cities one is a city of brigands the other a city of peaceNow to a great warrior of the city of peace the following thought occurs As long as this city of brigands exists we shall never be free from danger So he dons his armor and goes to the city of brigandsWith his sword he breaks the gate pillar together with the door wings he removes the bolt lifts the crossbar fills in the moat and lowers the flagSuch a saint has put down for good the burden of the five aggregates of kammaproducing volitions and of the defilements has fully liberated himself from the round of existenceComy Formerly that is when still in the environ of the Bodhi tree before turning the Wheel of the Dhamma and also from the time of turning the Wheel when teaching Dhamma it was only the Four Truths that I proclaimed In our sentence the term suffering includes also its roots the origination and the term cessation also the path that leads to the cessationSubComy There is no teaching of the Master that is unrelated to the Four TruthsBy saying What I teach now as before is suffering and the cessation of suffering the Blessed One indicates this Never do I teach a self that is annihilated or destroyed nor do I teach that there is any kind of selfFree of patchwork lit devoid of the nature of a patched clothComy Pilotika is a torn rag cloth patched up with stitches and knots which are similar to hypocrisy and other deceptionsSubComy substituting assumed attitudes for an actually in that individual nonexisting practice of meditation and insightPilotika means also refuse referring to false and unworthy monks who do not have any footing in the Buddhas dispensationThis phrase chinnapilotika seems however to point to the inner consistency of the Teaching which like a new cloth is of one piece and is not in need of patching up contradictions by artificial attempts of reconciling inconsistenciesHence the term may freely be rendered by the single word consistentThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living at Vesali in the grove outside the city to the westNow on that occasion Sunakkhatta son of the Licchavis had recently left this Dhamma and DisciplineHe was making this statement before the Vesali assembly The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesThe recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him and when he teaches the Dhamma to anyone it leads him when he practices it to the complete destruction of sufferingThen when it was morning the Venerable Sariputta dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Vesali for almsThen he heard Sunakkhatta son of the Licchavis making this statement before the Vesali assemblyWhen he had wandered for alms in Vesali and had returned from his almsround after his meal he went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one side and told the Blessed One what Sunakkhatta was sayingSariputta the misguided man Sunakkhatta is angry and his words are spoken out of angerThinking to discredit the Tathagata he actually praises him for it is a praise of the Tathagata to say of him When he teaches the Dhamma to anyone it leads him when he practices it to the complete destruction of sufferingSariputta this misguided man Sunakkhatta will never infer of me according to Dhamma That Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessedAnd he will never infer of me according to Dhamma That Blessed One enjoys the various kinds of supernormal power having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one he appears and vanishes he goes unhindered through a wall through an enclosure through a mountain as though through space he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water he walks on water without sinking as though it were earth seated crosslegged he travels in space like a bird with his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so powerful and mighty he wields bodily mastery even as far as the BrahmaworldAnd he will never infer of me according to Dhamma With the divine ear element which is purified and surpasses the human that Blessed One hears both kinds of sounds the heavenly and the human those that are far as well as nearAnd he will never infer of me according to Dhamma That Blessed One encompasses with his own mind the minds of other beings other personsHe understands a mind affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust he understands a mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate he understands a mind affected by delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion he understands a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted he understands an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted he understands a surpassed mind as surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed he understands a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated he understands a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberatedSariputta the Tathagata has these ten Tathagatas powers possessing which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of BrahmaWhat are the tenHere the Tathagata understands as it actually is the possible as possible and the impossible as impossibleAnd that is a Tathagatas power that the Tathagata has by virtue of which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of BrahmaAgain the Tathagata understands as it actually is the results of actions undertaken past future and present with possibilities and with causesThat too is a Tathagatas powerAgain the Tathagata understands as it actually is the ways leading to all destinationsThat too is a Tathagatas powerAgain the Tathagata understands as it actually is the world with its many and different elementsThat too is a Tathagatas powerAgain the Tathagata understands as it actually is how beings have different inclinationsThat too is a Tathagatas powerAgain the Tathagata understands as it actually is the disposition of the faculties of other beings other personsThat too is a Tathagatas powerAgain the Tathagata understands as it actually is the defilement the cleansing and the emergence in regard to the jhanas liberations concentrations and attainmentsThat too is a Tathagatas powerAgain the Tathagata recollects his manifold past lives that is one birth two births three births four births five births ten births twenty births thirty births forty births fifty births a hundred births a thousand births a hundred thousand births many aeons of worldcontraction many aeons of worldexpansion many aeons of worldcontraction and expansion There I was so named of such a clan with such an appearance such was my nutriment such my experience of pleasure and pain such my lifeterm and passing away from there I reappeared elsewhere and there too I was so named of such a clan with such an appearance such was my nutriment such my experience of pleasure and pain such my lifeterm and passing away from there I reappeared here Thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past livesThat too is a Tathagatas powerAgain with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human the Tathagata sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and he understands how beings pass on according to their actions thus These worthy beings who were illconducted in body speech and mind revilers of noble ones wrong in their views giving effect to wrong view in their actions on the dissolution of the body after death have reappeared in a state of deprivation in a bad destination in perdition even in hell but these worthy beings who were wellconducted in body speech and mind not revilers of noble ones right in their views giving effect to right view in their actions on the dissolution of the body after death have reappeared in a good destination even in the heavenly world Thus with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human he sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and he understands how beings pass on according to their actionsThat too is a Tathagatas powerAgain by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge the Tathagata here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taintsThat too is a Tathagatas power that a Tathagata has by virtue of which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of BrahmaThe Tathagata has these ten Tathagatas powers possessing which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of BrahmaSariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of me The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesThe recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him  unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as carried off and put there he will wind up in hellJust as a bhikkhu possessed of virtue concentration and wisdom would here and now enjoy final knowledge so it will happen in this case I say that unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as carried off and put there he will wind up in hellSariputta the Tathagata has these four kinds of intrepidity possessing which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of BrahmaWhat are the fourHere I see no ground on which any recluse or brahman or god or Mara or Brahma or anyone at all in the world could in accordance with the Dhamma accuse me thus While you claim full enlightenment you are not fully enlightened in regard to certain things And seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidityI see no ground on which any recluse or anyone at all could accuse me thus While you claim to have destroyed the taints these taints are undestroyed by you And seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidityI see no ground on which any recluse or anyone at all could accuse me thus Those things called obstructions by you are not able to obstruct one who engages in them And seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidityI see no ground on which any recluse or anyone at all could accuse me thus When you teach the Dhamma to someone it does not lead him when he practices it to the complete destruction of suffering And seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidityA Tathagata has these four kinds of intrepidity possessing which he claims the herdleaders place roars his lions roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of BrahmaSariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of me he will wind up in hellSariputta there are these eight assembliesWhat are the eightAn assembly of nobles an assembly of brahmans an assembly of householders an assembly of recluses an assembly of gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings an assembly of gods of the heaven of the Thirtythree an assembly of Maras retinue an assembly of BrahmasPossessing these four kinds of intrepidity the Tathagata approaches and enters these eight assembliesI recall having approached many hundred assemblies of nobles many hundred assemblies of brahmans many hundred assemblies of householders many hundred assemblies of recluses many hundred assemblies of gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings many hundred assemblies of gods of the heaven of the Thirtythree many hundred assemblies of Maras retinue many hundred assemblies of BrahmasAnd formerly I had sat with them there and talked with them and held conversations with them yet I see no ground for thinking that fear or timidity might come upon me thereAnd seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepiditySariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of me he will wind up in hellSariputta there are these four kinds of generationWhat are the fourEggborn generation wombborn generation moistureborn generation and spontaneous generationWhat is eggborn generationThere are these beings born by breaking out of the shell of an egg this is called eggborn generationWhat is wombborn generationThere are these beings born by breaking out from the caul this is called wombborn generationWhat is moistureborn generationThere are these beings born in a rotten fish in a rotten corpse in rotten dough in a cesspit or in a sewer this is called moistureborn generationWhat is spontaneous generationThere are gods and denizens of hell and certain human beings and some beings in the lower worlds this is called spontaneous generationThese are the four kinds of generationSariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of me he will wind up in hellSariputta there are these five destinationsWhat are the fiveHell the animal realm the realm of ghosts human beings and godsI understand hell and the path and way leading to hellAnd I also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hellI understand the animal realm and the path and way leading to the animal realmAnd I also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in the animal realmI understand the realm of ghosts and the path and way leading to the realm of ghostsAnd I also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in the realm of ghostsI understand human beings and the path and way leading to the human worldAnd I also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear among human beingsI understand the gods and the path and way leading to the world of the godsAnd I also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly worldI understand Nibbana and the path and way leading to NibbanaAnd I also understand how one who has entered this path will by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taintsBy encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell And then later on with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human I see that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell and is experiencing extremely painful racking piercing feelingsSuppose there were a charcoal pit deeper than a mans height full of glowing coals without flame or smoke and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same charcoal pitThen a man with good sight on seeing him would say This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that he will come to this same charcoal pit and then later on he sees that he has fallen into that charcoal pit and is experiencing extremely painful racking piercing feelingsSo too by encompassing mind with mind piercing feelingsBy encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in the animal realm And then later on with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human I see that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in the animal realm and is experiencing painful racking piercing feelingsSuppose there were a cesspit deeper than a mans height full of filth and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same cesspitThen a man with good sight on seeing him would say This person so behaves that he will come to this same cesspit and then later on he sees that he has fallen into that cesspit and is experiencing painful racking piercing feelingsSo too by encompassing mind with mind piercing feelingsBy encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in the realm of ghosts And then later on I see that he has reappeared in the realm of ghosts and is experiencing much painful feelingSuppose there were a tree growing on uneven ground with scanty foliage casting a dappled shade and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same treeThen a man with good sight on seeing him would say This person so behaves that he will come to this same tree and then later on he sees that he is sitting or lying in the shade of that tree experiencing much painful feelingSo too by encompassing mind with mind much painful feelingBy encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear among human beings And then later on I see that he has reappeared among human beings and is experiencing much pleasant feelingSuppose there were a tree growing on even ground with thick foliage casting a deep shade and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same treeThen a man with good sight on seeing him would say This person so behaves that he will come to this same tree and then later on he sees that he is sitting or lying in the shade of that tree experiencing much pleasant feelingSo too by encompassing mind with mind much pleasant feeling By encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly world And then later on I see that he has reappeared in a happy destination in the heavenly world and is experiencing extremely pleasant feelingsSuppose there were a mansion and it had an upper chamber plastered within and without shut off secured by bars with shuttered windows and in it there was a couch spread with rugs blankets and sheets with a deerskin coverlet with a canopy as well as crimson pillows for both and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same mansionThen a man with good sight on seeing him would say This person so behaves that he will come to this same mansion and later on he sees that he is sitting or lying in that upper chamber in that mansion experiencing extremely pleasant feelingsSo too by encompassing mind with mind extremely pleasant feelingsBy encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge he here and now will enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and

deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints and is experiencing extremely pleasant feelingsSuppose there were a pond with clean agreeable cool water transparent with smooth banks delightful and nearby a dense wood and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed towards that same pondThen a man with good sight on seeing him would say This person so behaves that he will come to this same pond and then later on he sees that he has plunged into the pond bathed drunk and relieved all his distress fatigue and fever and has come out again and is sitting or lying in the wood experiencing extremely pleasant feelingsSo too by encompassing mind with mind extremely pleasant feelingsThese are the five destinationsSariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of me The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesThe recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him  unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as carried off and put there he will wind up in hellJust as a bhikkhu possessed of virtue concentration and wisdom would here and now enjoy final knowledge so it will happen in this case I say that unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as carried off and put there he will wind up in hellSariputta I recall having lived a holy life possessing four factorsI have practiced asceticism  the extreme of asceticism I have practiced coarseness  the extreme of coarseness I have practiced scrupulousness  the extreme of scrupulousness I have practiced seclusion  the extreme of seclusionSuch was my asceticism Sariputta that I went naked rejecting conventions licking my hands not coming when asked not stopping when asked I did not accept food brought or food specially made or an invitation to a meal I received nothing from a pot from a bowl across a threshold across a stick across a pestle from two eating together from a pregnant woman from a woman giving suck from a woman lying with a man from where food was advertised to be distributed from where a dog was waiting from where flies were buzzing I accepted no fish or meat I drank no liquor wine or fermented brewI kept to one house to one morsel I kept to two houses to two morsels I kept to seven houses to seven morselsI lived on one saucerful a day on two saucerfuls a day on seven saucerfuls a day I took food once a day once every two days once every seven days and so on up to once every fortnight I dwelt pursuing the practice of taking food at stated intervalsI was an eater of greens or millet or wild rice or hideparings or moss or ricebran or ricescum or sesamum flour or grass or cowdungI lived on forest roots and fruits I fed on fallen fruitsI clothed myself in hemp in hempmixed cloth in shrouds in refuse rags in tree bark in antelope hide in strips of antelope hide in kusagrass fabric in bark fabric in woodshavings fabric in headhair wool in animal wool in owls wingsI was one who pulled out hair and beard pursuing the practice of pulling out hair and beardI was one who stood continuously rejecting seatsI was one who squatted continuously devoted to maintaining the squatting positionI was one who used a mattress of spikes I made a mattress of spikes my bedI dwelt pursuing the practice of bathing in water three times daily including the eveningThus in such a variety of ways I dwelt pursuing the practice of tormenting and mortifying the bodySuch was my asceticismSuch was my coarseness Sariputta that just as the bole of a tinduka tree accumulating over the years cakes and flakes off so too dust and dirt accumulating over the years caked off my body and flaked offIt never occurred to me Oh let me rub this dust and dirt off with my hand or let another rub this dust and dirt off with his hand  it never occurred to me thusSuch was my coarsenessSuch was my scrupulousness Sariputta that I was always mindful in stepping forwards and stepping backwardsI was full of pity even for a drop of water thus Let me not hurt the tiny creatures in the crevices of the ground Such was my scrupulousnessSuch was my seclusion Sariputta that I would plunge into some forest and dwell thereAnd when I saw a cowherd or a shepherd or someone gathering grass or sticks or a woodsman I would flee from grove to grove from thicket to thicket from hollow to hollow from hillock to hillockWhy was thatSo that they should not see me or I see themJust as a forestbred deer on seeing human beings flees from grove to grove from thicket to thicket from hollow to hollow from hillock to hillock so too when I saw a cowherd or a shepherd Such was my seclusionI would go on all fours to the cowpens when the cattle had gone out and the cowherd had left them and I would feed on the dung of the young suckling calvesAs long as my own excrement and urine lasted I fed on my own excrement and urineSuch was my great distortion in feedingI would plunge into some aweinspiring grove and dwell there  a grove so aweinspiring that normally it would make a mans hair stand up if he were not free from lustWhen those cold wintry nights came during the eightdays interval of frost I would dwell by night in the open and by day in the groveIn the last month of the hot season I would dwell by day in the open and by night in the groveAnd there came to me spontaneously this stanza never heard beforeI would make my bed in a charnel ground with the bones of the dead for a pillowAnd cowherd boys came up and spat on me urinated on me threw dirt at me and poked sticks into my earsYet I do not recall that I ever aroused an evil mind against themSuch was my abiding in equanimitySariputta there are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through food They say Let us live on kolafruits and they eat kolafruits they eat kolafruit powder they drink kolafruit water and they make many kinds of kolafruit concoctionsNow I recall having eaten a single kolafruit a daySariputta you may think that the kolafruit was bigger at that time yet you should not regard it so the kolafruit was then at most the same size as nowThrough feeding on a single kolafruit a day my body reached a state of extreme emaciationBecause of eating so little my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stemsBecause of eating so little my backside became like a camels hoofBecause of eating so little the projections on my spine stood forth like corded beadsBecause of eating so little my ribs jutted out as gaunt as the crazy rafters of an old roofless barnBecause of eating so little the gleam of my eyes sank far down in their sockets looking like a gleam of water which has sunk far down in a deep wellBecause of eating so little my scalp shriveled and withered as a green bitter gourd shrivels and withers in the wind and sunBecause of eating so little my belly skin adhered to my backbone thus if I touched my belly skin I encountered my backbone and if I touched my backbone I encountered my belly skinBecause of eating so little if I tried to ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands the hair rotted at its roots fell from my body as I rubbedSariputta there are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through food They say Let us live on beans Let us live on sesamum Let us live on rice and they eat rice they eat rice powder they drink rice water and they make various kinds of rice concoctionsNow I recall having eaten a single rice grain a daySariputta you may think that the rice grain was bigger at that time yet you should not regard it so the rice grain was then at most the same size as nowThrough feeding on a single rice grain a day my body reached a state of extreme emaciationBecause of eating so little the hair rotted at its roots fell from my body as I rubbedYet Sariputta by such conduct by such practice by such performance of austerities I did not attain any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesWhy was thatBecause I did not attain that noble wisdom which when attained is noble and emancipating and leads the one who practices in accordance with it to the complete destruction of sufferingSariputta there are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through the round of rebirths But it is impossible to find a realm in the round that I have not already passed through in this long journey except for the gods of the Pure Abodes and had I passed through the round as a god in the Pure Abodes I would never have returned to this worldThere are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through rebirth But it is impossible to find a kind of rebirth that I have not been reborn in already in this long journey except for the gods of the Pure AbodesThere are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through abode But it is impossible to find a kind of abode that I have not already dwelt in except for the gods of the Pure AbodesThere are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through sacrifice But it is impossible to find a kind of sacrifice that has not already been offered up by me in this long journey when I was either a headanointed noble king or a welltodobrahmanThere are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this Purification comes about through fireworship But it is impossible to find a kind of fire that has not already been worshipped by me in this long journey when I was either a headanointed noble king or a welltodo brahmanSariputta there are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this As long as this good man is still young a blackhaired young man endowed with the blessing of youth in the prime of life so long is he perfect in his lucid wisdomBut when this good man is old aged burdened with years advanced in life and come to the last stage being eighty ninety or a hundred years old then the lucidity of his wisdom is lost But it should not be regarded soI am now old aged burdened with years advanced in life and come to the last stage my years have turned eightyNow suppose that I had four disciples with a hundred years lifespan perfect in mindfulness retentiveness memory and lucidity of wisdomJust as a skilled archer trained practiced and tested could easily shoot a light arrow across the shadow of a palm tree suppose that they were even to that extent perfect in mindfulness retentiveness memory and lucidity of wisdomSuppose that they continuously asked me about the four foundations of mindfulness and that I answered them when asked and that they remembered each answer of mine and never asked a subsidiary question or paused except to eat drink consume food taste urinate defecate and rest in order to remove sleepiness and tirednessStill the Tathagatas exposition of the Dhamma his explanations of factors of the Dhamma and his replies to questions would not yet come to an end but meanwhile those four disciples of mine with their hundred years lifespan would have died at the end of those hundred yearsSariputta even if you have to carry me about on a bed still there will be no change in the lucidity of the Tathagatas wisdomRightly speaking were it to be said of anyone A being not subject to delusion has appeared in the world for the welfare and happiness of many out of compassion for the world for the good welfare and happiness of gods and humans it is of me indeed that rightly speaking this should be saidNow on that occasion the Venerable Nagasamala was standing behind the Blessed One fanning himThen he said to the Blessed One It is wonderful venerable sir it is marvelousAs I listened to this discourse on the Dhamma the hairs of my body stood upVenerable sir what is the name of this discourse on the DhammaAs to that Nagasamala you may remember this discourse on the Dhamma as The Hairraising Discourse That is what the Blessed One saidThe Venerable Nagasamala was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThe numbers enclosed in square brackets in the above text are page numbers of the Pali Text Society edition of the Pali textVbhSection explains this knowledge with reference to MN as the Buddhas knowledge of what is possible and what is impossible eg it is impossible that a person possessed of right view should regard any formations as permanent or as pleasurable or anything whatever as self while it is possible that a worldling will regard things in such an erroneous wayIt is impossible for a person possessed of right view to commit the five heinous crimes while it is possible for a worldling to commit such crimes etcetcThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThere he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus  Venerable sir they repliedThe Blessed One said thisBhikkhus only here is there a recluse only here a second recluse only here a third recluse only here a fourth recluseThe doctrines of others are devoid of recluses that is how you should rightly roar your lions roarIt is possible bhikkhus that wanderers of other sects might ask But on the strength of what or with the support of what do the venerable ones say thus Wanderers of other sects who ask thus may be answered in this way Friends four things have been declared to us by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened on seeing these in ourselves we say thus Only here is there a recluse only here a second recluse only here a third recluse only here a fourth recluseThe doctrines of others are devoid of recluses What are the fourWe have confidence in the Teacher we have confidence in the Dhamma we have fulfilled the precepts and our companions in the Dhamma are dear and agreeable to us whether they are layfolk or those gone forthThese are the four things declared to us by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened on seeing which in ourselves we say as we doIt is possible bhikkhus that wanderers of other sects might say thus Friends we too have confidence in the Teacher that is in our Teacher we too have confidence in the Dhamma that is in our Dhamma we too have fulfilled the precepts that is our precepts our companions in the Dhamma are dear and agreeable to us too whether they are layfolk or those gone forthWhat is the distinction here friends what is the variance what is the difference between you and usWanderers of other sects who ask thus may be answered in this way How then friends is the goal one or many Answering rightly the wanderers of other sects would answer thus Friends the goal is one not many  But friends is that goal for one affected by lust or free from lust Answering rightly the wanderers of other sects would answer thus Friends that goal is for one free from lust not for one affected by lust  But friends is that goal for one affected by hate or free from hate Answering rightly they would answer Friends that goal is for one free from hate not for one affected by hate  But friends is that goal for one affected by delusion or free from delusion Answering rightly they would answer Friends that goal is for one free from delusion not for one affected by delusion  But friends is that goal for one affected by craving or free from craving Answering rightly they would answer Friends that goal is for one free from craving not for one affected by craving  But friends is that goal for one affected by clinging or free from clinging Answering rightly they would answer Friends that goal is for one free from clinging not for one affected by clinging  But friends is that goal for one who has vision or for one without vision Answering rightly they would answer Friends that goal is for one with vision not for one without vision  But friends is that goal for one who favors and opposes or for one who does not favor and oppose Answering rightly they

proliferationBhikkhus there are these two views the view of being and the view of nonbeingAny recluses or brahmans who rely on the view of being adopt the view of being accept the view of being are opposed to the view of nonbeingAny recluses or brahmans who rely on the view of nonbeing adopt the view of nonbeing accept the view of nonbeing are opposed to the view of beingAny recluses or brahmans who do not understand as they actually are the origin the disappearance the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of these two views are affected by lust affected by hate affected by delusion affected by craving affected by clinging without vision given to favoring and opposing and they delight in and enjoy proliferationThey are not freed from birth aging and death from sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair they are not freed from suffering I sayAny recluses or brahmans who understand as they actually are the origin the disappearance the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of these two views are without lust without hate without delusion without craving without clinging with vision not given to favoring and opposing and they do not delight in and enjoy proliferationThey are freed from birth aging and death from sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair they are freed from suffering I sayBhikkhus there are these four kinds of clingingWhat fourClinging to sensual pleasures clinging to views clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of selfThough certain recluses and brahmans claim to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging they do not completely describe the full understanding of all kinds of clingingThey describe the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures without describing the full understanding of clinging to views clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of selfWhy is thatThose good recluses and brahmans do not understand these three instances of clinging as they actually areTherefore though they claim to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging they describe only the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures without describing the full understanding of clinging to views clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of selfThough certain recluses and brahmans claim to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging they describe the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures and clinging to views without describing the full understanding of clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of selfWhy is thatThey do not understand two instances therefore they describe only the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures and clinging to views without describing the full understanding of clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of selfThough certain recluses and brahmans claim to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging they describe the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures clinging to views and clinging to rules and observances without describing the full understanding of clinging to a doctrine of selfThey do not understand one instance therefore they describe only the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures clinging to views and clinging to rules and observances without describing the full understanding of clinging to a doctrine of selfBhikkhus in such a Dhamma and Discipline as that it is plain that confidence in the Teacher is not rightly directed that confidence in the Dhamma is not rightly directed that fulfillment of the precepts is not rightly directed and that the affection among companions in the Dhamma is not rightly directedWhy is thatBecause that is how it is when the Dhamma and Discipline is badly proclaimed and badly expounded unemancipating unconducive to peace expounded by one who is not fully enlightenedBhikkhus when a Tathagata accomplished and fully enlightened claims to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging he completely describes the full understanding of all kinds of clinging he describes the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures clinging to views clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of selfBhikkhus in such a Dhamma and Discipline as that it is plain that confidence in the Teacher is rightly directed that confidence in the Dhamma is rightly directed that fulfillment of the precepts is rightly directed and that the affection among companions in the Dhamma is rightly directedWhy is thatBecause that is how it is when the Dhamma and Discipline is well proclaimed and well expounded emancipating conducive to peace expounded by one who is fully enlightenedNow these four kinds of clinging have what as their source what as their origin from what are they born and producedThese four kinds of clinging have craving as their source craving as their origin they are born and produced from cravingCraving has what as its sourceCraving has feeling as its source Feeling has what as its sourceFeeling has contact as its source Contact has what as its sourceContact has the sixfold base as its source The sixfold base has what as its sourceThe sixfold base has mentalitymateriality as its source Mentalitymateriality has what as its sourceMentalitymateriality has consciousness as its source Consciousness has what as its sourceConsciousness has formations as its source Formations have what as their sourceFormations have ignorance as their source ignorance as their origin they are born and produced from ignoranceBhikkhus when ignorance is abandoned and true knowledge has arisen in a bhikkhu then with the fading away of ignorance and the arising of true knowledge he no longer clings to sensual pleasures no longer clings to views no longer clings to rules and observances no longer clings to a doctrine of selfWhen he does not cling he is not agitatedWhen he is not agitated he personally attains NibbanaHe understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being That is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThe numbers enclosed in square brackets in the above text are page numbers of the Pali Text Society edition of the Pali textThus have I heardAt one time the Blessed One was living in the Kurus at Kammasadamma a markettown of the Kuru peopleThen the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus as follows This is the only way O bhikkhus for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation for the destruction of suffering and grief for reaching the right path for the attainment of Nibbana namely the Four Arousings of MindfulnessWhat are the fourHere bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives contemplating the body in the body ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome

contents of stomach intestines mesentery feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat solid fat tars fat dissolved saliva mucus synovic fluid urineJust as if O bhikkhus there were a bag having two openings full

highest knowledge here and now or if some remainder of clinging is yet present the state of nonreturningO monks let alone seven yearsShould any person practice these four foundations of mindfulness in this manner for six years five years four years three years two years one year then one of these two fruits may be expected by him highest knowledge here and now or if some remainder of clinging is yet present the state of nonreturningO monks let alone a yearShould any person practice these four foundations of mindfulness in this manner for seven months six months five months four months three months two months a month half a month then one of these two fruits may be expected by him highest knowledge here and now or if some remainder of clinging is yet present the state of nonreturningO monks let alone half a monthShould any person practice these four foundations of mindfulness in this manner for a week then one of these two fruits may be expected by him highest knowledge here and now or if some remainder of clinging is yet present the state of nonreturningBecause of this it was said This is the only way monks for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation for the destruction of suffering and grief for reaching the right path for the attainment of Nibbana namely the four foundations of mindfulnessThus spoke the Blessed OneSatisfied the monks approved of his wordsRight view is normally explained in terms of the four noble truthsIn this discourse VenSariputta expands the discussion in several directionsHe begins by focusing on two concepts that underlie the structure of the four noble truths the dichotomy of skillful and unskillful action and the concept of nutrimentFocusing on the dichotomy of skillful and unskillful action draws attention to a general principle of cause and effect  the fact that actions give results  and to the particular role of action in determining ones experience of pleasure and pain Unskillful actions lead to pain skillful actions to pleasureThe search for the root of skillful and unskillful actions leads ultimately to the mind because the presence or lack of skill in any action is determined by the mental state motivating itThus the issue of skillful and unskillful action provides in a nutshell some of the basic principles of the four noble truths in terms of causality wise and unwise uses of causality and the dominant role of the mind in the causal chain leading to happiness or painThe image of root carries further implicationsBecause the function of roots is to draw nourishment from the soil the natural question is Where do the roots of skillful and unskillful behavior draw their nourishmentThis is why the next topic in the sutta is nutriment which is of two sorts physical and mentalAnd implicit in the idea of nutriment is the possibility for a strategy to use nutriment skillfully If the mental state being nourished is unskillful it can be overcome by depriving it of nutriment if its skillful it can be fostered by feeding it moreThis points to the possibility of training the mind through a strategy of selective feeding and starving while the analysis of mental nutriment shows precisely which events are most basic in the mental food chain contact intellectual intention and consciousnessVenSariputta combines the issues of skillfulness and nutriment by approaching the topic of nutriment with a fourfold framework nutriment its origination its cessation and the path of practice leading to its cessationThis line of thinking leads naturally to the next topic in which this same framework is applied to the focal issue of the Buddhas teaching  suffering and stress  yielding the four noble truthsIn this way VenSariputta shows how the four noble truths derive from the two topics of skillfulunskillful and nutrimentIts interesting to note that both these topics figure prominently in discourses directed at young peopleThe Buddhas instruction to Rahula in MN focuses on skillful and unskillful behavior the first of the Novices Questions on nutrimentSeeing how basic these concepts are to understanding the role of causality in putting an end to suffering the Buddha taught them to young people as an entry into the DhammaIn this sutta VenSariputta shows how these topics can perform the same function for adultsAnd perhaps he is also showing us the line of reasoning through which his own first glimpse of the deathless followed upon a simple statement of a causal principleThe remainder of this sutta expands on the four noble truths with a reverseorder analysis of dependent coarisingTwo features of this section stand outTo begin with VenSariputta points out that understanding the relationship between any two adjacent factors in the pattern of dependent coarising provides enough discernment to abandon unskillful obsessions and put an end to sufferingThere is no need to comprehend the entire pattern for the whole is implicit in each paired relationshipThis is a point with important practical implicationsSnmakes the same point but pairs the objects for contemplation in a different way Every factor in dependent coarising is paired directly with stressA comparison between these two suttas provides much practical food for thought showing how the ability to see and comprehend dualities is essential to the Buddhas strategy for discernment and releaseSecond VenSariputta here continues the pattern of dependent coarising past ignorance  the usual endpoint  to look for its origination which is mental fermentationBecause these fermentations in turn depend on ignorance the discussion shows how ignorance tends to prompt more ignoranceBut as VenSariputta has demonstrated throughout his discussion ignorance neednt keep propagating foreverBecause it is simply a lack of knowledge in terms of the four noble truths it can be replaced by knowledge that does look at things in terms of the four noble truths  the framework derived from the topics of skillfulunskillful and nutrimentWhen knowledge in terms of this framework is applied at any point in the causal framework the entire framework dependent on ignorance can be brought to an endIn this way VenSariputta fills in a blank contained in the stock Canonical description of AwakeningThe central part of that description states He discerns as it has come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are mental fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations This description however does not explain these last four insights into mental fermentation nor does it explain how they relate to the four insights into stressIn the last section of this discourse VenSariputta explains the first of these issues while in the overall structure of the discourse he explains the secondVenSariputta offers further explanations of right view in two other suttas in the Majjhima NikayaIn MN he offers a wordbyword analysis of the four noble truthsIn MN he analyzes the first noble truth  in particular the form clingingaggregate  showing how the comprehension of that one aggregate encompasses the comprehension of all five aggregates all four noble truths and the principle of dependent coarisingI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen VenSariputta addressed the monks FriendsYes friend the monks respondedVenSariputta said Right view right view it is saidTo what extent is a disciple of the noble ones a person of right view one whose view is made straight who is endowed with verified confidence in the Dhamma and who has arrived at this true DhammaWe would come from a long distance friend to learn the meaning of these words in VenSariputtas presenceIt would be good if VenSariputta himself would enlighten us as to their meaningHaving listened to him the monks will bear it in mindThen in that case friends listen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say friend the monks respondedVenSariputta said When a disciple of the noble ones discerns what is unskillful discerns the root of what is unskillful discerns what is skillful and discerns the root of what is skillful it is to that extent that he is a person of right view one whose view is made straight who is endowed with verified confidence in the Dhamma and who has arrived at this true DhammaNow

Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One I say Master GotamaWe brahmans perform sacrifices and get others to perform sacrificesAnd whoever performs a sacrifice whoever gets others to perform a sacrifice they have all practiced a practice of merit  the business of a sacrifice  countless beingsBut whoever leaving his family has gone forth from the home life into homelessness and tames his single self brings his single self into tune brings his single self to Unbinding his practice of merit  this business of going forth  is one only one beingVery well then brahman in that case I will crossquestion youAnswer as you see fitWhat do you thinkThere is the case where a Tathagata appears in the world a worthy one rightlyselfawakened consummate in clearknowing  conduct one who has gone the good way knower of the cosmos unexcelled trainer of those who can be taught teacher of human  divine beings awakened blessedHe says HereThis is the path this is the practice that having practiced I make known the unexcelled coming ashore in the holy life having directly known  realized it for myselfComeYou too practice in such a way that you will remain in the unexcelled coming ashore in the holy life having directly known  realized it for yourselves Thus the Teacher teaches the Dhamma and others practice for SuchnessAnd there are countless hundreds of them countless thousands of them countless hundreds of thousands of themThis being the case is this practice of merit  this business of goingforth  one that benefits countless beings or only one beingThis being the case Master Gotama this practice of merit  this business of goingforth  is one that benefits countless beingsWhen this was said VenAnanda said to the brahman Sangarava Of these two practices brahman which appeals to you as the less complicated the less violent the more fruitful  the more rewardingWhen this was said the brahman Sangarava said to VenAnanda Just as with Master Gotama  Master Ananda I worship them I praise themA second time VenAnanda said to him I didnt ask you whom you worship and whom you praiseI ask you Of these two practices brahman which appeals to you as the less complicated the less violent the more fruitful  the more rewarding A second time the brahman Sangarava said to VenAnanda Just as with Master Gotama  Master Ananda I worship them I praise themA third time VenAnanda said to him I didnt ask you whom you worship and whom you praiseI ask you Of these two practices brahman which appeals to you as the less complicated the less violent the more fruitful  the more rewarding A third time the brahman Sangarava said to VenAnanda Just as with Master Gotama  Master Ananda I worship them I praise themThen the thought occurred to the Blessed One Being asked a legitimate question by Ananda up to the third time the brahman Sangarava evades it and does not reply to itSuppose I were to get him outSo the Blessed One said to the brahman Sangarava Brahman what was the topic of conversation that arose today when the royal court sat gathered in the royal palaceMaster Gotama this was the topic of conversation that arose today when the royal court sat gathered in the royal palace In the past there were fewer monks but more who endowed with superior human attainments displayed the miracle of psychic powerNow there are more monks but fewer who endowed with superior human attainments display the miracle of psychic powerThis Master Gotama was the topic of conversation that arose today when the royal court sat gathered in the royal palaceBrahman there are these three miraclesWhich threeThe miracle of psychic power the miracle of telepathy  the miracle of instructionAnd what is the miracle of psychic powerThere is the case where a certain person wields manifold psychic powersHaving been one he becomes many having been many he becomes oneHe appearsHe vanishesHe goes unimpeded through walls ramparts  mountains as if through spaceHe dives in and out of the earth as if it were waterHe walks on water without sinking as if it were dry landSitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged birdWith his hand he touches and strokes even the sun  moon so mighty  powerfulHe exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worldsThis is called the miracle of psychic powerAnd what is the miracle of telepathyThere is the case where a certain person reads by means of a sign Such is your thinking here is where your thinking is thus is your mind And however much he may read thats exactly how it is and not otherwiseThen there is the case where a certain person reads not by means of a sign or vision but by hearing the voice of human beings nonhuman beings or devas Such is your thinking here is where your thinking is thus is your mind And however much he may read thats exactly how it is and not otherwiseThen there is the case where a certain person reads not by means of a sign or vision not by hearing the voice of human beings nonhuman beings or devas but by hearing the sound of the directed thought  evaluation of a person thinking directed thoughts and evaluating Such is your thinking here is where your thinking is thus is your mind And however much he may read thats exactly how it is and not otherwiseThen there is the case where a certain person reads not by means of a sign or vision not by hearing the voice of human beings nonhuman beings or devas not by hearing the sound of the directed thought  evaluation of a person thinking directed thoughts and evaluating but by having attained a concentration devoid of directed thought  evaluation and encompassing the awareness with his own awareness he discerns Given the way the mental fabrications of this venerable person are inclined the directed thoughts of his mind will immediately think about this And however much he may read thats exactly how it is and not otherwiseThis brahman is the miracle of telepathyAnd what is the miracle of instructionThere is the case where a certain person gives instruction in this way Direct your thought in this way dont direct it in thatAttend to things in this way dont attend to them in thatLet go of this enter and remain in that This is called the miracle of instructionAnd these are the three miraclesNow brahman of these three miracles which one appeals to you as the highest  most sublimeMaster Gotama of these three miracles the miracle of psychic power where a certain person wields manifold psychic powers exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds that is a miracle experienced only by him who does it it belongs only to him who does itIt seems to me to be of the nature of an illusionAs for the miracle where a certain person by means of a sign or vision by hearing the voice of human beings nonhuman beings or devas by hearing the sound of the directed thought  evaluation of a person thinking directed thoughts and evaluating Such is your thinking here is where your thinking is thus is your mind who by having attained a concentration devoid of directed thought  evaluation and encompassing the awareness with his own awareness he discerns Given the way the mental fabrications of this venerable person are inclined the directed thoughts of his mind will immediately think about this And however much he may read thats exactly how it is and not otherwise that is a miracle experienced only by him who does it it belongs only to him who does itIt seems to me to be of the nature of an illusionAs for the miracle where a certain person gives instruction in this way Direct your thought in this way dont direct it in thatAttend to things in this way dont attend to them in thatLet go of this enter and remain in that this is the miracle that of the three appeals to me as the highest  most sublimeIt is amazing Master GotamaIt is astounding how well this has been said by Master GotamaAnd we hold that Master Gotama is endowed with these three marvels Master Gotama wields manifold psychic powers exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worldsHaving attained a concentration devoid of directed thought  evaluation and encompassing the awareness with his own awareness Master Gotama discerns Given the way the mental fabrications of this venerable person are inclined the directed thoughts of his mind will immediately think about this Master Gotama gives instruction in this way Direct your thought in this way dont direct it in thatAttend to things in this way dont attend to them in thatLet go of this enter and remain in that Of course brahman you have affronted me with your personal statement but nevertheless I will respondYes I wield manifold psychic powers exercise influence with my body even as far as the Brahma worlds having attained a concentration devoid of directed thought and evaluation and encompassing the awareness with my own awareness I discern Given the way the mental fabrications of this venerable person are inclined the directed thoughts of his mind will immediately think about this I give instruction in this way Direct your thought in this way dont direct it in thatAttend to things in this way dont attend to them in thatLet go of this enter and remain in that Aside from Master Gotama is there another monk who is endowed with these three miraclesBrahman there are not only one hundred other monks two three four five hundred other monks the monks who are endowed with these three miracles are many more than thatAnd Master Gotama where do those monks now liveIn this very same community of monksMagnificent Master GotamaMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monksMay Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for lifeThen Vacchagotta the wanderer went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama I have heard that Gotama the contemplative says this Only to me should a gift be given and not to othersOnly to my disciples should a gift be given and not to othersOnly what is given to me bears great fruit and not what is given to othersOnly what is given to my disciples bears great fruit and not what is given to the disciples of others Now those who report this Are they reporting the Master Gotamas actual words are they not misrepresenting him with what is unfactual are they answering in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing themFor we dont want to misrepresent the Master GotamaVaccha whoever says this Gotama the contemplative says this Only to me should a gift be given Only what is given to my disciples bears great fruit and not what is given to the disciples of others is not reporting my actual words is misrepresenting me with what is unfactual  untrueVaccha whoever prevents another from giving a gift creates three obstructions three impedimentsWhich threeHe creates an obstruction to the merit of the giver an obstruction to the recipients gains and prior to that he undermines and harms his own selfWhoever prevents another from giving a gift creates these three obstructions these three impedimentsI tell you Vaccha even if a person throws the rinsings of a bowl or a cup into a village pool or pond thinking May whatever animals live here feed on this that would be a source of merit to say nothing of what is given to human beingsBut I do say that what is given to a virtuous person is of great fruit and not so much what is given to an unvirtuous personAnd the virtuous person has abandoned five factors and is endowed with fiveWhich five has he abandonedHe has abandoned sensual desire ill will sloth  drowsiness restlessness  anxiety uncertaintyThese are the five factors he has abandonedAnd with which five is he endowedHe is endowed with the aggregate of virtue of one beyond training the aggregate of concentration of one beyond training the aggregate of discernment of one beyond training the aggregate of release of one beyond training the aggregate of knowledge  vision of release of one beyond trainingThese are the five factors with which he is endowedI tell you What is given to one who has abandoned these five factors and is endowed with these five bears great fruitThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThere the Venerable Sariputta addressed the bhikkhus thus Friends bhikkhus  Friend they repliedThe Venerable Sariputta said thisOne of right view one of right view is said friendsIn what way is a noble disciple one of

is what the Venerable Sariputta saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Venerable Sariputtas wordsOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen two brahmans  feeble old men aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of life years old  went to the Blessed OneOn arrival they exchanged courteous greetings with him and after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they said to him Master Gotama we are brahmans  feeble old men aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of life years oldAnd we have done no admirable deeds no skillful deeds no deeds that allay our fearsTeach us Master GotamaInstruct us Master Gotama for our longterm benefit  happinessIndeed brahmans you are feeble old men aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of life years oldAnd you have done no admirable deeds no skillful deeds no deeds that allay your fearsThis world is on fire with aging illness  deathWith the world thus on fire with aging illness  death any restraint of body speech  intellect practiced here will be ones shelter cave island  refuge after death in the world beyondThus have I heardOnce the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen one evening the venerable MahaCunda rose from meditative seclusion and went to the Blessed OneHaving paid homage to him he sat down at one side and spoke thus to the Blessed OneVenerable sir there are these various views that arise in the world concerning selfdoctrines or worlddoctrinesDoes the abandoning and discarding of such views come about in a monk who is only at the beginning of his reflectionsCunda as to those several views that arise in the world concerning selfdoctrines and worlddoctrines if in which these views arise in which they underlie and become active is seen with right wisdom as it actually is thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self  then the abandoning of these views their discarding takes place in himIt may be Cunda that some monk detached from senseobjects detached from unsalutary ideas enters into the first absorption that is born of detachment accompanied by thoughtconception and discursive thinking and filled with rapture and joy and he then might think I am abiding in effacement But in the Noble Ones discipline it is not these that are called effacement in the Noble Ones discipline they are called abidings in ease here and nowIt may be that after the stilling of thought conception and discursive thinking he gains the inner tranquillity and harmony of the second absorption that is free of thoughtconception and discursive thinking born of concentration and filled with rapture and joy and he then might think I am abiding in effacement But in the Noble Ones discipline it is not these that are called effacement in the Noble Ones discipline they are called abidings in ease here and nowIt may be that after the fading away of rapture the monk dwells in equanimity mindful and clearly aware and he experiences a happiness in his body of which the Noble Ones say Happily lives he who dwells in equanimity and is mindful  that third absorption he wins and he then might think I am abiding in effacement But in the Noble Ones discipline it is not these that are called effacement in the Noble Ones discipline they are called abidings in ease here and nowIt may be that with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief he enters upon and abides in the fourth absorption which is beyond pleasure and pain and has purity of mindfulness due to equanimity and he then might think I am abiding in effacement But in the Noble Ones discipline it is not these that are called effacement in the Noble Ones discipline they are called abidings in ease here and nowIt may be that with the entire transcending of perceptions of corporeality with the disappearance of perceptions of senseresponse with nonattention to perceptions of variety thinking Space is infinite some monk enters upon and abides in the sphere of infinite space and he then might think I am abiding in effacement But in the Noble Ones discipline it is not these that are called effacement in the Noble Ones discipline they are called peaceful abidingsIt may be that by entirely transcending the sphere of infinite space thinking Consciousness is infinite some monk enters and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness and he then might think I am abiding in effacement But in the Noble Ones discipline it is not these that are called effacement in the Noble Ones discipline they are called peaceful abidingsIt may be that by entirely transcending the sphere of infinite consciousness some monk enters and abides in the sphere of nothingness and he then might think I am abiding in effacement But in the Noble Ones discipline it is not these that are called effacement in the Noble Ones discipline they are called peaceful abidingsIt may be that by entirely transcending the sphere of nothingness some monk enters and abides in the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception and he then might think I am abiding in effacement But in the Noble Ones discipline it is not these that are called effacement in the Noble ones discipline they are called peaceful abidingsBut herein Cunda effacement should be practiced by youCunda I say that even the arising of a thought concerned with salutary things is of great importance not to speak of bodily acts and words conformingTherefore CundaSuppose Cunda there were an uneven road and another even road by which to avoid it and suppose there were an uneven ford and another even ford by which to avoid itSo tooCunda as all unsalutary states lead downward and all salutary states lead upward even so CundaCunda it is impossible that one who is himself sunk in the mire should pull out another who is sunk in the mireBut it is possible Cunda that one not sunk in the mire himself should pull out another who is sunk in the mireIt is not possible Cunda that one who is himself not restrained not disciplined and not quenched should make others restrained and disciplined should make them attain to the full quenchingBut it is possible Cunda that one who is himself restrained disciplined and fully quenched should make others restrained and disciplined should make them attain to the full quenchingEven so CundaThus Cunda I have shown to you the instruction on effacement I have shown to you the instruction on thoughts arising I have shown to you the instruction on avoidance I have shown to you the instruction on the way upward I have shown to you the instruction on quenchingWhat can be done for his disciples by a Master who seeks their welfare and has compassion and pity on them that I have done for you CundaThere are these roots of trees there are empty placesMeditate Cunda do not delay lest you later regret itThis is my message to youThus spoke the Blessed OneSatisfied the venerable Cunda rejoiced in the Blessed Ones wordsAccording to the Comy the Theras question concerns those who overrate the degree of their achievement ie those who believe that in their meditative practice they have achieved this or that result while actually they have notOverestimation in that sense does not arise in ignorant common people who are entirely engrossed in worldly life nor does it arise in Noble Disciples because in a streamwinner the overestimation does not arise that he is a oncereturner etcSelfoverestimation can occur only in one who actually practices and has temporarily subdued the defilements by way of tranquillity or insightMahaCunda Thera being an arahant was no selfoverrater himself but in formulating his question he put himself in the place of one who is or as others say there may have been such selfoverraters among his pupils and for conveying to them the Buddhas reply he put his questionUnderlie ie habitually occurComy This refers to views which having been indulged in repeatedly have become strong and have not been removed SubComy By ultimate eliminationBecome activeComy Wrong views have arrived at the doors of body and speech ie which have found expression in words and deedsThe common meaning of sallekha is austere practice or asceticism but in the Buddhas usage it is the radical effacing or removal of the defilementsThe eight stages of meditation given here in the discourse consist of the four finematerial absorptions and the four immaterial absorptionsComysays that these meditative attainments are in common with the ascetics outsideComy The overraters meditative absorption is neither effacement nor is it the path of practice for effacementAnd why notBecause that jhana is not used by him as a basis for insight that is after rising from jhana he does not scrutinize the formationsHis jhana produces only onepointedness of mind and is as our text says an abiding in ease here and nowSubComy If one wishing to overcome the suffering of samsara goes with joyful confidence for refuge to the Triple Gem then this Refuge will be for him a supporting condition for higher virtue etc and it may gradually lead him to the attainment of the path of understandingThe Fortyfour Ways of EffacementSubComy But why is harmlessness mentioned at the very beginningBecause it is the root of all virtues harmlessness namely is a synonym of compassionEspecially it is the rootcause of morality because it makes one refrain from immorality which has as its characteristic mark the harming of othersJust as the killing of living beings has the harming of others as its mark so also the taking away of others property for robbing a mans wealth is worse than stabbing him Similarly chastity removes the cause for the pains of child bearing etc and there is hardly a need to mention the harm done by adulteryObvious is also the harm done to others by deception by causing dissension and by backbitingThe mark of harming others is also attached to gossip because it takes away what is beneficial and causes to arise what is not beneficial to covetousness as it causes one to take what is not given to ill will as it causes killing etc to wrong views as they are the cause of all that is unbeneficialOne who holds wrong views may in the conviction of acting righteously kill living beings and incite others to do likewiseThere is nothing to say about otherHarmlessness has the characteristic mark of making one refrain from immorality which on its part has the mark of harmingHence harmlessness is an especially strong productive cause of morality and morality again is the basis for concentration of mind while concentration is the basis for wisdomIn that way harmlessness is the root of all virtuesFurthermore in the case of the highest type of men who have noble aspirations who act considerately and wisely also their mental concentration and their wisdom just as their morality is conducive to the weal and happiness of othersIn that way too compassion is the root of all virtues and therefore it has been mentioned at the beginningNow the salutary courses of action are to show that these states are produced by harmlessnessThen follow the eight states of rightness to show that they must be brought about by basing them on morality which is the root of these virtuesNow the separation from the hindrances is included to indicate that this is the primary task for one intent on purifying the eightfold pathThen follows the cleansing from the defilements to indicate that effacement is accomplished by giving up anger etcAnd the cleansing from the defilements will be successful when aided by amenability to advice noble friendship and heedful diligenceNow the seven noble qualities are included to show that they will come to perfection in him who is endowed with amenability and the other and that they on their part after having strengthened insight will lead to the paths of sanctitudeFinally the passage on misapprehending according to ones individual views etcis meant to indicate that for such a one that wrong attitude is an obstacle to the attainment of the supramundane virtues and is therefore to be avoided totallyThis passage on misapprehending is also meant to show that one who by the right conduct here described is in the process of attaining one of the paths of sanctitude will be led to the acme of effacementIn this manner should be understood the purpose of stating these fortyfour modes of effacement as well as the order in which they appear in the discourseComysays that a salutary thought is of great importance as it leads entirely to weal and happiness and as it is the cause for the subsequent actions conforming to itExamples are given beginning with the intention to give almsfood to monks up to the aspiration for BuddhahoodThe SubComy however says that in some cases the importance is not in the thought itself but only in the actual execution of itThis certainly applies to the intention to give alms etcBut in the efforts for effacing the defilements the formation of a mental attitude directed towards it in other words the hearts resolve is certainly an important factorThis section of the discourse has been condensed in the present translationBut he who has chosen the path of effacement as his way of practice is well advised to repeat all fortyfour items linking them with his hearts earnest resolveAlso the last two sections of the discourse have been condensedAny salutary states of mind whether they produce rebirth or not and whether in a given rebirth they produce kamma results or not  all because of their type lead upwardsThey are just like that because on the occasion of their yielding a kamma result that result will be desirable and pleasantThe connection is as follows just as unsalutary states lead downwards so it is with that one state of harmfulness for him who is harmfulJust as all salutary states lead upwards so it is with that one state of harmlessness for him who is harmlessSuppose there is a king who sends a letter to the border region and the people there unable to read it by themselves have the letter read to them by another able to do itHaving learned of the contents they respond with respect knowing it as the kings orderBut they do not think that it is the letter readers order he will receive praise only for his smooth and fluent reading of the letterSimilarly even if preachers of the ability of Sariputta Thera expound the Dhamma still they are just like readers of a letter written by anotherTheir sermon should truly be attributed to the Blessed One like the decree to the kingThe preachers however receive their limited praise just because they expound the Dhamma with a smooth and fluent dictionHence that statement in the discourse is correctOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen two brahmans  feeble old men aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of life years old  went to the Blessed OneOn arrival they exchanged courteous greetings with him and after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they said to him Master Gotama we are brahmans  feeble old men aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of life years oldAnd we have done no admirable deeds no skillful deeds no deeds that allay our fearsTeach us Master GotamaInstruct us Master Gotama for our longterm benefit  happinessIndeed brahmans you are feeble old men aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of life years oldAnd you have done no admirable deeds no skillful deeds no deeds that allay your fearsThis world is swept away by aging by illness by deathWith the world thus swept away by aging illness  death any restraint of body speech  intellect practiced here will be ones shelter cave island  refuge after death in the world beyondThus have I heardOnce the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThere he addressed the monks thus Monks  Venerable sir they repliedThe Blessed One said thisMonks suppose a cloth were stained and dirty and a dyer dipped it in some dye or other whether blue or yellow or red or pink it would take the dye badly and be impure in colorAnd why is thatBecause the cloth was not cleanSo too monks when the mind is defiled an unhappy destination may be expectedMonks suppose a cloth were clean and bright and a dyer dipped it in some dye or other whether blue or yellow or red or pink it would take the dye well and be pure in colorAnd why is thatBecause the cloth was cleanSo too monks when the mind is undefiled a happy destination may be expectedAnd what monks are the defilements of the mindCovetousness and unrighteous greed are a defilement of the mind ill will is a defilement of the mind anger is a defilement of the mind hostility denigration domineering envy jealousy hypocrisy fraud obstinacy presumption conceit arrogance vanity negligence is a defilement of the mindKnowing monks covetousness and unrighteous greed to be a defilement of the mind the monk abandons themKnowing ill will to be a defilement of the mind he abandons itKnowing anger to be a defilement of the mind he abandons itKnowing hostility to be a defilement of the mind he abandons itKnowing denigration to be a defilement of the mind he abandons itKnowing domineering to be a defilement of the mind he abandons itKnowing envy to be a defilement of the mind he abandons itKnowing jealousy to be a defilement of the mind he abandons itKnowing hypocrisy to be a defilement of the mind he abandons itKnowing fraud to be a defilement of the mind he abandons itKnowing obstinacy to be a defilement of the mind he abandons itKnowing presumption to be a defilement of the mind he abandons itKnowing conceit to be a defilement of the mind he abandons itKnowing arrogance to be a defilement of the mind he abandons itKnowing vanity to be a defilement of the mind he abandons itKnowing negligence to be a defilement of the mind he abandons itWhen in the monk who thus knows that covetousness and unrighteous greed are a defilement of the mind this covetousness and unrighteous greed have been abandoned when in him who thus knows that ill will is a defilement of the mind this ill will has been abandoned when in him who thus knows that negligence is a defilement of the mind this negligence has been abandoned   he thereupon gains unwavering confidence in the Buddha thus Thus indeed is the Blessed One he is accomplished fully enlightened endowed with vision and conduct sublime knower of the worlds the incomparable guide of men who are tractable the teacher of gods and men enlightened and blessed he gains unwavering confidence in the Dhamma thus Well proclaimed by the Blessed One is the Dhamma realizable here and now possessed of immediate result bidding you come and see accessible and knowable individually by the wise he gains unwavering confidence in the Sangha thus The Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples has entered on the good way has entered on the straight way has entered on the true way has entered on the proper way that is to say the four pairs of men the eight types of persons this Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of reverential salutation the incomparable field of merit for the worldWhen he has given up renounced let go abandoned and relinquished in part he knows I am endowed with unwavering confidence in the Buddha in the Dhamma in the Sangha and he gains enthusiasm for the goal gains enthusiasm for the Dhamma gains gladness connected with the DhammaWhen he is gladdened joy is born in him being joyous in mind his body becomes tranquil his body being tranquil he feels happiness and the mind of him who is happy becomes concentratedHe knows I have given up renounced let go abandoned and relinquished in part and he gains enthusiasm for the goal gains enthusiasm for the Dhamma gains gladness connected with the DhammaWhen he is gladdened joy is born in him being joyous in mind his body becomes tranquil when his body is tranquil he feels happiness and the mind of him who is happy becomes concentratedIf monks a monk of such virtue such concentration and such wisdom eats almsfood consisting of choice hillrice together with various sauces and curries even that will be no obstacle for himJust as cloth that is stained and dirty becomes clean and bright with the help of pure water or just as gold becomes clean and bright with the help of a furnace so too if a monk of such virtue such concentration and such wisdom eats almsfood consisting of choice hillrice together with various sauces and curries even that will be no obstacle for himHe abides having suffused with a mind of lovingkindness one direction of the world likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth and so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides suffusing the entire universe with lovingkindness with a mind grown great lofty boundless and free from enmity and ill willHe abides having suffused with a mind of compassion of sympathetic joy of equanimity one direction of the world likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth and so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides suffusing the entire universe with equanimity with a mind grown great lofty boundless and free from enmity and ill willHe understands what exists what is low what is excellent and what escape there is from this field of perceptionWhen he knows and sees in this way his mind becomes liberated from the canker of sensual desire liberated from the canker of becoming liberated from the canker of ignoranceWhen liberated there is knowledge It is liberated and he knows Birth is exhausted the life of purity has been lived the task is done there is no more of this to come Such a monk is called one bathed with the inner bathingNow at that time the brahman Sundarika Bharadvaja was seated not far from the Blessed One and he spoke to the Blessed One thus But does Master Gotama go to the Bahuka River to batheWhat good brahman is the Bahuka RiverWhat can the Bahuka River doTruly Master Gotama many people believe that the Bahuka River gives purification many people believe that the Bahuka River gives meritFor in the Bahuka River many people wash away the evil deeds they have doneThen the Blessed One addressed the brahman Sundarika Bharadvaja in these stanzasWhen this was said the brahman Sundarika Bharadvaja spoke thusMagnificent Master GotamaMagnificent Master GotamaThe Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by Master Gotama as though he were righting the overthrown revealing the hidden showing the way to one who is lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see formsI go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the SanghaMay I receive the going forth under Master Gotama may I receive the full admissionAnd the brahman Sundarika Bharadvaja received the going forth under the Blessed One and he received the full admissionAnd not long after his full admission dwelling alone secluded diligent ardent and resolute the venerable Bharadvaja by his own realization understood and attained in this very life that supreme goal of the pure life for which men of good family go forth from home life into homelessnessAnd he had direct knowledge thus Birth is exhausted the pure life has been lived the task is done there is no more of this to comeAnd the venerable Bharadvaja became one of the ArahatsThe defilements to appear frequently as a group in the discourses eg in Majjh while in MajjhNois omittedA list of seventeen defilements appears regularly in each last discourse of Books to of the Anguttara Nikaya which carry the title Ragapeyyala the Repetitive Text on GreedIn these texts of the Anguttara Nikaya the first two defilements in the above list are called greed and hate to which delusion is added all the fourteen other defilements are identical with the above listKnowingSubComy Having known it either through the incipient wisdom or through the wisdom of the two lower pathsHe knows the defilements as to their nature cause cessation and means of effecting cessation This application of the formula of the Four Noble Truths to the defilements deserves close attentionAbandons themComy He abandons the respective defilement through the noble path where there is abandoning by eradication which according to SubComyis the final abandoningBefore the attainment of the noble paths all abandoning of defilements is of a temporary natureSee Nyanatiloka Thera Buddhist Dictionary svpahanaAccording to the Comy the sixteen defilements are finally abandoned by the noble paths in the following orderIf in the last group of terms covetousness is taken in a restricted sense as referring only to the craving for the five sense objects it is finally abandoned by the path of nonreturning and this is according to Comythe meaning intended hereAll greed however including the hankering after fine material and immaterial existence is eradicated only on the path of Arahatship hence the classification under the latter in the list aboveComyrepeatedly stresses that wherever in our text abandoning is mentioned reference is to the nonreturner for also in the case of defilements overcome on streamentry the states of mind which produce those defilements are eliminated only by the path of nonreturningThe disciples direct experience of being freed of this or that defilement becomes for him a living test of his former still imperfectly proven trust in the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaNow this trust has become a firm conviction an unshakable confidence based on experienceBhikkhu anamoli translates this paragraph thus And whatever has according to the limitation been given up has been dropped let go abandoned relinquishedIn the Vibhanga of the Abhidhamma Pitaka we read in the chapter Jhanavibhanga He is a bhikkhu because he has abandoned defilements limitedly or because he has abandoned defilements without limitationComy When reviewing  the abandonment of the defilements and his unwavering confidence strong joy arises in the nonreturner in the thought Such and such defilements are now abandoned by me It is like the joy of a king who learns that a rebellion in the frontier region has been quelledEnthusiasmAccording to Comy the word veda occurs in the Pali texts with three connotationsscripturejoyknowledgeHere it signifies joy and the knowledge connected with that joyAttha and dhamma are a frequently occurring pair of terms obviously intended to supplement each otherOften they mean letter and spirit of the doctrine but this hardly fits hereThese two terms occur also among the four kinds of analytic knowledgeAtthapatisambhida is explained as the discriminative knowledge of the result of a cause while dhammapatisambhida is concerned with the cause or conditionThe Comyapplies now the same interpretation to our present textual passage saying Atthaveda is the enthusiasm arisen in him who reviews his unwavering confidence dhammaveda is the enthusiasm arisen in him who reviews the abandonment of the defilement in part which is the cause of that unwavering confidence Hence the two terms refer to the joy that has as its object the unwavering confidence in the Buddha and so forth and the joy inherent in the knowledgeOur rendering of attha b goal is supported by Comy The unwavering confidence is called attha because it has to be reached ie to be approached in the sense of a limited goal or resultant blessingCfAng tasmim dhamme atthapatisamvedi ca hoti dhammapatisamvedi ca tassa atthapatisamvedino dhammapatisamvedino pamojjam jayati This text continues as our present discourse does with the arising of joy from gladnessAttha and dhamma refer here to the meaning and text of the Buddha word Comy Having shown the nonreturners meditation on the Divine Abidings the Blessed One now shows his practice of insight aiming at Arahatship and he indicates his attainment of it by the words He understands what exists etcThis nonreturner having arisen from the meditation on any of the four Divine Abidings defines as mind those very states of the Divine Abidings and the mental factors associated with themHe then defines as matter the heart base being the physical support and the four elements which on their part are the support of the heart baseIn that way he defines as matter the elements and corporeal phenomena derived from themWhen defining mind and matter in this manner he understands what existsHereby a definition of the truth of suffering has been givenThen in comprehending the origin of that suffering he understands what is low Thereby the truth of the origin of suffering has been definedFurther by investigating the means of giving it up he understands what is excellentHereby the truth of the path has been defined

majesty I can the chariot maker replied to the kingThen in six months minus six days the chariot maker finished one wheelKing Pacetana said to him In six days time from now the battle will take placeWill the pair of chariot wheels be finishedYour majesty in these six months minus six days I have finished one wheelBut can you finish the second wheel in these six daysYes your majesty I can the

wheels all finished your majestyAnd what is the difference between your wheel that took six months minus six days to finish and your wheel that took six days to finishI dont see any difference between them at allThere is a difference between them your majestyLook at the difference Then the chariot maker took the chariot wheel finished in six days and set it rollingGoing as far as its momentum carried it it twirled around and around and fell to the groundBut then he took the chariot wheel finished in six months minus six days and set it rollingGoing as far as its momentum carried it it stood still as if fixed on an axleNow what is the reason my good chariot maker what is the cause why the chariot wheel finished in six days when set rolling goes as far as its momentum carries it and then twirling around and around falls to the groundAnd what is the reason what is the cause why the chariot wheel finished in six months minus six days when set rolling goes as far as its momentum carries it and then stands still as if fixed on an axleYour majesty as for the wheel finished in six days its rim is crooked with faults  flawsIts spokes are crooked with faults  flawsIts hub is crooked with faults  flawsBecause its rim spokes hub are crooked with faults  flaws when set rolling it goes as far as its momentum carries it and then twirling around and around falls to the

arising of wrong viewMonks there are these two conditions for the arising of right viewWhich twoThe voice of another and appropriate attentionThese are the two conditions for the arising of right viewThere are several problems with this interpretation the first being that it leaves no room for an event happening many times in the Canon people gaining right view simply on hearing the words of another personOne scholar has tried to get around this objection saying that the voice from another world must refer to the voice of the Buddha or to one of the noble disciples who gained Awakening on hearing the Buddhas own voiceThe implication here is that only the words of these two classes of people can inspire right viewThis position however is disproved by the fact that in MvIVenSariputta who at that point has not yet met the Buddha is able to inspire the arising of the Dhamma eye in VenMoggallanaThis passage appears in the long origin story leading up to the rules dealing with ordination and proves an important point in validating the tradition of ordination that a person who has not met the Buddha can still inspire right view and even Awakening in the mind of anotherSo the Canon itself disproves both of these otherworldly interpretations of this statementAs for Woodwards linguistic arguments It is hard for a nonnative speaker of a dead language to know the reasoning in the mind of a native speaker in that language but it might have been the case that the Buddha avoided the word aññassa for other because it could have easily been confused for another meaning of aññassa pertaining to the knowledge of an arahant As for vaacii and aññatarassa neither of them fits the contextVaacii is a stemform used in compounds and aññatarassa means of a certain person This leaves vaacaa statement as a possible alternative but perhaps the Buddha chose ghoso to leave room for the possibility that there are times when one can bring another to hisher senses simply by clearing ones throatFinally concerning the passage from MN This sutta is a long series of questions and answers that abruptly switch from topic to topic so its hard to say that the sutta provides a clear sense of context for any of its statementsThat said however its not even the case that this passage follows on a statement about abnormal powersIt actually follows on two questions about discernment which in turn follow on a discussion of the formless jhanas  apparently the abnormal powers mentioned by Woodward  and as AN and MN show its possible to develop discernment based on these attainments without psychic powersMonks these two people are hard to find in the worldWhich twoThe one who is first to do a kindness and the one who is grateful for a kindness done and feels obligated to repay itThese

Gladly would we let the flesh  blood in our bodies dry up leaving just the skin tendons  bones but if we have not attained what can be reached through human firmness human persistence human striving there will be no relaxing our persistence Thats how you should train yourselvesLuminous monks is the mindAnd it is defiled by incoming defilementsLuminous monks is the mindAnd it is freed from incoming defilementsLuminous monks is the mindAnd it is defiled by incoming defilementsThe uninstructed runofthemill person doesnt discern that as it actually is present which is why I tell you that  for the uninstructed runofthemill person  there is no development of the mindLuminous monks is the mindAnd it is freed from incoming defilementsThe wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones discerns that as it actually is present which is why I tell you that  for the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones  there is development of the mindThis statement has engendered a great deal of controversy over the centuriesThe commentary maintains that mind here refers to the bhavangacitta the momentary mental state between periods when the mental stream adverts to objects but this statement raises more questions than it answersThere is no reference to the bhavangacitta or the mental stream in any of the suttas and because the commentaries compare the bhavangacitta to deep sleep why is it called luminousAnd why would the perception of its luminosity be a prerequisite for developing the mindAnd further if mind in this discourse means bhavangacitta what would it mean to develop the bhavangacittaAnother interpretation equates the luminosity of the mind with the consciousness without feature described as luminous in MN and DN but this interpretation also has problemsAccording to MN that consciousness partakes of nothing in the describable world not even the Allness of the All so how could it possibly be defiledAnd because it is not realized until the goal of the practice is reached why would the perception of its luminosity be a prerequisite for developing the mindAnd again if mind here means consciousness without feature how could the sutta talk of its developmentA more reasonable approach to understanding the statement can be derived from taking it in context the luminous mind is the mind that the meditator is trying to developTo perceive its luminosity means understanding that defilements such as greed aversion or delusion are not intrinsic to its nature are not a necessary part of awarenessWithout this understanding it would be impossible to practiceWith this understanding however one can make an effort to cut away existing defilements leaving the mind in the stage that MN calls purity in terms of mind This would correspond to the luminous level of concentration described in the standard simile for the fourth jhana And furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpainHe sits permeating the body with a pure bright awarenessJust as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating the body with a pure bright awarenessThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awareness From this state it is possible to develop the discernment that not only cuts away existing defilements but also uproots any potential for them to ever arise againOnly in the stages of Awakening that follow on those acts of discernment would consciousness without feature be realizedI dont envision a single thing that is as quick to reverse itself as the mind  so much so that there is no feasible simile for how quick to reverse itself it isJust as of all trees the balsam is foremost in terms of softness and pliancy in the same way I dont envision a

abandoned by avoiding have been abandoned by avoiding his fermentations that should be abandoned by dispelling have been abandoned by dispelling his fermentations that should be abandoned by developing have been abandoned by developing then he is called a monk who dwells restrained with the restraint of all the fermentationsHe has severed craving thrown off the fetters and  through the right penetration of conceit  has made an end of suffering  stressThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThe Buddha taught that clinging to views is one of the four forms of clinging that tie the mind to the processes of sufferingHe thus recommended that his followers relinquish their clinging not only to views in their fullblown form as specific positions but also in their rudimentary form as the categories  relationships that the mind reads into experienceThis is a point he makes in the following discourse which is apparently his response to a particular school of Brahmanical thought that was developing in his time  the Samkhya or classification schoolThis school had its beginnings in the thought of Uddalaka a ninthcentury Bphilosopher who posited a root an abstract principle out of which all things emanated and which was immanent in all thingsPhilosophers who carried on this line of thinking offered a variety of theories based on logic and meditative experience about the nature of the ultimate root and about the hierarchy of the emanationMany of their theories were recorded in the Upanishads and eventually developed into the classical Samkhya system around the time of the BuddhaAlthough the present discourse says nothing about the background of the monks listening to it the Commentary states that before their ordination they were brahmans and that even after their ordination they continued to interpret the Buddhas teachings in light of their previous training which may well have been protoSamkhyaIf this is so then the Buddhas opening lines  I will teach you the sequence of the root of all phenomena  would have them prepared to hear his contribution to their line of thinkingAnd in fact the list of topics he covers reads like a Buddhist SamkhyaParalleling the classical Samkhya it contains items begins with the physical world and leads back through ever more refined  inclusive levels of being  experience culminating with the ultimate Buddhist concept UnbindingIn the pattern of Samkhya thought Unbinding would thus be the ultimate root or ground of being immanent in all things and out of which they all emanateHowever instead of following this pattern of thinking the Buddha attacks it at its very root the notion of a principle in the abstract the in  out of superimposed on experienceOnly an uninstructed run of the mill person he says would read experience in this wayIn contrast a person in training should look for a different kind of root  the root of suffering experienced in the present  and find it in the act of delightDeveloping dispassion for that delight the trainee can then comprehend the process of comingintobeing for what it is drop all participation in it and thus achieve true AwakeningIf the listeners present at this discourse were indeed interested in fitting Buddhist teachings into a Samkhyan mold then its small wonder that they were displeased  one of the few places where we read of a negative reaction to the Buddhas wordsThey had hoped to hear his contribution to their project but instead they hear their whole pattern of thinking  theorizing attacked as ignorant  illinformedThe Commentary tells us though they were later able to overcome their displeasure and eventually attain Awakening on listening to the discourse reported in ANAlthough at present we rarely think in the same terms as the Samkhya philosophers there has long been  and still is  a common tendency to create a Buddhist metaphysics in which the experience of emptiness the Unconditioned the Dharmabody Buddhanature rigpa etc is said to function as the ground of being from which the All  the entirety of our sensory  mental experience  is said to spring and to which we return when we meditateSome people think that these theories are the inventions of scholars without any direct meditative experience but actually they have most often originated among meditators who label a particular meditative experience as the ultimate goal identify with it in a subtle way and then view that level of experience as the ground of being out of which all other experience comesAny teaching that follows these lines would be subject to the same criticism that the Buddha directed against the monks who first heard this discourseI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Ukkattha in the shade of a royal Sal tree in the Very Blessed GroveThere he addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks respondedThe Blessed One said Monks I will teach you the sequence of

not conceive things coming out of Unbinding does not conceive Unbinding as mine does not delight in UnbindingWhy is thatBecause he has known that delight is the root of suffering  stress that from comingintobeing there is birth and that for what has come into being there is aging  deathTherefore with the total ending fading away cessation letting go relinquishment of craving the Tathagata has totally awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening I tell youThat is what the Blessed One saidDispleased the monks did not delight in the Blessed Ones wordsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi at Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen Janussonin the brahman went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama the sons of good families who have gone forth from the home life into homelessness out of conviction in Master Gotama is Master Gotama their leaderIs Master Gotama their helperIs Master Gotama their inspirerDo they take Master Gotama as their exampleYes brahman so it isThe sons of good families who have gone forth from the home life into homelessness out of conviction in me I am their leaderI am their helperI am their inspirerThey take me as their exampleBut Master Gotama its not easy to endure isolated forest or wilderness dwellingsIts not easy to maintain seclusion not easy to enjoy being aloneThe forests as it were plunder the mind of a monk who has not attained concentrationYes brahman so it isIts not easy to endure isolated forest or wilderness dwellingsIts not easy to maintain seclusion not easy to enjoy being aloneThe forests as it were plunder the mind of a monk who has not attained concentrationBefore my Awakening when I was still an unawakened Bodhisatta the thought occurred to me as well Its not easy to endure isolated forest or wilderness dwellingsIts not easy to maintain seclusion not easy to enjoy being aloneThe forests as it were plunder the mind of a monk who has not attained concentrationThe thought occurred to me When brahmans or contemplatives who are unpurified in their bodily activities resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings its the fault of their unpurified bodily activities that they give rise to unskillful fear  terrorBut its not the case that I am unpurified in my bodily activities when I resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellingsI am purified in my bodily activitiesI am one of those noble ones who are purified in their bodily activities when they resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings Seeing in myself this purity of bodily activities I felt even more undaunted about staying in the wildernessThe thought occurred to me When brahmans or contemplatives who are unpurified in their verbal activities unpurified in their mental activities unpurified in their livelihood resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings its the fault of their unpurified livelihood that they give rise to unskillful fear  terrorBut its not the case that I am unpurified in my livelihood when I resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellingsI am purified in my livelihoodI am one of those noble ones who are purified in their livelihood when they resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings Seeing in myself this purity of livelihood I felt even more undaunted about staying in the wildernessThe thought occurred to me When brahmans or contemplatives who are covetous  fiercely passionate for sensual pleasures I am not covetousWhen brahmans or contemplatives who have minds of ill will with destructive attitudes I have a mind of good willWhen brahmans or contemplatives who are overcome by sloth  drowsiness I am devoid of sloth  drowsinessWhen brahmans or contemplatives who are restless  with an unstill mind I have a still mindWhen brahmans or contemplatives who are uncertain  doubting I have gone beyond uncertaintyWhen brahmans or contemplatives who are given to praising themselves  disparaging others I do not praise myself or disparage othersWhen brahmans or contemplatives who tend toward panic  dread I have gone beyond horripilationWhen brahmans or contemplatives who are desirous of gains offerings  fame I have few wantsWhen brahmans or contemplatives who are lazy  lacking in persistence My persistence is arousedWhen brahmans or contemplatives who are muddled in their mindfulness  unalert I have mindfulness establishedWhen brahmans or contemplatives who are unconcentrated with straying minds I am consummate in concentrationThe thought occurred to me When brahmans or contemplatives who are drooling idiots resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings its the fault of their drooling idiocy that they give rise to unskillful fear  terrorBut its not the case that I am a drooling idiot when I resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellingsI am consummate in discernmentI am one of those noble ones who are consummate in discernment when they resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings Seeing in myself this consummate discernment I felt even more undaunted about staying in the wildernessThe thought occurred to me What if  on recognized designated nights such as the eighth fourteenth  fifteenth of the lunar fortnight  I were to stay in the sort of places that are aweinspiring and make your hair stand on end such as parkshrines forestshrines  treeshrinesPerhaps I would get to see that fear  terror So at a later time  on recognized designated nights such as the eighth fourteenth  fifteenth of the lunar fortnight  I stayed in the sort of places that are aweinspiring and make your hair stand on end such as parkshrines forestshrines  treeshrinesAnd while I was staying there a wild animal would come or a peacock would make a twig fall or wind would rustle the fallen leavesThe thought would occur to me Is this that fear  terror coming Then the thought occurred to me Why do I just keep waiting for fearWhat if I in whatever state Im in when fear  terror come to me were to subdue that fear  terror in that very state So when fear  terror came to me while I was walking back  forth I would not stand or sit or lie downI would keep walking back  forth until I had subdued that fear  terrorWhen fear  terror came to me while I was standing I would not walk or sit or lie downI would keep standing until I had subdued that fear  terrorWhen fear  terror came to me while I was sitting I would not lie down or stand up or walkI would keep sitting until I had subdued that fear  terrorWhen fear  terror came to me while I was lying down I would not sit up or stand or walkI would keep lying down until I had subdued that fear  terrorThere are some brahmans  contemplatives brahman who have the perception of day when it is night and of night when it is dayThis I tell you is their being in a dwelling of delusionAs for me I have the perception of day when it is day and of night when it is nightIf anyone when speaking rightly were to say A being not subject to delusion has appeared in the world for the benefit  happiness of many out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of human  divine beings he would rightly be speaking of meUnflagging persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness establishedMy body was calm  unaroused my mind concentrated  singleQuite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities I entered  remained in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluationWith the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations I entered  remained in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceWith the fading of rapture I remained in equanimity mindful  alert and physically sensitive of pleasureI entered  remained in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  I entered  remained in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor painWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past livesI recollected my manifold past lives ie one birth two five ten fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many eons of cosmic contraction many eons of cosmic expansion many eons of cosmic contraction  expansion There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose thereThere too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose here Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes  detailsThis was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away  reappearance of beingsI saw  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech  mind who reviled noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellBut these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech  mind who did not revile noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  I saw beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kammaThis was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentationsI discerned as it had come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations My heart thus knowing thus seeing was released from the fermentation of sensuality released from the fermentation of becoming released from the fermentation of ignoranceWith release there was the knowledge Released I discerned that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThis was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteNow brahman if the thought should occur to you Perhaps Gotama the contemplative is even today not free of passion not free of aversion not free of delusion which is why he resorts to isolated forest  wilderness dwellings it should not be seen in that wayIts through seeing two compelling reasons that I resort to isolated forest  wilderness dwellings seeing a pleasant abiding for myself in the present and feeling sympathy for future generationsHow truly future generations have been shown sympathy by Master Gotama in the manner of one who is worthy  rightly selfawakenedMagnificent Master GotamaMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monksMay Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeThus have I heardOnce the Bhagāva was staying at the Jetavana monastery of Anāthapiṇḍika in SāvatthiAt that time the Bhagāva addressed the bhikkhus saying Bhikkhus And they answered

the mind They are like liquor long fermentedThey convey the idea of something flowing out that intoxicates or befuddles the mindsavas are usually classified into four categories kāmāsava or gross attachment to and craving for the five senseobjects bhavāsava or craving for better existence such as the rūpa and arūpa planes of existence in the belief that they are permanent stable and constant this craving occurs together with sassata diṭṭhi avijjāsava or the defilement of lack of comprehension of the Four Ariya Truths through Magga Insight diṭṭhāsava or the defilement that is false beliefIn this Sutta however the last is not mentionedIt may be taken as part of bhavāsavaAlthough the āsavas are variously classified they are basically only lobha diṭṭhi and mohaThe most crucial point in  is the practice of the four SatipaṭṭhānasIt is the one and only way for the attainment of maggas and phalas and also for the realization of NibbānaAs a matter of fact the Seven Bojjhaṅgas cannot take place without the practice of the four SatipaṭṭhānasWhen a yogī practices the Satipaṭṭhānas he will achieve first of all mental concentrationWhen it becomes sufficiently strong he will achieve stage by stage thirteen vipassanā ñāṇas which will enable him to perceive the true nature of mind and body before he achieves maggasBojjhaṅgas are the factors of enlightenment which one must have while he is passing through these thirteen vipassanā ñāṇasSati means mindfulnessDhammavicaya means mindfulness of nāma and rūpa and their appearance and disappearanceVīriya means diligencePīti means the emotion of joyPassadhi means composureSamādhi means mental concentrationUpekkhā means equanimityBriefly speaking in the course of the practice of the Satipaṭṭhānas if one knows he has the bojjhaṅgas hen he has them and knows he does not have them hen they disappear and if he knows why he has them when he has them and why he does not have them when he has lost them he is deemed to be a person who is endowed with these seven factors of enlightenmentAnd the Buddha taught that such a person is one who will pass through the vipassanā ñāṇas and achieve maggas speedilyVery well then my friend I will give you an analogy for there are cases where it is through the use of an analogy that intelligent people can understand the meaning of what is being saidReferences to DN Iti Khp  MN are

Royal Thai EditionTerms marked in the text with an asterisk are explained in the End NotesBecause Pali has many ways of expressing the word and I have  to avoid monotony  used the ampersand to join lists of words  short phrases and the word and to join long phrases  clausesTo study ancient texts is like visiting a foreign city Time  inclination determine whether you want a quick prepackaged tour of the highlights a less structured opportunity for personal exploration or bothThis book on the connotations of the words nibbāna  upādāna in the early Buddhist texts is organized on the assumption that both approaches to the topic have their merits and so it consists of two separate but related partsPart I The Abstract is the quick tour  a brief survey to highlight the main points of the argumentPart II The Essay is a chance to make friends with the natives soak up the local atmosphere and gain your own insightsIt takes a more oblique approach to the argument letting the texts themselves point the way with a minimum of interference so that you may explore  ponder them at leisurePart I is for those who need their bearings and who might get impatient with the seeming indirection of Part II Part II is for those who are interested in contemplating the nuances the tangential connections  the sense of context that usually get lost in a more structured approachEither part may be read on its own but I would like to recommend that anyone seriously interested in the Buddhas teachings take the time to read reflectively the translations that form the main body of Part People in the West even committed Buddhists are often remarkably ignorant of the Buddhas original teachings as presented in the early textsMuch of what they know has been filtered for them at second or third hand without their realizing what was added or lost in the filtrationAlthough the quotations in Part II by their sheer length  numbers may at times seem like overkill they are important for the context they give to the teachingsOnce the teachings have context you can have a surer sense of what is true Buddha Dhamma and what are filtration productsThis book has been many years in preparationIt began from a casual remark made one evening by my meditation teacher  Phra Ajaan Fuang Jotiko  to the effect that the mind released is like fire that has gone out The fire is not annihilated he said but is still there diffused in the air it simply no longer latches on to any fuelThis remark gave me food for thought for a long time afterwardsWhen I came to learn Pali my first interest was to explore the early texts to learn what views they contained about the workings of fire and how these influenced the meaning of nibbāna  literally extinguishing  as a name for the Buddhist goalThe result of my research is this bookMany people have helped in this project directly or indirectly and I would like to acknowledge my debts to themFirst of all Phra Ajaan Fuang Jotiko in addition to being the original inspiration for the research provided me with the training that has formed the basis for many of the insights presented hereThe example of his life  teachings was what originally convinced me of Buddhisms worthAKWarders excellent Introduction to Pali made learning Pali a joyMarcia Colish  JDLewis two of my professors at Oberlin College taught me  with no small amount of patience  how to read  interpret ancient textsVenBhikkhu Bodhi Donald Swearer John Bullitt Margaret Dornish Robert Ebert Michael Grossi Lawrence Howard  Doris Weir all read earlier incarnations of the manuscript and made valuable suggestions for improvementsI of course am responsible for any mistakes that may still remainFinally I would like to dedicate this book in gratitude to my father Henry Lewis DeGraff and to the memory of my mother Esther Penny Boutcher DeGraff who taught me the value of truth inner beauty  goodness from an early ageThis timeline chronicles some of the significant events and personalities in the evolution of Theravada Buddhism that in one way or another figure prominently in the readings found elsewhere on this websiteThis is not meant to be a comprehensive chronologyThe sources used in constructing this timeline often assumed different dates for the Buddhas nativityFor this reason I have occasionally had to interpolate in order to fit events onto a reasonably consistent timelineNevertheless this chronology should provide a fairly clear picture of the relative sequence of events if not the absolute dates on which they occurredFor a general introduction to Theravada Buddhism please see What is Theravada BuddhismDuring the fullmoon night of July the Buddha delivers his first discourse near Varanasi introducing the world to the Four Noble Truths and commencing a year career of teaching the religion he called DhammavinayaDuring the rains retreat following the Buddhas Parinibbana the First Council convenes at Rajagaha India during which arahant bhikkhus led by VenMahakassapa gather to recite the entire body of the Buddhas teachingsThe recitation of the Vinaya by VenUpali becomes accepted as the Vinaya Pitaka the recitation of the Dhamma by VenAnanda becomes established as the Sutta PitakaBE  Buddhist EraYear of the Buddhist Era calendar is the year of the Buddhas Parinibbana which occurred in the Buddhas eightieth yearThe actual date of the Buddhas birth is unknownAccording to Buddhist tradition the Buddhas birth took place in BCE although some recent estimates place the Buddhas birth much later  perhaps as late as BCEBCE is one commonly accepted date for the Buddhas birth and the historical date for that event that I adopt hereEvents in the timeline prior to CE are shown with two CE dates the date based on the traditional nativity of BCE followed by the date based on the historical date of BCEAfter CE the historical date is dropped since these dates are more appropriate only in discussions of earlier eventsTo calculate the CE date corresponding to an event in the Buddhist traditional calendar subtract years from the BE dateThe BE dates of welldocumented historical events may be off by one year since the CE and BE calendars start their years on different monthsSo this is what you think of me The Blessed One sympathetic seeking our wellbeing teaches the Dhamma out of sympathy Then you should train yourselves  harmoniously cordially and without dispute  in the qualities I have pointed out having known them directly the four frames of reference the four right exertions the four bases of power the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors for Awakening the noble eightfold pathThis book has been several years in the makingIn the course of assembling it I have used some of the material it contains to lead study courses at the Barre Center of Buddhist Studies Barre Massachusetts at Awareness Grove Laguna Beach California with the Insight Meditation Society of Orange County the San Diego Vipassana Community and the Open Door Sangha of Santa BarbaraThe feedback coming from the participants in these courses has helped force me to clarify the presentation and to make explicit the connections between the words of the teachings and their application in practiceIt has been encouraging to see that people in America  contrary to their reputation in other parts of the world  are interested in learning authentic Buddhist teachings and integrating them into their livesThis encouragement is what has given me the impetus to turn this material into a bookIn addition to the participants at the above courses Dorothea Bowen John Bullitt Jim Colfax Charles Hallisey Karen King Mu Soeng Andrew Olendzki Gregory MSmith and Jane Yudelman have read and offered valuable comments on earlier incarnations of the manuscriptJohn Bullitt also helped with the IndexThe finished book owes a great deal to all of these peopleAny mistakes that remain of course are my own responsibilityI dedicate this book to all of my teachers and in particular to Phra Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo the teacher of my primary teacher Phra Ajaan Fuang JotikoThe example of Ajaan Lees life has had a large influence on my own in more ways than I can ever really repayHis teaching of the Buddhist path as a skill  as expressed in the Wings to Awakening and embodied in the practice of breath meditation  provided the original and ongoing inspiration for writing this bookI offer it to his memory with the highest respectReferences to DN Iti and MN are to discourseReferences to Dhp are to

Pali CanonIn the translated passages parentheses enclose alternative renderings and words needed to make sense of the passageSquare brackets enclose explanatory information crossreferences material summarized from longer passages in the text and other material not found in the original textBraces enclose material interpolated from other passages in the Canon the source of this material is indicated in braces as part of the citation at the end of the passageBecause Pali has many ways of expressing the word and I have  to avoid monotony  used the ampersand to join lists of words and short phrases and the word and to join long phrases and clausesMany anthologies of the Buddhas teachings have appeared in English but this is the first to be organized around the set of teachings that the Buddha himself said formed the heart of his message the Wings to AwakeningThe material is arranged in three parts preceded by a long IntroductionThe Introduction tries to define the concept of Awakening so as to give a clear sense of where the Wings to Awakening are headedIt does this by discussing the Buddhas accounts of his own Awakening with special focus on the way in which the principle of skillful kamma formed both the how and the what of that Awakening the Buddha was able to reach Awakening only by developing skillful kamma  this is the how his understanding of the process of developing skillful kamma is what sparked the insights that constituted Awakening  this is the whatWith this background established the remainder of the book focuses in detail on the Wings to Awakening as an expanded analysis of the how Part One focuses on aspects of the principle of skillful kamma that shaped the way the Wings to Awakening are formulatedPart Two goes through the seven sets that make up the Wings to Awakening themselves the four foundations of mindfulness the four right exertions the four bases for power the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors for Awakening and the noble eightfold pathPart Three reduces all the terms in the seven sets to the five faculties and then deals with those faculties in detailWith the fifth and final faculty discernment the book concludes by returning to the what of Awakening showing how discernment focuses on the Wings themselves as topics to be observed in such a way that they will spark the insights leading to total releaseThus the organization of the book is somewhat circularAs with any circle there are several points where the book can be enteredI would recommend two to begin withThe first is to read straight through the book from beginning to end gaining a systematic framework for the material from Parts One and Two which explain why the seven sets are organized as they are and then focusing more on individual elements in the sets in Part ThreeThis way of approaching the material has the advantage of giving an overall perspective on the topic before going into the details making the role and meaning of the details clear from the startHowever this approach is the reverse of what actually happens in the practiceA practicing meditator must learn first to focus on individual phenomena in and of themselves and then through observation and experimentation to discover their interrelationshipsFor this reason some readers  especially those who find the discussion of causal relationships in Parts One and Two too abstract to be helpful  may prefer to skip from the Introduction straight to sections A through E of Part Three to familiarize themselves with teachings that may connect more directly with their own experienceThey may then return later to Parts One and Two to gain a more overall perspective on how the practice is meant to deal with those experiencesRegardless of which approach you take to the material you should discover fairly quickly that the relationships among the overall patterns and individual elements in the Wings are very complexThis complexity reflects the nonlinear nature of the Buddhas teachings on causal relationships and is reflected in the many crossreferences among the various parts of the bookIn this way the structure of this book instead of being a simple circle is actually a pattern of many loops within loopsThus a third way to read it  for those familiar enough with the material to want to explore unexpected connections  would be to follow the crossreferences to see where they leadParts One through Three of the book are each divided into sections consisting of passages translated from discourses in the Pali Canon which is apparently the earliest extant record of the Buddhas teachingsEach section is introduced where necessary with an essayThese essays are printed in sans serif type to distinguish them clearly from the translated passagesThey are attempts to provide context  and thus meaning  for the passages to show how they relate to one another to specific issues in the practice and to the path of practice as a wholeThey are not meant to anticipate or answer every possible question raised by the passagesInstead they are aimed at giving an idea of the kinds of questions that can be most fruitfully brought to the passages so that the lessons contained in the passages can properly be applied to the practiceAs the Buddha has pointed out the attitude of appropriate attention the ability to focus on the right questions is one of the most important skills to develop in the course of the practiceThis skill is much more fruitful than an attitude that tries to come to the practice armed with all the right answers in advanceThe context provided by the essays is threefold doctrinal placing the passages within the structure of the Buddhas teachings taken as a whole historical relating them to what is known of the intellectual and social history of the Buddhas time and practical applying them to the actual practice of the Buddhist path in the presentThe first and foremost sources for the doctrinal context are the discourses in the Canon itselfThe Buddha and his noble disciples are by far the most reliable guides to the meaning of their own wordsOften a teaching that seems vague or confusing when encountered on its own in a single discourse becomes clearer when viewed in the context of several discourses that treat it from a variety of angles just as it is easier to get a sense of a building from a series of pictures taken from different perspectives than from a single snapshotThis approach to understanding the discourses is instructive not only when discourse x explicitly defines a term mentioned in discourse y but also when patterns of imagery and terminology permeate many passagesTwo cases in point in separate contexts the discourses compare suffering to fire and the practice of training the mind in meditation to the art of tuning and playing a musical instrumentIn each case technical terms  from physics in the first instance from music theory in the second  are applied to the mind in a large number of contextsThus it is helpful to understand where the terms are coming from in order to grasp their connotations and to gain an intuitive sense  based on our own familiarity with fire and music  of what they meanIn a few instances I have cited alternative versions of the discourses  such as those contained in the Sarvāstivādin Canon preserved in Chinese translation  to throw light on passages in the PaliAlthough the Sarvāstivādin Canon as a whole seems to be later than the Pali there is no way of knowing whether particular Sarvāstivādin discourses are earlier or later than their Pali counterparts so the comparisons drawn between the two are intended simply as food for thoughtI have also drawn occasionally on the Pali Abhidhamma and commentaries which postdate the discourses by several centuriesHere however I have had to be selectiveThese texts employ a systematic approach to interpreting the discourses that fits some teachings better than othersThere are instances where a particular teaching has one meaning in terms of this system and another when viewed in the context of the discourses themselvesThus I have taken specific insights from these texts where they seem genuinely to illuminate the meaning of the discourses but without adopting the overall structure they impose on the teachingsTo provide historical context I have drawn on a variety of sourcesAgain the foremost source here is the Pali Canon itself both in what it has to say explicitly about the social and intellectual milieu of the Buddhas time and in what it says implicitly about the way the intellectual disciplines of the Buddhas time  such as science mathematics and music theory  helped to shape the way the Buddha expressed his thoughtI have also drawn on secondary sources where these do a useful job of fleshing out themes present in the Pali CanonThese secondary sources are cited in the BibliographyBecause the Pali tradition is still a living one the doctrinal and historical contexts do not account for the full range of meanings that practicing Buddhists continue to find in the textsTo provide this living dimension I have drawn on the teachings of modern practice traditions where these seem to harmonize with the message of the Canon and add an illuminating perspectiveMost of these teachings are drawn from the Thai Forest Tradition but I have also drawn on other traditions as wellI have followed a traditional Buddhist practice in not identifying the sources for these teachings and for two reasons first in many ways I owe every insight offered in this book to the training I have received from my teachers in the Forest Tradition and it seems artificial to credit them for some points and not for others second there is the possibility that I have misunderstood some of their teachings or taken them out of context so I dont want to risk crediting my misunderstandings to themIn providing a more modern context for the passages presented in this book however I have not tried to interpret the teachings in terms of modern psychology or sociologyThe Buddhas message is timeless and directIt does not need to be translated into the passing fashions of disciplines that are in many ways more removed than it is from the realities of direct experience and more likely to grow out of dateHowever there are two modern disciplines that I have drawn on to help explain some of the more formal aspects of the Buddhas mode of speech and his analysis of causal principlesThe first discipline is phenomenology the branch of philosophy that deals with phenomena as they are directly experienced in and of themselvesThere are many schools of modern phenomenology and it is not my purpose to try to equate the Buddhas teachings with any one of themHowever the Buddha does recommend a mode of perception that he calls entry into emptiness  in which one simply notes the presence or absence of phenomena without making further assumptions about themThis approach resembles what in modern philosophy could be called radical phenomenology a mode of perception that looks at experiences and processes simply as events with no reference to the question of whether there are any things lying behind those events or of whether the events can be said really to existBecause of this resemblance the word phenomenology is useful in helping to explain the source of the Buddhas descriptions of the workings of kamma and the process of dependent coarising in particularOnce we know where he is coming from it is easier to make sense of his statements and to use them in their proper contextI have made similar use of modern science  chaos theory in particularThere are many parallels between Buddhist theories of causation and modern deterministic chaos theoryExamples and terminology drawn from the latter  such as feedback scale invariance resonance and fluid turbulence  are very useful in explaining the formerAgain in using these parallels I am not trying to equate Buddhist teachings with chaos theory or to engage in pseudoscienceFashions in science change so rapidly that we do the Buddhas teachings no favor in trying to prove them in light of current scientific paradigmsHere I am simply pointing out similarities as a way of helping to make those teachings intelligible in modern termsDeterministic chaos theory is the only modern body of knowledge that has worked out a vocabulary for the patterns of behavior described in Buddhist explanations of causality and so it seems a natural source to draw on both to describe those patterns and to point out some of their less obvious implicationsIn doing so I realize that I run the risk of alienating nonscientists who feel intimidated by scientific terminology as well as scientists who resent the application of terminology from their disciplines to nonscientific fieldsTo both groups I can say only that the terms in and of themselves are not scientific Much of our current everyday terminology for explaining causal relations is derived from the science of the eighteenth century I expect that it will only be a matter of time before the terminology of more recent science will percolate into everyday usageFor the purpose of this book it is important to point out that when the Buddha talked about causality his notion of causal relations did not correspond to our ordinary linear picture of causal chainsIf this point is not grasped the common tendency is to judge the Buddhas descriptions of causality against our own and to find them either confusing or confusedViewing them in the light of deterministic chaos theory however helps us to see that they are both coherent and of practical useAnother example of an analogy drawn from modern science is the term holographic which I have used to describe some formulations of the Buddhist pathWhen a hologram is made of an object an image of the entire object  albeit fairly fuzzy  can be made from even small fragments of the hologramIn the same way some formulations of the path contain a rough version of the entire path complete in each individual stepIn my search for an adjective to describe such formulations holographic seemed the best choiceIf you are unfamiliar with the terminology of phenomenology chaos theory and holograms read section IA on skillfulness to find the doctrinal context in which these terms can be related to an immediate experience the process of developing a skillThe approach of phenomenology relates to the fact that on the night of his Awakening the Buddha focused his attention directly on the mental process of developing skillful states in the mind without referring to who or what was developing the skill or to whether there was any sort of substratum underlying the processChaos theory relates to the patterns of causality that the Buddha discerned while observing this process whereby the effects of action can in turn become causal factors influencing new actionHolography relates to his discovery that skillfulness is developed by taking clusters of good qualities already present in the mind and using them to strengthen one another each step along the wayOnce these familiar reference points are understood the abstract terms describing them should become less foreign and more helpfulIn providing doctrinal historical and practical context based on all the abovementioned sources the essays are meant to give an entry into the mental horizons and landscape of the texts they introduceThey are also meant to suggest how the texts may be used for their intended purpose to help eliminate obstacles to the release of the mindAlthough some of the essays address controversial questions the textual passages are not meant to prove the points made in the essaysIn assembling this anthology I first gathered and translated the passages from the CanonOnly then after contemplating what I had gathered did I add the essaysFor this reason any reader who disagrees with the positions presented in the essays should still find the translations useful for hisher own purposesI am painfully aware that some of the essays especially those in Part I tend to overpower the material they are designed to introduce but this is because the themes in Part I play a pervasive role in the Buddhas teachings as a wholeThus I had to deal with them in considerable detail to point out how they relate not only to the passages in Part I but also to themes raised in the rest of the bookAlthough the essays should go far toward familiarizing the reader with the conceptual world and relevance of the textual passages there are other aspects of the passages that might prove daunting to the uninitiated and so I would like to deal with them hereTo begin with the teachings on the Wings to Awakening are interrelated in very complex waysBecause books must be arranged in linear sequence taking one thing at a time in a row this means that no book can do justice to all the side avenues and underground passageways that connect elements in one set of teachings to those in anotherFor this reason I have organized the material in line with the order of the sets as given in the Canon but  as mentioned above  have extensively crossreferenced it for the sake of readers who want to explore connections that fall outside the linear patternCrossreferences are given in brackets and take three formsAn example that looks like this   is a reference to a passage from the Pali Canon translated in this bookOne that looks like this   is a reference to an essay introducing a section in this case Section E in Part One that looks like this   is a reference to a passage from the Pali Canon not translated hereThe abbreviations used in these last references are explained on the Abbreviations pageMany passages falling in this last category are translated in my book The Mind Like Fire Unbound in which case the reference will include the abbreviation MFU followed by the number of the page on which the passage is located in that bookMy hope is that these crossreferences will open up useful lines of thought to whoever takes the time to explore themAnother potential difficulty for the uninitiated reader lies in the style of the passagesThe Pali Canon was for years an entirely oral traditionAs a result it tends to be terse in some areas and repetitive in othersIve made an effort to cut out as many of the repetitions as possible but Ill have to ask your patience for those that remainThink of them as the refrains in a piece of musicAlso when the Buddha is referring to monks doing this and that keep in mind that his audience was frequently composed entirely of monksThe commentaries state that the word monk includes anyone  male or female lay or ordained  who is serious about the practice and this meaning should always be kept in mindI apologize for the gender bias in the translationsAlthough I have tried to figure out ways to minimize it I find myself stymied because it is so thoroughly embedded in a literature originally addressed to monksI trust however that none of these difficulties will prove insurmountable and that you will find as I have that the teachings of the Pali Canon more than reward the effort put into exploring themThe reality of the Wings to Awakening lies in the qualities of the mindThe words with which they are expressed in the Pali Canon are simply pointersThese pointers have to be tested in the light of serious practice but my conviction is that of all the meditation teachers the human race has ever seen the Buddha is still the bestHis words should be read repeatedly reflectively and put to test in the practiceMy hope in gathering his teachings in this way is that they will give you useful insights for training the mind so that someday you wont have to read about Awakening but will be able to know it for yourselfThe Wings to Awakening constitute the Buddhas own list of his most important teachingsToward the end of his life he stated several times that as long as the teachings in this list were remembered and put into practice his message would endureThus the Wings cover in the Buddhas eyes the words and skills most worth mastering and passing along to othersWhen discussing the Buddhas teachings the best place to start is with his AwakeningThat way one will know where the teachings are coming from and where they are aimedTo appreciate the Awakening though we have to know what led Prince Siddhattha Gotama  the Buddha before his Awakening  to seek it in the first placeAccording to his own account the search began many lifetimes ago but in this lifetime it was sparked by the realization of the inevitability of aging illness and deathIn his wordsI lived in refinement utmost refinement total refinementMy father even had lotus ponds made in our palace one where red lotuses bloomed one where white lotuses bloomed one where blue lotuses bloomed all for my sakeI used no sandalwood that was not from VārāṇasīMy turban was from Vārāṇasī as were my tunic my lower garments  my outer cloakA white sunshade was held over me day  night to protect me from cold heat dust dirt  dewI had three palaces one for the cold season one for the hot season one for the rainy seasonDuring the four months of the rainy season I was entertained in the rainyseason palace by minstrels without a single man among them and I did not once come down from the palaceWhereas the servants workers  retainers in other peoples homes are fed meals of lentil soup  broken rice in my fathers home the servants workers  retainers were fed wheat rice  meatEven though I was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me When an untaught runofthemill person himself subject to aging not beyond aging sees another who is aged he is horrified humiliated  disgusted oblivious to himself that he too is subject to aging not beyond agingIf I  who am subject to aging not beyond aging  were to be horrified humiliated  disgusted on seeing another person who is aged that would not be fitting for me As I noticed this the young persons intoxication with youth entirely dropped awayEven though I was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me When an untaught runofthemill person himself subject to illness not beyond illness sees another who is ill he is horrified humiliated  disgusted oblivious to himself that he too is subject to illness not beyond illnessAnd if I  who am subject to illness not beyond illness  were to be horrified humiliated  disgusted on seeing another person who is ill that would not be fitting for me As I noticed this the healthy persons intoxication with health entirely dropped awayEven though I was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me When an untaught runofthemill person himself subject to death not beyond death sees another who is dead he is horrified humiliated  disgusted oblivious to himself that he too is subject to death not beyond deathAnd if I  who am subject to death not beyond death  were to be horrified humiliated  disgusted on seeing another person who is dead that would not be fitting for me As I noticed this the living persons intoxication with life entirely dropped awayBefore my selfawakening when I was still just an unawakened Bodhisatta being subject myself to birth aging illness death sorrow  defilement I sought what was subject to birth aging illness death sorrow  defilementThe thought occurred to me Why am I being subject myself to birth defilement seeking what is subject to birth defilementWhat if I were to seek the unborn unaging unailing undying sorrowless undefiled unexcelled security from bondage UnbindingSo at a later time when I was still young blackhaired endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life I shaved off my hair  beard  though my parents wished otherwise and were grieving with tears on their faces  and I put on the ochre robe and went forth from the home life into homelessnessThese passages are universal in their import but a fuller appreciation of why the young prince left home for the life of a homeless wanderer requires some understanding of the beliefs and social developments of his timePrince Siddhattha lived in an aristocratic republic in northern India during the sixth century BCE a time of great social upheavalA new monetary economy was replacing the older agrarian economyAbsolute monarchies in alliance with the newly forming merchant class were swallowing up the older aristocraciesAs often happens when an aristocratic elite is being disenfranchised people on all levels of society were beginning to call into question the beliefs that had supported the older order and were looking to science and other alternative modes of knowledge to provide them with a new view of lifeThe foremost science in North India at that time was astronomyNew precise observations of planetary movements combined with newly developed means of calculation had led astronomers to conclude that time was measured in aeons incomprehensibly long cycles that repeat themselves endlesslyTaking up these conclusions philosophers of the time tried to work out the implications of this vast temporal frame for the drama of human life and the quest for ultimate happinessThese philosophers fell into two broad camps those who conducted their speculations within the traditions of the Vedas early Indian religious and ritual texts that provided the orthodox beliefs of the old order and other unorthodox groups called the Samaṇas who questioned the authority of the VedasModern etymology derives the word Samaṇa from striver but the etymology of the time derived it from sama which means to be on pitch or in tune The Samaṇa philosophers were trying to find a way of life and thought that was in tune not with social conventions but with the laws of nature as these could be directly contemplated through scientific observation personal experience reason meditation or shamanic practices such as the pursuit of altered states of consciousness through fasting or other austeritiesMany of these forms of contemplation required that one abandon the constraints and responsibilities of the home life and take up the life of a homeless wandererThis was the rationale behind Prince Siddhatthas decision to leave the home life in order to see if there might be a true happiness beyond the sway of aging illness and deathAlready by his time philosophers of the Vedic and Samaṇa schools had developed widely differing interpretations of what the laws of nature were and how they affected the pursuit of true happinessTheir main points of disagreement were two Survival beyond deathMost Vedic and Samaṇa philosophers assumed that a persons identity extended beyond this lifetime aeons before birth back into the past and after death on into the future although there was some disagreement as to whether ones identity from life to life would change or remain the sameThe Vedas had viewed rebirth in a positive light but by the time of Prince Siddhattha the influence of the newly discovered astronomical cycles had led those who believed in rebirth to regard the cycles as pointless and restrictive and release as the only possibility for true happinessThere was however a Samaṇa school of hedonist materialists called Lokāyatans who denied the existence of any identity beyond death and insisted that happiness could be found only by indulging in sensual pleasures here and now CausalityMost philosophers accepted the idea that human action played a causative role in providing for ones future happiness both in this life and beyondViews about how this causal principle worked though differed from school to schoolFor some Vedists the only effective action was ritualThe Jains a Samaṇa school taught that all action fell under linear deterministic causal laws and formed a bond to the recurring cyclePresent experience they said came from past actions present actions would shape future experienceThis linear causality was also materialistic physical action created āsavas  sticky substances on the soul that kept it attached to the cycleAccording to them the only escape from the cycle lay in a life of nonviolence and inaction culminating in a slow suicide by starvation which would burn the āsavas away thus releasing the soulSome Upanishads  postVedic speculative texts  expressed causality as a morally neutral purely physical process of evolutionOthers stated that moral laws were intrinsic to the nature of causality rather than being mere social conventions and that the morality of an action determined how it affected ones future course in the round of rebirthWhether these last texts were composed before or after the Buddha taught this view though no one knowsAt any rate all preBuddhist thinkers who accepted the principle of causality however they expressed it saw it as a purely linear processOn the other side of the issue the Lokāyatans insisted that no causal principle acted between events and that all events were spontaneous and selfcausedThis meant that actions had no consequences and one could safely ignore moral rules in ones pursuit of sensual pleasureOne branch of another Samaṇa school the jīvakas insisted that causality was illusoryThe only truly existent things they said were the unchanging substances that formed the building blocks of the universeBecause causality implied change it was therefore unrealAs a result human action had no effect on anything of any substance  including happiness  and so was of no accountAnother branch of the same school which specialized in astrology insisted that causality was real but totally deterministicHuman life was entirely determined by impersonal amoral fate written in the stars human action played no role in providing for ones happiness or misery morality was purely a social conventionThus they insisted that release from the round of rebirth came only when the round worked itself outPeace of mind could be found by accepting ones fate and patiently waiting for the cycle like a ball of string unwinding to come to its endThese divergent viewpoints formed the intellectual backdrop for Prince Siddhatthas quest for ultimate happinessIn fact his Awakening may be seen as his own resolution of these two issuesThe Pali Canon records several different versions of the Buddhas own descriptions of his AwakeningThese descriptions are among the earliest extended autobiographical accounts in human historyThe Buddha presents himself as an explorer and experimenter  and an exceedingly brave one at that putting his life on the line in the search for an undying happinessAfter trying several false paths including formless mental absorptions and physical austerities he happened on the path that eventually worked bringing the mind into the present by focusing it on the breath and then making a calm mindful analysis of the processes of the mind as they presented themselves directly to his immediate awarenessSeeing these processes as inconstant stressful and notself he abandoned his sense of identification with themThis caused them to disband and what remained was Deathlessness beyond the dimensions of time and spaceThis was the happiness for which he had been seekingIn one passage of the Pali canon the Buddha noted that what he had come to realize in the course of his Awakening could be compared to the leaves of an entire forest what he taught to others was like a mere handful of leavesThe latter part comprised the essential points for helping others to attain Awakening themselvesThe part he had kept back would have been useless for that purposeThus when we discuss the Buddhas Awakening we must keep in mind that we know only a small sliver of the total eventHowever the sliver we do know is designed to aid in our own AwakeningThat is the part we will focus on here keeping the Buddhas purpose for teaching it constantly in mindWhen the Buddha later analyzed the process of Awakening he stated that it consisted of two kinds of knowledgeFirst there is the knowledge of the regularity of the Dhamma after which there is the knowledge of UnbindingThe regularity of the Dhamma here denotes the causal principle that underlies all fabricated experience ie experience made up of causal conditions and influencesKnowing this principle means mastering it one can not only trace the course of causal processes but also escape from them by skillfully letting them disbandThe knowledge of Unbinding is the realization of total freedom that comes when one has disbanded the causal processes of the realm of fabrication leaving the freedom from causal influences that is termed the UnfabricatedThe Buddhas choice of the word Unbinding  which literally means the extinguishing of a fire  derives from the way the physics of fire was viewed at his timeAs fire burned it was seen as clinging to its fuel in a state of entrapment and agitationWhen it went out it let go of its fuel growing calm and freeThus when the Indians of his time saw a fire going out they did not feel that they were watching extinctionRather they were seeing a metaphorical lesson in how freedom could be attained by letting goThe first knowledge that of the regularity of the Dhamma is the describable part of the process of Awakening the second knowledge that of Unbinding though indescribable is what guarantees the worth of the firstWhen one has been totally freed from all suffering and stress one knows that one has properly mastered the realm of fabrication and can vouch for the usefulness of the insights that led to that freedomTruth here is simply the way things work true knowledge is gauged by how skillfully one can manipulate themThere are many places in the Pali Canon where the Buddha describes his own act of Awakening to the first knowledge as consisting of three insightsThe first two insights were not the exclusive property of the Buddhist traditionShamanic traditions throughout the world have reported seers who have had similar insightsThe third insight however went beyond shamanism into a phenomenology of the mind ie a systematic account of phenomena as they are directly experiencedThis insight was exclusively Buddhist although it was based on the previous twoBecause it was multifaceted the Canon describes it from a variety of standpoints stressing different aspects as they apply to specific contextsIn the course of this book we too will explore specific facets of this insight from different anglesHere we will simply provide a general outline to show how the principle of skillful kamma underlay the main features of this insightThe Bodhisattas realization in his second insight that kamma determines how beings fare in the round of rebirth caused him to focus on the question of kamma in his third insightAnd because the second insight pointed to right and wrong views as the factors determining the quality of kamma he looked into the possibility that kamma was primarily a mental process rather than a physical one as the Vedists and Jains taughtAs a result he focused on the mental kamma that was taking place at that very moment in his mind to understand the process more clearlyIn particular he wanted to see if there might be a type of right view that instead of continuing the round of rebirth would bring release from itTo do this he realized that he would have to make his powers of discernment more skillful this meant that the process of developing skillfulness would have to be the kamma that he would observeNow in the process of developing a skill two major assumptions are made that there is a causal relationship between acts and their results and that good results are better than badIf these assumptions were not valid there would be no point in developing a skillThe Bodhisatta noticed that this point of view provided two variables  causes and results and favorable and unfavorable  that divided experience into four categories which he later formulated as the four noble truths stress its origination its cessation and the path to its cessationEach category he further realized entailed a dutyStress had to be comprehended its cause abandoned its cessation realized and the path to its cessation developedIn trying to comprehend stress and its relationship to kamma the Bodhisatta discovered that contrary to the teachings of the Jains kamma was not something extrinsic to the cycle of rebirth that bound one to the cycleRather the common cycle of kamma result and reaction was the cycle of rebirth in and of itself and the binding agent in the cycle was not kamma itself but rather an optional part of the reaction to the results of kammaThe Bodhisatta analyzed the cycle of kamma result and reaction into the following terms kamma is intention its result feeling the reaction to that feeling perception and attention  ie attention to perceptions about the feeling  which together form the views that color further intentionsIf perception and attention are clouded by ignorance craving and clinging they lead to stress and further ignorance forming the basis for intentions that keep the cycle in motionIn his later teachings the Buddha identified these clouding factors  forms of clinging together with their resultant states of becoming and ignorance  as the āsavas or effluents that act as binding agents to the cycleIn this way he took a Jain term and gave it a new meaning mental rather than physicalAt the same time his fullscale analysis of the interaction between kamma and the effluents formed one of the central points of his teaching termed dependent coarisingThe fact that it is possible to develop a skill suggested to the Bodhisatta while he was developing his third insight that the craving and clinging that cloud ones perceptions and attention did not necessarily follow on the feeling that resulted from kammaOtherwise there would be no way to develop skillful intentionsThus craving and clinging could be abandonedThis would require steady and refined acts of attention and intention which came down to welldeveloped concentration and discernment the central qualities in the path to the cessation of stressConcentration gave discernment the focus and solidity it needed to see clearly while discernment followed the twofold pattern that attention must play in the development of any skill sensitivity to the context of the act formed by preexisting factors coming from the past together with sensitivity to the act itself formed by present intentionsIn other words discernment had to see the results of an action as stemming from a combination of past and present causesAs the more blatant forms of craving clinging and ignorance were eradicated with the continued refinement of concentration and discernment there came a point where the only acts of attention and intention left to analyze were the acts of concentration and discernment in and of themselvesThe feedback loop that this process entailed  with concentration and discernment shaping one another in the immediate present  brought the investigation into such close quarters that the terms of analysis were reduced to the most basic words for pointing to present experiences this and that The double focus of discernment in terms of past and present influences was reduced to the most basic conditions that make up the experience of the present on the one hand and time on the otherAttention to present participation in the causal process was reduced to the basic condition for the experience of the present ie mutual presence while attention to influences from the past was reduced to the basic condition for the experience of time ie the dependence of one event on anotherThese expressions later formed the basic formula of the Buddhas teachings on causality which he termed thisthat conditionality to emphasize that the formula described patterns of events viewed in a mode of perception empty of any assumptions outside of what could be immediately perceivedAfter reaching this point there was nothing further that concentration and discernment  themselves being conditioned by time and the present  could doWhen all residual attachments even to these subtle realizations were let go there thus followed a state called nonfashioning in which the mind made absolutely no present input into experienceWith no present input to maintain experience of time and the present the cycle of fabricated experience disbandedThis formed an opening to the Unfabricated the undying happiness that the Bodhisatta now the Buddha had soughtThis was the knowledge of Unbinding or total releaseThe texts say that the Buddha spent a total of days after his Awakening sensitive to the bliss of release reviewing the implications of the insights that had brought about his AwakeningAt the end of this period he thought of teaching other living beingsAt first the subtlety and complexity of his Awakening made him wonder if anyone would be able to understand and benefit from his teachingsHowever after he ascertained through his new powers of mind that there were those who would understand he made the decision to teach determining that he would not enter total Unbinding until he had established his teachings  his doctrine and discipline  on a solid basis for the longterm benefit of human and divine beingsThe two primary knowledges that constituted the Awakening  knowledge of the regularity of the Dhamma and knowledge of Unbinding  played a major role in shaping what the Buddha taught and how he taught itOf the two the knowledge of Unbinding was the more importantIt not only guaranteed the truth of the other knowledge but also constituted the Buddhas whole purpose in teaching he wanted others to attain this happiness as wellHowever because the first knowledge was what led to the second it provided the guidelines that the Buddha used in determining what would be useful to communicate to others so that they too would arrive at the knowledge of Unbinding of their own accordThese guidelines were nothing other than the three insights of which this knowledge was composed recollection of past lives insight into the death and rebirth of beings and insight into the ending of the mental effluentsAs became clear during the Buddhas teaching career not all those who would reach the knowledge of Unbinding would need to gain direct insight into previous lifetimes or into the death and rebirth of other beings but they would have to gain direct insight into the ending of the mental effluentsThe mastery of causality that formed the heart of this insight thus formed the heart of his teaching with the first two insights providing the background against which the teachings were to be put into practiceAs we noted above the three insights taken together provided answers to the questions that had provoked Prince Siddhatthas quest for Awakening in the first placeHis remembrance of previous lives showed on the one hand that death is not annihilation but on the other hand that there is no core identity that remains unchanged or makes steady upward progress through the process of rebirthOne life follows another as one dream may follow another with similar wide swings in ones sense of who or where one isThus there is no inherent security in the processThe second insight  into the death and rebirth of beings throughout the cosmos  provided part of the answer to the questions surrounding the issue of causality in the pursuit of happinessThe primary causal factor is the mind and in particular the moral quality of the intentions comprising its thoughts words and deeds and the rightness of the views underlying themThus moral principles are inherent in the functioning of the cosmos rather than being mere social conventionsFor this reason any quest for happiness must focus on mastering the quality of the minds views and intentionsThe third insight  into the ending of the mental effluents  showed that escape from the cycle of rebirth could be found not through ritual action or total inaction but through the skillful development of a type of right view that abandoned the effluents that kept the cycle of kamma stress and ignorance in motionAs we have seen this type of right view went through three stages of refinement as the third insight progressed the four noble truths dependent coarising and thisthat conditionalityWe will discuss the first two stages in detail elsewhere in this bookHere we will focus on thisthat conditionality the most radical aspect of the Buddhas third insightIn terms of its content it explained how past and present intentions underlay all experience of time and the presentThe truth of this content was shown by its role in disbanding all experience of time and the present simply by bringing present intentions to a standstillSmall wonder then that this principle provided the most fundamental influence in shaping the Buddhas teachingThe Buddha expressed thisthat conditionality in a simplelooking formulaThere are many possible ways of interpreting this formula but only one does justice both to the way the formula is worded and to the complex fluid manner in which specific examples of causal relationships are described in the CanonThat way is to view the formula as the interplay of two causal principles one linear and the other synchronic that combine to form a nonlinear patternThe linear principle  taking and as a pair  connects events rather than objects over time the synchronic principle  and  connects objects and events in the present momentThe two principles intersect so that any given event is influenced by two sets of conditions input acting from the past and input acting from the presentAlthough each principle seems simple the fact that they interact makes their consequences very complexTo begin with every act has repercussions in the present moment together with reverberations extending into the futureDepending on the intensity of the act these reverberations can last for a very short or a very long timeThus every event takes place in a context determined by the combined effects of past events coming from a wide range in time together with the effects of present actsThese effects can intensify one another can coexist with little interaction or can cancel one another outThus even though it is possible to predict that a certain type of act will tend to give a certain type of result  for example acting on anger will lead to pain  there is no way to predict when or where that result will make itself feltThe complexity of the system is further enhanced by the fact that both causal principles meet at the mindThrough its views and intentions the mind takes a causal role in keeping both principles in actionThrough its sensory powers it is affected by the results of the causes it has set in motionThis creates the possibility for the causal principles to feed back into themselves as the mind reacts to the results of its own actionsThese reactions can take the form of positive feedback loops intensifying the original input and its results much like the howl in a speaker placed next to the microphone feeding into itThey can also create negative feedback loops counteracting the original input much like the action of a thermostat that turns off a heater when the temperature in a room is too high and turns it on again when it gets too lowBecause the results of actions can be immediate and the mind can then react to them immediately these feedback loops can at times quickly spin out of control at other times they may act as skillful checks on ones behaviorFor example a man may act out of anger which gives him an immediate sense of disease to which he may react with further anger thus creating a snowballing effectOn the other hand he may come to understand that the anger is causing his disease and so immediately does what he can to stop itHowever there can also be times when the results of his past actions may obscure the disease he is causing himself in the present so that he does not immediately react to it one way or anotherIn this way the combination of two causal principles  influences from the past interacting with those in the immediate present  accounts for the complexity of causal relationships as they function on the level of immediate experienceHowever the combination of the two principles also opens the possibility for finding a systematic way to break the causal webIf causes and effects were entirely linear the cosmos would be totally deterministic and nothing could be done to escape from the machinations of the causal processIf they were entirely synchronic there would be no relationship from one moment to the next and all events would be arbitraryThe web could break down totally or reform spontaneously for no reason at allHowever with the two modes working together one can learn from causal patterns observed from the past and apply ones insights to disentangling the same causal patterns acting in the presentIf ones insights are true one can then gain freedom from those patternsFor this reason the principle of thisthat conditionality provides an ideal foundation both theoretical and practical for a doctrine of releaseAnd as a teacher the Buddha took full advantage of its implications using it in such a way that it accounts not only for the presentation and content of his teachings but also for their organization their function and their utilityIt even accounts for the need for the teachings and for the fact that the Buddha was able to teach them in the first placeWe will take up these points in reverse orderThe fact of the teaching As noted above thisthat conditionality is a combination of two causal modes linear activity connecting events over time and synchronic causality connecting objects in the presentThe fact that the causal principle was not totally linear accounts for the fact that the Buddha was able to break the causal circle as soon as he had totally comprehended it and did not have to wait for all of his previous kamma to work itself out firstThe fact that the principle was not totally synchronic however accounts for the fact that he survived his Awakening and lived to tell about itAlthough his actions created no new kammic results after his Awakening he continued to live and teach under the influence of the kamma he had created before his Awakening finally passing away only when those kammic influences totally worked themselves outThus the combination of the two patterns allowed for an experience of the Unfabricated that could be survived opening the opportunity for the Buddha to teach others about it before his total UnbindingThe need for the teachings Thisthat conditionality even though it can be expressed in a simple formula is very complex in its workingoutAs a result the conditions of time and the present are bewildering to most peopleThis is particularly true in the process leading up to suffering and stressAs  states beings react to suffering in two ways bewilderment and a search for a way outIf the conditions for suffering were not so complex it would be the result of a simple regular process that would not be so confusingPeople would be able to understand it without any need for outside teachingsThe fact of its actual complexity however explains why people find it bewildering and as a result of their bewilderment have devised a wide variety of unskillful means to escape from it recourse to such external means as magic ritual revenge and force and to such internal means as denial repression selfhatred and prayerThus the complexity of thisthat conditionality accounts for the lack of skill that people bring to their lives  creating more suffering and stress in their attempts to escape suffering and stress  and shows that this lack of skill is a result of ignoranceThis explains the need for a teaching that points out the true nature of the causal system operating in the world so that proper understanding of the system can lead people to deal with it skillfully and actually gain the release they seekThe utility of the teachings The fact that thisthat conditionality allows for causal input from the present moment means that the causal process is not totally deterministicAlthough linear causality places restrictions on what can be done and known in any particular moment synchronic causality allows some room for free willHuman effort can thus make a difference in the immediate presentAt the same time the fact that the principle of thisthat conditionality is expressed in impersonal terms means that the Buddhas insights did not depend on any power peculiar to him personallyAs he noted in recounting his experience the realizations he attained were such that anyone who developed the mind to the same pitch of heedfulness ardency and resolution and then directed it to the proper task would be able to attain them as wellFor these reasons the act of teaching would not be futile because the mental qualities needed for the task of Awakening were available to other people who would have the freedom to develop them if they wanted toThe function of the teachings As chaos theory has shown in graphic terms any causal system that contains three or more feedback loops can develop into incredible complexity with small but wellplaced changes in input tipping the balance from complex order to seeming chaos or from chaos to order in the twinkling of an eyeA similar observation applies to thisthat conditionalityGiven the inherent complexity and instability of such a system a simple description of it would be futile the complexity would boggle the mind and the instability would ensure that any such description would not be helpful for longAt the same time the instability of the system makes it imperative for anyone immersed in such a system to find a way out for instability threatens any true chance for lasting peace or happinessThe complexity of the system requires that one find a reliable analysis of the sensitive points in the system and how they can be skillfully manipulated in a way that brings the system down from withinAll of these considerations play a role in determining the function for which the Buddha designed his teachingsThey are meant to act as a guide to skillful ways of understanding the principles underlying the causal system and to skillful ways of manipulating the causal factors so as to gain freedom from themThe concept of skillful and unskillful thoughts words and deeds thus plays a central role in the teachingIn fact the teachings themselves are meant to function as skillful thoughts toward the goal of AwakeningThe Buddha was very clear on the point that he did not mean for his teachings to become a metaphysical system or for them to be adhered to simply for the sake of their truth valueHe discussed metaphysical topics only when they could play a role in skillful behaviorMany metaphysical questions  such as whether or not there is a soul or self whether or not the world is eternal whether or not it is infinite etc he refused to answer on the grounds that they were either counterproductive or irrelevant to the task at hand that of gaining escape from the stress and suffering inherent in time and the presentAlthough the Buddha insisted that all of his teachings were true  none of his skillful means were useful fictions  they were to be put aside when one had fully benefited from putting them into practiceIn his teachings true but conditioned knowledge is put into service to an unconditioned goal a release so total that no conditioned truths can encompass itBecause a meditator has to use causal factors in order to disband the causal system heshe has to make use of factors that eventually have to be transcendedThis pattern of developing qualities in the practice that one must eventually let go as one attains the Unfabricated is common throughout the Buddhas teachingsEventually even skillfulness itself has to be transcendedThe organization of the teachings The fact that the causal system contains many feedback loops means that a particular causal connection  either one that continues the system or one designed to disband it  can follow one of several pathsThus there is a need for a variety of explanations for people who find themselves involved in these different pathsThis need explains the topical organization of the Buddhas teachings in his discoursesIn talking to different people or to the same people at different times he gave different accounts of the causal links leading up to stress and suffering and to the knowledge that can bring that stress and suffering to an endThose who have tried to form a single consistent account of Buddhist causal analyses have found themselves stymied by this fact and have often discounted the wide variety of analyses by insisting that only one of them is the true Buddhist analysis or that only the general principle of mutual causality is important the individual links of the analyses being immaterial or that the Buddha did not really understand causality at allNone of these positions do justice to the Buddhas skill as a teacher of this person and that each caught at different junctures in the feedback loops of thisthat conditionalityAs we will see when we consider the Wings to Awakening in detail the Buddha listed different ways of envisioning the causal factors at work in developing the knowledge needed to gain release from the realm of fabricationAlthough the lists follow different lines of thisthat conditionality he insisted that they were equivalentThus any fair account of his teachings must make room for the variety of paths he outlined and for the fact that each is helpfully specific and preciseThe content of the teachings Perhaps one of the most radical aspects of the Buddhas teachings is the assertion that the factors at work in the cosmos at large are the same as those at work in the way each individual mind processes experienceThese processes rather than the sensory data that they process are primary in ones experience of the cosmosIf one can disband the act of processing one is freed from the cosmic causal netWhat this means in the case of the individual mind  engaged in and suffering from the processes of time and the present  is that the way out is to be found by focusing directly on the processing of present experience for that is where the crucial issues play themselves out most clearlyHere and now is where everything important is happening not there and thenAt the same time the skills needed to deal with these issues are skills of the mind proper ways of analyzing what one experiences and proper qualities of mind to bring to the analysis to make it as clear and effective as possibleThis boils down to the proper frame of reference the proper quality of awareness and the proper mode of analysisThese are precisely the topics covered in the Wings to Awakening although as ones skill develops they coalesce the quality of awareness itself becomes the frame of reference and the object to which the analysis is appliedThe presentation of the teaching Because the Buddhas listeners were already caught in the midst of the web of thisthat conditionality he had to present his message in a way that spoke to their conditionThis meant that he had to be sensitive both to the linear effects of past kamma that might either prevent or support the listeners ability to benefit from the teaching and to the listeners current attitudes and concernsA person whose adverse past kamma prevented Awakening in this lifetime might benefit from a more elementary teaching that would put himher in a better position to gain Awakening in a future lifetimeAnother persons past kamma might open the possibility for Awakening in this lifetime but hisher present attitude might have to be changed before heshe was willing to accept the teachingA second complication entailed by the principle of thisthat conditionality is that it has to be known and mastered at the level of direct experience in and of itselfThis mastery is thus a task that each person must do for him or herselfNo one can master direct experience for anyone elseThe Buddha therefore had to find a way to induce his listeners to accept his diagnosis of their sufferings and his prescription for their cureHe also had to convince them to believe in their own ability to follow the instructions and obtain the desired resultsTo use a traditional Buddhist analogy the Buddha was like a doctor who had to convince his patients to administer a cure to themselves much as a doctor has to convince his patients to follow his directions in taking medicine getting exercise changing their diet and lifestyle and so forthThe Buddha had an additional difficulty however in that his definition of health  Unbinding  was something that none of his listeners had yet experienced for themselvesHence the most important point of his teaching was something that his listeners would have to take on faithOnly when they had seen the results of putting the teachings into practice for themselves would faith no longer be necessaryThus for every listener faith in the Buddhas Awakening was a prerequisite for advanced growth in the teachingWithout faith in the fact of the Buddhas knowledge of Unbinding one could not fully accept his prescriptionWithout faith in the regularity of the Dhamma  including conviction in the principle of kamma and the impersonality of the causal law making the path open in principle to everyone  one could not fully have faith in ones own ability to follow the pathOf course this faith would then be confirmed step by step as one followed the teaching and began gaining results but full confirmation would come only with an experience of AwakeningPrior to that point ones trust bolstered only by partial results would have to be a matter of faithAcquiring this faith is called going for refuge in the BuddhaThe refuge here derives from the fact that one has placed trust in the truth of the Buddhas Awakening and expects that by following his teachings  in particular the principle of skillful kamma  one protects oneself from creating further suffering for oneself or others eventually reaching true unconditioned happinessThis act of going for refuge is what qualifies one as a Buddhist  as opposed to someone simply interested in the Buddhas teachings  and puts one in a position to benefit fully from what the Buddha taughtThe Buddha employed various means of instilling faith in his listeners but the primary means fall into three classes his character his psychic powers and his powers of reasonWhen he gave his first sermon  to the Five Brethren his former compatriots  he had to preface his remarks by reminding them of his honest and responsible character before they would willingly listen to himWhen he taught the Kassapa brothers he first had to subdue their pride with a dazzling array of psychic featsIn most cases however he needed only to reason with his listeners and interlocutors although here again he had to be sensitive to the level of their minds so that he could lead them step by step taking them from what they saw as immediately apparent and directing them to ever higher and more subtle pointsThe typical pattern was for the Buddha to begin with the immediate joys of generosity and virtue followed by the longerterm sensual rewards of these qualities in line with the principle of kamma then the ultimate drawbacks of those sensual rewards and finally the benefits of renunciationIf his listeners could follow his reasoning this far they would be ready for the more advanced teachingsWe often view reason as something distinct from faith but for the Buddha it was simply one way of instilling faith or conviction in his listenersAt several points in the Pali Canon he points out the fallacies that can result when one draws reasoned conclusions from a limited range of experience from false analogies or from inappropriate modes of analysisBecause his teachings could not be proven prior to an experience of Awakening he recognized that the proper use of reason was not in trying to prove his teachings but simply in showing that they made sensePeople can make sense of things when they see them as similar to something they already know and understandThus the main function of reason in presenting the teachings is in finding proper analogies for understanding them hence the many metaphors and similes used throughout the textsFaith based on reason and understanding the Buddha taught was more solid than unreasoned faith but neither could substitute for the direct knowledge of the regularity of the Dhamma and of Unbinding for only the experience of Unbinding was a guarantee of true knowledgeNevertheless faith was a prerequisite for attaining that direct knowledgeOnly when the initial presentation of the teaching had aroused faith in the listener would heshe be in a position to benefit from a lessadorned presentation of the content and put it into practiceThe need for various ways of presenting his points on a wide range of levels meant that the body of the Buddhas teachings grew ever more varied and immense with timeAs his career drew to a close he found it necessary to highlight the essential core of the teaching the unadorned content so that the more timeless aspects of his message would remain clear in his followers mindsSocieties and cultures inevitably change so that what counts as effective persuasion in one time and place may be ineffective in anotherThe basic structure of thisthat conditionality does not change however the qualities of the mind needed for mastering causality and realizing the Unfabricated will always remain the sameThe Buddha thus presented the Wings to Awakening as the unadorned content the timeless essential coreEven here however the principle of thisthat conditionality affected his presentationHe needed to find principles that would be relatively immune to changes in society and cultureHe needed a mode of presentation that was simple enough to memorize but not so simplistic as to distort or limit the teachingHe also needed words that would point not to abstractions but to the immediate realities of awareness in the listeners own mindAnd finally he needed a useful framework for the teaching as a whole so that those who wanted to track down specific points would not lose sight of how those points fit into the larger picture of the practiceHis solution was to give lists of mental qualities as we noted above rather than any of the more abstruse philosophical doctrines that are often cited as distinctively BuddhistThese mental qualities are immediately present to at least some extent in every human mindThus they retain a constant meaning no matter what changes occur in ones mental landscape or cultural horizonsThe Buddha presents them in seven alternative interconnected listsEach list  when all of its implications are worked out  is equivalent to all of the others in its effects but each takes a distinctive approach to the practiceThus the lists provide enough variety to meet the needs of people caught in different parts of the causal networkAs one searches the texts for explanations of the meaning of specific terms and factors in the lists one finds that the lists connect  directly or indirectly  with everything thereAt the same time the categories of the lists because they point to qualities in the mind encourage the listener to regard the teachings not as a system in and of themselves but as tools for looking directly into hisher own mind where the sources and solutions to the problem of suffering lieAs a result although the lists are short and simple they are an effective introduction to the teaching and a guide to its practiceFrom his experience with thisthat conditionality on the path the Buddha had seen that if one develops the mental qualities listed in any one of these seven sets focuses them on the present keeping in mind the four frames of reference and analyzing what appears to ones immediate awareness in terms of the categories of the four noble truths one will inevitably come to the same realizations that he did the regularity of the Dhamma and the reality of UnbindingThis was the happiness he himself sought and found and that he wanted others to attainIn addition to the seven lists the Buddha left behind a monastic order designed not only so that the teachings would be memorized from generation to generation but also so that future generations would have living examples of the teaching to learn from and a conducive social environment in which to put them into practiceThis environment was intended as a gift not only for those who would ordain but also for those lay people who associated with the order taking the opportunity to develop their own generosity morality and mindfulness in the processAssociating with others who are following a sensitive disciplinary code forces one to become more sensitive and disciplined oneselfAlthough our concern in this book is with the Dhamma or the teaching of the Wings to Awakening we should not forget that the Buddha named his teaching DhammaVinayaThe Vinaya was the set of rules and regulations he established for the smooth running of the orderDhamma is the primary member of the compound but the Vinaya forms the context that helps keep it aliveThey meet in a common focus on the factor of intentionThe Vinaya uses its rules not only to foster communal order but also to sensitize individual practitioners to the element of intention in all their actionsThe Dhamma then makes use of this sensitivity as a means of fostering the insights that lead to AwakeningAfter he had placed the DhammaVinaya on a sure footing the Buddha passed away into total UnbindingThis event has provoked a great deal of controversy within and without the Buddhist tradition some people saying that if the Buddha was truly compassionate he should have taken repeated rebirth so that the rest of humanity could continue to benefit from the excellent qualities that he had built into his mindHis total Unbinding however can be seen as one of his greatest kindnesses to his followersHe showed by example that although the path to true happiness entails generosity and kindness to others the goal of the path needs no justification in terms of anything elseThe limitless freedom of Unbinding is a worthy end for its own sakeSocietys usual demand that people must justify their actions by appeal to the continued smooth functioning of society or the happiness of others has no sway over the innate worth of this levelThe Buddha made use of the kammic residue remaining after his Awakening to make a free gift of the DhammaVinaya to all who care about genuine happiness and health but when those residues were exhausted he took the noble way of true health as an example and challenge to us allThus the DhammaVinaya can be seen as the Buddhas generous gift to posterityThe rules of the Vinaya offer an environment for practice while the Wings to Awakening are an invitation and guide to that practice leading to true happinessAnyone anywhere who is seriously interested in true happiness is welcome to focus on the qualities listed here to see if thisthat conditionality is indeed the causal principle governing the dimensions of time and the present and to test if it can be mastered in a way that leads to the promised result freedom transcending those dimensions totally beyond measure and unboundOf all the concepts central to Buddhism merit is one of the least known and least appreciated in the WestThis is perhaps because the pursuit of merit seems to be a lowly practice focused on getting and selfing whereas higher Buddhist practice focuses on letting go particularly of any sense of selfBecause we in the West often feel pressed for time we dont want to waste our time on lowly practices and instead want to go straight to the higher levelsYet the Buddha repeatedly warns that the higher levels cannot be practiced in a stable manner unless they develop on a strong foundationThe pursuit of merit provides that foundationTo paraphrase a modern Buddhist psychologist one cannot wisely let go of ones sense of self until one has developed a wise sense of selfThe pursuit of merit is the Buddhist way to develop a wise sense of selfThe following readings show how this is doneThey begin with a section on basic wisdom which shows how the questions that lead ultimately to the wisdom of letting go first focus on things to hold onto the skillful traits that on the beginning level provide a secure place to stand while letting go of character traits that are obviously harmfulBuddhist wisdom famously focuses in the characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself but the application of that wisdom grows out of the pursuit of what is relatively constant and pleasant and requires a mature sense of self able to plan for the future to sacrifice shortterm happiness for longterm happiness to consider the needs of others and to develop a strong sense of selfreliance in the pursuit of a happiness that is wise pure and compassionateThe section on merit then sets out in general terms the types of meritorious activities that conduce to that happiness focusing primarily on three giving virtue and meditationThe next three sections focus on the ways in which each of these activities can be pursued so as to produce the most happinessFor instance the section on giving discusses how the happiness of generosity can be maximized by wisely choosing the proper motivation for giving a gift a proper gift and a proper recipient for ones giftThe section on virtue shows how to learn from ones past mistakes without succumbing to debilitating feelings of guiltThe section on meditation discusses not only how the development of good will  the meditative practice most often cited in conjunction with merit  can lead to happiness both now and in the future but also how it can help minimize the bad results of ones past unwise actionsAll three of these forms of merit conduce to the highest form of merit the realization of streamentry the first glimpse of the deathlessThus the penultimate section of this study guide focuses on the happiness and wellbeing that derive from this attainmentFor all the rewards of meritorious action however the concluding section serves as a reminder that the pursuit of happiness ultimately leads beyond the pursuit of meritIn fact this study guide is planned as part of a twopart study guide covering the Buddhist approach to the pursuit of happiness with the second part discussing the teachings on the three characteristics as the next stage in this approach as they lead to the deathless happiness attained with arahantshipStill it would be a mistake to view the two stages as radically separateIn the course of developing a wise sense of self in the pursuit of merit one is already learning how to let go of unwise ways of selfing as one learns to overcome stinginess apathy and hardheartedness through the development of giving virtue and good willThe teachings on the three characteristics simply carry this same process of deselfing for the sake of an even truer happiness to a higher pitchThere are some cases in which a person overcome with pain his mind exhausted grieves mourns laments beats his breast  becomes bewilderedOr one overcome with pain his mind exhausted comes to search outside Who knows a way or two to stop this pain I tell you monks that stress results either in bewilderment or in searchThis is the way leading to discernment when visiting a brahman or contemplative to ask What is skillful venerable sirWhat is unskillfulWhat is blameworthyWhat is blamelessWhat should be cultivatedWhat should not be cultivatedWhat when I do it will be for my longterm harm  sufferingOr what when I do it will be for my longterm welfare  happinessWhat do you think Rahula What is a mirror forFor reflection sirIn the same way Rahula bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts are to be done with repeated reflectionWhenever you want to perform a bodily act you should reflect on it This bodily act I want to perform  would it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to bothIs it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results If on reflection you know that it would lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it would be an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then any bodily act of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to doBut if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction it would be a skillful bodily action with happy consequences happy results then any bodily act of that sort is fit for you to doWhile you are performing a bodily act you should reflect on it This bodily act I am doing  is it leading to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to bothIs it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results If on reflection you know that it is leading to selfaffliction to affliction of others or both you should give it upBut if on reflection you know that it is not you may continue with itHaving performed a bodily act you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then you should confess it reveal it lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy lifeHaving confessed it you should exercise restraint in the futureBut if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful bodily action with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed  joyful training day  night in skillful mental qualitiesHaving performed a mental act you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful mental act with painful consequences painful results then you should feel distressed ashamed  disgusted with itFeeling distressed you should exercise restraint in the futureBut if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful mental action with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed  joyful training day  night in skillful mental qualitiesRahula all those brahmans  contemplatives in the course of the past who purified their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts did it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts in just this wayAll those brahmans  contemplatives in the course of the future who will purify their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts will do it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts in just this wayAll those brahmans  contemplatives at present who purify their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts do it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts in just this wayThus Rahula you should train yourself I will purify my bodily acts through repeated reflectionI will purify my verbal acts through repeated reflectionI will purify my mental acts through repeated reflection Thats how you should train yourselfAs for the course of action that is unpleasant to do but that when done leads to what is profitable its in light of this course of action that one may be known  in terms of manly stamina manly persistence manly effort  as a fool or a wise personFor a fool doesnt reflect Even though this course of action is unpleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is profitable So he doesnt do it and thus the nondoing of that course of action leads to what is unprofitable for himBut a wise person reflects Even though this course of action is unpleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is profitable So he does it and thus the doing of that course of action leads to what is profitable for himAs for the course of action that is pleasant to do but that when done leads to what is unprofitable its in light of this course of action that one may be known  in terms of manly stamina manly persistence manly effort  as a fool or a wise personFor a fool doesnt reflect Even though this course of action is pleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is unprofitable So he does it and thus the doing of that course of action leads to what is unprofitable for himBut a wise person reflects Even though this course of action is pleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is unprofitable So he doesnt do it and thus the nondoing of that course of action leads to what is profitable for himAnd what is the self as a governing principleThere is the case where a monk having gone to a wilderness to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling reflects on this Its not for the sake of robes that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness its not for the sake of almsfood for the sake of lodgings or for the sake of this or that state of becoming that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessnessSimply that I am beset by birth aging  death by sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs beset by stress overcome with stress Perhaps the end of this entire mass of suffering  stress might be known Now if I were to seek the same sort of sensual pleasures that I abandoned in going forth from home into homelessness  or a worse sort  that would not be fitting for me So he reflects on this My persistence will be aroused  not lax my mindfulness established  not confused my body calm  not aroused my mind centered  unified Having made himself his governing principle he abandons what is unskillful develops what is skillful abandons what is blameworthy develops what is unblameworthy and looks after himself in a pure wayThis is called the self as a governing principleThis body comes into being through conceitAnd yet it is by relying on conceit that conceit is to be abandoned Thus it was saidAnd in reference to what was it saidThere is the case sister where a monk hears The monk named suchandsuch they say through the ending of the fermentations has entered  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known  realized them for himself right in the here  now The thought occurs to him The monk named suchsuch they say through the ending of the fermentations has entered  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known  realized them for himself right in the here  nowThen why not me Then at a later time he abandons conceit having relied on conceitThese four types of action have been understood realized  made known by meWhich fourThere is action that is dark with dark result action that is white with white result action that is dark  white with dark  white result and action that is neither dark nor white with neither dark nor white result leading to the ending of actionAnd what is action that is dark with dark resultThere is the case where a certain person fabricates an injurious bodily fabrication an injurious verbal fabrication an injurious mental fabrication He rearises in an injurious world where he is touched by injurious contacts He experiences feelings that are exclusively painful like those of the beings in hellThis is called action that is dark with dark resultAnd what is action that is white with white resultThere is the case where a certain person fabricates an uninjurious bodily fabrication an uninjurious verbal fabrication an uninjurious mental fabrication He rearises in an uninjurious world where he is touched by uninjurious contacts He experiences feelings that are exclusively pleasant like those of the Everradiant DevasThis is called kamma that is white with white resultAnd what is action that is dark  white with dark  white resultThere is the case where a certain person fabricates a bodily fabrication that is injurious  uninjurious a verbal fabrication that is injurious  uninjurious a mental fabrication that is injurious  uninjurious He rearises in an injurious  uninjurious world where he is touched by injurious  uninjurious contacts He experiences injurious  uninjurious feelings pleasure mingled with pain like those of human beings some devas and some beings in the lower realmsThis is called kamma that is dark  white with dark  white resultAnd what is action that is neither dark nor white with neither dark nor white result leading to the ending of actionThe intention right there to abandon this action that is dark with dark result this action that is white with white result this action that is dark  white with dark  white resultThis is called action that is neither dark nor white with neither dark nor white result leading to the ending of actionAnd what is action that is neither dark nor white with neither dark nor white result leading to the ending of actionRight view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationSo aiming at Suppabuddha the leper the Blessed One gave a stepbystep talk ie a talk on generosity on virtue on heaven he declared the drawbacks degradation  corruption of sensual passions and the rewards of renunciationThen when he saw that Suppabuddha the lepers mind was ready malleable free from hindrances elated  bright he then gave the Dhammatalk peculiar to Awakened Ones ie stress origination cessation  pathAnd just as a clean cloth free of stains would properly absorb a dye in the same way as Suppabuddha the leper was sitting in that very seat the dustless stainless Dhamma eye arose within him Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessationThis was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard Monks dont be afraid of acts of meritThis is another way of saying what is blissful desirable pleasing endearing charming  ie acts of meritI am cognizant that having long performed meritorious deeds I long experienced desirable pleasing endearing charming resultsHaving developed a mind of good will for seven years then for seven aeons of contraction  expansion I didnt return to this worldWhenever the aeon was contracting I went to the realm of Streaming RadianceWhenever the aeon was expanding I reappeared in an empty BrahmaabodeThere I was the Great Brahman the Unconquered Conqueror Allseeing  Wielder of PowerThen for thirtysix times I was Sakka ruler of the godsFor many hundreds of times I was a king a wheelturning emperor a righteous king of Dhamma conqueror of the four corners of the earth maintaining stable control over the countryside endowed with the seven treasures  to say nothing of the times I was a local kingThe thought occurred to me Of what action of mine is this the fruit of what action the result that I now have such great power  might Then the thought occurred to me This is the fruit of my three action the result of three types of action that I now have such great power  might ie generosity selfcontrol  restraintThis was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard There are these three grounds for meritorious activityWhich threeThe ground for meritorious activity made of generosity the ground for meritorious activity made of virtue and the ground for meritorious activity made of developmentThese are the three grounds for meritorious activityThis was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard I have seen beings who  endowed with bodily good conduct verbal good conduct  mental good conduct who did not revile noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  at the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destination the heavenly worldIt is not from having heard this from other brahmans  contemplatives that I tell you that I have seen beings who  endowed with bodily good conduct verbal good conduct  mental good conduct who did not revile noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  at the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destination the heavenly worldIt is from having known it myself seen it myself realized it myself that I tell you that I have seen beings who  endowed with bodily good conduct verbal good conduct  mental good conduct who did not revile noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  at the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destination the heavenly worldAs he was sitting to one side King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One Just now lord while I was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in my awareness Who are dear to themselves and who are not dear to themselves Then it occurred to me Those who engage in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct are not dear to themselvesEven though they may say We are dear to ourselves still they arent dear to themselvesWhy is thatOf their own accord they act toward themselves as an enemy would act toward an enemy thus they arent dear to themselvesBut those who engage in good bodily conduct good verbal conduct  good mental conduct are dear to themselvesEven though they may say We arent dear to ourselves still they are dear to themselvesWhy is thatOf their own accord they act toward themselves as a dear one would act toward a dear one thus they are dear to themselves Thats the way it is great kingThats the way it isThose who engage in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct are not dear to themselvesEven though they may say We are dear to ourselves still they arent dear to themselvesWhy is thatOf their own accord they act toward themselves as an enemy would act toward an enemy thus they arent dear to themselvesBut those who engage in good bodily conduct good verbal conduct  good mental conduct are dear to themselvesEven though they may say We arent dear to ourselves still they are dear to themselvesWhy is thatOf their own accord they act toward themselves as a dear one would act toward a dear one thus they are dear to themselvesThat is what the Blessed One saidHaving said that the One WellGone the Teacher said furtherAs he was sitting to one side King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One Is there lord any one quality that keeps both kinds of benefits secure  benefits in this life  benefits in lives to comeThere is one quality great king that keeps both kinds of benefits secure  benefits in this life  benefits in lives to comeBut what venerable sir is that one qualityHeedfulness great kingJust as the footprints of all living beings with legs can be encompassed by the footprint of the elephant and the elephants footprint is declared to be supreme among them in terms of its great size in the same way heedfulness is the one quality that keeps both kinds of benefits secure  benefits in this life  benefits in lives to comeThat is what the Blessed One saidHaving said that the One WellGone the Teacher said furtherWithout abandoning these five qualities one is incapable of entering  remaining in the first jhana second jhana the third jhana the fourth jhana incapable of realizing the fruit of streamentry the fruit of oncereturning the fruit of nonreturning arahantshipWhich fiveStinginess as to ones monastery ones family ones gains ones status and stinginess as to the DhammaAnd what is the treasure of generosityThere is the case of a disciple of the noble ones his awareness cleansed of the stain of stinginess living at home freely generous openhanded delighting in being magnanimous responsive to requests delighting in the distribution of almsThis is called the treasure of generosityThen another deva exclaimed in the Blessed Ones presenceThese are the five rewards of generosity One is dear and appealing to people at large one is admired by good people ones good name is spread about one does not stray from the rightful duties of the householder and with the breakup of the body at death one reappears in a good destination in the heavenly worldsIf beings knew as I know the results of giving and sharing they would not eat without have given nor would the stain of miserliness overcome their mindsEven if it were their last bite their last mouthful they would not eat without having shared if there were someone to receive their giftBut because beings do not know as I know the results of giving and sharing they eat without have givenThe stain of miserliness overcomes their mindsAsibandhakaputta the headman said to the Blessed One Venerable sir doesnt the Blessed One in many ways praise kindness protection  sympathy for familiesYes headman the Tathagata in many ways praises kindness protection  sympathy for familiesThen how venerable sir is the Blessed One together with a large community of monks wandering on tour around Nalanda in the midst of famine a time of scarcity when the crops are white with blight and turned to strawThe Blessed One is practicing for the ruin of familiesThe Blessed One is practicing for the demise of familiesThe Blessed One is practicing for the downfall of familiesHeadman recollecting back over aeons I do not know any family to have been brought to downfall through the giving of cooked almsOn the contrary Whatever families are rich with much wealth with many possessions with a great deal of money a great many accoutrements of wealth a great many commodities all have become so from giving from truth from restraintIn giving a meal the donor gives five things to the recipientWhich fiveHeshe gives life beauty happiness strength  quickwittednessHaving given life heshe has a share in long life either human or divineHaving given beauty heshe has a share in beauty either human or divineHaving given happiness heshe has a share in happiness either human or divineHaving given strength heshe has a share in strength either human or divineHaving given quickwittedness heshe has a share in quickwittedness either human or divineIn giving a meal the donor gives these five things to the recipientThen a certain devata in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jetas Grove went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him stood to one sideAs she was standing there she recited these verses in the Blessed Ones presenceNow on that occasion Princess Sumana  with an entourage of ladiesinwaiting riding on carriages  went to where the Buddha was stayingOn arrival having bowed down she sat to one sideAs she was sitting there she said to the Blessed One Suppose there were two disciples of the Blessed One equal in conviction virtue and discernment but one was a giver of alms and the other was notAt the breakup of the body after death they would reappear in a good destination in the heavenly worldHaving become devas would there be any distinction any difference between the twoYes there would said the Blessed OneThe one who was a giver of alms on becoming a deva would surpass the other in five areas in divine life span divine beauty divine pleasure divine status and divine power And if they were to fall from there and reappear in this world Having become human beings would there be any distinction any difference between the twoYes there would said the Blessed OneThe one who was a giver of alms on becoming a human being would surpass the other in five areas in human life span human beauty human pleasure human status and human power And if they were to go forth from home into the homeless life of a monk Having gone forth would there be any distinction any difference between the twoYes there would said the Blessed OneThe one who was a giver of alms on going forth would surpass the other in five areas He would often be asked to make use of robes it would be rare that he wouldnt be askedHe would often be asked to take food to make use of shelter to make use of medicine it would be rare that he wouldnt be askedHis companions in the holy life would often treat him with pleasing actions pleasing words pleasing thoughts and present him with pleasing gifts and rarely with unpleasing And if both were to attain arahantship would there be any distinction any difference between their attainments of arahantshipIn that case I tell you that there would be no difference between the two as to their releaseIts awesome lord and astoundingJust this is reason enough to give alms to make merit in that it benefits one as a deva as a human being and as a monkThen Janussonin the brahman went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama you know that we brahmans give gifts make offerings May this gift accrue to our dead relativesMay our dead relatives partake of this gift Now Master Gotama does that gift accrue to our dead relativesDo our dead relatives partake of that giftIn possible places brahman it accrues to them but not in impossible placesAnd which Master Gotama are the possible placesWhich are the impossible placesThere is the case brahman where a certain person takes life takes what is not given engages in sensual misconduct engages in false speech engages in divisive speech engages in abusive speech engages in idle chatter is covetous bears ill will and has wrong viewsWith the breakup of the body after death he reappears in hellHe lives there he remains there by means of whatever is the food of hellbeingsThis is an impossible place for that gift to accrue to one staying thereThen there is the case where a certain person takes life takes what is not given engages in sensual misconduct engages in false speech engages in divisive speech engages in abusive speech engages in idle chatter is covetous bears ill will and has wrong viewsWith the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the animal wombHe lives there he remains there by means of whatever is the food of common animalsThis too is an impossible place for that gift to accrue to one staying thereThen there is the case where a certain person refrains from taking life refrains from taking what is not given refrains from sensual misconduct refrains from false speech refrains from divisive speech refrains from abusive speech refrains from idle chatter is not covetous bears no ill will and has right viewsWith the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of human beingsHe lives there he remains there by means of whatever is the food of human beingsThis too is an impossible place for that gift to accrue to one staying thereThen there is the case where a certain person refrains from taking life refrains from taking what is not given refrains from sensual misconduct refrains from false speech refrains from divisive speech refrains from abusive speech refrains from idle chatter is not covetous bears no ill will and has right viewsWith the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of the devasHe lives there he remains there by means of whatever is the food of devasThis too is an impossible place for that gift to accrue to one staying thereThen there is the case where a certain person takes life takes what is not given engages in sensual misconduct engages in false speech engages in divisive speech engages in abusive speech engages in idle chatter is covetous bears ill will and has wrong viewsWith the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the realms of the hungry shadesHe lives there he remains there by means of whatever is the food of hungry shadesHe lives there he remains that by means of whatever his friends or relatives give in dedication to himThis is the possible place for that gift to accrue to one staying thereBut Master Gotama if that dead relative does not reappear in that possible place who partakes of that giftOther dead relatives brahman who have reappeared in that possible placeBut Master Gotama if that dead relative does not reappear in that possible place and other dead relatives have not reappeared in that possible place then who partakes of that giftIts impossible brahman it cannot be that over this long time that possible place is devoid of ones dead relativesBut at any rate the donor does not go without rewardDoes Master Gotama describe any preparation for the impossible placesBrahman I do describe a preparation for the impossible placesThere is the case where a certain person takes life takes what is not given engages in sensual misconduct engages in false speech engages in divisive speech engages in abusive speech engages in idle chatter is covetous bears ill will and has wrong viewsBut he gives food drink cloth vehicles garlands scents creams bed lodging  lamps to brahmans  contemplativesWith the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of elephantsThere he receives food drink flowers  various ornamentsIts because he took life took what is not given engaged in sensual misconduct engaged in false speech engaged in divisive speech engaged in abusive speech engaged in idle chatter was covetous bore ill will and had wrong views that he reappears in the company of elephantsBut its because he gave food drink cloth vehicles garlands scents creams bed lodging  lamps to brahmans  contemplatives that he receives food drink flowers  various ornamentsThen there is the case where a certain person takes life has wrong viewsBut he gives food lamps to brahmans  contemplativesWith the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of horses in the company of cattle in the company of poultryThere he receives food drink flowers  various ornamentsIts because he took life and had wrong views that he reappears in the company of poultryBut its because he gave food drink  lamps to brahmans  contemplatives that he receives food drink flowers  various ornamentsThen there is the case where a certain person refrains from taking life refrains from taking what is not given refrains from sensual misconduct refrains from false speech refrains from divisive speech refrains from abusive speech refrains from idle chatter is not covetous bears no ill will and has right viewsAnd he gives food drink cloth vehicles garlands scents creams bed lodging  lamps to brahmans  contemplativesWith the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of human beingsThere he experiences the five strings of human sensualityIts because he refrained from taking what is not given refrained from sensual misconduct refrained from false speech refrained from divisive speech refrained from abusive speech refrained from idle chatter was not covetous bore no ill will and had right views that he reappears in the company of human beingsAnd its because he gave food drink cloth vehicles garlands scents creams bed lodging  lamps to brahmans  contemplatives that he experiences the five strings of human sensualityThen there is the case where a certain person refrains from taking life and has right viewsAnd he gives food drink cloth vehicles garlands scents creams bed lodging  lamps to brahmans  contemplativesWith the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of devasThere he experiences the five strings of divine sensualityIts because he refrained from taking what is not given and had right views that he reappears in the company of devasAnd its because he gave food drink cloth vehicles garlands scents creams bed lodging  lamps to brahmans  contemplatives that he experiences the five strings of divine sensualityBut at any rate brahman the donor does not go without rewardIts amazing Master Gotama its astounding how its enough to make one want to give a gift enough to make one want to make an offering where the donor does not go without rewardThats the way it is brahmanThats the way it isThe donor does not go without rewardMagnificent Master GotamaMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monksMay Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeThen VenSariputta together with the lay followers from Campa went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Might there be the case where a person gives a gift of a certain sort and it does not bear great fruit or great benefit whereas another person gives a gift of the same sort and it bears great fruit and great benefitYes Sariputta there would Why lordSariputta there is the case where a person gives a gift seeking his own profit with a mind attached seeking to store up for himself Ill enjoy this after death He gives his gift  food drink clothing a vehicle a garland perfume  ointment bedding shelter  a lamp  to a brahman or a contemplativeWhat do you think SariputtaMight a person give such a gift as thisYes lordHaving given this gift seeking his own profit  with a mind attached seeking to store up for himself Ill enjoy this after death  on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of the Four Great KingsThen having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this worldThen there is the case of a person who gives a gift not seeking his own profit not with a mind attached not seeking to store up for himself nor Ill enjoy this after death Instead he gives a gift with the thought Giving is good He gives his gift  food drink clothing a vehicle a garland perfume  ointment bedding shelter  a lamp  to a brahman or a contemplativeWhat do you think SariputtaMight a person give such a gift as thisYes lordHaving given this gift with the thought Giving is good on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of the devas of the ThirtythreeThen having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this worldOr instead of thinking Giving is good he gives a gift with the thought This was given in the past done in the past by my father  grandfatherIt would not be right for me to let this old family custom be discontinued on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of the devas of the HoursThen having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this worldOr instead he gives a gift with the thought I am welloffThese are not welloffIt would not be right for me being welloff not to give a gift to those who are not welloff on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of the Contented devasThen having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this worldOr instead he gives a gift with the thought Just as there were the great sacrifices of the sages of the past  Atthaka Vamaka Vamadeva Vessamitta Yamataggi Angirasa Bharadvaja Vasettha Kassapa  Bhagu  in the same way will this be my distribution of gifts on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of the devas who delight in creationThen having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this worldOr instead he gives a gift with the thought When this gift of mine is given it makes the mind sereneGratification  joy arise on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of the devas who have power over the creations of othersThen having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this worldOr instead of thinking When this gift of mine is given it makes the mind sereneGratification  joy arise he gives a gift with the thought This is an ornament for the mind a support for the mind He gives his gift  food drink clothing a vehicle a garland perfume  ointment bedding shelter  a lamp  to a brahman or a contemplativeWhat do you think SariputtaMight a person give such a gift as thisYes lordHaving given this not seeking his own profit not with a mind attached not seeking to store up for himself nor Ill enjoy this after death nor with the thought Giving is good nor with the thought This was given in the past done in the past by my father  grandfatherIt would not be right for me to let this old family custom be discontinued nor with the thought I am welloffThese are not welloffIt would not be right for me being welloff not to give a gift to those who are not welloff nor with the thought Just as there were the great sacrifices of the sages of the past  Atthaka Vamaka Vamadeva Vessamitta Yamadaggi Angirasa Bharadvaja Vasettha Kassapa  Bhagu  in the same way this will be my distribution of gifts nor with the thought When this gift of mine is given it makes the mind sereneGratification  joy arise but with the thought This is an ornament for the mind a support for the mind  on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of Brahmas RetinueThen having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a nonreturnerHe does not come back to this worldThis Sariputta is the cause this is the reason why a person gives a gift of a certain sort and it does not bear great fruit or great benefit whereas another person gives a gift of the same sort and it bears great fruit and great benefitThese five are a person of integritys giftsWhich fiveA person of integrity gives a gift with a sense of convictionA person of integrity gives a gift attentivelyA person of integrity gives a gift in seasonA person of integrity gives a gift with an empathetic heartA person of integrity gives a gift without adversely affecting himself or othersHaving given a gift with a sense of conviction he  wherever the result of that gift ripens  is rich with much wealth with many possessionsAnd he is wellbuilt handsome extremely inspiring endowed with a lotuslike complexionHaving given a gift attentively he  wherever the result of that gift ripens  is rich with much wealth with many possessionsAnd his children wives slaves servants and workers listen carefully to him lend him their ears and serve him with understanding heartsHaving given a gift in season he  wherever the result of that gift ripens  is rich with much wealth with many possessionsAnd his goals are fulfilled in seasonHaving given a gift with an empathetic heart he  wherever the result of that gift ripens  is rich with much wealth with many possessionsAnd his mind inclines to the enjoyment of the five strings of lavish sensualityHaving given a gift without adversely affecting himself or others he  wherever the result of that gift ripens  is rich with much wealth with many possessionsAnd not from anywhere does destruction come to his property  whether from fire from water from kings from thieves or from hateful heirsThese five are a person of integritys giftsThere are these five seasonable giftsWhich fiveOne gives to a newcomerOne gives to one going awayOne gives to one who is illOne gives in time of famineOne sets the first fruits of field  orchard in front of those who are virtuousThese are the five seasonable giftsSo Prince Payasi established a donation for brahmans contemplatives indigents hoboes paupers  beggarsAnd in that donation he gave food of this sort unhusked rice porridge together with pickle brineAnd he gave rough cloth with knotted fringeNow a brahman youth named Uttara was the superintendent of that donationAs he was giving the donation he dedicated it in this wayThrough this donation may I be associated with Prince Payasi in this life but not in the next Prince Payasi heard that Uttara when giving the donation dedicated it in this way Through this donation may I be associated with Prince Payasi in this life but not in the next So having summoned him he said to him Is it true dear boy that when giving the donation you dedicated in this way Through this donation may I be associated with Prince Payasi in this life but not in the nextYes sirBut why do you dedicate it in this wayDont we who wish to gain merit hope for the fruit of our donationBut sir the food in the donation is like this unhusked rice porridge together with pickle brineYou wouldnt want to touch it with your foot much less eat itAnd the rough cloth with knotted fringe You wouldnt want to touch it with your foot much less wear itYou are dear  charming to us so how can we connect what is dear  charming with what is not charmingThen in that case my dear boy establish the sort of food that I eat and the sort of cloth that I wearResponding Yes sir Uttara the brahman youth established the sort of food that Prince Payasi ate and the sort of cloth that Prince Payasi woreThen Prince Payasi  having given the donation inattentively having given the donation not with his own hand having given the donation thoughtlessly having given the donation as if he were throwing it away  on the breakup of the body after death reappeared in the company of the devas of the Four Great Kings in the empty Serisaka palaceBut Uttara the brahman youth who was the superintendent of the donation  having given the donation attentively having given the donation with his own hand having given the donation thoughtfully having given the donation not as if he were throwing it away  on the breakup of the body after death reappeared in the good destination the heavenly world in the company of the devas of the ThirtythreeAnd how is a donation endowed with six factorsThere is the case where the donor has three factors and the recipients have threeAnd which are the donors three factorsThere is the case where the donor before giving is happyWhile giving hisher mind is clear  confidentAfter giving heshe is gratifiedThere are the donors three factorsAnd which are the recipients three factorsThere is the case where the recipients are free from passion or are practicing for the subduing of passion they are free of aversion or are practicing for the subduing of aversion they are free of delusion or are practicing for the subduing of delusionThese are the recipients three factors Now it is not easy to take the measure of the merit of a donation thus endowed with six factors as just this much bonanza of merit bonanza of skillfulness nourishment of bliss heavenly ripening in bliss leading to heaven leading to what is agreeable pleasing charming happy  beneficial It is reckoned simply as a great mass of merit that is unreckonable immeasurableJust as it is not easy to take the measure of the water in the great ocean as just this many pails of water or hundreds of pails of water or thousands of pails of water or hundreds of thousands of pails of water It is reckoned simply as a great mass of water that is unreckonable immeasurableIn the same way it is not easy to take the measure of the merit of a donation thus endowed with six factors as just this much bonanza of merit bonanza of skillfulness nourishment of bliss heavenly ripening in bliss leading to heaven leading to what is agreeable pleasing charming happy  beneficial It is reckoned simply as a great mass of merit that is unreckonable immeasurableThen King Pasenadi Kosala went to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Well now great king where are you coming from in the middle of the dayJust now lord a moneylending householder died in SavatthiI have come from conveying his heirless fortune to the royal palace ten million in silver to say nothing of the goldBut even though he was a moneylending householder his enjoyment of food was like this he ate broken rice  pickle brineHis enjoyment of clothing was like this he wore three lengths of hempen clothHis enjoyment of a vehicle was like this he rode in a dilapidated little cart with an awning of leavesThats the way it is great kingThats the way it isOnce in the past that moneylending householder provided alms for the Private Buddha named TagarasikhiSaying Give alms to the contemplative he got up from his seat and leftAfter giving though he felt regret It would have been better if my slaves or servants had eaten those alms Now the result of his action in having provided alms for the Private Buddha named Tagarasikhi was that he appeared seven times in a good destination the heavenly worldAnd through the remaining result of that action he acted as moneylender seven times in this very same SavatthiBut the result of his action in feeling regret after giving alms  It would have been better if my slaves or servants had eaten those alms  was that his mind didnt lend itself to the lavish enjoyment of food didnt lend itself to the lavish enjoyment of clothing didnt lend itself to the lavish enjoyment of a vehicle didnt lend itself to the lavish enjoyment of the five strings of sensualityThen Vacchagotta the wanderer went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama I have heard that Gotama the contemplative says this Only to me should a gift be given and not to othersOnly to my disciples should a gift be given and not to othersOnly what is given to me bears great fruit and not what is given to othersOnly what is given to my disciples bears great fruit and not what is given to the disciples of others Now those who report this Are they reporting the Master Gotamas actual words are they not misrepresenting him with what is unfactual are they answering in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing themFor we dont want to misrepresent the Master GotamaVaccha whoever says this Gotama the contemplative says this Only to me should a gift be given Only what is given to my disciples bears great fruit and not what is given to the disciples of others is not reporting my actual words is misrepresenting me with what is unfactual  untrueVaccha whoever prevents another from giving a gift creates three obstructions three impedimentsWhich threeHe creates an obstruction to the merit of the giver an obstruction to the recipients gains and prior to that he undermines and harms his own selfWhoever prevents another from giving a gift creates these three obstructions these three impedimentsI tell you Vaccha even if a person throws the rinsings of a bowl or a cup into a village pool or pond thinking May whatever animals live here feed on this that would be a source of merit to say nothing of what is given to human beingsBut I do say that what is given to a virtuous person is of great fruit and not so much what is given to an unvirtuous personAs he was sitting to one side King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One Where lord should a gift be givenWherever the mind feels confidence great kingBut a gift given where lord bears great fruitThis is one thing great king  Where should a gift be given  while this  A gift given where bears great fruit  is something else entirelyWhat is given to a virtuous person  rather than to an unvirtuous one  bears great fruitIn that case great king I will ask you a counterquestionAnswer as you see fitWhat do you think great kingThere is the case where you have a war at hand a battle imminentA noblewarrior youth would come along  untrained unpracticed undisciplined undrilled fearful terrified cowardly quick to fleeWould you take him onWould you have any use for a man like thatNo lord I wouldnt take him onI wouldnt have any use for a man like thatThen a brahman youth a merchant youth a laborer youth would come along  untrained unpracticed undisciplined undrilled fearful terrified cowardly quick to fleeWould you take him onWould you have any use for a man like thatNo lord I wouldnt take him onI wouldnt have any use for a man like thatNow what do you think great kingThere is the case where you have a war at hand a battle imminentA noblewarrior youth would come along  trained practiced disciplined drilled fearless unterrified not cowardly not quick to fleeWould you take him onWould you have any use for a man like thatYes lord I would take him onI would have use for a man like thatThen a brahman youth a merchant youth a laborer youth would come along  trained practiced disciplined drilled fearless unterrified not cowardly not quick to fleeWould take you him onWould you have any use for a man like thatYes lord I would take him onI would have use for a man like thatIn the same way great kingWhen someone has gone forth from the home life into homelessness  no matter from what clan  and he has abandoned five factors and is endowed with five what is given to him bears great fruitAnd which five factors has he abandonedHe has abandoned sensual desire ill will sloth  drowsiness restlessness  anxiety uncertaintyThese are the five factors he has abandonedAnd with which five factors is he endowedHe is endowed with the aggregate of virtue of one beyond training the aggregate of concentration of one beyond training the aggregate of discernment of one beyond training the aggregate of release of one beyond training the aggregate of knowledge  vision of release of one beyond trainingThese are the five factors with which he is endowedWhat is given to one who has abandoned five factors and is endowed with five factors in this way bears great fruitThat is what the Blessed One saidHaving said that the One WellGone the Teacher said furtherThis was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard There are these three supreme objects of confidenceWhich threeAmong whatever beings there may be  footless twofooted fourfooted many footed with form or formless percipient nonpercipient neither percipient nor nonpercipient  the Tathagata worthy  rightly selfawakened is considered supremeThose who have confidence in the Awakened One have confidence in what is supreme and for those with confidence in the supreme supreme is the resultAmong whatever qualities there may be fabricated or unfabricated the quality of dispassion  the subduing of intoxication the elimination of thirst the uprooting of attachment the breaking of the round the destruction of craving dispassion cessation the realization of Unbinding  is considered supremeThose who have confidence in the quality of dispassion have confidence in what is supreme and for those with confidence in the supreme supreme is the resultAmong whatever fabricated qualities there may be the Noble Eightfold Path  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration  is considered supremeThose who have confidence in the Noble Eightfold Path have confidence in what is supreme and for those with confidence in the supreme supreme is the resultAmong whatever communities or groups there may be the Sangha of the Tathagatas disciples is considered supreme  ie the four when taken as pairs the eight when taken as personsThose who have confidence in the Sangha have confidence in what is supreme and for those with confidence in the supreme supreme will be the resultThese monks are the three supreme objects of confidenceThis was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard There are these two kinds of gifts a gift of material things  a gift of the DhammaOf the two this is supreme a gift of the DhammaThere are these two kinds of sharing sharing of material things  sharing of the DhammaOf the two this is supreme sharing of the DhammaThere are these two kinds of assistance assistance with material things  assistance with the DhammaOf the two this is supreme help with the DhammaIts not easy to teach the Dhamma to others AnandaThe Dhamma should be taught to others only when five qualities are established within the person teachingWhich fiveThe Dhamma should be taught with the thought I will speak stepbystep I will speak explaining the sequence  I will speak out of compassion I will speak not for the purpose of material rewardI will speak without disparaging myself or othersAnd what is the treasure of virtueThere is the case where a disciple of the noble ones abstains from taking life abstains from stealing abstains from illicit sexual conduct abstains from lying abstains from taking intoxicants that cause heedlessnessThis monks is called the treasure of virtueNow what is unskillfulTaking life is unskillful taking what is not given sexual misconduct lying abusive speech divisive talebearing idle chatter is unskillfulCovetousness ill will wrong views are unskillfulThese things are termed unskillfulAnd what is skillfulAbstaining from taking life is skillful abstaining from taking what is not given from sexual misconduct from lying from abusive speech from divisive talebearing abstaining from idle chatter is skillfulLack of covetousness lack of ill will right views are skillfulThese things are termed skillfulThen King Pasenadi Kosala descending from the palace went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now I was together with Queen Mallika in the upper palaceI said to her Is there anyone more dear to you than yourselfNo your majesty she answeredThere is no one more dear to me than myselfAnd what about you your majestyIs there anyone more dear to you than yourselfNo MallikaThere is no one more dear to me than myself Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedThere are these five gifts five great gifts  original longstanding traditional ancient unadulterated unadulterated from the beginning  are not open to suspicion will never be open to suspicion and are unfaulted by knowledgeable contemplatives and brahmansWhich fiveThere is the case where a noble disciple abandoning the taking of life abstains from taking lifeIn doing so he gives

chariot troops a squadron of infantry troops might protect them still they leave themselves unprotectedWhy is thatBecause thats an external protection not an internal oneTherefore they leave themselves unprotectedBut those who engage in good bodily conduct good verbal conduct  good mental conduct have themselves protectedEven though neither a squadron of elephant troops a squadron of cavalry troops a squadron of chariot troops nor a squadron of infantry troops might protect them still they have themselves protectedWhy is thatBecause thats an internal protection not an external

Asibandhakaputta the headman went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One The brahmans of the Western lands lord  those who carry water pots wear garlands of water plants purify with water  worship fire  can take a dead person lift it out instruct it  send it to heavenBut the Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened can arrange it so that all the world at the breakup of the body after death reappears in a good destination the heavenly worldVery well then headman I will question you on this matterAnswer as you see fitWhat do you think There is the case where a man is one who takes life steals indulges in illicit sex is a liar one who speaks divisive speech harsh speech  idle chatter is greedy bears thoughts of illwill  holds to wrong viewsThen a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart May this man at the breakup of the body after death reappear in a good destination the heavenly world What do you think would that man  because of the prayers praise  circumambulation of that great crowd of people  at the breakup of the body after death reappear in a good destination the heavenly worldNo lordSuppose a man were to throw a large boulder into a deep lake of water and a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart Rise up O boulderCome floating up O boulderCome float to the shore O boulder What do you think would that boulder  because of the prayers praise  circumambulation of that great crowd of people  rise up come floating up or come float to the shoreNo lordSo it is with any man who takes life steals indulges in illicit sex is a liar one who speaks divisive speech harsh speech  idle chatter is greedy bears thoughts of illwill  holds to wrong viewsEven though a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart  May this man at the breakup of the body after death reappear in a good destination the heavenly world  still at the breakup of the body after death he would reappear in destitution a bad destination the lower realms hellNow what do you think There is the case where a man is one who refrains from taking life from stealing  from indulging in illicit sex he refrains from lying from speaking divisive speech from harsh speech  from idle chatter he is not greedy bears no thoughts of illwill  holds to right viewThen a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart May this man at the breakup of the body after death reappear in

death reappear in destitution a bad destination the lower realms hellNo lordSuppose a man were to throw a jar of ghee or a jar of oil into a deep lake of water where it would breakThere the shards

the tip of my fingernail or the great earthThe great earth is far greater lordThe little bit of dust the Blessed One has picked up with the tip of his fingernail is next to nothingIts not a hundredth a thousandth a one hundredthousandth  this little bit of dust the Blessed One has picked up with the tip of his fingernail  when compared with the great earthIn the same way monks for a disciple of the noble ones who is consummate in view an individual who has broken through the suffering  stress totally ended  extinguished is far greaterThat which remains in the state of having at most seven remaining lifetimes is next to nothing its not a hundredth a thousandth a one hundredthousandth when compared with the previous mass of sufferingThats how great the benefit is of breaking through to the Dhamma monksThats how great the benefit is of obtaining the Dhamma eyeAs he was standing to one side Uttara the devas son recited this verse in the Blessed Ones presenceMeditation is not simply a matter of bare attentionIt is more a matter of appropriate attention seeing experience in terms of the four noble truths and responding in line with the tasks appropriate to those truths stress is to be comprehended its cause abandoned its cessation realized and the path to its cessation developedThese tasks involve processes of thought analysis and memory  which means that these processes instead of being enemies of meditation are actually the means by which Awakening is attainedThe ten recollections are a set of meditation themes that highlight the positive role that memory and thought play in training the mindThey employ memory to sensitize the mind to the need for training to induce feelings of confidence and wellbeing conducive for concentration to keep the topics of concentration in mind to produce tranquility and insight and to incline the mind toward the deathless when tranquility and insight have grown sufficiently strongStrictly speaking only seven of the ten are actually recollections recollection of the Buddha recollection of the Dhamma recollection of the Sangha recollection of virtue recollection of generosity recollection of the devas and recollection of stillingThe other three are called mindfulness practices mindfulness of inandout breathing mindfulness of death and mindfulness immersed in the bodyHowever the Pali words for mindfulness and recollection  sati and anussati  are intimately relatedIn the Pali Canon sati does not simply mean awarenessIt means the ability to keep something in mind it is a function of the active memoryThis point is clear in the Buddhas definition of the faculty of mindfulness and it crops up again and again in the descriptions of these three mindfulness practices mindfulness involves keeping particular themes or intentions in mind so as to induce mental states necessary for concentration clear insight and releaseThus all ten of these practices  the recollections and mindfulness practices  employ memory as an essential factorFor conveniences sake it seems best to stick to the traditional label of recollection for all tenUnlike other sets of meditation practices such as the four frames of reference or the four sublime abidings the ten recollections do not have a single canonical discourse devoted to the entire setThus the way they interact and support one another has to be pieced together from many different discourses scattered throughout the CanonThe only place where they are listed as a set is in a series of ten short discourses in the Anguttara NikayaThese discourses suggest that all ten recollections function in the same way for all are described in the same terms This is one thing that  when developed  pursued  leads solely to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding From this formulaic statement it might be concluded that all ten are equivalent and interchangeable and that the choice of one theme over the others is simply a matter of personal preferenceHowever other passages in the Canon indicate that this is not soEach recollection plays a specific role in the practice and all are needed to provide a complete and effective training for the mindIn this way they are like the contents of a meditators toolbox a range of approaches that every meditator should master so as to respond skillfully to whatever issue arises in the practiceBroadly speaking the roles of these practices are these Mindfulness of death is meant to evoke a sense of samvega  a sense of dismay over the dangers and futility of human life as it is normally lived with its ordinary defilements and a sense of urgency in trying to find a way beyond those limitationsThis sense of urgency further induces the quality of heedfulness in approaching the practice which the Buddha said is basic to all skillful endeavors The first six recollections  of the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha virtue generosity and the devas  are meant to induce a sense of joy and confidence in the practiceThe first two induce a sense of confidence in the practice itself the last three a sense of confidence in ones own worthiness to follow the practice while the third theme  recollection of the Sangha  can induce bothThe texts say that the joy and confidence induced by these practices can bring the mind to concentration and cleanse it of defilement although they do not describe in any detail as to how far this cleansing goes or how it occursPassage  however suggests that these themes can perform this function as adjuncts to mindfulness practice Mindfulness of inandout breathing and mindfulness immersed in the body are the primary themes for developing tranquility and insight so as to lead to strong concentration in terms of the four jhanas or absorptions and they develop jhana in such a way that it gives added power to tranquility and insight in leading the mind to releaseOf all the meditation themes taught in the Canon mindfulness of inandout breathing is treated in the most detail and so it seems to have pride of place among the ten recollectionsThe Buddha himself prior to his Awakening apparently practiced this theme more than any otherAfter his Awakening he frequently continued to practice it as wellHowever mindfulness of inandout breathing and mindfulness immersed in the body play complementary roles on the pathTo begin with there is some overlap in the two in that the first four steps of breath meditation are also listed as techniques in mindfulness immersed in the bodyIn addition mindfulness immersed in the body  especially in its aspect as contemplation of the unattractiveness of the body  can handle strong defilements that in some cases do not respond to the tranquil concentration induced by mindfulness of inandout breathingAt the same time mindfulness immersed in the body can sometimes induce strong feelings of disgust and revulsion that cause the mind to respond in unskillful waysWhen this happens mindfulness of inandout breathing can help dispel those feelings and replace them with a feeling of refreshment that helps the mind stay skillfully on the pathIn this way these two mindfulness practices work together to keep the mind balanced and on course Once the mind has been brought to a developed state of tranquility and insight  able to see even the pleasures of jhana as inconstant stressful and notself  recollection of stilling is brought to bear so that the mind does not simply stay focused on the drawbacks of fabricated experiencesIt does this by inclining the mind to the exquisite peace of the deathless experienced through dispassion cessation and UnbindingWhen viewed in this way  starting with mindfulness of death and ending with a recollection aimed at Unbinding  the ten recollections illustrate the principle stated in  that mindfulness of death has as its final end not death but the deathlessThe seven sections of this study guide are designed to flesh out this general outlineThe material in each section is drawn from the Pali Canon and has been selected to provide more specifics as to the how the what and the why of each of these practices how they function what is supposed to be recollected in each of these themes and why each recollection is useful in training the mindIn reading these sections the following overview is useful to keep in mindSection OneThis section contains the only section of the Canon where the ten recollections are presented as a listIt also contains the Buddhas definition of the faculty of mindfulness to show that mindfulness in his vocabulary means something similar to recollectionSection TwoThis section covers the first six recollections as a setPassages  describe exactly what is to be recollected in these practices deals both with the qualities of mind that should be brought to these recollections  the five strengths of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment  and the rewards of these recollections in terms of joy and increased concentration emphasizes that this increased joy and concentration can also lead to cleansing the mind of defilements it also stresses that these recollections are a useful part of any uposatha practice the practice by which lay people rest from their daily work on the full moon new moon and quarter moon days devoting those days to listening to the Dhamma and training the mind in meditationPassages  indicate two other uses for this joy and concentration cleansing the mind of fear and other unskillful thoughts while dwelling in seclusion and relieving the mind and body of any feverish or unsettling feelings that would prevent mindfulness practice from yielding higher states of jhanaSection ThreeThis section contains passages that aid in the recollection of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha adding more detail to the standard passages for each of these recollectionsBecause these recollections are meant to be inspiring it is helpful to know in more detail some of the inspiring attributes of their objectsYet because different people will find different aspects of these objects more or less inspiring at any particular time this section cannot begin to cover the full range of passages that might be helpful in offering inspirationInstead they focus more on the basicsIn the case of the Buddha this means focusing on his Awakening and the way he found itIn the case of the Dhamma this means focusing on the qualities of mind the practice of the Dhamma is meant to induce and on the manner in which the Dhamma is taughtIn the case of the Sangha this means focusing on how the Buddhas noble disciples were able to overcome inner and outer obstacles in the pathThis last set of passages focuses on what honorable and admirable people they became thus inspiring confidence in themBut it also focuses on the fact that they began their practice with weaknesses similar to  or even worse than  ours and yet they were able to overcome those weaknesses using personal qualities that we all have in potential formThis latter consideration helps to inspire confidence in our own ability to follow the path as wellSection FourThis section covers the practice of mindfulness of inandout breathingIt includes passages that discuss the conditions that enable this practice to give quick results and passages that go into detail as to how rewarding those results can beCentral to this section are the repeated references to the sixteen steps that comprise the Buddhas approach to mindfulness of inandout breathing Breathing in long he discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long Or breathing in short he discerns I am breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns I am breathing out short He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication He trains himself I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to rapture He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to rapture He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to pleasure He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to pleasure He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to mental fabrication He trains himself I will breathe in calming mental fabrication He trains himself I will breathe out calming mental fabrication He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to the mind He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to the mind He trains himself I will breathe in gladdening the mind He trains himself I will breathe out gladdening the mind He trains himself I will breathe in steadying the mind He trains himself I will breathe out steadying the mind He trains himself I will breathe in releasing the mind He trains himself I will breathe out releasing the mind He trains himself I will breathe in focusing on inconstancy He trains himself I will breathe out focusing on inconstancy He trains himself I will breathe in focusing on dispassion He trains himself I will breathe out focusing on dispassion He trains himself I will breathe in focusing on cessation He trains himself I will breathe out focusing on cessation He trains himself I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment He trains himself I will breathe out focusing on relinquishment These sixteen steps show that the Buddha did not regard this practice simply as a preliminary to other more advanced practicesThese steps cover the entire path leading to full releaseAs  shows in its presentation of these steps mindfulness of breathing does not simply mean staying with the breath in the present it involves training the mind to develop a range of skills with each in and out breathThe irony of these sixteen steps is that even though they are the Buddhas most detailed meditation instructions the Canon leaves unanswered a number of important questions concerning themThe most prominent question concerns how the sixteen steps are related to one anotherAre they meant to be sequential or can they be developed in a nonsequential wayShould the meditator try to cover all sixteen or is it enough to focus on just one of the four tetrads making up the sixteenAnd in either case how is this doneDifferent passages suggest different answers to these questionsThe suttas that present the sixteen steps without further explanation seem to indicate that all sixteen steps are to be followed and in a sequential wayPassage  however equates each of the tetrads with a frame of reference and then goes on to state that each frame of reference is sufficient to fulfill the seven factors for Awakening which in turn lead to full releaseThis suggests that its enough to focus on any one of the tetradsBut in either case the suttas dont explain how one step leads to anotherPerhaps this lack of explanation was an intentional part of the Buddhas teaching style forcing his students to make discoveries on their ownBut it can be helpful to share a few thoughts on the matter based on what the suttas taken together seem to suggest indicates that the steps are meant among other things to lead to the jhanasThus the practice of the sixteen steps in one way or another should relate to the practice of jhanaAnd there are at least two possible ways in which this can happen one based on following the path of all sixteen steps and the other based on following the path of one of the tetradsFirst taking the path of all sixteen stepsSteps and involve two of the factors of the first jhana directed thought and evaluation directing ones thoughts and attention to the breath in and of itself in the present at the same time evaluating it as one begins to discern variations in the length of the breathSome modern teachers maintain that the factor of evaluation here also includes taking ones observations of short and long breathing as a basis for adjusting the rhythm of the breath to make it as comfortable as possibleBecause the first level of jhana must be based on a sense of pleasure this advice is very practicalThe remaining steps are willed or determined one trains oneself first by manipulating ones sense of conscious awareness making it sensitive to the body as a wholeThen one can begin manipulating the bodily sensations that become apparent within that fullbody awareness reducing them to a single sensation of calm by letting bodily fabrication  the in and out breathing  grow calmAs the breathing grows calm it allows for easeful sensations of rapture and pleasure to grow prominentA comparison between the stages of breath meditation and the similes for the jhanas suggests that steps and  being sensitive to rapture and pleasure  involve making these feelings single as well by letting them suffuse the entire body just as the bathman kneads the moisture throughout his ball of bath powderWith bodily fabrications stilled mental fabrications  feelings and perceptions  become clearly apparent as they occur just as tuning a radio precisely to a certain frequency eliminates static and allows the message sent by the radio station broadcasting at that frequency to become clearThese mental fabrications too are calmed a step symbolized in the similes for the jhanas by the still waters in the simile for the third jhana in contrast to the spring waters welling up in the secondWhat remains is simply a sense of the mind itself corresponding to the level of fourth jhana in which the body is filled from head to toe with a single sense of bright radiant awarenessOnce this stage is reached one can now turn ones attention to consolidating ones mastery of concentrationThis is done by reviewing the various levels of jhana focusing not so much on the breath as on the mind as it relates to the breathThis develops a sensitivity to the different ways in which the mind can be brought to the desired state for gaining greater tranquility or insightFor instance if it needs to be gladdened one can gladden it with refreshing breathing or with any of the inspiring recollectionsIf it needs to be steadied one can develop fullbody awareness and calm any disturbances that can be detected in terms of bodily or mental fabricationIn the process of mastering these skills one also begins to grow sensitive to the different factors from which the mind can be released as it goes through the different levels of jhana  for example releasing it from sensuality by taking it to the first jhana releasing it from directed thought and evaluation by taking it from the first jhana to the second releasing it from rapture by taking it from the second level to the third and so forthOne comes to see that although the breath feels different on the different levels of jhana the cause is not so much the breath as it is the way the mind relates to the breath shedding the various mental activities surrounding its single preoccupationThe mastery of concentration developed in steps  provides an excellent chance to develop discernment into the pattern of cause and effect in the process of concentrating the mind in that one must master the causal factors before gaining the desired results in terms of gladness steadiness and releaseThis insight into cause and effect provides the basis for insight the ability to see events in the mind simply as events arising and passing away as part of a chain of causes and effects that also arise and pass awayRealizing the inconstancy and unreliability of the events in this pattern gives rise to the realization that they are also stressful and notself neither me nor mine but simply instances of the first noble truth of suffering and stressWhen this discernment goes straight to the heart there occurs a sense of dispassion for any craving directed at them and an experience of their fading away and cessationFinally one relinquishes attachment not only to these events but also to the discernment that sees through to their true natureThis brings the seven factors for Awakening to completion in a state dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting go where letting go would appear to be equivalent to the relinquishment in stepWhen one is able simply to experience the act of relinquishment without feeling that one is doing the relinquishing one stands at the threshold to total releaseIn this interpretation of the sixteen steps the first two tetrads constitute the stage of familiarizing oneself with the potentials of concentration that can be attained by focusing on the breath the third tetrad constitutes the stage of gaining insight to the patterns of cause and effect through mastering the concentration and the fourth tetrad constitutes the stage of bringing the mind to a point of relinquishing all activity even the activity of the pathThese three stages correspond to the three stages of framesofreference practice described in detail in The Wings to AwakeningAs for the interpretation in which each of the four tetrads is regarded as sufficient for full release this is best understood by first looking at the underlying pattern of the seven factors for Awakening which each tetrad is said to fulfillThe seven factors begin with mindfulness established on a particular frame of reference the body in and of itself feelings in and of themselves the mind in and of itself or mental qualities in and of themselvesThis is followed by analysis of qualities which not only perceives the chosen frame of reference in terms of dhammas but also how these dhammas may be skillful or unskillfulThen follows persistence which  as right effort  abandons the unskillful qualities and develops the skillful ones leading to the factors of rapture calm concentration and equanimityThus the general pattern consists of focusing on a particular frame of reference seeing it as dhammas and dealing with those dhammas in a skillful way so as to bring about calming and peaceThis is precisely the pattern followed in each of the four tetradsAs one stays focused on the breath as ones basic theme to the point of giving rise to jhana one has the choice of viewing the events of the developing concentration in terms of any one of the four frames of reference the body feelings the mind and mental qualitiesAs long as ones practice is skillful events will develop in line with the above pattern regardless of the chosen frameThus each tetrad provides a particular perspective on these events as they relate to the corresponding frame of referenceThe first tetrad shows how the development of breath concentration registers in terms of the bodyIn steps and one becomes sensitized to the breath in terms of its lengthIn step one becomes sensitive to the breath as a wholebody processIn step this fullbody awareness enables one to see the breath as a process fabricating the experience of the bodyThis in turn inclines one to allow that fabrication to grow calm creating feelings of rapture pleasure and ultimately equanimityAccording to  this can lead  in the fourth jhana  to the absolute stilling of the inandout breath as the oxygen needs of the body decrease when the mind reaches a firm stillnessThe second tetrad shows how the development of breath concentration registers in terms of feelingsIn steps and one becomes sensitive to feelings of rapture and pleasure as they begin to manifest in the course of developing concentration first in a gentle way then in stronger waysIn step this sensitivity allows one to see the impact that these feelings have in fabricating the mind together with the perceptions that allow for one to maximize this sensitivity and its impact in the first placeThis in turn inclines one to allow these feelings and perceptions to grow calmAn example of calming feeling would be abandoning rapture for equanimityAn example of calming perception would be to perceive the body as a full energy field rather than as a solid mass thus making it easier for the inandout breathing to grow stillAccording to  this stepbystep process of calming can lead through the jhanas and into the formless states culminating in the attainment of the cessation of perception and feelingThe third tetrad charts the development of breath concentration in terms of the mindIn step one simply becomes sensitive to the state of the minds awareness as it focuses on the breath in the present momentIn response to that sensitivity one can use the breath to induce desired states in the mindIf the mind needs gladdening one can breathe in ways that induce rapture and pleasureIf the mind needs steadying one can bring it to strong states of jhana by developing a strong fullbody awareness and by allowing both bodily fabrication and mental fabrication to grow calmAs concentration develops one can release the mind from the affliction of sensuality by bringing it into jhana and from the afflictions of the lower jhanas by bringing it to the higher jhanasThis process of release if it involves only the jhanas is temporary but if it leads to the release of Unbinding it is total and permanentThe fourth tetrad describes the development of breath concentration in terms of mental qualitiesTo be sensitive to mental qualities one first has to be sensitive to their arising and passing awayThus the first step is to look for their inconstancy to see when they arise how they arise when they pass away how they pass awayAs one is developing concentration based on the breath one has to watch both for the inconstancy of the unskillful qualities that block concentration  the hindrances  and for the skillful qualities that nurture it the factors for AwakeningIn seeing the hindrances simply as events one can pull away from them weigh their allure and drawbacks and develop dispassion for themBecause one feels dispassionate toward them one no longer participates in fabricating themThus they ceaseOn this preliminary level however the cessation is temporary and lasts only as long as concentration can be maintainedHowever the practice of dealing with the hindrances in this way strengthens the first three factors for Awakening mindfulness analysis of qualities and persistenceIn watching these factors as events one focuses on their inconstancy with a different agenda in mind instead of trying to develop dispassion for them immediately one tries to understand the causal factors behind their arising and passing away so that the factors for Awakening can be brought into being more often and maintained for longer periods of timeThis process combined with the continued absence of the hindrances allows ones concentration to grow stronger and more solidAs one attains the higher jhanas one is in a position to change tacticsOne can now view the lower jhanas in terms of their inconstancy so as to induce dispassion for them tooThis tactic can be applied to higher and higher levels of jhana as ones powers of concentration and insight advanceHere again the sense of dispassion at first leads only to temporary cessationBut as this process continues there come stages of realization in which various hindrances and fetters are totally relinquished once and for all yielding the ultimate in calm and releaseThus in this interpretation each of the four tetrads of mindfulness of inandout breathing charts the way in which meditation progresses as seen from a particular point of viewThey all touch on the same process  with the same threestep dynamic of sensitizing viewing as dhammas and then calming  showing how this process appears simultaneously from different frames of referenceIn the course of ones practice one is likely to shift among all four of these frames of reference for they are all interrelatedFor example in gladdening the mind one focuses on the breath to calm bodily fabrication and on feelings of rapture and pleasure as means of inducing gladnessIn becoming sensitive to the entire body one naturally notices mental qualities that interfere with wholebody awareness and mental qualities that nurture itHowever as the practice develops individual meditators will tend to focus on one frame more than the othersThe four tetrads show how regardless of the chosen frame all four frames can simultaneously be brought into line with the basic pattern of the seven factors for AwakeningRegardless of which of these two interpretations one follows  and it is possible in practice to follow both  mindfulness of inandout breathing is obviously a method in which tranquility and insight develop in tandemAs  shows tranquility is a matter of allowing the mind to settle and become unified insight a matter of regarding experience in terms of fabricationsIn the Buddhas practice of mindfulness of inandout breathing the mind is brought to stillness and unity through watching the breath  and its attendant feelings and mindstates  in terms of fabrication and allowing those fabrications to grow calmCalm is thus attained through insight insight through calmPerhaps it was because this method progresses in such a balanced way that the Buddha used it as his preferred theme of meditation and taught it more frequently and in more detail than any otherSection FiveThis section covers mindfulness of deathAs the passages collected here show the Buddha taught this topic not to induce a feeling of depression or hopelessness or a sense of sentimental nostalgia for the beauties of the worldHe taught it to encourage heedfulness a sense that a great deal needs to be done in training the mind and that not much time remains to do itThus mindfulness of death fosters an appreciation of what human life offers the opportunity to doWhat is valuable about life is not the pleasures that can be experienced but the skillful mental qualities that can be developedDeath is not the end but a transition and the transition will be easy or difficult depending on the qualities one has built into ones mindBecause there is no way of knowing when death will come one should focus each day on which skillful qualities of mind most need developing and which unskillful ones most need abandoningMindfulness of death is thus an excellent practice for ordering ones prioritiesAs  point out today may be ones last day in this lifeWhat remains to be doneSome ideas are offered by  which point out the mental traits that lead one to fear death and  which point out the traits by which death leads to rebirthIf one focuses on lessening and eradicating these traits ones mindfulness of death can actually lead to the deathlessSection SixThis section covers mindfulness immersed in the bodyPassage  in discussing how the body is a theme for both mindfulness practice and jhana practice illustrates a consistent theme in the suttas that there is no sharp divide between mindfulness and concentration practices and that mindfulness is intended to lead to jhanaIt also contains the most complete discussion of the methods of this practice along with its rewardsIn addition to the benefits listed in this sutta however other passages list other benefits as well mindfulness immersed in the body helps in overcoming lust pride based ones appearance or race and fear of deathIt also provides a solid basis for restraint of the sensesPassage  points out that one of the practices listed under this heading  contemplation of the unattractiveness of the body  can lead to unskillful mental states that are best cleared away by turning to mindfulness of inandout breathingPeople who resist the theme of unattractiveness tend to focus on this passage citing it as proof that the perception of unattractiveness is a dangerous and unhealthy meditation themeHowever  points out that some strong defilements will respond only to this themeAnd there is nothing inherently unhealthy about focusing on the unattractiveness of the bodyInstead of fostering an unhealthy negative image of the body  in which other peoples bodies are attractive while ones own is not  it fosters an accurate perception of aspects of the body that are often ignored and yet which are unattractive in everybodyThis sort of negative image is thus healthy in that it helps cure the mind of its blind infatuationsThus the two themes of breathing and unattractiveness are best practiced together as complementary tools in ones meditative repertoire to be mastered and honed so that they will be ready for use whenever neededSection SevenAs mentioned above the recollection of stilling  the topic of the final section  guarantees that mindfulness of death does not stop at the topic of death but leads to the deathlessIt also ensures that tranquility and insight do not stay focused on fabricated experiences but incline to the unfabricatedPassage  shows the ideal stage in the practice for this recollection when one has mastered jhana and begun to see even its refined pleasures as inconstant stressful and notself this recollection helps to turn the mind in the direction of what lies beyond tranquility and insight total UnbindingAs this passage points out if  after utilizing this recollection  one still regards Unbinding as an object of passion ones Awakening will not be completeThis is why the Buddha taught that all dhammas  not just fabricated ones  are to be seen as notself so as to overcome this passionBut when Unbinding is fully experienced not as an object but as the end of objects insight and tranquility are no longer needed for the purpose of liberation and can be used instead simply as pleasant means of abiding until the end of ones life when all this  the experience of the senses  grows cold right here One thing  when developed  pursued  leads solely to disenchantment to dispassion

stilling to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingAnd what is the faculty of mindfulnessThere is the case where a monk a disciple of the noble ones is mindful highly meticulous remembering  able to call to mind even things that were done  said long agoHe remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldHe remains focused on feelings in  of themselves the mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldThis is called the faculty of mindfulnessI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan ParkNow at that time Mahanama went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One I have heard that many monks are at work making robes for the Blessed One When the robes are finished at the end of the three months the Blessed One will set out wandering For those of us living by means of various dwelling places by means of which dwelling place should we liveExcellent Mahanama excellentIt is fitting for clansmen like you to approach the Tathagata and ask For those of us living by means of various dwelling places by means of which dwelling place should we liveOne who is aroused to practice is one of conviction not without conviction is one with persistence aroused not lazy is one of established mindfulness not muddled mindfulness is centered in concentration not uncenteredOne aroused to practice is discerning not undiscerningEstablished in these five qualities you should further develop six qualitiesThere is the case where you recollect the Tathagata Indeed the Blessed One is pure and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessed At any time when a disciple of the noble ones is recollecting the Tathagata his mind is not overcome with passion not overcome with aversion not overcome with delusionHis mind heads straight based on the TathagataAnd when the mind is headed straight the disciple of the noble ones gains a sense of the goal gains a sense of the Dhamma gains joy connected with the DhammaIn one who is joyful rapture arisesIn one who is rapturous the body grows calmOne whose body is calmed senses pleasureIn one sensing pleasure the mind becomes concentratedMahanama you should develop this recollection of the Buddha while you are walking while you are standing while you are sitting while you are lying down while you are busy at work while you are resting in your home crowded with childrenFurthermore there is the case where you recollect the Dhamma The Dhamma is wellexpounded by the Blessed One to be seen here  now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselves At any time when a disciple of the noble ones is recollecting the Dhamma his mind is not overcome with passion not overcome with aversion not overcome with delusionHis mind heads

the Eastern Monastery the palace of Migaras motherNow at that time  it being the uposatha day  Visakha Migaras mother went to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs she was sitting there the Blessed One said to her Well now Visakha why are you coming in the middle of the dayToday Im observing the uposatha lordVisakha there are these three uposathasWhich threeThe uposatha of a cowherd the uposatha of the Jains and the uposatha of the Noble OnesAnd what is the uposatha of a cowherdJust as when a cowherd returns the cattle to their owners in the evening he reflects Today the cattle wandered to that spot and this they drank at this spot and that tomorrow they will wander to that spot and this they will drink at this spot and that in the same way there is the case where a certain person observing the uposatha reflects Today I ate this sort of nonstaple food and that sort of staple foodTomorrow I will eat that sort of nonstaple food and this sort of staple food He spends the day with an awareness imbued with that covetousness with that greedSuch is the uposatha of a cowherd VisakhaWhen this uposatha of a cowherd is undertaken it is not of great fruit or great benefit not of great glory or radianceAnd what is the uposatha of the JainsThere are the contemplatives called the NiganthasThey get their disciple to undertake the following practice Here my good manLay down the rod with regard to beings who live more than leagues to the east more than leagues to the west more than leagues to the north more than leagues to the south Thus they get the disciple to undertake kindness  sympathy to some beings but not to othersOn the uposatha day they get their disciple to undertake the following practice Here my good manHaving stripped off all your clothing say this I am nothing by anything or of anythingThus there is nothing by anything or of anything that is mine Yet in spite of that his parents know of him that This is our child And he knows of them that These are my parents His wives  children know of him that This is our husband  father And he knows of them that These are my wives  children His workers  slaves know of him that This is our master And he knows of them that These are my workers  slaves Thus at a time when he should be persuaded to undertake truthfulness he is persuaded to undertake falsehoodAt the end of the night he resumes the consumption of his belongings even though they arent given back to himThis counts as stealing I tell youSuch is the uposatha of the Jains VisakhaWhen this uposatha of the Jains is undertaken it is not of great fruit or great benefit not of great glory or radianceAnd what is the uposatha of the Noble OnesIt is the cleansing of the defiled mind through the proper

were arrayed for battleThen Sakka the chief of the devas addressed the devas of the Thirtythree If dear sirs when the devas have gone into battle there should arise fear terror or horripilation then on that occasion you should catch sight of the top of my standardFor when you have caught sight of the top of my standard whatever fear terror or horripilation there is will be abandonedIf you cant catch sight of the top of my standard then you should catch sight of the top of the devaking Pajapatis standardIf you cant catch sight of the top of the devaking Pajapatis standard then you should catch sight of the top of the devaking Varunas standardIf you cant catch sight of the top of the devaking Varunas standard then you should catch sight of the top of the devaking Isanas standardFor when you have caught sight of the top of the devaking Isanas standard whatever fear terror or horripilation there is will be abandonedBut monks when the top of the devachief Sakkas standard is caught sight of or when the top of the devaking Pajapatis standard the top of the devaking Varunas standard or the top of the devaking Isanas standard is caught sight of whatever fear terror or horripilation there is may be abandoned or may not be abandonedWhy is thatBecause Sakka the chief of the devas is not devoid of passion not devoid of aversion not devoid of delusionHe feels fear feels terror feels dreadHe runs awayBut I tell you this If  when you have gone into the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building  there should arise fear terror or horripilation then on that occasion you should recollect me Indeed the Blessed One is worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit

recollected the Dhamma whatever fear terror or horripilation there is will be abandonedIf you cant recollect the Dhamma then you should recollect the Sangha The Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples who have practiced well who have practiced straightforwardly who have practiced methodically who have practiced masterfully  in other words the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs the eight when taken as individual types  they are the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect the unexcelled field of merit for

devoid of aversion devoid of delusionHe feels no fear feels no terror feels no dreadHe doesnt run awayThat is what the Blessed One saidHaving said that the Onewellgone the Teacher further said thisI have heard that on one occasion a certain monk was dwelling among the Kosalans in a forest thicketNow at that time he spent the days abiding thinking evil unskillful thoughts ie thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will thoughts of doing harmThen the devata inhabiting the forest thicket feeling sympathy for the monk desiring his benefit desiring to bring him to his senses approached him and addressed him with this verseThe monk chastened by the devata came to his sensesThere is the case of a monk who remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldAs he remains thus focused on the body in  of itself a fever based on the body arises within his body or there is sluggishness in his awareness or his mind becomes scattered externallyHe should then direct his mind to any inspiring themeAs his mind is directed to any inspiring theme delight arises within himIn one who feels delight rapture arisesIn one whose mind is enraptured the body grows sereneHis body serene he feels pleasureAs he feels pleasure his mind grows concentratedHe reflects I have attained the aim to which my mind was directedLet me withdraw He withdraws  engages neither in directed thought nor in evaluationHe discerns I am not thinking or evaluatingI am inwardly mindful  at easeFurthermore he remains focused on feelings mind mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldAs he remains thus focused on mental qualities in  of themselves a fever based on mental qualities arises within his body or there is sluggishness in his awareness or his mind becomes scattered externallyHe should then direct his mind to any inspiring themeAs his mind is directed to any inspiring theme delight arises within himIn one who feels delight rapture arisesIn one whose mind is enraptured the body grows sereneHis body serene he is sensitive to pleasureAs he feels pleasure his mind grows concentratedHe reflects I have attained the aim to which my mind was directedLet me withdraw He withdraws  engages neither in directed thought nor in evaluationHe discerns I am not thinking or evaluatingI am inwardly mindful  at easeThe Blessed One said And how is one undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mindThere is the case where a pleasant feeling arises in an uneducated runofthemill personOn being touched by the pleasant feeling he becomes impassioned with pleasure and is reduced to being impassioned with pleasureHis pleasant feeling ceasesWith the cessation of the pleasant feeling there arises a painful feelingOn being touched with the painful feeling he sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraughtWhen that pleasant feeling had arisen in him it invaded his mind and remained because of his lack of development of the bodyWhen that painful feeling had arisen in him it invaded his mind and remained because of his lack of development of the mindThis is how one is undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mindAnd how is one developed in body and developed in mindThere is the case where a pleasant feeling arises in a welleducated disciple of the noble onesOn being touched by the pleasant feeling he doesnt become impassioned with pleasure and is not reduced to being impassioned with pleasureHis pleasant feeling ceasesWith the cessation of the pleasant feeling there arises a painful feelingOn being touched with the painful feeling he doesnt sorrow grieve or lament beat his breast or becomes distraughtWhen that pleasant feeling had arisen in him it didnt invade his mind and remain because of his development of the bodyWhen that painful feeling had arisen in him it didnt invade his mind and remain because of his development of the mindThis is how one is developed in body and developed in mindI have confidence in Master Gotama that Master Gotama is developed in body and developed in mind Well Aggivessana you are certainly being rude and presumptuously speaking your words but nevertheless I will respond to youEver since I shaved my hair  beard put on the ochre robe and went forth from the home life into homelessness it has not been possible for a pleasant feeling that has arisen to invade my mind and remain or for a painful feeling that has arisen to invade my mind and remainBut perhaps there has never arisen in Master Gotama the sort of pleasant feeling that having arisen would invade the mind and remainPerhaps there has never arisen in Master Gotama the sort of painful feeling that having arisen would invade the mind and remainWhy wouldnt it have AggivessanaBefore my Awakening when I was still an unawakened bodhisatta the thought occurred to me Household life is confining a dusty pathLife gone forth is the open airIt isnt easy living in a home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shellWhat if I having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe were to go forth from the household life into homelessnessSo at a later time when I was still young blackhaired endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life having shaved off my hair  beard  though my parents wished otherwise and were grieving with tears on their faces  I put on the ochre robe and went forth from the home life into homelessnessHaving gone forth in search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace I went to Alara Kalama and on arrival said to him Friend Kalama I want to practice in this doctrine  disciplineWhen this was said he replied to me You may stay here my friendThis doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter  dwell in his own teachers knowledge having realized it for himself through direct knowledgeIt was not long before I quickly learned the doctrineAs far as mere lipreciting  repetition I could speak the words of knowledge the words of the elders and I could affirm that I knew  saw  I along with othersI thought It isnt through mere conviction alone that Alara Kalama declares I have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge Certainly he dwells knowing  seeing this Dhamma So I went to him and said To what extent do you declare that you have entered  dwell in this Dhamma When this was said he declared the dimension of nothingnessI thought Not only does Alara Kalama have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernmentI too have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernmentWhat if I were to endeavor to realize for myself the Dhamma that Alara Kalama declares he has entered  dwells in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge So it was not long before I quickly entered  dwelled in that Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledgeI went to him and said Friend Kalama is this the extent to which you have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for yourself through direct knowledgeYes my friendThis friend is the extent to which I too have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledgeIt is a gain for us my friend a great gain for us that we have such a companion in the holy lifeSo the Dhamma I declare I have entered  dwell in having realized it for myself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledgeAnd the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma I declare I have entered  dwell in having realized it for myself through direct knowledgeThe Dhamma I know is the Dhamma you know the Dhamma you know is the Dhamma I knowAs I am so are you as you are so am Come friend let us now lead this community togetherIn this way did Alara Kalama my teacher place me his pupil on the same level with himself and pay me great honorBut the thought occurred to me This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to Awakening nor to Unbinding but only to reappearance in the dimension of nothingness So dissatisfied with that Dhamma I leftIn search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace I went to Uddaka Ramaputta and on arrival said to him Friend Uddaka I want to practice in this doctrine  disciplineWhen this was said he replied to me You may stay here my friendThis doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter  dwell in his own teachers knowledge having realized it for himself through direct knowledgeIt was not long before I quickly learned the doctrineAs far as mere lipreciting  repetition I could speak the words of knowledge the words of the elders and I could affirm that I knew  saw  I along with othersI thought It wasnt through mere conviction alone that Rama declared I have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge Certainly he dwelled knowing  seeing this Dhamma So I went to Uddaka and said To what extent did Rama declare that he had entered  dwelled in this Dhamma When this was said Uddaka declared the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionI thought Not only did Rama have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernmentI too have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernmentWhat if I were to endeavor to realize for myself the Dhamma that Rama declared he entered  dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge So it was not long before I quickly entered  dwelled in that Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledgeI went to Uddaka and said Friend Uddaka is this the extent to which Rama entered  dwelled in this Dhamma having realized it for himself through direct knowledgeYes my friendThis friend is the extent to which I too have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it

having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma Rama declared he entered  dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledgeThe Dhamma he knew is the Dhamma you know the Dhamma you know is the Dhamma he knewAs he was so are you as you are so was heCome friend lead this communityIn this way did Uddaka Ramaputta my companion in the holy life place me in the position of teacher and pay me great honorBut the thought occurred to me This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to Awakening nor to Unbinding but only to reappearance in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception So dissatisfied with that Dhamma I leftIn search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace I wandered by stages in the Magadhan country and came to the military town of UruvelaThere I saw some delightful countryside with an inspiring forest grove a clearflowing river with fine delightful banks and villages for almsgoing on all sidesThe thought occurred to me How delightful is this countryside with its inspiring forest grove clearflowing river with fine delightful banks and villages for almsgoing on all sidesThis is just right for the striving of a clansman intent on striving So I sat down right there thinking This is just right for strivingThen these three similes  spontaneous never before heard  appeared to meSuppose there were a wet sappy piece of timber lying in the water and a man were to come along with an upper firestick thinking Ill light a fireIll produce heat Now what do you thinkWould he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper firestick in the wet sappy timber lying in the waterNo Master GotamaWhy is thatBecause the timber is wet  sappy and besides it is lying in the waterEventually the man would reap only his share of weariness  disappointmentSo it is with any brahman or contemplative who does not live withdrawn from sensuality in body  mind and whose desire infatuation urge thirst  fever for sensuality is not relinquished  stilled within him Whether or not he feels painful racking piercing feelings due to his striving he is incapable of knowledge vision  unexcelled selfawakeningThis was the first simile  spontaneous never before heard  that appeared to meThen a second simile  spontaneous never before heard  appeared to meSuppose there were a wet sappy piece of timber lying on land far from water and a man were to come along with an upper firestick thinking Ill light a fireIll produce heat Now what do you thinkWould he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper firestick in the wet sappy timber lying on land far from waterNo Master GotamaWhy is thatBecause the timber is wet  sappy even though it is lying on land far from waterEventually the man would reap only his share of weariness  disappointmentSo it is with any brahman or contemplative who lives withdrawn from sensuality in body only but whose desire infatuation urge thirst  fever for sensuality is not relinquished  stilled within him Whether or not he feels painful racking piercing feelings due to his striving he is incapable of knowledge vision  unexcelled selfawakeningThis was the second simile  spontaneous never before heard  that appeared to meThen a third simile  spontaneous never before heard  appeared to meSuppose there were a dry sapless piece of timber lying on land far from water and a man were to come along with an upper firestick thinking Ill light a fireIll produce heat Now what do you thinkWould he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper firestick in the dry sapless timber lying on landYes Master GotamaWhy is thatBecause the timber is dry  sapless and besides it is lying on land far from waterSo it is with any brahman or contemplative who lives withdrawn from sensuality in body  mind and whose desire infatuation urge thirst  fever for sensuality is relinquished  stilled within him Whether or not he feels painful racking piercing feelings due to his striving he is capable of knowledge vision  unexcelled selfawakeningThis was the third simile  spontaneous never before heard  that appeared to meI thought Suppose that I clenching my teeth and pressing my tongue against the roof of my mouth were to beat down constrain  crush my mind with my awareness So clenching my teeth and pressing my tongue against the roof of my mouth I beat down constrained  crushed my mind with my awarenessJust as a strong man seizing a weaker man by the head or the throat or the shoulders would beat him down constrain  crush him in the same way I beat down constrained  crushed my mind with my awarenessAs I did so sweat poured from my armpitsAnd although tireless persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness established my body was aroused  uncalm because of the painful exertionBut the painful feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainI thought Suppose I were to become absorbed in the trance of nonbreathing So I stopped the inbreaths  outbreaths in my nose  mouthAs I did so there was a loud roaring of winds coming out my ear holes just like the loud roar of winds coming out of a smiths bellows So I stopped the inbreaths  outbreaths in my nose  mouth  earsAs I did so extreme forces sliced through my head just as if a strong man were slicing my head open with a sharp sword Extreme pains arose in my head just as if a strong man were tightening a turban made of tough leather straps around my head Extreme forces carved up my stomach cavity just as if a butcher or his apprentice were to carve up the stomach cavity of an ox There was an extreme burning in my body just as if two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms were to roast  broil him over a pit of hot embersAnd although tireless persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness established my body was aroused  uncalm because of the painful exertionBut the painful feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainDevas on seeing me said Gotama the contemplative is dead Other devas said He isnt dead hes dying Others said Hes neither dead nor dying hes an arahant for this is the way arahants liveI thought Suppose I were to practice going altogether without food Then devas came to me and said Dear sir please dont practice going altogether without foodIf you go altogether without food well infuse divine nourishment in through your pores and you will survive on that I thought If I were to claim to be completely fasting while these devas are infusing divine nourishment in through my pores I would be lying So I dismissed them saying EnoughI thought Suppose I were to take only a little food at a time only a handful at a time of bean soup lentil soup vetch soup or pea soup So I took only a little food at a time only a handful at a time of bean soup lentil soup vetch soup or pea soupMy body became extremely emaciatedSimply from my eating so little my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stems My backside became like a camels hoof My spine stood out like a string of beads My ribs jutted out like the jutting rafters of an old rundown barn The gleam of my eyes appeared to be sunk deep in my eye sockets like the gleam of water deep in a well My scalp shriveled  withered like a green bitter gourd shriveled  withered in the heat  the wind The skin of my belly became so stuck to my spine that when I thought of touching my belly I grabbed hold of my spine as well and when I thought of touching my spine I grabbed hold of the skin of my belly as well If I urinated or defecated I fell over on my face right there Simply from my eating so little if I tried to ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands the hair  rotted at its roots  fell from my body as I rubbed simply from eating so littlePeople on seeing me would say Gotama the contemplative is black Other people would say Gotama the contemplative isnt black hes brown Others would say Gotama the contemplative is neither black nor brown hes goldenskinned So much had the clear bright color of my skin deteriorated simply from eating so littleI thought Whatever brahmans or contemplatives in the past have felt painful racking piercing feelings due to their striving this is the utmostNone have been greater than thisWhatever brahmans or contemplatives in the future will feel painful racking piercing feelings due to their striving this is the utmostNone will be greater than thisWhatever brahmans or contemplatives in the present are feeling painful racking piercing feelings due to their striving this is the utmostNone is greater than thisBut with this racking practice of austerities I havent attained any superior human state any distinction in knowledge or vision worthy of the noble onesCould there be another path to AwakeningI thought I recall once when my father the Sakyan was working and I was sitting in the cool shade of a roseapple tree then  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful mental qualities  I entered  remained in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationCould that be the path to Awakening Then following on that memory came the realization That is the path to Awakening I thought So why am I afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensuality nothing to do with unskillful mental qualities I thought I am no longer afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensuality nothing to do with unskillful mental qualities but that pleasure is not easy to achieve with a body so extremely emaciatedSuppose I were to take some solid food some rice  porridge So I took some solid food some rice  porridgeNow five monks had been attending on me thinking If Gotama our contemplative achieves some higher state he will tell us But when they saw me taking some solid food  some rice  porridge  they were disgusted and left me thinking Gotama the contemplative is living luxuriouslyHe has abandoned his exertion and is backsliding into abundanceSo when I had taken solid food and regained strength then  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful mental qualities I entered  remained in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationBut the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainWith the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations I entered  remained in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceBut the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainWith the fading of rapture I remained in equanimity mindful  alert and sensed pleasure with the bodyI entered  remained in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainWith the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of joys  distresses  I entered  remained in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor painBut the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past livesI recollected my manifold past lives ie one birth two five ten fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many eons of cosmic contraction many eons of cosmic expansion many eons of cosmic contraction  expansion There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose thereThere too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose here Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes  detailsThis was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteBut the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away  reappearance of beingsI saw  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech  mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellBut these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech  mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  I saw beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kammaThis was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteBut the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the fermentationsI discerned as it had come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations My heart thus knowing thus seeing was released from the fermentation of sensuality released from the fermentation of becoming released from the fermentation of ignoranceWith release there was the knowledge Released I discerned that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThis was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteBut the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainI recall having taught the Dhamma to an assembly of many hundreds and yet each one of them assumes of me Gotama the contemplative is teaching the Dhamma attacking just me but it shouldnt be seen in that wayThe Tathagata rightly teaches them the Dhamma simply for the purpose of giving knowledgeAt the end of that very talk I steady the mind inwardly settle it concentrate it and unify it in the same theme of concentration as before in which I almost constantly dwellThat is credible for the Master Gotama as would be the case for one who is worthy  rightly selfawakenedBut does the Master Gotama recall sleeping during the dayI recall Aggivessana in the last month of the hot season after the meal returning from my almsround setting out my outer robe folded in four lying down on my right side and falling asleep while mindful  alertThere are some brahmans  contemplatives Master Gotama who would call that dwelling in delusionIts not to that extent that one is deluded or undeluded AggivessanaAs to how one is deluded or undeluded listen and pay close attentionI will speakAs you say Master Gotama Saccaka respondedThe Blessed One said In whomever the fermentations that defile that lead to renewed becoming that give trouble that ripen in stress and lead to future birth aging  death are not abandoned Him I call deludedFor it is from not abandoning the fermentations that one is deludedIn whomever the fermentations that defile that lead to renewed becoming that give trouble that ripen in stress and lead to future birth aging  death are abandoned Him I call undeludedFor it is from abandoning the fermentations that one is undeludedIn the Tathagata Aggivessana the fermentations that defile that lead to renewed becoming that give trouble that ripen in stress and lead to future birth aging  death have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of existence not destined for future arisingJust as a palmyra cut off at the crown is incapable of further growth in the same way in the Tathagata the fermentations that defile that lead to renewed becoming that give trouble that ripen in stress and lead to future birth aging  death have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of existence not destined for future arisingThen Mahapajapati Gotami went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him stood to one sideAs she was standing there she said to him It would be good venerable sir if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief such that having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One I might dwell alone secluded heedful ardent  resoluteGotami the qualities of which you may know These qualities lead to passion not to dispassion to being fettered not to being unfettered to accumulating not to shedding to selfaggrandizement not to modesty to discontent not to contentment to entanglement not to seclusion to laziness not to aroused persistence to being burdensome not to being unburdensome You may definitely hold This is not the Dhamma this is not the Vinaya this is not the Teachers instructionAs for the qualities of which you may know These qualities lead to dispassion not to passion to being unfettered not to being fettered to shedding not to accumulating to modesty not to selfaggrandizement to contentment not to discontent to seclusion not to entanglement to aroused persistence not to laziness to being unburdensome not to being burdensome You may definitely hold This is the Dhamma this is the Vinaya this is the Teachers instruction That is what the Blessed One saidGratified Mahapajapati Gotami delighted in his wordsThe Blessed One said Its through direct knowledge that I teach the Dhamma not without direct knowledgeIts with a cause that I teach the Dhamma not without a causeIts with marvels that I teach the Dhamma not without marvelsBecause I teach the Dhamma through direct knowledge and not without direct knowledge because I teach the Dhamma with a cause and not without a cause because I teach the Dhamma with marvels and not without marvels there is good reason for my instruction good reason for my admonitionAnd it is enough for you to be content enough for you to be gratified enough for you to take joy that the Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One and the community has practiced rightlyNow at that time a baby boy was lying faceup on Prince Abhayas lapSo the Blessed One said to the prince What do you think prince If this young boy through your own negligence or that of the nurse were to take a stick or a piece of gravel into its mouth what would you doI would take it out venerable sirIf I couldnt get it out right away then holding its head in my left hand and crooking a finger of my right I would take it out even if it meant drawing bloodWhy is thatBecause I have sympathy for the young boyIn the same way princeIn the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be unfactual untrue unbeneficial unendearing  disagreeable to others he does not say themIn the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true unbeneficial unendearing  disagreeable to others he does not say themIn the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true beneficial but unendearing  disagreeable to others he has a sense of the proper time for saying themIn the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be unfactual untrue unbeneficial but endearing  agreeable to others he does not say themIn the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true unbeneficial but endearing  agreeable to others he does not say themIn the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true beneficial and endearing  agreeable to others he has a sense of the proper time for saying themWhy is thatBecause the Tathagata has sympathy for living beingsOnce the Blessed One was staying at Kosambi in the Simsapa forestThen picking up a few simsapa leaves with his hand he asked the monks How do you construe this monks Which are more numerous the few simsapa leaves in my hand or those overhead in the simsapa forestThe leaves in the hand of the Blessed One are few in number lordThose overhead in the forest are far more numerousIn the same way monks those things that I have known with direct knowledge but have not taught are far more numerousAnd why havent I taught themBecause they are not connected with the goal do not relate to the rudiments of the holy life and do not lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingThat is why I have not taught themAnd what have I taughtThis is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is what I have taughtAnd why have I taught these thingsBecause they are connected with the goal relate to the rudiments of the holy life and lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingThis is why I have taught themThen Kevatta the householder approached the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Venerable sir this Nalanda is powerful both prosperous and populous filled with people who have faith in the Blessed OneIt would be good if the Blessed One were to direct a monk to display a marvel of psychic power from his superior human state so that Nalanda would to an even greater extent have faith in the Blessed OneWhen this was said the Blessed One said to Kevatta the householder Kevatta I dont teach the monks in this way Come monks display a marvel of psychic power to the lay people clad in white A second time A third time Kevatta the householder said to the Blessed One I wont argue with the Blessed One but I tell you Venerable sir this Nalanda is powerful both prosperous and populous filled with people who have faith in the Blessed OneIt would be good if the Blessed One were to direct a monk to display a marvel of psychic power from his superior human state so that Nalanda would to an even greater extent have faith in the Blessed OneA third time the Blessed One said to Kevatta the householder Kevatta I dont teach the monks in this way Come monks display a marvel of psychic power to the lay people clad in whiteKevatta there are these three marvels that I have declared having directly known and realized them for myselfWhich threeThe marvel of psychic power the marvel of telepathy and the marvel of instructionAnd what is the marvel of psychic powerThere is the case where a monk wields manifold psychic powersHaving been one he becomes many having been many he becomes oneHe appearsHe vanishesHe goes unimpeded through walls ramparts and mountains as if through spaceHe dives in and out of the earth as if it were waterHe walks on water without sinking as if it were dry landSitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged birdWith his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon so mighty and powerfulHe exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worldsThen someone who has faith and conviction in him sees him wielding manifold psychic powers exercising influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worldsHe reports this to someone who has no faith and no conviction telling him Isnt it awesomeIsnt it astounding how great the power how great the prowess of this contemplativeJust now I saw him wielding manifold psychic powers exercising influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worldsThen the person without faith without conviction would say to the person with faith and with conviction Sir there is a charm called the Gandhari charm by which the monk wielded manifold psychic powers exercising influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds What do you think Kevatta  isnt that what the man without faith without conviction would say to the man with faith and with convictionThats what he would say venerable sirSeeing this drawback to the marvel of psychic power Kevatta I feel repelled ashamed  disgusted with the marvel of psychic powerAnd what is the marvel of telepathyThere is the case where a monk reads the minds the mental events the thoughts the ponderings of other beings other individuals Such is your thinking here is where your thinking is thus is your mindThen someone who has faith and conviction in him sees him reading the minds of other beings He reports this to someone who has no faith and no conviction telling him Isnt it awesomeIsnt it astounding how great the power how great the prowess of this contemplativeJust now I saw him reading the minds of other beingsThen the person without faith without conviction would say to the person with faith and with conviction Sir there is a charm called the Manika charm by which the monk read the minds of other beings What do you think Kevatta  isnt that what the man without faith without conviction would say to the man with faith and with convictionThats what he would say venerable sirSeeing this drawback to the marvel of telepathy Kevatta I feel repelled ashamed  disgusted with the marvel of telepathyAnd what is the marvel of instructionThere is the case where a monk gives instruction in this way Direct your thought in this way dont direct it in thatAttend to things in this way dont attend to them in thatLet go of this enter and remain in that This Kevatta is called the marvel of instructionThen there is the case where a Tathagata appears in the world worthy and rightly selfawakenedHe teaches the Dhamma admirable in its beginning admirable in its middle admirable in its endHe proclaims the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pureA householder or householders son hearing the Dhamma gains conviction in the Tathagata and reflects Household life is confining a dusty pathThe life gone forth is like the open airIt is not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shellWhat if I were to shave off my hair and beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessnessSo after some time he abandons his mass of wealth large or small leaves his circle of relatives large or small shaves off his hair and beard puts on the ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessnessWhen he has thus gone forth he With his mind thus concentrated purified  bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge  vision to creating a mindmade body to the modes of supranormal powers to the divine earelement to knowledge of the awareness of other beings to knowledge of the recollection of past lives to knowledge of the passing away  reappearance of beings to the knowledge of the ending of the fermentationsHe discerns as it has come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentation of sensuality the fermentation of becoming the fermentation of ignoranceWith release there is the knowledge Released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this world Just as if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen  clear limpid and unsullied  where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells gravel and pebbles and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting and it would occur to him This pool of water is clear limpid and unsulliedHere are these shells gravel and pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability  the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the fermentationsHe discerns as it has come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentation of sensuality the fermentation of becoming the fermentation of ignoranceWith release there is the knowledge Released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThis too is called the marvel of instructionThese are the three marvels that I declare Kevatta having directly known and realized them for myselfMatangaputtaVakkaliTekicchakaniSappadasaA bandit chiefI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryThen VenMaha Kassapa went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him You are now old KassapaYour robes made of castoff hemp rags are heavy for youSo wear robes donated by householders eat invitational meals and live close by meLord for a long time I have lived in the wilderness and have extolled living in the wildernessI have been an almsgoer and have extolled being an almsgoerI have worn cast off rags and have extolled wearing cast off ragsI have worn only one set of the triple robe and have extolled wearing only one set of the triple robeI have been modest and have extolled being modestI have been content and have extolled being contentI have been reclusive and have extolled being reclusiveI have been unentangled and have extolled being unentangledI have kept my persistence aroused and have extolled having persistence arousedBut Kassapa what compelling reason do you see that you for a long time have lived in the wilderness and have extolled living in the wilderness that you have kept your persistence aroused and have extolled having persistence arousedLord I see two compelling reasons that for a long time I have lived in the wilderness and have extolled living in the wilderness that I have kept my persistence aroused and have extolled having persistence aroused seeing a pleasant abiding for myself in the here  now and feeling sympathy for later generations Perhaps later generations will take it as an example It seems that the disciples of the Awakened One and those who awakened after him lived for a long time in the wilderness and extolled living in the wilderness were almsgoers and extolled being almsgoers wore cast off rags and extolled wearing cast off rags wore only one set of the triple robe and extolled wearing only one set of the triple robe were modest and extolled being modest were content and extolled being content were reclusive and extolled being reclusive were unentangled and extolled being unentangled kept their persistence aroused and extolled having persistence aroused Good KassapaVery goodIt seems that you are one who practices for the happiness of many out of compassion for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of beings human  divineSo continue wearing your robes of cast off hemp cloth go for alms and live in the wildernessEndowed with five qualities a monk pursuing mindfulness of inout breathing will in no long time penetrate the UnprovokedWhich fiveHe is a person who imposes only a little one of few duties  projects easy to support easily contented with the requisites of lifeHe is a person who eats only a little food committed to not indulging his stomachHe is a person of

seclusion nonentanglement arousing persistence virtue concentration discernment release and the knowledge  vision of release He lives in the wilderness in an isolated dwelling placeHe reflects on the mind as it is releasedEndowed with these five qualities a monk pursuing mindfulness of inout breathing will in no long time penetrate the UnprovokedMindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued is of great fruit of great benefitMindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued brings the four frames of reference to their culminationThe four frames of reference when developed  pursued bring the seven factors for Awakening to their culminationThe seven factors for Awakening when developed  pursued bring clear knowing  release to their culminationNow how is mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefitThere is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the foreAlways mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out Breathing in long he discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long Or breathing in short he discerns I am breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns I am breathing out short He trains himself I will

benefitAnd how is mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination On whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long discerns I am breathing out long or breathing in short discerns I am breathing in short or breathing out short discerns I am breathing out short trains himself I will breathe in  out sensitive to the entire body trains himself I will breathe in  out calming bodily fabrication On that occasion the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert

distress is one who watches carefully with equanimity which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldThis is how mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culminationAnd how are the four frames of reference developed  pursued so as to bring the seven factors for Awakening to their culminationOn whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world on that occasion his mindfulness is steady  without lapseWhen his mindfulness is steady  without lapse then mindfulness as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its developmentRemaining mindful in this way he examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernmentWhen he remains mindful in this way examining analyzing  coming to a comprehension of that quality with discernment then analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its developmentIn one who examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment unflagging persistence is arousedWhen unflagging persistence is

enraptured monk grow calm then calm as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its developmentFor one who is at ease  his body calmed  the mind becomes concentratedWhen the mind of one who is at ease  his body calmed  becomes concentrated then concentration as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the

culminationAnd how are the seven factors for Awakening developed  pursued so as to bring clear knowing  release to their culminationThere is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in relinquishmentHe develops analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening persistence as a factor for Awakening rapture as a factor for Awakening calm as a factor for Awakening concentration as a factor for Awakening equanimity as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in relinquishmentThis is how the seven factors for Awakening are developed  pursued so as to bring clear knowing  release to their culminationThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsAt SavatthiThere the Blessed One said Monks do you develop mindfulness of inout breathingWhen this was said VenArittha replied to the Blessed One I develop mindfulness of inout breathing lordBut how do you develop mindfulness of inout breathing AritthaHaving abandoned sensual desire for past sensual pleasures lord having done away with sensual desire for future sensual pleasures and having thoroughly subdued perceptions of irritation with regard to internal  external events I breathe in mindfully and breathe out mindfullyThere is that mindfulness of inout breathing AritthaI dont say that there isntBut as to how mindfulness of inout breathing is brought in detail to its culmination listen and pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord VenArittha responded to the Blessed OneThe Blessed One said And how Arittha is mindfulness of inout breathing brought in detail to its culminationThere is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the foreAlways mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out Breathing in long he discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long He trains himself I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment He trains himself I will breathe out focusing on relinquishmentThis Arittha is how mindfulness of inout breathing is brought in detail to its culminationMonks concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued is of great fruit of great benefitAnd how is concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefitThere is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the foreAlways mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out Breathing in long he discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long He trains himself I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment He trains himself I will breathe out focusing on relinquishmentThis is how concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefitI too monks before my Awakening when I was an unawakened bodhisatta frequently remained with this abidingWhen I frequently remained with this abiding neither my body was fatigued nor were my eyes and my mind through lack of clingingsustenance was released from fermentationsSo if a monk should wish May neither my body be fatigued nor my eyes and may my mind through lack of clingingsustenance be released from fermentations then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May my memories  resolves related to the household life be abandoned then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I remain percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I remain percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome  what is percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I  in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not  cutting myself off from both  remain equanimous mindful  alert then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities  enter  remain in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations enter  remain in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I with the fading of rapture remain equnimous mindful  alert sense pleasure with the body and enter  remain in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I with the abandoning of pleasure  stress  as with the earlier disappearance of joys  distresses  enter  remain in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity Infinite space enter  remain in the dimension of the infinitude of space then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space Infinite consciousness enter  remain in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness There is nothing enter  remain in the dimension of nothingness then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness enter  remain in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception enter  remain in the cessation of perception  feeling then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingWhen concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing is thus developed thus pursued then if he senses a feeling of pleasure he discerns that it is inconstant not grasped at not relishedIf he senses a feeling of pain he discerns that it is inconstant not grasped at not relishedIf he senses a feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain he discerns that it is inconstant not grasped at not relishedIf he senses a feeling of pleasure he senses it disjoined from itIf he senses a feeling of pain he senses it disjoined from itIf he senses a feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain he senses it disjoined from itWhen sensing a feeling limited to the body he discerns that I am sensing a feeling limited to the body When sensing a feeling limited to life he discerns that I am sensing a feeling limited to life He discerns that With the breakup of the body after the termination of life everything that is experienced not being relished will grow cold right hereJust as an oil lamp burns in dependence on oil  wick and from the termination of the oil  wick  and from not being provided any other sustenance  it goes out unnourished in the same way when sensing a feeling limited to the body he discerns that I am sensing a feeling limited to the body When sensing a feeling limited to life he discerns that I am sensing a feeling limited to life He discerns that With the breakup of the body after the termination of life everything that is sensed not being relished will grow cold right hereI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vesali in the Great Wood at the Gabled HallNow on that occasion the Blessed One with many lines of reasoning was giving the monks a talk on the unattractiveness was speaking in praise of unattractiveness was speaking in praise of the development of unattractivenessThen the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks I wish to go into seclusion for half a monthI am not to be approached by anyone at all except for the one who brings almsfoodAs you say lord the monks responded to himAnd no one approached the Blessed One except for the one who brought almsfoodThen the monks  The Blessed One with many lines of reasoning has given a talk on the unattractiveness has spoken in praise of unattractiveness has spoken in praise of the development of unattractiveness  remained committed to the development of unattractiveness in many modes  mannersThey  ashamed repelled  disgusted with this body  sought for an assassinIn one day ten monks took the knifeIn one day twenty monks took the knifeIn one day thirty monks took the knifeThen the Blessed One emerging from his seclusion after half a months time said to VenAnanda Ananda why does the community of monks seem so depletedBecause lord the Blessed One with many lines of reasoning gave the monks a talk on the unattractiveness spoke in praise of unattractiveness spoke in praise of the development of unattractivenessThe monks remained committed to the development of unattractiveness in many modes  mannersThey  ashamed repelled  disgusted with this body  sought for an assassinIn one day ten monks twenty monks thirty monks took the knifeIt would be good lord if the Blessed One would explain another method so that this community of monks might be established in gnosisIn that case Ananda gather in the assembly hall all the monks who live in dependence on VesaliAs you say lord VenAnanda respondedWhen he had gathered in the assembly hall all the monks who lived in dependence on Vesali he went to the Blessed One and said The community of monks is gathered lordNow is the time to do as the Blessed One sees fitThen the Blessed One went to the assembly hall and sat down on a seat made readyAs he was sitting there he addressed the monks Monks this concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued is both peaceful  exquisite a refreshing  pleasant abiding that immediately disperses  allays any evil unskillful qualities that have arisenJust as when in the last month of the hot season a great raincloud out of season immediately disperses  allays the dust  dirt that have stirred up in the same way this concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued is both peaceful  exquisite a refreshing  pleasant abiding that immediately disperses  allays any evil unskillful qualities that have arisenAnd how is concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to be both peaceful  exquisite a refreshing  pleasant abiding that immediately disperses  allays any evil unskillful qualities that have arisenThere is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the foreAlways mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out Breathing in long he discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long He trains himself I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment He trains himself I will breathe out focusing on relinquishmentThis is how concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to be both peaceful  exquisite a refreshing  pleasant abiding that immediately disperses  allays any evil unskillful qualities that have arisenThere is the case where a monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five hindrancesAnd how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five hindrancesThere is the case where there being sensual desire present within a monk discerns that There is sensual desire present within me Or there being no sensual desire present within he discerns that There is no sensual desire present within me He discerns how there is the arising of unarisen sensual desireAnd he discerns how there is the abandoning of sensual desire once it has arisenAnd he discerns how there is no further appearance in the future of sensual desire that has been abandonedFurthermore the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the seven factors for AwakeningAnd how does he remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the seven factors for AwakeningThere is the case where there being mindfulness as a factor for Awakening present within he discerns that Mindfulness as a factor for Awakening is present within me Or there being no mindfulness as a factor for Awakening present within he discerns that Mindfulness as a factor for Awakening is not present within me He discerns how there is the arising of unarisen mindfulness as a factor for AwakeningAnd he discerns how there is the culmination of the development of mindfulness as a factor for Awakening once it has arisen And what is the food for the arising of unarisen analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening or for the growth  increase of analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening once it has arisenThere are mental qualities that are skillful  unskillful blameworthy  blameless gross  refined siding with darkness  with lightTo foster appropriate attention to them This is the food for the arising of unarisen analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening or for the growth  increase of analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening once it has arisenIf a monk would wish May I attain  whenever I want without strain without difficulty  the four jhanas that are heightened mental states pleasant abidings in the herenow then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection who is committed to inner tranquility of awareness who does not neglect jhana who is endowed with insight and who frequents empty dwellingsIf a monk would wish May I  with the ending of fermentations  remain in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known  realized them for myself right in the herenow then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection who is committed to inner tranquility of awareness who does not neglect jhana who is endowed with insight and who frequents empty dwellingsThe individual who has attained internal tranquility of awareness but not insight into phenomena through heightened discernment should approach an individual who has attained insight into phenomena through heightened discernment and ask him How should fabrications be regardedHow should they be investigatedHow should they be seen with insight The other will answer in line with what he has seen  experienced Fabrications should be regarded in this wayFabrications should be investigated in this wayFabrications should be seen in this way with insight Then eventually he will become one who has attained both internal tranquility of awareness  insight into phenomena through heightened discernmentAs for the individual who has attained insight into phenomena through heightened discernment but not internal tranquility of awareness he should approach an individual who has attained internal tranquility of awareness and ask him How should the mind be steadiedHow should it be made to settle downHow should it be unifiedHow should it be concentrated The other will answer in line with what he has seen  experienced The mind should be steadied in this wayThe mind should be made to settle down in this wayThe mind should be unified in this wayThe mind should be concentrated in this way Then eventually he will become one who has attained both internal tranquility of awareness  insight into phenomena through heightened discernmentI have also taught the stepbystep cessation of

has attained the fourth jhana inandout breathing has been calmedWhen one has attained the cessation of perception  feeling perception  feeling have been calmedWhen a monks fermentations have ended

SanctuaryThere he said to the monks This Unbinding is pleasant friendsThis Unbinding is pleasantWhen this was said VenUdayin said to VenSariputta But what is the pleasure here my friend where there is nothing feltJust that is the pleasure here my friend where there is nothing feltThere are these five strands of sensualityWhich fiveForms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing sounds cognizable via the ear aromas cognizable via the nose flavors cognizable via the tongue tactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingWhatever pleasure or joy arises in dependence on these five strands of sensuality that is sensual pleasureNow there is the case where a monk  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationIf as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with sensuality that is an affliction for himJust as pain arises as an affliction in a healthy person for his affliction even so the attention to perceptions dealing with sensuality that beset the monk is an affliction for himNow the Blessed One has said that whatever is an affliction is stressSo by this line of reasoning it may be known how Unbinding is pleasantThen there is the case where a monk with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceIf as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with directed thought that is an affliction for himThen there is the

Unbinding is pleasantThen there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception enters  remains in the cessation of perception  feelingAnd having seen with discernment his fermentations are completely endedSo by this line of reasoning it may be known how Unbinding is pleasantThen the Blessed One emerging from his seclusion after three months time addressed the monks Monks if wanderers of other sects should ask you With what abiding did Master Gotama often remain during the Rains retreat  thus asked you should answer them The Blessed One often remained with concentration through inout breathing during the Rains retreatMonks if anyone speaking rightly were to described something as a noble dwelling a brahmadwelling the Tathagatas dwelling he would speaking rightly describe concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing as a noble dwelling a brahmadwelling the Tathagatas dwellingThose monks who are trainees yearning for the unexcelled relief from bondage their aspirations as yet unfulfilled for them concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued leads to the ending of the fermentationsAs for those monks who are worthy ones devoid of fermentations  who have attained completion finished the task laid down the burden attained the true goal destroyed the fetters of becoming and are released through right knowledge for them concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued leads to a pleasant dwelling here  now and to mindfulness  alertnessIf anyone speaking rightly were to described something as a noble dwelling a brahmadwelling the Tathagatas dwelling he would speaking rightly describe concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing as a noble dwelling a brahmadwelling the Tathagatas dwellingNow based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect that I am subject to death have not gone beyond deathThere are beings who are intoxicated with a living persons intoxication with lifeBecause of that intoxication with life they conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mindBut when they often reflect on that fact that living persons intoxication with life will either be entirely abandoned or grow weakerNow a disciple of the noble ones considers this I am not the only one subject to death who has not gone beyond deathTo the extent that there are beings  past and future passing away and rearising  all beings are subject to death have not gone beyond death When heshe often reflects on this the path take birthHeshe sticks with that path develops it cultivates itAs heshe sticks with that path develops it and cultivates it the fetters are abandoned the latent tendencies destroyedI have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying at Nadika in the Brick HallThere he addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks repliedThe Blessed One said Mindfulness of death when developed  pursued is of great fruit  great benefitIt gains a footing in the Deathless has the Deathless as its final endTherefore you should develop mindfulness of deathWhen this was said a certain monk addressed the Blessed One I already develop mindfulness of deathAnd how do you develop mindfulness of deathI think O that I might live for a day  night that I might attend to the Blessed Ones instructionsI would have accomplished a great deal This is how I develop mindfulness of deathThen another monk addressed the Blessed One I too already develop mindfulness of deathAnd how do you develop mindfulness of deathI think O that I might live for a day that I might attend to the Blessed Ones instructionsI would have accomplished a great deal This is how I develop mindfulness of deathThen another monk addressed the Blessed One I too develop mindfulness of death I think O that I might live for the interval that it takes to eat a meal that I might attend to the Blessed Ones instructionsI would have accomplished a great dealThen another monk addressed the Blessed One I too develop mindfulness of death I think O that I might live for the interval that it takes to swallow having chewed up four morsels of food that I might attend to the Blessed Ones instructionsI would have accomplished a great dealThen another monk addressed the Blessed One I too develop mindfulness of death I think O that I might live for the interval that it takes to swallow having chewed up one morsel of food that I might attend to the Blessed Ones instructionsI would have accomplished a great dealThen another monk addressed the Blessed One I too develop mindfulness of death I think O that I might live for the interval that it takes to breathe out after breathing in or to breathe in after breathing out that I might attend to the Blessed Ones instructionsI would have accomplished a great deal This is how I develop mindfulness of deathWhen this was said the Blessed One addressed the monksWhoever develops mindfulness of death thinking O that I might live for a day  night for a day for the interval that it takes to eat a meal for the interval that it takes to swallow having chewed up four morsels of food that I might attend to the Blessed Ones instructionsI would have accomplished a great deal  they are said to dwell heedlesslyThey develop mindfulness of death slowly for the sake of ending the fermentationsBut whoever develops mindfulness of death thinking O that I might live for the interval that it takes to swallow having chewed up one morsel of food for the interval that it takes to breathe out after breathing in or to breathe in after breathing out that I might attend to the Blessed Ones instructionsI would have accomplished a great deal  they are said to dwell heedfullyThey develop mindfulness of death acutely for the sake of ending the fermentationsTherefore you should train yourselves We will dwell heedfullyWe will develop mindfulness of death acutely for the sake of ending the fermentations That is how you should train yourselvesThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsI have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying at Nadika in the Brick HallThere he addressed the monks Monks mindfulness of death  when developed  pursued  is of great fruit  great benefitIt gains a footing in the Deathless has the Deathless as its final endAnd how is mindfulness of death developed  pursued so that it is of great fruit  great benefit gains a footing in the Deathless and has the Deathless as its final endThere is the case where a monk as day departs and night returns reflects Many are the causes of my deathA snake might bite me a scorpion might sting me a centipede might bite meThat would be how my death would come aboutThat would be an obstruction for meStumbling I might fall my food digested might trouble me my bile might be provoked my phlegm piercing wind forces might be provokedThat would be how my death would come aboutThat would be an obstruction for me Then the monk should investigate Are there any evil unskillful mental qualities unabandoned by me that would be an obstruction for me were I to die in the night If on reflecting he realizes that there are evil unskillful mental qualities unabandoned by him that would be an obstruction for him were he to die in the night then he should put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor undivided mindfulness  alertness for the abandoning of those very same evil unskillful qualitiesJust as when a person whose turban or head was on fire would put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor undivided mindfulness  alertness to put out the fire on his turban or head in the same way the monk should put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor undivided mindfulness  alertness for the abandoning of those very same evil unskillful qualitiesBut if on reflecting he realizes that there are no evil unskillful mental qualities unabandoned by him that would be an obstruction for him were he to die in the night then for that very reason he should dwell in joy  rapture training himself day  night in skillful qualitiesFurther

the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThen King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One in the middle of the day and on arrival having bowed down sat down to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Well now your majesty where are you coming from in the middle of the dayJust now lord I was engaged in the sort of royal affairs typical of headanointed noblewarrior kings intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures who have attained stable control in their country and who rule having conquered a great sphere of territory on earthWhat do you think your majestySuppose a man trustworthy and reliable were to come to you from the east and on arrival would say If it please your majesty you should know that I come from the eastThere I saw a great mountain as high as the clouds coming this way crushing all living beingsDo whatever you think should be done Then a second man were to come to you from the west Then a third man were to come to you from the north Then a fourth man were to come to you from the south and on arrival would say If it please your majesty you should know that I come from the southThere I saw a great mountain as high as the clouds coming this way crushing all living beingsDo whatever you think should be done If your majesty such a great peril should arise such a terrible destruction of human life  the human state being so hard to obtain  what should be doneIf lord such a great peril should arise such a terrible destruction of human life  the human state being so hard to obtain  what else should be done but Dhammaconduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deedsI inform you your majesty I announce to you your majesty aging and death are rolling in on youWhen aging and death are rolling in on you great king what should be doneAs aging and death are rolling in on me lord what else should be done but Dhammaconduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deedsThere are lord elephant battles headanointed noblewarrior kings intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures who have attained stable control in their country and who rule having conquered a great sphere of territory on earth but there is no use for those elephant battles no scope for them when aging and death are rolling inThere are cavalry battles chariot battles infantry battles but there is no use for those infantry battles no scope for them when aging and death are rolling inIn this royal court there are counselors who when the enemies arrive are capable of dividing them by their wits but there is no use for those battles of wits no scope for them when aging and death are rolling inIn this royal court there is abundant bullion and gold stored in vaults and depositories and with such wealth we are capable of buying off enemies when they come but there is no use for those battles of wealth no scope for them when aging and death are rolling inAs aging and death are rolling in on me venerable sir what else should be done but Dhammaconduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deedsSo it is your majestySo it is your majestyAs aging and death are rolling in on you what else should be done but Dhammaconduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deedsThat is what the Blessed One saidHaving said that the One WellGone the Teacher further said thisAnd who is the person who subject to death is not afraid or in terror of deathThere is the case of the person who has abandoned passion desire fondness thirst fever and craving for sensuality who has abandoned passion desire fondness thirst fever and craving for the body who has done what is good what is skillful has given protection to those in fear and has not done what is evil savage or cruel who has no doubt or perplexity who has arrived at certainty with regard to the True DhammaWhen he comes down with a serious disease he does not grieve is not tormented does not weep or beat his breast or grow deliriousThis is another person who subject to death is not afraid or in terror of deathJust as a fire Vaccha burns with sustenance and not without sustenance even so I declare the rebirth of one who has sustenance and not of one without sustenanceBut Venerable Gotama at the moment a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance what do you say is its sustenance thenVaccha when a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance I say that it is windsustainedThe wind Vaccha is its sustenance at that timeAnd at the moment when a being sets this body aside and has not yet attained another body what do you say is its sustenance thenActually Vaccha when a being sets this body aside and has not yet attained another body I say that it is cravingsustainedCraving Vaccha is its sustenance at that timeMogharajaNow how is mindfulness immersed in the body developed how is it pursued so as to be of great fruit  great benefitThere is the case where a monk  having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building  sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the foreAlways mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes outBreathing in long he discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long Or breathing in short he discerns I am breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns I am breathing out short He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication He trains himself I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication And as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centeredThis is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the bodyFurthermore when walking the monk discerns I am walking When standing he discerns I am standing When sitting he discerns I am sitting When lying down he discerns I am lying down Or however his body is disposed that is how he discerns it This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the bodyFurthermore when going forward  returning he makes himself fully alert when looking toward  looking away when bending  extending his limbs when carrying his outer cloak his upper robe  his bowl when eating drinking chewing  savoring when urinating  defecating when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking  remaining silent he makes himself fully alert This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the bodyFurthermore just as if a sack with openings at both ends were full of various kinds of grain  wheat rice mung beans kidney beans sesame seeds husked rice  and a man with good eyesight pouring it out were to reflect This is wheatThis is riceThese are mung beansThese are kidney beansThese are sesame seedsThis is husked rice in the same way the monk reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet on up from the crown of the head on down surrounded by skin and full of various kinds of unclean things In this body there are head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs large intestines small intestines gorge feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears skinoil saliva mucus fluid in the joints urine This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the bodyFurthermore just as a skilled butcher or his apprentice having killed a cow would sit at a crossroads cutting it up into pieces the monk contemplates this very body  however it stands however it is disposed  in terms of properties In this body there is the earth property the liquid property the fire property  the wind property This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the bodyFurthermore as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground  one day two days three days dead  bloated livid  festering he applies it to this very body This body too Such is its nature such is its future such its unavoidable fateOr again as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground picked at by crows vultures  hawks by dogs hyenas  various other creatures a skeleton smeared with flesh  blood connected with tendons a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood connected with tendons a skeleton without flesh or blood connected with tendons bones detached from their tendons scattered in all directions  here a hand bone there a foot bone here a shin bone there a thigh bone here a hip bone there a back bone here a rib there a chest bone here a shoulder bone there a neck bone here a jaw bone there a tooth here a skull the bones whitened somewhat like the color of shells piled up more than a year old decomposed into a powder He applies it to this very body This body too Such is its nature such is its future such its unavoidable fateAnd as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centeredThis is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the bodyFurthermore quite secluded from sensuality secluded from

body with the rapture  pleasure born from seclusionJust as if a skilled bathman or bathmans apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together sprinkling it again  again with water so that his ball of bath powder  saturated moistureladen permeated within  without  would nevertheless not drip even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of seclusionThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born from seclusionAnd as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are

with the skies supplying abundant showers time  again so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate  pervade suffuse  fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of concentrationThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure

enters  remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the pleasure divested of raptureJust as in a lotus pond some of the lotuses born  growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated  pervaded suffused  filled with cool water from their roots to their tips and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water even so the monk permeates this very body with the pleasure divested of

pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of joys  distresses  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpainHe sits permeating the body with a

in the supreme supreme is the resultIn recent years more and more Westerners have come into contact with Theravada Buddhist monks and many have become curious about the rules governing the monks lifeThis introduction is meant to help satisfy that curiosity by giving a brief explanation of the rationale behind the rules and their enforcement and by providing summaries of the rules classed according to topicAnyone interested in more information on the rules and their interpretation may look into the book The Buddhist Monastic Code The Patimokkha Training Rules Translated and ExplainedReaders may also wish to refer to the complete list of Patimokkha rulesOne of the first questions that many people ask is why the monks have rules in the first placeSince the Dhamma aims at freedom and depends on selfreliance wouldnt it be better to let the monks develop their own innate sense of right and wrong unfettered by legalismsThe answer to this question lies in the fact that the monks form a Community reliant on the support of lay Buddhists and anyone who has lived for any time in a communal situation knows that communities need rules in order to function peacefullyThe Buddha in laying down each rule gave ten reasons for doing so for the excellence of the Community the peace of the Community the curbing of the shameless the comfort of wellbehaved bhikkhus the restraint of pollutants related to the present life the prevention of pollutants related to the next life the arousing of faith in the faithless the increase of the faithful the establishment of the true Dhamma and the fostering of disciplineThese reasons fall into three main typesThe first two are external to ensure peace and wellbeing within the Community itself and to foster and protect faith among the laity on whom the monks depend for their supportThe third type of reason is internal to help restrain and prevent mental pollutants within the individual monksThis last point quickly becomes apparent to anyone who seriously tries to keep to the rules for they encourage mindfulness and circumspection in ones actions qualities that carry over into the training of the mindRules however are not the only way to express ethical norms and the Buddha also made use of principles and models in teaching the virtues he wanted his following to developThe rules thus function in a wider context than simple legality and work together with the principles and models formulated by the Buddha to provide a complete training in behavior with each side making up for the weaknesses of the otherPrinciples and models serve as personal subjective standards and tend to be loosely definedTheir interpretation and application are left to the judgment of the individualThus they are difficult to enforce when an individual has blatantly overstepped the bounds of proper behaviorRules serve as more objective standards and thus are more enforceableTo work they must be precisely defined in a way acceptable to the Community at largeThis precision though accounts for their weakness in general as universal guides to behaviorTo begin with a clear practical line must be drawn between black and white ie between what is and is not an infraction of the ruleIn some cases it is difficult to find a practical break off point that corresponds exactly to ones intuitive sense of what is right and wrong so it is sometimes necessary to include the areas of gray either with the black or the whiteSecondly the more precisely a rule is defined to suit a particular time and place the less well it may fit other times and placesThis is where principles and models come in They indicate the spirit of the rules and aid in applying them to differing contextsThus as you look at the rules and contemplate them you should keep in mind that they function in a larger context the teachings and practice of the Dhamma as a wholeThe Buddhas own name for the religion he founded was DhammaVinaya so remember that neither half was meant to function without the otherThe Buddha did not set out a code of rules all at onceInstead he formulated rules one by one in response to particular incidentsThe Canon reports these incidents in each case and often a knowledge of these origin stories can help in understanding the reasons behind the rulesFor instance the origin story to the rule forbidding lustful conduct between monks and women shows that the Buddha did not view women as somehow inferior or uncleanRather the rule comes from an incident where a monk was fondling the wife of a Brahman who had come to visit his hut and the Buddha wanted women to feel safe in the knowledge that when visiting monasteries they would not be in danger of being molestedSome of the stories are classics of Buddhist literature and show a dry understated sense of humor together with a perceptive insight into human foiblesThe element of humor here is very important for without it there can be no intelligent set of rules to govern human behaviorAs time passed and the number of rules grew some of the Buddhas followers headed by VenUpali gathered the major rules into a set code  the Patimokkha  that eventually contained rulesThe minor rules which came to number several hundred they gathered into chapters loosely organized according to topic called KhandhakasThe Patimokkha as we now have it is embedded in a text called the Sutta VibhangaThis presents each rule preceded by its origin story and followed by what permutations if any it went through before reaching its final formThe rule is then analyzed into its component elements to show how the factors of effort object perception intention and result do or do not mitigate the penalty assigned by the ruleThe discussion then concludes with a list of extenuating circumstances for which there is no offense in breaking the ruleThe system of penalties the Buddha worked out for the rules is based on two principlesThe first is that the training aims primarily at the development of the mindThus the factors of intention and perception often determine whether or not a particular action is an infringement of a ruleFor instance killing an animal accidentally is in terms of the mind of the agent very different from killing it purposefully and does not count as an infringement of the rule against killingThere are a few rules where the factors of intention and perception make no difference at all  such as in the rule forbidding a monk to drink alcohol  but they almost always deal with situations where one would be expected to be mindful and perceptive enough to know whats going on and so these rules too help in the training of the mindIn any event the system of analyzing each offense into the factors of effort object perception intention and result shows how adherence to the rules leads directly to the development of concentration and discernmentIf a monk is careful to view his actions in terms of these factors he is developing mindfulness an analytical approach to events in the present and persistenceThese are the first three factors for Awakening and form the basis for the remaining four rapture serenity concentration and equanimityThe second principle used in determining penalties is based on the Buddhas observation to Ananda one of his chief disciples that friendship and companionship with the good is the whole of the religious lifeAnyone who approaches the Dhamma seriously should be wise enough to realize that without the opportunity of associating and learning from people who are experienced on the path it is well nigh impossible to make any progress on ones ownThe monks are thus expected to value their good standing vis a vis the wellbehaved members of their group and so the system of punishments worked out by the Buddha revolves entirely around affecting the offenders status within the CommunityThe Patimokkha classifies its rules into seven levelsThe next three levels of rules  nissaggiya pācittiya pācittiya and pāṭidesanīya  entail simple confession to a fellow monk although the NP rules involved an article that has to be forfeited  in most cases temporarily although in a few cases the object has to be forfeited for good in which case the offender has to confess his offense to the entire CommunityIf a monk commits an offense and refuses to undergo the penalty the Community may decide how seriously they take the matterSince there is no monks police beyond the individuals conscience it may often happen that no one else knows of the offense to begin with and nothing is doneIf however it becomes common knowledge and the Community regards it as a serious matter they should talk privately with the monk to help him see the error of his waysIf he is recalcitrant they may strip him temporarily of his status either by censuring him stripping him of his seniority driving him from the Community or suspending him from the Order of monks as a wholeIf the offender sees the error of his ways and reforms his behavior accordingly the Community may return him to his former statusNow of course there may be some hardened souls among the monks who are unfazed by punishments of this sort but we should note that the Buddha saw no use for physical coercion in enforcing his rulesIf a monk had to be physically forced into abiding by the training his heart wouldnt be in it and there is no way that he could benefit from itSuch monks the Buddha considered beyond the pale although he allowed them to stay on in the Community in hopes that eventually their conscience would get the better of themIn the meantime the law of karma would guarantee that in the long run they would not be getting away with anything at allThe final two levels of rules in the Patimokkha do not give a particular penaltyThe sekhiya rules  dealing primarily with etiquette  simply state that one should work at following themThe Sutta Vibhanga explains that if one oversteps them out of disrespect one should confess the factThe adhikaraṇa samatha rules are not so much rules as they are principles to follow in dealing with issues that arise in the CommunityIf monks try to settle an issue without following these principles their decision is invalid and they must confess their wrongdoing to other monks who took no part in the decisionWith this background we may now look at the content of the rulesWhat follows is a list summarizing the basic meanings of the rules organized into five major categories dealing with Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Communal harmony and the etiquette of a contemplativeThe first three categories  the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path that make up the training in heightened virtue  are especially useful for showing how the rules relate to the Buddhist path as a wholeThese five categories are not sharply distinct typesInstead they are more like the colors in the band of light thrown off by a prism  discernably different but shading into one another with no sharp dividing linesRight Speech for instance often shades into Communal harmony just as Right Livelihood shades into personal etiquetteThus the placement of a particular rule in one category rather than another has been a somewhat arbitrary processThere are a few cases  such as Pācittiyas   where the reason for placing the rule in a particular category will become clear only after reading the detailed discussions in BMCEach rule is followed by a code giving the rules number in its section of the PatimokkhaIf you count the number of rules in the list you will see that they do not quite equalThis is because there are a couple of cases where I have condensed two or three Sekhiya rules into one summaryMN defines wrong speech as lying divisive speech abusive speech and idle chatterMaking an unfounded charge to a bhikkhu that he has committed a pārājika offense in hopes of having him disrobed is a saṇghādisesa offenseDistorting the evidence while accusing a bhikkhu of

bathing or drinkingShortly after her ordination the Buddhas stepmother Mahapajapati Gotami asked him for a short Dhammainstruction that would guide her in her solitary practiceHe responded with eight principles for recognizing what qualifies as Dhamma and Vinaya and what does notThe commentary tells us that after her instruction Mahapajapati Gotami in no long time became an arahantThe eight principles have been widely cited ever sinceOne Thai writer has called them the constitution of Buddhism as they form the standards against which the validity of any interpretation of the Dhamma or Vinaya must be judgedPerhaps the most important point that these principles make is that any teaching has to be judged by the results that come when putting it into practiceThey are an excellent illustration of the teachings given in the wellknown Kalama Sutta as well as in the teachings that the Buddha gave to his son RahulaThe Canon illustrates these principles not only with abstract discussions but also with stories and the stories are often more memorable than the discussionsThus this study guide differs from its companions in that it is predominantly composed of storiesBear in mind as you read the stories that they are often framed in somewhat extreme terms to drive their points homeSister Subha Kali Prince Dighavu and the monk whose limbs are being removed by a saw would not be as memorable if their stories were framed in more realistic termsAlso bear in mind that there is some overlap among the principles and that a passage may illustrate more than one at a timeThus for instance the story of VenIsidatta analyzes the fetter of selfidentity views at the same time illustrating the principles of modesty and nonentanglementThe most extensive overlap is between the principle of dispassion and that of not being fettered as passion in its various forms covers three of the ten fetters that bind a person to the round of rebirthThus the section on dispassion contains passages dealing with how to overcome the three passion fetters  sensual passion passion for the sense of form experienced in the jhanas of form and passion for the sense of formlessness experienced in the formless jhanas  whereas the section on being unfettered treats the remaining seven fettersI have heard that at on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Vesali in the Peaked Roof Hall in the Great ForestThen Mahapajapati Gotami went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him stood to one sideAs she was standing there she said to him It would be good lord if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief such that having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One I might dwell alone secluded heedful ardent  resoluteGotami the qualities of which you may know These qualities leadYou may categorically hold This is not the Dhamma this is not the Vinaya this is not the Teachers instructionAs for the qualities of which you may know These qualities leadYou may categorically hold This is the Dhamma this is the Vinaya this is the Teachers instruction That is what the Blessed One saidGratified Mahapajapati Gotami delighted at his wordsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Gaya at Gaya Head with monksThere he addressed the monksMonks the All is aflameWhat All is aflameThe eye is aflameForms are aflameConsciousness at the eye is aflameContact at the eye is aflameAnd whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye  experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain  that too is aflameAflame with whatAflame with the fire of passion the fire of aversion the fire of delusionAflame I tell you with birth aging  death with sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairsThe ear is aflameSounds are aflameThe nose is aflameAromas are aflameThe tongue is aflameFlavors are aflameThe body is aflameTactile sensations are aflameThe intellect is aflameIdeas are aflameConsciousness at the intellect is

with whatAflame with the fire of passion the fire of aversion the fire of delusionAflame I say with birth aging  death with sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairsSeeing thus the instructed noble disciple grows disenchanted with the eye disenchanted with forms disenchanted with consciousness at the eye disenchanted with contact at the eyeAnd whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain With that too he grows disenchantedHe grows disenchanted with the earHe grows disenchanted with the noseHe grows disenchanted with the tongueHe grows disenchanted with the bodyHe grows disenchanted with the intellect disenchanted with ideas disenchanted with consciousness at the intellect disenchanted with contact at the intellectAnd whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the intellect experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain He grows disenchanted with that tooDisenchanted he becomes dispassionateThrough dispassion he is fully releasedWith full release there is the knowledge Fully released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this world That is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted at his wordsAnd while this explanation was being given the hearts of the monks through no clinging were fully released from fermentationeffluentsAnd how does a monk guard the doors of his sensesOn seeing a form with the eye he does not grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail himOn hearing a sound with the ear On smelling an odor with the nose On tasting a flavor with the tongue On touching a tactile sensation with the body On cognizing an idea with the intellect he does not grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail himEndowed with this noble restraint over the sense faculties he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blamelessThis is how a monk guards the doors of his sensesAs Subha the nun was going through Jivakas delightful mango grove a libertine blocked her path so she said to himNow at that time VenAnuruddha going through the Kosalan countryside on his way to Savatthi arrived in the evening at a certain villageAnd at that time a rest house had been set up by a woman in that villageSo VenAnuruddha went to the woman and on arrival said to her If it is no inconvenience for you sister I will stay for one night in the rest houseYou are welcome to stay venerable sirThen other travelers went to that woman and on arrival said If it is no inconvenience for you lady we will stay for one night in the rest houseThis master has arrived firstIf he gives his permission you may staySo the travelers went to VenAnuruddha and on arrival said to him If it is no inconvenience for you venerable sir we will stay for one night in the rest houseYou are welcome to stay friendsNow it so happened that the woman had fallen in love with VenAnuruddha at first sight so she went to him and said The master will not be comfortable crowded with these peopleIt would be good if I were to prepare a bed inside for the masterVenAnuruddha consented by remaining silenceThen the woman having herself prepared a bed inside for VenAnuruddha having put on her jewelry and scented herself with perfumes went to him and said Master you are beautiful goodlooking and appealingI too am beautiful goodlooking  appealingIt would be good if I were to be your wifeWhen this was said VenAnuruddha remained silentSo a second time A third time she said to him Master you are beautiful goodlooking  appealingI too am beautiful goodlooking  appealingPlease take me together with all my wealthA third time VenAnuruddha remained silentSo the woman having slipped off her upper cloak paraded up  down in front of him stood sat down  then lay down right in front of himBut VenAnuruddha keeping control of his faculties didnt as much as glance at her or say even a wordThen the thought occurred to her Isnt it amazingIsnt it astoundingMany men send for me at a price of or even but this contemplative even when I myself beg him doesnt want to take me together with all of my wealth So putting her upper cloak back on and bowing her head at his feet she said to him Venerable sir a transgression has overcome me in that I was so foolish so muddleheaded  so unskillful as to act in such a wayPlease accept this confession of my transgression as such so that I may restrain myself in the futureYes sister a transgression overcame you in that you were so foolish so muddleheaded  so unskillful as to act in such a wayBut because you see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with the Dhamma we accept your confessionFor it is a cause of growth in the Dhamma  Discipline of the noble ones when seeing a transgression as such one makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma and exercises restraint in the futureThen when the night had passed the woman with her own hand served  satisfied VenAnuruddha with excellent staple and nonstaple foodWhen VenAnuruddha had eaten  removed his hand from his bowl she sat to one sideAs she was sitting there VenAnuruddha instructed urged roused  encouraged her with a talk on DhammaThen the woman having been instructed urged roused  encouraged by VenAnuruddha with a talk on Dhamma said to him Magnificent venerable sirMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has VenAnuruddha  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Community of monksMay the master remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for life Pacittiya Quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters and remains in the first jhana rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought and evaluationHe permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born from withdrawalJust as if a skilled bathman or bathmans apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together sprinkling it again and again with water so that his ball of bath powder  saturated moistureladen permeated within and without  would nevertheless not drip even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of withdrawalThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born from withdrawalThis is a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublimeFurthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters and remains in the second jhana rapture and pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation  internal assuranceHe permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composureJust like a lake with springwater welling up from within having no inflow from the east west north or south and with the skies supplying abundant showers time and again so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate and pervade suffuse and fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composureThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born of composureThis too is a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublimeAnd furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding He permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the pleasure divested of raptureJust as in a lotus pond some of the lotuses born and growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated and pervaded suffused and filled with cool water from their roots to their tips and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water even so the monk permeates this very body with the pleasure divested of raptureThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of raptureThis too is a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublimeAnd furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure and pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress  he enters and remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpainHe sits permeating the body with a pure bright awarenessJust as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating the body with a pure bright awarenessThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awarenessThis too great king is a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublimeI tell you the ending of the effluents depends on the first jhana Thus it has been saidIn reference to what was it said Suppose that an archer or archers apprentice were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay so that after a while he would become able to shoot long distances to fire accurate shots in rapid succession and to pierce great massesIn the same way there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born of withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluationHe regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perception fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness notselfHe turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation UnbindingStaying right there he reaches the ending of the mental effluentsOr if not then  through this very dhammapassion this very dhammadelight and from the total wasting away of the first five of the Fetters  he is due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that worldI tell you the ending of the effluents depends on the first jhana Thus was it said and in reference to this was it saidThus as far as the perceptionattainments go that is as far as gnosispenetration goesAs for these two dimensions  the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception  the attainment of the cessation of feeling  perception  I tell you that they are to be rightly explained by those monks who are meditators skilled in attaining skilled in attaining  emerging who have attained  emerged in dependence on them there remains only equanimity pure  bright pliant malleable  luminousJust as if a skilled goldsmith or goldsmiths apprentice were to prepare a furnace heat up a crucible and taking gold with a pair of tongs place it in the crucibleHe would blow on it periodically sprinkle water on it periodically examine it periodically so that the gold would become refined wellrefined thoroughly refined flawless free from dross pliant malleable  luminousThen whatever sort of ornament he had in mind  whether a belt an earring a necklace or a gold chain  it would serve his purposeIn the same way there remains only equanimity pure  bright pliant malleable  luminousHe discerns that If I were to direct equanimity as pure  bright as this toward the dimension of the infinitude of space I would develop the mind along those lines and thus this equanimity of mine  thus supported thus sustained  would last for a long timeHe discerns that If I were to direct equanimity as pure  bright as this toward the dimension of the infinitude of space and to develop the mind along those lines that would be fabricated He neither fabricates nor wills for the sake of becoming or unbecomingThis being the case he is not sustained by anything in the worldUnsustained he is not agitatedUnagitated he is totally unbound right withinHe discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThere are these ten fettersWhich tenFive lower fetters  five higher fettersAnd which are the five lower fettersSelfidentity views uncertainty grasping at precepts  practices sensual desire and ill willThese are the five lower fettersAnd which are the five higher fettersPassion for form passion for what is formless conceit restlessness and ignoranceThese are the five higher fettersAnd these are the ten fettersThere are in this community of monks monks who with the total ending of three Fetters are streamwinners steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for selfawakeningThere are monks who with the total ending of three fetters and the thinning out of passion aversion  delusion are oncereturnersAfter returning only once to this world they will put an end to stressThere are monks who with the total ending of the first five of the Fetters are due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that worldThere are monks who are arahants whose mental effluents are ended who have reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and who are released through right gnosisAnd what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by seeingThere is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person does not discern what ideas are fit for attention or what ideas are unfit for attentionThis being so he does not attend to ideas fit for attention and attends to ideas unfit for attentionAnd what are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends toWhatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen effluent of sensuality arises and the arisen effluent of sensuality increases the unarisen effluent of becoming the unarisen effluent of ignorance arises and the arisen effluent of ignorance increases This is how he attends inappropriately Was I in the pastWas I not in the pastWhat was I in the pastHow was I in the pastHaving been what what was I in the pastShall I be in the futureShall I not be in the futureWhat shall I be in the futureHow shall I be in the futureHaving been what what shall I be in the future Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present Am IAm I notWhat am IHow am IWhere has this being come fromWhere is it boundAs he attends inappropriately in this way one of six kinds of view arises in him The view I have a self arises in him as true  established or the view I have no self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive notself or the view It is precisely by means of notself that I perceive self arises in him as true  established or else he has a view like this This very self of mine  the knower that is sensitive here  there to the ripening of good  bad actions  is the self of mine that is constant everlasting eternal not subject to change and will endure as long as eternityThis is called a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of viewsBound by a fetter of views the uninstructed runofthemill person is not freed from birth aging  death from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despairHe is not freed I tell you from stressThe wellinstructed noble disciple discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attentionThis being so he does not attend to ideas unfit for attention and attends to ideas fit for attention And what are the ideas fit for attention that he attends toWhatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen effluent of sensuality does not arise and the arisen effluent of sensuality is abandoned the unarisen effluent of becoming the unarisen effluent of ignorance does not arise and the arisen effluent of ignorance is abandoned He attends appropriately This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stressAs he attends appropriately in this way three fetters are abandoned in him identityview doubt and grasping at precepts  practicesThese are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by seeingThere is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person

orpiment indigo or crimson such that a man with good eyesight examining the reflection of his face in it would not be able to know or see his face as it actually isIn the same way when one remains

occur to him Before taking a loan I invested it in my business affairsNow my business affairs have succeededI have repaid my old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining my wife Because of that he would experience joy  happinessNow suppose that a man falls sick  in pain  seriously illHe does not enjoy his meals and there is no strength in his bodyAs time passes he eventually recovers

my body Because of that he would experience joy  happinessNow suppose that a man is bound in prisonAs time passes he eventually is released from that bondage safe  sound with no loss of propertyThe

man is a slave subject to others not subject to himself unable to go where he likesAs time passes he eventually is released from that slavery subject to himself not subject to others freed able to go

my property Because of that he would experience joy  happinessIn the same way when these five hindrances are not abandoned in himself the monk regards it as a debt a sickness a prison slavery a road through desolate countryBut when these five hindrances are abandoned in himself he regards it as unindebtedness good health release from prison freedom a place of securityThese seven things  pleasing

occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryThen the brahman Akkosaka Bharadvaja heard that a brahman of the Bharadvaja clan had gone forth from the home life into homelessness in the presence of the Blessed OneAngered  displeased he went to the Blessed One and on arrival insulted  cursed him with rude harsh wordsWhen this was said the Blessed One said to him What do you think brahman Do friends  colleagues relatives  kinsmen come to you as guestsYes Master Gotama sometimes friends  colleagues relatives  kinsmen come to me as guestsAnd what do you think Do you serve them with staple  nonstaple foods  delicaciesYes sometimes I serve them with staple  nonstaple foods  delicaciesAnd if they dont accept them to whom do those foods belongIf they dont accept them Master Gotama those foods are all mineIn the same way brahman that with which you have insulted me who is not insulting that with which you have taunted me who is not taunting that with which you have berated me who is not berating that I dont accept from youIts all yours brahmanIts all yoursWhoever returns insult to one who is insulting returns taunts to one who is taunting returns a berating to one who is berating is said to be eating together sharing company with that personBut I am neither eating together nor sharing your company brahmanIts all yoursIts all yoursThe king together with his court know this of Master Gotama  Gotama the contemplative is an arahant  and yet still Master Gotama gets angryWhen this was said the brahman Akkosaka Bharadvaja said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master GotamaMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monksLet me obtain the going forth in Master Gotamas presence let me obtain admissionThen the brahman Akkosaka Bharadvaja received the going forth  the admission in the Blessed Ones presenceAnd not long after his admission  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute  he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And so VenBharadvaja became another one of the arahantsOnce monks in this same Savatthi there was a lady of a household named VedehikaThis good report about Lady Vedehika had circulated Lady Vedehika is gentleLady Vedehika is eventemperedLady Vedehika is calm Now Lady Vedehika had a slave named Kali who was diligent deft  neat in her workThe thought occurred to Kali the slave This good report about my Lady Vedehika has circulated Lady Vedehika is eventemperedLady Vedehika is gentleLady Vedehika is calm Now is anger present in my lady without showing or is it absentOr is it just because Im diligent deft  neat in my work that the anger present in my lady doesnt showWhy dont I test herSo Kali the slave got up after daybreakThen Lady Vedehika said to her Hey KaliYes madamWhy did you get up after daybreakNo reason madamNo reason you wicked slave and yet you get up after daybreak Angered  displeased she scowledThen the thought occurred to Kali the slave Anger is present in my lady without showing and not absentAnd its just because Im diligent deft  neat in my work that the anger present in my lady doesnt showWhy dont I test her some moreSo Kali the slave got up later in the dayThen Lady Vedehika said to her Hey KaliYes madamWhy did you get up later in the dayNo reason madamNo reason you wicked slave and yet you get up later in the day Angered  displeased she grumbledThen the

her only slave for getting up after daybreak grab hold of a rolling pin and give her a whack over the head cutting it openAfter that this evil report about Lady Vedehika circulated Lady Vedehika is viciousLady Vedehika is foultemperedLady Vedehika is violentIn the same way monks a monk may be ever so gentle ever so eventempered ever so calm as long as he is not touched by disagreeable aspects of speechBut it is only when disagreeable aspects of speech touch him that he can truly be known as gentle eventempered  calmI dont call a monk easy to admonish if he is easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish only by reason of robes almsfood lodging  medicinal requisites for curing the sickWhy is thatBecause if he doesnt get robes almsfood lodging  medicinal requisites for curing

number of senior monks were living near Macchikasanda in the Wild Mango GroveThen Citta the householder went to them and on arrival having bowed down to them sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to them Venerable sirs may the senior monks acquiesce to tomorrows meal from meThe senior monks acquiesced by silenceThen Citta the householder sensing the senior monks acquiescence got up from his seat and having bowed down to them circumambulated them  keeping them to his right  and leftWhen the night had passed the senior monks put on their robes in the early morning and  taking their bowls  outer robes  went to Cittas residenceThere they sat down on the appointed seatsCitta the householder went to them and having bowed down to them sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the most senior monkVenerable sir concerning the various views that arise in the world  The cosmos is eternal or The cosmos isnt eternal The cosmos is finite or The cosmos is infinite The soul and the body are the same or The soul is one thing the body another A Tathagata exists after death or A Tathagata doesnt exist after death or A Tathagata both exists  doesnt exist after death or A Tathagata neither exists nor doesnt exist after death these along with the sixtytwo views mentioned in the Brahmajala  when what is present do these views come into being and when what is absent do they not come into beingWhen this was said the senior monk was silentA second time A third time Citta the householder asked Concerning the various views that arise in the world when what is present do they come into being and what is absent do they not come into being A third time the senior monk was silentNow on that occasion VenIsidatta was the most junior of all the monks in that CommunityThen he said to the senior monk Allow me venerable sir to answer Citta the householders questionGo ahead  answer it friend IsidattaNow householder are you asking this Concerning the various views that arise in the world when what is present do they come into being and what is absent do they not come into beingYes venerable sirConcerning the various views that arise in the world householder when selfidentity view is present these views come into being when selfidentity view is absent they dont come into beingBut venerable sir how does selfidentity view come into beingThere is the case householder where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formHe assumes feeling to be the self or the self as possessing feeling or feeling as in the self or the self as in feelingHe assumes apperception to be the self or the self as possessing apperception or apperception as in the self or the self as in apperceptionHe assumes fabrications to be the self or the self as possessing fabrications or fabrications as in the self or the self as in fabricationsHe assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousnessThis is how selfidentity view comes into beingAnd venerable sir how does selfidentity view not come into beingThere is the case householder where a wellinstructed noble disciple  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma  does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formHe does not assume feeling to be the self He does not assume apperception to be the self He does not assume fabrications to be the self He does not assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousnessThis is how selfidentity view does not come into beingVenerable sir where does Master Isidatta come fromI come from Avanti householderThere is venerable sir a clansman from Avanti named Isidatta an unseen friend of mine who has gone forthHave you ever seen himYes householderWhere is he living now venerable sirWhen this was said the Venerable Isidatta was silentAre you my IsidattaYes householderThen may Master Isidatta delight in the charming Wild Mango Grove at MacchikasandaI will be responsible for your robes almsfood lodgings  medicinal requisitesThat is admirably said householderThen Citta the householder  having delighted  rejoiced in the Venerable Isidattas words  with his own hand served  satisfied the senior monks with choice staple  nonstaple foodsWhen the senior monks had finished eating and had removed their hands from their bowls they got up from their seats and leftThen the most senior monk said to the Venerable Isidatta It was excellent friend Isidatta the way that question inspired you to answerIt didnt inspire an answer in me at allWhenever a similar question comes up again may it inspire you to answer as you did just nowThen VenIsidatta  having set his lodging in order and taking his bowl  robes  left MacchikasandaAnd in leaving Macchikasanda he was gone for good and never returnedVenSariputta said Friends just now as I was withdrawn in seclusion this train of thought arose to my awareness Is there anything in the world with whose change or alteration there would arise within me sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair Then the thought occurred to me There is nothing in the world with whose change or alteration there would arise within me sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair When this was said VenAnanda said to VenSariputta Sariputta my friend even if there were change  alteration in the Teacher would there arise within you no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despairEven if there were change  alteration in the Teacher my friend there would arise within me no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despairStill I would have this thought What a great being of great might of great prowess has disappearedFor if the Blessed One were to remain for a long time that would be for the benefit of many people for the happiness of many people out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of human  divine beings Surely its because VenSariputtas Imaking  minemaking and obsessions with conceit have long been well uprooted that even if there were change  alteration in the Teacher there would arise within him no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despairThen VenAnuruddha went to where VenSariputta was staying and on arrival greeted him courteouslyAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenSariputta By means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human I see the thousandfold cosmosMy persistence is aroused  unsluggishMy mindfulness is established  unshakenMy body is calm  unarousedMy mind is concentrated into singlenessAnd yet my mind is not released from the effluents through lack of clingingsustenanceSariputta My friend when the thought occurs to you By means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human I see the thousandfold cosmos that is related to your conceitWhen the thought occurs to you My persistence is aroused  unsluggishMy mindfulness is established  unshakenMy body is calm  unperturbedMy mind is concentrated into singleness that is related to your restlessnessWhen the thought occurs to you And yet my mind is not released from the effluents through lack of clingingsustenance that is related to your anxietyIt would be well if  abandoning these three qualities not attending to these three qualities  you directed your mind to the Deathless propertySo after that VenAnuruddha  abandoning those three qualities not attending to those three qualities  directed his mind to the Deathless propertyDwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus VenAnuruddha became another one of the arahantsAnd what is ignoranceNot knowing stress not knowing the origination of stress not knowing the cessation of stress not knowing the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is called ignoranceJust as if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen  clear limpid and unsullied  where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells gravel and pebbles and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting and it would occur to him This pool of water is clear limpid and unsulliedHere are these shells gravel and pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability  the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentationsHe discerns as it has come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are mental fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentation of sensuality the fermentation of becoming the fermentation of ignoranceWith release there is the knowledge Released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this world This too great king is a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublimeAnd as for another visible fruit of the contemplative life higher and more sublime than this there is noneOnce monks in Varanasi Brahmadatta was the king of Kasi  rich prosperous with many possessions many troops many vehicles many territories with fullystocked armories  granariesDighiti was the king of Kosala  poor not very prosperous with few possessions few troops few vehicles few territories with poorlystocked armories  granariesSo Brahmadatta the king of Kasi raising a fourfold army marched against Dighiti the king of KosalaDighiti the king of Kosala heard Brahmadatta the king of Kasi they say has raised a fourfold army and is marching against me Then the thought occurred to him King Brahmadatta is rich prosperous with fullystocked armories  granaries whereas I am poor with poorlystocked armories  granariesI am not competent to stand against even one attack by himWhy dont I slip out of the city beforehand So taking his chief consort he slipped out of the city beforehandThen King Brahmadatta conquering the troops vehicles lands armories  granaries of King Dighiti lived in lordship over themMeanwhile King Dighiti had set out for Varanasi together with his consort and traveling by stages arrived thereThere he lived with her on the outskirts of Varanasi in a potters house disguised as a wandererNot long afterwards she became pregnantShe had a pregnancy wish of this sort she wanted to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swordsShe said to King Dighiti Your majesty I am pregnant and I have a pregnancy wish of this sort I want to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swords He said My queen where is there for us  fallen on hard times  a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground and water used for washing the swordsIf I dont get this your majesty I will dieNow at that time the brahman adviser to King Brahmadatta was a friend of King DighitiSo King Dighiti went to him and on arrival said A lady friend of yours old friend is pregnant and she has a pregnancy wish of this sort she wants to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swordsIn that case let me see herSo King Dighitis consort went to King Brahmadattas brahman adviserWhen he saw her coming from afar he rose from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder and with his hands raised in salutation to her exclaimed three times Surely the king of Kosala has come to your wombSurely the king of Kosala has come to your wombDont be worried my queenYou will get to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swordsThen he went to King Brahmadatta and on arrival said to him Your majesty signs have appeared such that tomorrow at dawn a fourfold army armed  arrayed should stand on a parade ground and that the swords should be washedSo King Brahmadatta ordered his people I say then Do as the brahman adviser says Thus King Dighitis chief consort got to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and got to drink the water used for washing the swordsThen with the maturing of the fetus she gave birth to a son whom they named DighavuNot long afterwards Prince Dighavu reached the age of discretionThe thought occurred to King Dighiti This King Brahmadatta of Kasi has done us great harmHe has seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granariesIf he finds out about us he will have all three of us killedWhy dont I send Prince Dighavu to live outside of the city So Prince Dighavu having gone to live outside of the city learned all the craftsNow at that time King Dighitis barber had gone over to King BrahmadattaHe saw King Dighiti together with his consort living on the outskirts of Varanasi in a potters house disguised as a wandererOn seeing them he went to King Brahmadatta and on arrival said to him Your majesty King Dighiti of Kosala together with his consort is living on the outskirts of Varanasi in a potters house disguised as a wandererSo King Brahmadatta ordered his people I say then go fetch King Dighiti together with his consortResponding As you say your majesty they went and fetched King Dighiti together with his consortThen King Brahmadatta ordered his people I say then having bound King Dighiti  his consort with a stout rope with their arms pinned tightly against their backs and having shaved them bald march them to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads evict them out the south gate of the city and there to the south of the city cut them into four pieces and bury them in holes placed in the four directionsResponding As you say your majesty the kings people bound King Dighiti  his consort with a stout rope pinning their arms tightly against their backs shaved them bald and marched them to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroadsThen the thought occurred to Prince Dighavu Its been a long time since I saw my mother  fatherWhat if I were to go see them So he entered Varanasi and saw his mother  father bound with a stout rope their arms pinned tightly against their backs their heads shaven bald being marched to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroadsSo he went to themKing Dighiti saw Prince Dighavu coming from afar and on seeing him said Dont my dear Dighavu be farsightedDont be nearsightedFor vengeance is not settled through vengeanceVengeance is settled through nonvengeanceWhen this was said the people said to him This King Dighiti has gone crazyHes talking nonsenseWho is DighavuWhy is he saying Dont my dear Dighavu be farsightedDont be nearsightedFor vengeance is not settled through vengeanceVengeance is settled through nonvengeanceIm not crazy or talking nonsenseHe who knows will understand Then a second time a third time he said Dont my dear Dighavu be farsightedDont be nearsightedFor vengeance is not settled through vengeanceVengeance is settled through nonvengeanceA third time the people said to him This King Dighiti has gone crazyHes talking nonsenseWho is DighavuWhy is he saying Dont my dear Dighavu be farsightedDont be nearsightedFor vengeance is not settled through vengeanceVengeance is settled through nonvengeanceIm not crazy or talking nonsenseHe who knows will understandThen the kings people having marched King Dighiti together with his chief consort to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads evicted them out the south gate of the city and there to the south of the city cut them into four pieces buried them in holes placed in the four directions stationed guards and leftThen Prince Dighavu having entered Varanasi brought out some liquor and got the guards to drink itWhen they had fallen down drunk he collected sticks made a pyre raised the bodies of his mother  father onto the pyre set fire to it and then circumambulated it three times with his hands raised in salutationNow at that time King Brahmadatta had gone up to the terrace on top of his palaceHe saw Prince Dighavu circumambulating the pyre three times with his hands raised in salutation and on seeing him the thought occurred to him Doubtlessly this person is a relative or bloodkinsman of King DighitiAh how unfortunate for me for there is no one who will tell me what this meansThen Prince Dighavu having gone into the wilderness and having cried  wept as much as he needed to dried his tears and entered VaranasiGoing to an elephant stable next to the kings palace he said to the chief elephant trainer Teacher I want to learn this craftIn that case young man you may learn itThen rising in the last watch of the night Prince Dighavu sang in a sweet voice and played the lute in the elephant stableKing Brahmadatta also rising in the last watch of the night heard the sweetvoiced singing  luteplaying in the elephant stableOn hearing it he asked his people I say Who was that rising in the last watch of the night singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant stableYour majesty a young man  the student of suchandsuch an elephant trainer rising in the last watch of the night was singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant stableI say then go fetch that young manResponding As you say your majesty they went and fetched Prince DighavuThen King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu I say Was that you rising in the last watch of the night singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant stableYes your majestyI say then my young man sing and play the luteResponding As you say your majesty and seeking to win favor Prince Dighavu sang with a sweet voice and played the luteThen King Brahmadatta said to him I say You my young man are to stay and attend to meAs you say your majesty Prince Dighavu repliedThen he rose in the morning before King Brahmadatta went to bed in the evening after him did whatever the king ordered always acting to please him speaking politely to himAnd it was not long before King Brahmadatta placed the prince close to him in a position of trustThen one day King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu I say then my young man harness the chariotIm going huntingResponding As you say your majesty Prince Dighavu harnessed the chariot and then said to King Brahmadatta Your chariot is harnessed your majestyNow is the time for you to do as you see fitThen King Brahmadatta mounted the chariot and Prince Dighavu drove itHe drove it in such a way that the kings entourage went one way and the chariot anotherThen after they had gone far King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu I say then my young man unharness the chariotIm tiredIm going to lie downResponding As you say your majesty Prince Dighavu unharnessed the chariot and sat down crosslegged on the groundThen King Brahmadatta lay down placing his head on Prince Dighavus lapAs he was tired he went to sleep right awayThen the thought occurred to Prince Dighavu This King Brahmadatta of Kasi has done us great harmHe has seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granariesAnd it was because of him that my mother  father were killedNow is my chance to wreak vengeance He drew his sword from his scabbardBut then he thought My father told me as he was about to die Dont my dear Dighavu be farsightedDont be nearsightedFor vengeance is not settled through vengeanceVengeance is settled through nonvengeance It would not be proper for me to transgress my fathers words So he put his sword back in its scabbardA second time A third time the thought occurred to Prince Dighavu This King Brahmadatta of Kasi has done us great harmHe has seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granariesAnd it was because of him that my mother  father were killedNow is my chance to wreak vengeance He drew his sword from his scabbardBut then he thought My father told me as he was about to die Dont my dear Dighavu be farsightedDont be nearsightedFor vengeance is not settled through vengeanceVengeance is settled through nonvengeance It would not be proper for me to transgress my fathers words So once again he put his sword back in its scabbardThen King Brahmadatta suddenly got up  frightened agitated unnerved alarmedPrince Dighavu said to him Your majesty why have you gotten up suddenly  frightened agitated unnerved  alarmedI say my young man Just now as I was dreaming Prince Dighavu  son of Dighiti king of Kasi  struck me down with a sword Then Prince Dighavu grabbing King Brahmadatta by the head with his left hand and drawing his sword from its scabbard with his right said I your majesty am that very Prince Dighavu son of Dighiti king of KasiYou have done us great harmYou have seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granariesAnd it was because of you that my mother  father were killedNow is my chance to wreak vengeanceSo King Brahmadatta dropping his head down to Prince Dighavus feet said Grant me my life my dear DighavuGrant me my life my dear DighavuWho am I that I would dare grant life to your majestyIt is your majesty who should grant life to meIn that case my dear Dighavu you grant me my life and I grant you your lifeThen King Brahmadatta and Prince Dighavu granted one another their lives and taking one another by the hands swore an oath to do one another no harmThen King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu In that case my dear Dighavu harness the chariotWe will go onResponding As you say your majesty Prince Dighavu harnessed the chariot and then said to King Brahmadatta Your chariot is harnessed your majestyNow is the time for you to do as you see fitThen King Brahmadatta mounted the chariot and Prince Dighavu drove itHe drove it in such a way that it was not long before they met up with the kings entourageThen King Brahmadatta having entered Varanasi had his ministers  councilors convened and said to them I say thenIf you were to see Prince Dighavu the son of Dighiti the king of Kasi what would you do to himDifferent ministers said We would cut of his hands your majesty  We would cut off his feet your majesty  We would cut off his hands  feet your majesty  We would cut off his ears your majesty  We would cut off his nose your majesty  We would cut off his ears  nose your majesty  We would cut off his head your majestyThen the king said This I say is Prince Dighavu the son of Dighiti the king of KasiYou are not allowed to do anything to himIt was by him that my life was granted to me and it was by me that his life was granted to himThen King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu What your father said to you as he was about to die  Dont my dear Dighavu be farsightedDont be nearsightedFor vengeance is not settled through vengeanceVengeance is settled through nonvengeance  in reference to what did he say thatWhat my father said to me as he was about to die  Dont be farsighted  Dont bear vengeance for a long time is what he was saying to me as he was about to dieAnd what he said to me as he was about to die  Dont be nearsighted  Dont be quick to break with a friend is what he was saying to me as he was about to dieAnd what he said to me as he was about to die  For vengeance is not settled through vengeanceVengeance is settled through nonvengeance  My mother  father were killed by your majestyIf I were to deprive your majesty of life those who hope for your majestys wellbeing would deprive me of lifeAnd those who hope for my wellbeing would deprive them of lifeAnd in that way vengeance would not be settled by vengeanceBut now I have been granted my life by your majesty and your majesty has been granted your life by meAnd in this way vengeance has been settled by nonvengeanceThat is what my father was saying to me as he was about to dieThen King Brahmadatta said Isnt it amazingIsnt it astoundingHow wise this Prince Dighavu is in that he can understand in full the meaning of what his father said in brief So he returned his fathers troops vehicles lands armories  granaries and gave him his daughter in marriageSuch monks is the forbearance  gentleness of kings who wield the scepter who wield the swordSo now let your light shine forth so that you  who have gone forth in such a welltaught Dhamma  Discipline  will be their equal in forbearance  gentlenessThis Dhamma is for one who is modest not for one who is selfaggrandizing Thus was

the Blessed One was staying near Alavi on a spread of leaves by a cattle track in a simsapa forestThen Hatthaka of Alavi out roaming  rambling for exercise saw the Blessed One sitting on a spread of leaves by the cattle track in the simsapa forestOn seeing him he went to him and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord I hope the Blessed One has slept in easeYes young manI have slept in easeOf those in the world who sleep in ease I am oneBut cold lord is the winter nightThe BetweentheEights is a time of snowfallHard is the ground trampled by cattle hoovesThin is the spread of leavesSparse are the leaves in the treesThin are your ochre robesAnd cold blows the Verambha windYet still the Blessed One says Yes young manI have slept in easeOf those in the world who sleep in ease I am one In that case young man I will question you in returnAnswer as you see fitNow what do you think Suppose a householder or householders son has a house with a gabled roof plastered inside  out draftfree with closefitting door  windows shut against the windInside he has a horsehair couch spread with a longfleeced coverlet a white wool coverlet an embroidered coverlet a rug of kadalideer hide with a canopy above  red cushions on either sideAnd there a lamp would be burning and his four wives with their many charms would be attending to himWould he sleep in ease or notOr how does this strike youYes lord he would sleep in easeOf those in the world who sleep in ease he would be oneBut what do you think young manMight there arise in that householder or householders son any bodily fevers or fevers of mind born of passion so that  burned with those passionborn fevers  he would sleep miserablyYes lordAs for those passionborn fevers  burned with which the householder or householders son would sleep miserably  that passion has been abandoned by the Tathagata its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingTherefore he sleeps in easeNow what do you think young manMight there arise in that householder or householders son any bodily fevers or fevers of mind born of aversion so that  burned with those aversionborn fevers  he would sleep miserablyYes lordAs for those aversionborn fevers  burned with which the householder or householders son would sleep miserably  that aversion has been abandoned by the Tathagata its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingTherefore he sleeps in easeNow what do you think young manMight there arise in that householder or householders son any bodily fevers or fevers of mind born of delusion so that  burned with those delusionborn fevers  he would sleep miserablyYes lordAs for those delusionborn fevers  burned with which the householder or householders son would sleep miserably  that delusion has been abandoned by the Tathagata its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingTherefore he sleeps in easeI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Anupiya in the Mango OrchardNow at that time VenBhaddiya Kaligodha on going to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling would repeatedly exclaim What blissWhat bliss A large number of monks heard VenBhaddiya Kaligodha on going to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling repeatedly exclaim What blissWhat bliss and on hearing him the thought occurred to them Theres no doubt but that VenBhaddiya Kaligodha doesnt enjoy leading the holy life for when he was a householder he knew the bliss of kingship so that now on recollecting that he is repeatedly exclaiming What blissWhat bliss They went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they told him VenBhaddiya Kaligodha lord on going to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling repeatedly exclaims What blissWhat bliss Theres no doubt but that VenBhaddiya Kaligodha doesnt enjoy leading the holy life for when he was a householder he knew the bliss of kingship so that now on recollecting that he is repeatedly exclaiming What blissWhat bliss Then the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monkIn my name call Bhaddiya saying The Teacher calls you my friend As you say lord the monk answered and having gone to VenBhaddiya on arrival he said The Teacher calls you my friendAs you say my friend VenBhaddiya repliedThen he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Bhaddiya that on going to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling you repeatedly exclaim What blissWhat blissYes lordWhat meaning do you have in mind that you repeatedly exclaim What blissWhat blissBefore when I was a householder maintaining the bliss of kingship I had guards posted within and without the royal apartments within and without the city within and without the countrysideBut even though I was thus guarded thus protected I dwelled in fear  agitated distrustful and afraidBut now on going alone to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling I dwell without fear unagitated confident and unafraid  unconcerned unruffled my wants satisfied with my mind like a wild deerThis is the meaning I have in mind that I repeatedly exclaim What blissWhat bliss Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryNow at that time a certain lay follower from Icchanangalaka had arrived in Savatthi on some business affairsHaving settled his affairs in Savatthi he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him At long last you have managed to come hereFor a long time I have wanted to come see the Blessed One lord but being involved in one business affair after another I have not been able to do soThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedThis Dhamma is for one who is reclusive not for one who is entangled Thus was it saidWith reference to what was it saidThere is the case where a monk when living in seclusion is visited by monks nuns lay men lay women kings royal ministers sectarians  their disciplesWith his mind bent on seclusion tending toward seclusion inclined toward seclusion aiming at seclusion relishing renunciation he converses with them only as much as is necessary for them to take their leaveThis Dhamma is for one who is reclusive not for one in entanglement Thus was it saidAnd with reference to this was it saidNow at that time a large number of monks after the meal on returning from their alms round had gathered at the meeting hall and were engaged in many kinds of bestial topics of conversation conversation about kings robbers  ministers of state armies alarms  battles food  drink clothing furniture garlands  scents relatives vehicles villages towns cities the countryside women  heroes the gossip of the street  the well tales of the dead tales of diversity the creation of the world  of the sea talk of whether things exist or notThen the Blessed One emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the meeting hall and on arrival sat down on a seat made readyAs he was sitting there he addressed the monks For what topic of conversation are you gathered together hereIn the midst of what topic of conversation have you been interruptedJust now lord after the meal on returning from our alms round we gathered at the meeting hall and got engaged in many kinds of bestial topics of conversation conversation about kings robbers  ministers of state tales of diversity the creation of the world  of the sea talk of whether things exist or notIt isnt right monks that sons of good families on having gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life should get engaged in such topics of conversation ie conversation about kings robbers  ministers of state talk of whether things exist or notThere are these ten topics of conversationWhich tenTalk on modesty on contentment on seclusion on nonentanglement on arousing persistence on virtue on concentration on discernment on release and on the knowledge  vision of releaseThese are the ten topics of conversationIf you were to engage repeatedly in these ten topics of conversation you would outshine even the sun  moon so mighty so powerful  to say nothing of the wanderers of other sectsThen a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they informed him Lord there is a certain monk by the name of Elder who lives alone and extols the virtues of living aloneThen the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monkIn my name call the monk named Elder saying The Teacher calls you my friend As you say lord the monk answered and having gone to VenElder on arrival he said The Teacher calls you my friendAs you say my friend VenElder repliedThen he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Elder that you live alone and extol the virtues of living aloneYes lordBut how do you live alone and extol the virtues of living aloneLord alone I enter the village for alms alone I return alone I sit withdrawn alone I do walking meditationThat is how I live alone and extol the virtues of living aloneThere is that way of living alone ElderI dont say that there isntStill listen well to you how your living alone is perfected in its details and pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord VenElder respondedThe Blessed One said And how is living alone perfected in its detailsThere is the case where whatever is past is abandoned whatever is future is relinquished and any passion  desire with regard to states of being attained in the present is well subduedThat is how living alone is perfected in its detailsThat is what the Blessed One saidHaving said it the One Wellgone further said thisThis Dhamma is for one whose persistence is aroused not for one who is lazy Thus was it saidWith reference to what was it saidThere is the case where a monk keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualitiesHe is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualitiesThis Dhamma is for one whose persistence is aroused not for one who is lazy Thus was it saidAnd with reference to this was it saidFurthermore the monk finds pleasure  delight in developing finds pleasure  delight in abandoningHe does not on account of his pleasure  delight in developing  abandoning exalt himself or disparage othersIn this he is diligent deft alert  mindfulThis is said to be a monk standing firm in the ancient original traditions of the noble onesAnd how is a monk devoted to wakefulnessThere is the case where a monk during the day sitting  pacing back  forth cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in checkDuring the first watch of the night sitting  pacing back  forth he cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in checkDuring the second watch of the night reclining on his right side he takes up the lions posture one foot placed on top of the other mindful alert with his mind set on getting upDuring the last watch of the night sitting  pacing back  forth he cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in checkThis is how a monk is devoted to wakefulnessMonks there are these eight grounds for lazinessWhich eightThere is the case where a monk has some work to doThe thought occurs to him I

counteract cold to counteract heat to counteract the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles simply for the purpose of covering the parts of the body that cause shameReflecting appropriately he uses alms food not playfully nor for intoxication nor for putting on bulk nor for beautification but simply for the survival  continuance of this body for ending its afflictions for the support of the holy life thinking Thus will I destroy old feelings and not create new feelingsI will maintain myself be blameless  live in comfortReflecting appropriately he uses lodging simply to counteract cold to counteract heat to counteract the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles simply for protection from the inclemencies of weather and for the enjoyment of seclusionReflecting appropriately he uses medicinal requisites that are used for curing the sick simply to counteract any pains of illness that have arisen and for maximum freedom from diseaseAt that time the monks of Alavi were having huts built from their own begging  having no sponsors destined for themselves not to any standard measurement  that did not come to completionThey were continually begging continually hinting Give a man give labor give an ox give a wagon give a machete give an ax give an adz give a spade give a chisel give rushes give reeds give grass give clay People harassed with the begging harassed with the hinting on seeing monks would feel apprehensive alarmed would run away would take another route face another direction close the doorEven on seeing cows they would run away imagining them to be monksThen VenMahaKassapa having come out of his Rains retreat at Rajagaha set out for AlaviAfter wandering by stages he arrived at Alavi where he stayed at the Chief ShrineThen in the early morning having put on his robes and carrying his bowl  outer robe he went into Alavi for almsThe people on seeing VenMahaKassapa were apprehensive alarmed ran away took another route faced another direction closed the doorThen VenMahaKassapa having gone for alms after his meal returning from his alms round addressed the monks Before friends Alavi was a good place for almsAlms food was easy to come by it was easy to maintain oneself by gleanings  patronageBut now Alavi is a bad place for almsAlms food is hard to come by it isnt easy to maintain oneself by gleanings or patronageWhat is the cause what is the reason why Alavi is now a bad place for alms Then the monks told VenMahaKassapa about that matterThen the Blessed One having stayed at Rajagaha as long as he like left for AlaviAfter wandering by stages he arrived at Alavi where he stayed at the Chief ShrineThen VenMahaKassapa went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he told the Blessed One about that matterThen the Blessed One because of that issue because of that affair had the community of monks convened and asked the Alavi monks They say that you are having huts built from your own begging  having no sponsors destined for yourselves not to any standard measurement  that do not come to completion that you are continually begging continually hinting Give a man give labor give an ox give a wagon give a machete give an ax give an adz give a spade give a chisel give rushes give reeds give grass give clay that people harassed with the begging harassed with the hinting on seeing monks feel apprehensive alarmed run away take another route face another direction close the door that even on seeing cows they run away imagining them to be monks is this trueYes lordIt is trueSo the Blessed One rebuked them Misguided men its unseemly unbecoming unsuitable and unworthy of a contemplative improper and not to be done Havent I taught the Dhamma in many ways for the sake of dispassion and not for passion for unfettering and not for fettering for letting go and not for clingingYet here while I have taught the Dhamma for dispassion you set your heart on passion while I have taught the Dhamma for unfettering you set your heart on being fettered while I have taught the Dhamma for letting go you set your heart on clingingHavent I taught the Dhamma in various ways for the fading of passion the sobering of pride the subduing of thirst the destruction of attachment the severing of the round the depletion of craving dispassion cessation unbindingHavent I advocated abandoning sensual pleasures understanding sensual perceptions subduing sensual thirst destroying sensual preoccupations calming sensual fevers Misguided men this neither inspires faith in the faithless nor increases the faithfulRather it inspires lack of faith in the faithless and wavering in some of the faithfulThen having given a Dhamma talk on what is seemly  becoming for monks he addressed the monksOnce monks there were two brothers who were hermits living on the banks of the GangesThen Manikantha the nagaking coming up out of the river Ganges went to the younger hermit and on arrival having encircled him seven times with his coils stood spreading his great hood above his headThen the younger hermit through fear of the naga became thin wretched unattractive  jaundiced his body covered with veinsThe elder brother seeing his younger brother thin his body covered with veins asked him Why are you thin your body covered with veinsManikantha the nagaking coming up out of the river Ganges comes to me and on arrival having encircled me seven times with his coils stands spreading his great hood above my headThrough fear of the naga I have become thin my body covered with veinsBut do you want that naga not to returnI want the naga not to returnDo you see that this naga has anythingI see that he is ornamented with a jewel on his throatThen beg the naga for the jewel saying Good sir give me your jewelI want your jewelThen Manikantha the nagaking coming up out of the river Ganges went to the younger hermit and on arrival stood to one sideAs he was standing there the younger hermit said to him Good sir give me your jewelI want your jewel Then Manikantha the nagaking thinking The monk is begging for my jewelThe monk wants my jewel hurried offThen a second time the nagaking coming up out of the river Ganges went toward the younger hermitSeeing him from afar the younger hermit said to him Good sir give me your jewelI want your jewel Then Manikantha the nagaking thinking The monk is begging for my jewelThe monk wants my jewel hurried offThen a third time the nagaking came up out of the river GangesSeeing him come up out of the river Ganges the younger hermit said to him Good sir give me your jewelI want your jewelThen Manikantha the nagaking addressed the younger hermit with this verseThen Manikantha the nagaking thinking The monk is begging for my jewelThe monk wants my jewel went awayAnd having gone away he never again returnedThen the younger hermit from not seeing that lovely naga became even thinner more wretched unattractive  jaundiced his body cover with veinsHis older brother saw that he was even thinner his body covered with veins and on seeing him he asked him Why are you even thinner your body covered with veinsIts from not seeing that lovely naga that I am even thinner my body covered with veinsThen the elder hermit addressed the younger hermit with this verseMonks begging is unpleasant hinting is unpleasant even to those who are common animals  how much more so to human beingsOnce monks a monk lived on the slopes of the Himalayas in a forest groveNot far from the grove was a broad lowlying marshA great flock of birds after feeding all day in the marsh went to roost in the grove at nightfallThe monk was annoyed by the noise of that flock of birdsSo he came to me and on arrival having bowed down sat to one sideAs he was sitting there I said to him I hope monk that you are well that you are getting along that you have completed your journey with little fatigueWhere have you come fromI am well lord am getting along and have completed my journey with little fatigueLord there is a large forest grove on the slopes of the Himalayas and not far from it is a broad lowlying marshA great flock of birds after feeding all day in the marsh goes to roost in the grove at nightfallThat is why I have come to see the Blessed One  because I am annoyed by the noise of that flock of birdsMonk you want those birds to go away for goodYes lord I want them to go away for goodThen go back there enter the forest and in the first watch of the night make this announcement three times Listen to me good birdsI want a feather from everyone roosting in this forestEach of you give me one feather In the second watch In the third watch of the night make this announcement three times Listen to me good birdsI want a feather from everyone roosting in this forestEach of you give me one feather Then the flock of birds thinking The monk begs for a feather the monk wants a feather left the forestAnd after they were gone they never again returnedMonks begging is unpleasant hinting is unpleasant even to these common animals  how much more so to human beingsOnce monks the father of Ratthapala the clansman addressed Ratthapala with this verseMonks if Ratthapala the clansman can speak this way to his father why not a stranger to a stranger Sanghadisesa The Buddhas Awakening gave him among other things a new perspective on the uses and limitations of wordsHe had discovered a reality  the Deathless  that no words could describeAt the same time he discovered that the path to Awakening could be described although it involved a new way of seeing and conceptualizing the problem of suffering and stressBecause ordinary concepts were often poor tools for teaching the path he had to invent new concepts and to stretch preexisting words to encompass those concepts so that others could taste Awakening themselvesOne of the new concepts most central to his teaching was that of the khandhas usually translated into English as aggregates Prior to the Buddha the Pali word khandha had very ordinary meanings A khandha could be a pile a bundle a heap a massIt could also be the trunk of a treeIn his first sermon though the Buddha gave it a new psychological meaning introducing the term clingingkhandhas to summarize his analysis of the truth of stress and sufferingThroughout the remainder of his teaching career he referred to these psychological khandhas time and againTheir importance in his teachings has thus been obvious to every generation of Buddhists ever sinceLess obvious though has been the issue of how they are important How should a meditator make use of the concept of the psychological khandhasWhat questions are they meant to answerThe most common response to these questions is best exemplified by two recent scholarly books devoted to the subjectBoth treat the khandhas as the Buddhas answer to the question What is a person To quote from the jacket of the firstIf Buddhism denies a permanent self how does it perceive identity What we conventionally call a person can be understood in terms of five aggregates the sum of which must not be taken for a permanent entity since beings are nothing but an amalgam of everchanging phenomena ithout a thorough understanding of the five aggregates we cannot grasp the liberation process at work within the individual who is after all simply an amalgam of the five aggregatesFrom the introduction of the otherThe third key teaching is given by the Buddha in contexts when he is asked about individual identity when people want to know what am I what is my real selfThe Buddha says that individuality should be understood in terms of a combination of phenomena which appear to form the physical and mental continuum of an individual lifeIn such contexts the human being is analysed into five constituents  the pañcakkhandhāThis understanding of the khandhas isnt confined to scholarsAlmost any modern Buddhist meditation teacher would explain the khandhas in a similar wayAnd it isnt a modern innovationIt was first proposed at the beginning of the common era in the commentaries to the early Buddhist canons  both the Theravādin and the Sarvāstivādin which formed the basis for Mahāyāna scholasticismHowever once the commentaries used the khandhas to define what a person is they spawned many of the controversies that have plagued Buddhist thinking ever since If a person is just khandhas then what gets reborn If a person is just khandhas and the khandhas are annihilated on reaching total nibbāna then isnt total nibbāna the annihilation of the person If a person is khandhas and khandhas are interrelated with other khandhas how can one person enter nibbāna without dragging everyone else alongA large part of the history of Buddhist thought has been the story of ingenious but unsuccessful attempts to settle these questionsIts instructive to note though that the Pali canon never quotes the Buddha as trying to answer themIn fact it never quotes him as trying to define what a person is at allInstead it quotes him as saying that to define yourself in any way is to limit yourself and that the question What am I is best ignoredThis suggests that he formulated the concept of the khandhas to answer other different questionsIf as meditators we want to make the best use of this concept we should look at what those original questions were and determine how they apply to our practiceThe canon depicts the Buddha as saying that he taught only two topics suffering and the end of sufferingA survey of the Pali discourses shows him using the concept of the khandhas to answer the primary questions related to those topics What is sufferingHow is it causedWhat can be done to bring those causes to an endThe Buddha introduced the concept of the khandhas in his first sermon in response to the first of these questionsHis short definition of suffering was the five clingingkhandhas This fairly cryptic phrase can be fleshed out by drawing on other passages in the canonThe five khandhas are bundles or piles of form feeling perception fabrications and consciousnessNone of the texts explain why the Buddha used the word khandha to describe these thingsThe meaning of tree trunk may be relevant to the pervasive fire imagery in the canon  nibbāna being extinguishing of the fires of passion aversion and delusion  but none of the texts explicitly make this connectionThe common and explicit image is of the khandhas as burdensomeWe can think of them as piles of bricks we carry on our shouldersHowever these piles are best understood not as objects but as activities for an important passage defines them in terms of their functionsForm  which covers physical phenomena of all sorts both within and without the body  wears down or deforms Feeling feels pleasure pain and neither pleasure nor painPerception labels or identifies objectsConsciousness cognizes the six senses along with their objectsOf the five khandhas fabrication is the most complexPassages in the canon define it as intention but it includes a wide variety of activities such as attention evaluation and all the active processes of the mindIt is also the most fundamental khandha for its intentional activity underlies the experience of form feeling etc in the present momentThus intention is an integral part of our experience of all the khandhas  an important point for this means that there is an element of intention in all sufferingThis opens the possibility that suffering can be ended by changing our intentions  or abandoning them entirely  which is precisely the point of the Buddhas teachingsTo understand how this happens we have to look more closely at how suffering arises  or in other words how khandhas become clingingkhandhasWhen khandhas are experienced the process of fabrication normally doesnt simply stop thereIf attention focuses on the khandhas attractive features  beautiful forms pleasant feelings etc it can give rise to passion and delightThis passion and delight can take many forms but the most tenacious is the habitual act of fabricating a sense of me or mine identifying with a particular khandha or claiming possession of itThis sense of me and mine is rarely staticIt roams like an amoeba changing its contours as it changes locationSometimes expansive sometimes contracted it can view itself as identical with a khandha as possessing a khandha as existing within a khandha or as having a khandha existing within itselfAt times feeling finite at other times infinite whatever shape it takes its always unstable and insecure for the khandhas providing its food are simply activities and functions inconstant and insubstantialIn the words of the canon the khandhas are like foam like a mirage like the bubbles formed when rain falls on waterTheyre heavy only because the iron grip of trying to cling to them is burdensomeAs long as were addicted to passion and delight for these activities  as long as we cling to them  were bound to sufferThe Buddhist approach to ending this clinging however is not simply to drop itAs with any addiction the mind has to be gradually weaned awayBefore we can reach the point of no intention where were totally freed from the fabrication of khandhas we have to change our intentions toward the khandhas so as to change their functionsInstead of using them for the purpose of constructing a self we use them for the purpose of creating a path to the end of sufferingInstead of carrying piles of bricks on our shoulders we take them off and lay them along the ground as pavementThe first step in this process is to use the khandhas to construct the factors of the noble eightfold pathFor example Right Concentration Each of the four jhānas and the first three formless attainments are called perceptionattainments for they are based on maintaining a steady perception of the object of meditationIn the first jhāna for instance we maintain a steady perception focused on an aspect of form such as the breath and used directed thought and evaluation  which count as fabrications  to create feelings of pleasure and refreshment which we spread through the bodyIn the beginning its normal that we experience passion and delight for these feelings and that consciousness follows along in line with themThis helps get us absorbed in mastering the skills of concentrationOnce weve gained the sense of strength and wellbeing that comes from mastering these skills we can proceed to the second step attending to the drawbacks of even the refined khandhas we experience in concentration so as to undercut the passion and delight we might feel for themSuppose that an archer or archers apprentice were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay so that after a while he would become able to shoot long distances to fire accurate shots in rapid succession and to pierce great massesIn the same way there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationHe regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perceptions fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration a void notselfThe various ways of fostering dispassion are also khandhas khandhas of perceptionA standard list includes the following the perception of inconstancy the perception of notself the perception of unattractiveness the perception of drawbacks the perception of abandoning the perception of distaste for every world the perception of the undesirability of all fabricationsOne of the most important of these perceptions is that of notselfWhen the Buddha first introduced the concept of notself in his second sermon he also introduced a way of strengthening its impact with a series of questions based around the khandhasTaking each khandha in turn he asked Is it constant or inconstant InconstantAnd is what is inconstant stressful or pleasurable StressfulAnd is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I am NoThese questions show the complex role the khandhas play in this second step of the pathThe questions themselves are khandhas  of fabrication  and they use the concept of the khandhas to deconstruct any passion and delight that might center on the khandhas and create sufferingThus in this step we use khandhas that point out the drawbacks of the khandhasIf used unskillfully though these perceptions and fabrications can simply replace passion with its mirror image aversionThis is why they have to be based on the first step  the wellbeing constructed in jhāna  and coupled with the third step the perceptions of dispassion and cessation that incline the mind to the deathless This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation UnbindingIn effect these are perceptionkhandhas that point the mind beyond all khandhasThe texts say that this threestep process can lead to one of two resultsIf after undercutting passion and delight for the khandhas the mind contains any residual passion for the perception of the deathless it will attain the third level of Awakening called nonreturnIf passion and delight are entirely eradicated though all clinging is entirely abandoned the intentions that fabricate khandhas are dropped and the mind totally releasedThe bricks of the pavement have turned into a runway and the mind has taken offInto whatThe authors of the discourses seem unwilling to say even to the extent of describing it as a state of existence nonexistence neither or bothAs one of the discourses states the freedom lying beyond the khandhas also lies beyond the realm to which language properly appliesThere is also the very real practical problem that any preconceived notions of that freedom if clung to as a perceptionkhandha could easily act as an obstacle to its attainmentStill there is also the possibility that if properly used such a perceptionkhandha might act as an aid on the pathSo the discourses provide hints in the form of similes referring to total freedom asOther passages mention a consciousness in this freedom  without feature or surface without end luminous all around  lying outside of time and space experienced when the six sense spheres stop functioningIn this it differs from the consciousnesskhandha which depends on the six sense spheres and can be described in such terms as near or far past present or futureConsciousness without feature is thus the awareness of AwakeningAnd the freedom of this awareness carries over even when the awakened person returns to ordinary consciousnessAs the Buddha said of himselfFreed dissociated  released from form the Tathāgata dwells with unrestricted awarenessFreed dissociated  released from feeling perception fabrications consciousness birth aging death suffering  stress defilement the Tathāgata dwells with unrestricted awarenessThis shows again the importance of bringing the right questions to the teachings on the khandhasIf you use them to define what you are as a person you tie yourself down to no purposeThe questions keep piling onBut if you use them to put an end to suffering your questions fall away and youre freeYou never again cling to the khandhas and no longer need to use them to end your selfcreated sufferingAs long as youre still alive you can employ the khandhas as needed for whatever skillful uses you see fitAfter that youre liberated from all uses and needs including the need to find words to describe that freedom to yourself or to anyone elseThere are some cases in which a person overcome with pain his mind exhausted grieves mourns laments beats his breast  becomes bewilderedOr one overcome with pain his mind exhausted comes to search outside Who knows a way or two to stop this pain I tell you monks that stress results either in bewilderment or in searchBoth formerly  now it is only stress that I describe and the cessation of stressVenSāriputta said Friends in foreign lands there are wise nobles  brahmans householders  contemplatives  for the people there are wise  discriminating  who will question a

time has this mind been defiled by passion aversion  delusion From the defilement of the mind are beings defiledFrom the purification of the mind are beings purifiedIts just as when  there being dye lac yellow orpiment indigo or crimson  a dyer or painter would paint the picture of a woman or a man complete in all its parts on a wellpolished panel or wall or on a piece of cloth in the same way an uninstructed runofthemill person when creating creates nothing but form feeling perception fabrications consciousnessAt SāvatthīThere the Blessed One said Monks I will teach you the five aggregates  the five clingingaggregatesListen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord the monks respondedThe Blessed One said Now what monks are the five aggregatesWhatever form is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the aggregate of formWhatever feeling is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the aggregate of feelingWhatever perception is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the aggregate of perceptionWhatever fabrications are past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near those are called the aggregate of fabricationWhatever consciousness is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the aggregate of consciousnessThese are called the five aggregatesAnd what are the five clingingaggregatesWhatever form  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  is clingable offers sustenance and is accompanied with fermentation that is called form as a clingingaggregateWhatever feeling  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  is clingable offers sustenance and is accompanied with fermentation that is called feeling as a clingingaggregateWhatever perception  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  is clingable offers sustenance and is accompanied with fermentation that is called perception as a clingingaggregateWhatever fabrications  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  are clingable offer sustenance and are accompanied with fermentation those are called fabrication as a clingingaggregateWhatever consciousness  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  is clingable offers sustenance and is accompanied with fermentation that is called consciousness as a clingingaggregateThese are called the five clingingaggregatesAnd why do you call it formBecause it is afflicted thus it is called form Afflicted with whatWith cold  heat  hunger  thirst with the touch of flies mosquitoes wind

it perceives red it perceives whiteBecause it perceives it is called perceptionAnd why do you call them fabricationsBecause they fabricate fabricated things thus they are called fabrications What do they fabricate into a fabricated thingFor the sake of formness they fabricate form as a fabricated thingFor the sake of feelingness they fabricate feeling as a fabricated thingFor the sake of perceptionhood For the sake of fabricationhood For the sake of consciousnesshood they fabricate consciousness as a fabricated thingBecause they fabricate fabricated things they are called fabricationsAnd why do you call it consciousnessBecause it cognizes thus it is called consciousnessWhat does it cognizeIt cognizes what is sour bitter pungent sweet alkaline nonalkaline salty

consciousnessIf consciousness were not to gain a foothold in nameform would a comingintoplay of the origination of birth aging death and stress in the future be discernedNo lordThus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for consciousness ie nameformThis is the extent to which there is birth aging death passing away and rearisingThis is the extent to which there are means of designation expression and delineationThis is the extent to which the dimension of discernment extends the extent to which the cycle revolves for the manifesting of this world  ie nameform together with consciousnessThere are these four nutriments for the establishing of beings who have taken birth or for the support of those in search of a place to be bornWhich fourPhysical food gross or refined contact as the second consciousness the third and intellectual intention the fourthThese are the four nutriments for the establishing of beings or for the support of those in search of a place to be bornWhere there is passion delight  craving for the nutriment of physical food consciousness lands there and growsWhere consciousness lands and grows nameform alightsWhere nameform alights there is the growth of fabricationsWhere there is the growth of fabrications there is the production of renewed becoming in the futureWhere there is the production of renewed becoming in the future there is future birth aging  death together I tell you with sorrow affliction  despairJust as  when there is dye lac yellow orpiment indigo or crimson  a dyer or painter would paint the picture of a woman or a man complete in all its parts on a wellpolished panel or wall or on a piece of cloth in the same way where there is passion delight  craving for the nutriment of physical food consciousness lands there  grows together I tell you with sorrow affliction  despairWhere there is no passion for the nutriment of physical food where there is no delight no craving then consciousness does not land there or grow Nameform does not alight There is no growth of fabrications There is no production of renewed becoming in the futureWhere there is no production of renewed becoming in the future there is no future birth aging  deathThat I tell you has no sorrow affliction or despairJust as if there were a roofed house or a roofed hall having windows on the north the south or the eastWhen the sun rises and a ray has entered by way of the window where does it landOn the western wall lordAnd if there is no western wallOn the ground lordAnd if there is no

monks is how the four standingspots for consciousness should be seenLike the liquid property is how delight  passion should be seenLike the five means of propagation is how consciousness together with its nutriment should be seenShould consciousness when taking a stance stand attached to form supported by form established on form watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase

consciousness when taking a stance stand attached to perception supported by perception established on perception watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase  proliferationShould consciousness when taking a stance stand attached to fabrications supported by fabrications established on fabrications watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase  proliferationWere someone to say I will describe a coming a going a passing away an arising a growth an increase or a proliferation of consciousness apart from form from feeling from perception from fabrications that would be impossibleMonks I will teach you the burden the carrier of the burden the taking up of the burden and the casting off of the burdenListen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord the monks respondedThe Blessed One said And which is the burdenThe five clingingaggregates it should be saidWhich fiveForm as a clingingaggregate feeling as a clingingaggregate perception as a clingingaggregate fabrications as a clingingaggregate consciousness as a clingingaggregate This monks is called the burdenAnd which is the carrier of the burdenThe person it should be saidThis venerable one with such a name such a clanname This is called the carrier of the burdenAnd which is the taking up of the burdenThe craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion  delight relishing now here  now there  ie craving for sensual pleasure craving for becoming craving for nonbecoming This is called the taking up of the burdenAnd which is the casting off of the burdenThe remainderless

go that is as far as gnosispenetration goesAs for these two dimensions  the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception  the attainment of the cessation of feeling  perception  I tell you that they are to be rightly explained by those monks who are meditators skilled in attaining skilled in attaining  emerging who have attained  emerged in dependence on themI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryAnd on that occasion VenGirimānanda was diseased in pain severely illThen Vennanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord VenGirimānanda is diseased in pain severely illIt would be good if the Blessed One would visit VenGirimānanda out of sympathy for himnanda if you go to the monk Girimānanda and tell him ten perceptions its possible that when he hears the ten perceptions his disease may be allayedWhich tenThe perception of inconstancy the perception of notself the perception of unattractiveness the perception of drawbacks the perception of abandoning the perception of dispassion the perception of cessation the perception of distaste for every world the perception of the undesirability of all fabrications mindfulness of inout breathingAnd what is the perception of inconstancyThere is the case where a monk  having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building  reflects thus Form is inconstant feeling is inconstant perception is inconstant fabrications are inconstant consciousness is inconstant Thus he remains focused on inconstancy with regard to the five aggregatesThis nanda is called the perception of inconstancyAnd what is the perception of notselfThere is the case where a monk  having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building  reflects thus The eye is notself forms are notself the ear is notself sounds are notself the nose is notself aromas are notself the tongue is notself flavors are notself the body is notself flavors are notself the intellect is notself ideas are notself Thus he remains focused on notselfness with regard to the six inner  outer sense mediaThis is called the perception of notselfAnd what is the perception of unattractivenessThere is the case where a monk ponders this very body  from the soles of the feet on up from the crown of the head on down surrounded by skin filled with all sorts of unclean things There is in this body hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin muscle tendons bones bone marrow spleen heart liver membranes kidneys lungs large intestines small intestines gorge feces gall phlegm lymph blood sweat fat tears oil saliva mucus oil in the joints urine Thus he remains focused on unattractiveness with regard to this very bodyThis is called the perception of unattractivenessAnd what is the perception of drawbacksThere is the case where a monk  having gone to the wilderness to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling  reflects thus This body has many pains many drawbacksIn this body many kinds of disease arise such as seeingdiseases

combinations of bodily humors from changes in the weather from uneven care of the body from attacks from the result of kamma cold heat hunger thirst defecation urination Thus he remains focused on drawbacks with regard to this bodyThis is called the perception of drawbacksAnd what is the perception of abandoningThere is the case where a monk does not tolerate an arisen thought of sensualityHe abandons it destroys it dispels it  wipes it out of existenceHe does not tolerate an arisen thought of illwillHe abandons it destroys it dispels it  wipes it out of existenceHe does not tolerate an

this is exquisite  the stilling of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving cessation Unbinding This is called the perception of cessationAnd what is the perception of distaste for every worldThere is the case where a monk abandoning any attachments clingings fixations of awareness biases or obsessions with regard to any world refrains from them and does not get involvedThis is called the perception of distaste for every worldAnd what is the perception of the undesirability of all fabricationsThere is the case where a monk feels horrified humiliated  disgusted with all fabricationsThis is called the perception of the undesirability of all fabricationsAnd what is mindfulness of inout breathingThere is the case where a monk  having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building  sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the foreAlways mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out Breathing in long he discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long Or breathing in short he discerns I am breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns I am breathing out short He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I

inout breathingNow nanda if you go to the monk Girimānanda and tell him these ten perceptions its possible that when he hears these ten perceptions his disease may be allayedThen Vennanda having learned these ten perceptions in the Blessed Ones presence went to VenGirimānanda and told them to himAs VenGirimānanda heard these ten perceptions his disease was allayedAnd VenGirimānanda recovered from his diseaseThat was how VenGirimānandas disease was abandonedWhat do you think monks If a person were to gather or burn or do as he likes with the grass twigs branches  leaves here in Jetas Grove would the thought occur to you Its us that this person is gathering burning or doing with as he likesNo lordWhy is thatBecause those things are not our self nor do they belong to our selfEven so monks whatever isnt yours Let go of itYour letting go of it will be for your longterm welfare  happinessAnd what isnt yoursForm isnt yours Feeling isnt yours Perception Fabrications Consciousness isnt yours Let go of itYour letting go of it will be for your longterm welfare  happinessAnd just this noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of form ie right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationThe fact that pleasure  happiness arise in dependence on form that is the allure of formThe fact that form is inconstant stressful subject to change that is the drawback of formThe subduing of desire  passion for form the abandoning of desire  passion for form that is the escape from formSuppose there were a householder or householders son  rich wealthy with many possessions  who was thoroughly wellguardedThen suppose there came along a certain man desiring what was not his benefit desiring what was not his welfare desiring his loss of security desiring to kill himThe thought would occur to this man It would not be easy to kill this person by forceWhat if I were to sneak in and then kill himSo he would go to the householder or householders son and say May you take me on as a servant lord With that the householder or householders son would take the man on as a servantHaving been taken on as a servant the man would rise in the morning before his master go to bed in the evening only after his master doing whatever his master ordered always acting to please him speaking politely to himThen the householder or householders son would come to regard him as a friend  companion and would fall into his trustWhen the man realizes This householder or householders son trusts me then encountering him in a solitary place he would kill him with a sharp knifeNow what do you think my friend YamakaWhen that man went to the householder or householders son and said May you take me on as a servant lord wasnt he even then a murdererAnd yet although he was a murderer the householder or householders son did not know him as my murderer And when taken on as a servant he would rise in the morning before his master go to bed in the evening only after his master doing whatever his master ordered always acting to please him speaking politely to him wasnt he even then a murdererAnd yet although he was a murderer the householder or householders son did not know him as my murderer And when he encountered him in a solitary place and killed him with a sharp knife wasnt he even then a murdererAnd yet although he was a murderer the householder or householders son did not know him as my murderer Yes my friendIn the same way an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is

its current swift carrying everything with it and  holding on to both banks  kāsa grasses kusa grasses reeds bīraṇa grasses  trees were growingThen a man swept away by the current would grab hold of the kāsa grasses but they would tear away and so from that cause he would come to disasterHe would grab hold of the kusa grasses the reeds the bīraṇa grasses the trees but they would tear away and so from that cause he would come to disasterIn the same way there is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for people of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formThat

noble ones reflects in this way I am now being chewed up by formBut in the past I was also chewed up by form in the same way I am now being chewed up by present formAnd if I delight in future form then in the future I will be chewed up by form in the same way I am now being chewed up by present form Having reflected in this way he becomes indifferent to past form does not delight in future form and is practicing for the sake of disenchantment dispassion and cessation with regard to present form I am now being chewed up by feeling perception fabrications consciousnessBut in the past I was also chewed up by consciousness in the same way I am now being chewed up by present consciousnessAnd if I delight in future consciousness then in the future I will be chewed up by consciousness in the same way I am now being chewed up by present consciousness Having reflected in this way he becomes indifferent to past consciousness does not delight in future consciousness and is practicing for the sake of disenchantment dispassion and cessation with regard to present consciousnessFor a monk practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma what accords with the Dhamma is this that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to form that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to feeling that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to perception that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to fabrications that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to consciousnessAs he keeps cultivating disenchantment with regard to form feeling perception fabrications consciousness he comprehends form feeling perception fabrications consciousnessAs he comprehends form feeling perception fabrications consciousness he is totally released from form feeling perception fabrications consciousnessHe is totally released from sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairsHe is totally released I tell you from suffering  stress  SNMonks I will teach you the phenomena to be comprehended as well as comprehensionListen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord the monks respondedThe Blessed One said And which are the phenomena to be comprehendedForm is a phenomenon to be comprehendedFeeling Perception Fabrications Consciousness is a phenomenon to be comprehendedThese are called phenomena to be comprehendedAnd which is comprehensionAny ending of passion ending of aversion ending of delusionThis is called comprehensionI teach the Dhamma for the abandoning of the gross acquisition of a self the mindmade acquisition of a self the formless acquisition of a self such that when you practice it defiling mental qualities will be abandoned bright mental qualities will grow and you will enter  remain in the culmination  abundance of discernment having known  realized it for yourself in the here  nowIf the thought should occur to you that when defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown and one enters  remains in the culmination  abundance of discernment having known  realized it for oneself in the here  now ones abiding is stressfulpainful you should not see it in that wayWhen defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown and one enters  remains in the culmination  abundance of discernment having known  realized it for oneself in the here  now there is joy rapture serenity mindfulness alertness and a pleasanthappy abidingIts just as when boys or girls are playing with little sand castlesAs long as they are not free from passion desire love thirst fever  craving for those little sand castles thats how long they have fun with those sand castles enjoy them treasure them feel possessive of themBut when they become free from passion desire love thirst fever  craving for those little sand castles then they smash them scatter them demolish them with their hands or feet and make them unfit for playIn the same way Rādha you too should smash scatter  demolish form and make it unfit for playPractice for the ending of craving for formYou should smash scatter  demolish feeling and make it unfit for playPractice for the ending of craving for feelingYou should smash scatter  demolish perception and make it unfit for playPractice for the ending of craving for perceptionYou should smash scatter  demolish fabrications and make them unfit for playPractice for the ending of craving for fabricationsYou should smash scatter  demolish consciousness and make it unfit for playPractice for the ending of craving for consciousness  because the ending of craving Rādha is UnbindingOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Ayojjhans on the banks of the Ganges RiverThere he addressed the monks Monks suppose that a large glob of foam were floating down this Ganges River and a man with good eyesight were to see it observe it  appropriately examine itTo him  seeing it observing it  appropriately examining it  it would appear empty void without substance for what substance would there be in a glob of foamIn the same way a monk sees observes  appropriately examines any form that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or nearTo him  seeing it observing it  appropriately examining it  it would appear empty void without substance for what substance would there be in formNow suppose that in the autumn  when its raining in fat heavy drops  a water bubble were to appear  disappear on the water and a man with good eyesight were to see it observe it  appropriately examine itTo him  seeing it observing it  appropriately examining it  it would appear empty void without substance for what substance would there be in a water bubbleIn the same way a monk sees observes  appropriately examines any feeling that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or nearTo him  seeing it observing it  appropriately examining it  it would appear empty void without substance for what substance would there be in feelingNow suppose that in the last month of the hot season a mirage were shimmering and a man with good eyesight were to see it observe it  appropriately examine itTo him  seeing it observing it  appropriately examining it  it would appear empty void without substance for what substance would there be in a mirageIn the same way a monk sees observes  appropriately examines any perception that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or nearTo him  seeing it observing it  appropriately examining it  it would appear empty void without substance for what substance would there be in perceptionNow suppose that a man desiring heartwood in quest of heartwood seeking heartwood were to go into a forest carrying a sharp axThere he would see a large banana tree straight young of enormous heightHe would cut it at the root and having cut it at the root would chop off the topHaving chopped off the top he would peel away the outer skinPeeling away the outer skin he wouldnt even find sapwood to say nothing of heartwoodThen a man with good eyesight would see it observe it  appropriately examine itTo him  seeing it observing it  appropriately examining it  it would appear empty void without substance for what substance would there be in a banana treeIn the

five clingingaggregates Such is form such its origination such its disappearanceSuch is feeling Such is perception Such are fabrications Such is consciousness such its origination such its disappearance This is the development of concentration that leads to the ending of the fermentationsFurthermore the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five clingingaggregatesAnd how does he remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five clingingaggregatesThere is the case where a monk Such is form such its origination such its disappearanceSuch is feeling Such is perception Such are fabrications Such is consciousness such its origination such its disappearanceIn this way he remains focused internally on mental qualities in  of themselves or externally on mental qualities in  of themselves or both internally  externally on mental qualities in  of themselvesOr he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to mental qualities on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to mental qualities or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to mental qualitiesOr his mindfulness that There are mental qualities is maintained to the extent of knowledge  remembranceAnd he remains independent unsustained by anything in the worldThis is how a monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five clingingaggregatesThen VenKhemaka leaning on his staff went to the elder monks and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with themAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the elder monks said to him Friend Khemaka this I am of which you speak what do you say I amDo you say I am form or do you say I am something other than formDo you say I am feeling perception fabrications consciousness or do you say I am something other than consciousnessThis I am of which you speak what do you say I amFriends its not that I say I am form nor do I say I am something other than form Its not that I say I am feeling perception fabrications consciousness nor do I say I am something other than consciousness With regard to these five clingingaggregates I am has not been overcome although I dont assume that I am thisIts just like the scent of a blue red or white lotus If someone were to call it the scent of a petal or the scent of the color or the scent of a filament would he be speaking correctlyNo friendThen how would he describe it if he were describing it correctlyAs the scent of the flower Thats how he would describe it if he were describing it correctlyIn the same way friends its not that I say I am form nor do I say I am other than form Its not that I say I am feeling perception fabrications consciousness nor do I say I am something other than consciousness With regard to these five clingingaggregates I am has not been overcome although I dont assume that I am thisFriends even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters he still has with regard to the five clingingaggregates a lingering residual I am conceit an I am desire an I am obsessionBut at a later time he keeps focusing on the phenomena of arising  passing away with regard to the five clingingaggregates Such is form such its origin such its disappearanceSuch is feeling Such is perception Such are fabrications Such is consciousness such its origin such its disappearance As he keeps focusing on the arising  passing away of these five clingingaggregates the lingering residual I am conceit I am desire I am obsession is fully obliteratedJust like a cloth dirty  stained Its owners give it over to a washerman who scrubs it with salt earth or lye or cowdung and then rinses it in clear waterNow even though the cloth is clean  spotless it still has a lingering residual scent of salt earth or lye or cowdungThe washerman gives it to the owners the owners put it away in a scentinfused wicker hamper and its lingering residual scent of salt earth lye or cowdung is fully obliteratedIn the same way friends even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters he still has with regard to the five clingingaggregates a lingering residual I am conceit an I am desire an I am obsessionBut at a later time he keeps focusing on the phenomena of arising  passing away with regard to the five clingingaggregates Such is form such its origin such its disappearanceSuch is feeling Such is perception Such are fabrications Such is consciousness such its origin such its disappearance As he keeps focusing on the arising  passing away of these five clingingaggregates the lingering residual I am conceit I am desire I am obsession is fully obliteratedWhen this was said the elder monks said to VenKhemaka We didnt crossexamine VenKhemaka with the purpose of troubling him just that VenKhemaka is capable of declaring the Blessed Ones message teaching it describing it setting it forth revealing it explaining it making it plain  just as he has in fact declared it taught it described it set it forth revealed it explained it made it plainThat is what VenKhemaka saidGratified the elder monks delighted in his wordsAnd while this explanation was being given the minds of sixtysome monks through no clinging were fully released from fermentations  as was VenKhemakasSuppose there were a king or kings minister who had never heard the sound of a lute beforeHe might hear the sound of a lute and say What my good men is that sound  so delightful so tantalizing so intoxicating so ravishing so enthralling They would say That sire is called a lute whose sound is so delightful so tantalizing so intoxicating so ravishing so enthralling Then he would say Go  fetch me that lute They would fetch the lute and say Here sire is the lute whose sound is so delightful so tantalizing so intoxicating so ravishing so enthralling He would say Enough of your luteFetch me just the sound Then they would say This lute sire is made of numerous components a great many componentsIts through the activity of numerous components that it sounds that is in dependence on the body the skin the neck the frame the strings the bridge and the appropriate human effortThus it is that this lute  made of numerous components a great many components  sounds through the activity of numerous componentsThen the king would split the lute into ten pieces a hundred piecesHaving split the lute into ten pieces a hundred pieces he would shave it to splintersHaving shaved it to splinters he would burn it in a fireHaving burned it in a fire he would reduce it to ashesHaving reduced it to ashes he would winnow it before a high wind or let it be washed away by a swiftflowing streamHe would then say A sorry thing this lute  whatever a lute may be  by which people have been so thoroughly tricked  deceivedIn the same way a monk investigates form however far form may goHe investigates feeling perception fabrications consciousness however far consciousness may goAs he is investigating form feeling perception fabrications consciousness however far consciousness may go any thoughts of me or mine or I am do not occur to himTo what extent nanda does one assume when assuming a selfAssuming feeling to be the self one assumes that Feeling is my self Feeling is not my self My self is oblivious  Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious to feeling but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feelingNow one who says Feeling is my self should be addressed as follows There are these three feelings my friend  feelings of pleasure feelings of pain and feelings of neither pleasure nor painWhich of these three feelings do you assume to be the selfAt a moment when a feeling of pleasure is sensed no feeling of pain or of neither pleasure nor pain is sensedOnly a feeling of pleasure is sensed at that momentAt a moment when a feeling of pain is sensed no feeling of pleasure or of neither pleasure nor pain is sensedOnly a feeling of pain is sensed at that momentAt a moment when a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed no feeling of pleasure or of pain is sensedOnly a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed at that momentNow a feeling of pleasure is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessationA feeling of pain is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessationA feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessationHaving sensed a feeling of pleasure as my self then with the cessation of ones very own feeling of pleasure my self has perishedHaving sensed a feeling of pain as my self then with the cessation of ones very own feeling of pain my self has perishedHaving sensed a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain as my self then with the cessation of ones very own feeling of neither pleasure nor pain my self has perishedThus he assumes assuming in the immediate present a self inconstant entangled in pleasure and pain subject to arising and passing away he who says Feeling is my self Thus in this manner nanda one does not see fit to assume feeling to be the selfAs for the person who says Feeling is not the self My self is oblivious he should be addressed as follows My friend where nothing whatsoever is sensed at all would there be the thought I am No lordThus in this manner nanda one does not see fit to assume that Feeling is not my self My self is obliviousAs for the person who says Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feeling he should be addressed as follows My friend should feelings altogether and every way stop without remainder then with feeling completely not existing owing to the cessation of feeling would there be the thought I am No lordThus in this manner nanda one does not see fit to assume that Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feelingNow nanda in as far as a monk does not assume feeling to be the self nor the self as oblivious nor that My self feels in that my self is subject to feeling then not assuming in this way he does not cling to anything in the worldNot clinging he is not agitatedUnagitated he is totally unbound right withinHe discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldIf anyone were to say with regard to a monk whose mind is thus released that The Tathāgata exists after death is his view that would be mistaken that The Tathāgata does not exist after death that The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death that The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death is his view that would be mistakenWhyHaving directly known the extent of designation and the extent of the objects of designation the extent of expression and the extent of the objects of expression the extent of description and the extent of the objects of description the extent of discernment and the extent of the objects of discernment the extent to which the cycle revolves Having directly known that the monk is releasedThe view that Having directly known that the monk released does not see does not know would be mistakenThen VenAnurādha went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now I was staying not far from the Blessed One in a wilderness hutThen a large number of wandering sectarians came and said to me Friend Anurādha the Tathāgata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described with these four positions The Tathāgata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after deathWhen this was said I said to them Friends the Tathāgata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described otherwise than with these four positions The Tathāgata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after deathWhen this was said the wandering sectarians said to me This monk is either a newcomer not long gone forth or else an elder who is foolish  inexperienced So addressing me as they would a newcomer or a fool they got up from their seats and leftThen not long after they had left this thought occurred to me If I am questioned again by those wandering sectarians how will I answer in such a way that will I speak in line with what the Blessed One has said will not misrepresent the Blessed One with what is unfactual will answer in line with the Dhamma and no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing me What do you think Anurādha Is form constant or inconstantInconstant lordAnd is that which is inconstant easeful or stressfulStressful lordAnd is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I amNo lord Is feeling constant or inconstantInconstant lord Is perception constant or inconstantInconstant lord Are fabrications constant or inconstantInconstant lordWhat do you think Anurādha Is consciousness constant or inconstantInconstant lordAnd is that which is inconstant easeful or stressfulStressful lordAnd is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I amNo lordWhat do you think Anurādha Do you regard form as the TathāgataNo lordDo you regard feeling as the TathāgataNo lordDo you regard perception as the TathāgataNo lordDo you regard fabrications as the TathāgataNo lordDo you regard consciousness as the TathāgataNo lordWhat do you think Anurādha Do you regard the Tathāgata as being in form Elsewhere than form In feeling Elsewhere than feeling In perception Elsewhere than perception In fabrications Elsewhere than fabrications In consciousness Elsewhere than consciousnessNo lordWhat do you think Do you regard the Tathāgata as formfeelingperceptionfabricationsconsciousnessNo lordDo you regard the Tathāgata as that which is without form without feeling without perception without fabrications without consciousnessNo lordAnd so Anurādha  when you cant pin down the Tathāgata as a truth or reality even in the present life  is it proper for you to declare Friends the Tathāgata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described otherwise than with these four positions The Tathāgata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after deathNo lordVery good AnurādhaVery goodBoth formerly  now its only stress that I describe and the cessation of stressAnd so my friend Yamaka  when you cant pin down the Tathāgata as a truth or reality even in the present life  is it proper for you to declare As I understand the Teaching explained by the Blessed One a monk with no more fermentations on the breakup of the body is annihilated perishes  does not exist after deathPreviously my friend Sāriputta I did foolishly hold that evil suppositionBut now having heard your explanation of the Dhamma I have abandoned that evil supposition and have broken through to the DhammaThen friend Yamaka how would you answer if you are thus asked A monk a worthy one with no more fermentations what is he on the breakup of the body after deathThus asked I would answer Form is inconstant Feeling Perception Fabrications Consciousness is inconstantThat which is inconstant is stressfulThat which is stressful has ceased and gone to its end  SNNow at that moment this line of thinking appeared in the awareness of a certain monk So  form is notself feeling is notself perception is notself fabrications are notself consciousness is notselfThen what self will be touched by the actions done by what is notselfThen the Blessed One realizing with his awareness the line of thinking in that monks awareness addressed the monks Its possible that a senseless person  immersed in ignorance overcome with craving  might think that he could outsmart the Teachers message in this way So  form is notself feeling is notself perception is notself fabrications are notself consciousness is notselfThen what self will be touched by the actions done by what is notself Now monks havent I trained you in counterquestioning with regard to this  that topic here  thereWhat do you think Is form constant or inconstantInconstant lordAnd is that which is inconstant easeful or stressfulStressful lordAnd is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I amNo lord Is feeling constant or inconstantInconstant lord Is perception constant or inconstantInconstant lord Are fabrications constant or inconstantInconstant lordWhat do you think monks Is consciousness constant or inconstantInconstant lordAnd is that which is inconstant easeful or stressfulStressful lordAnd is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I amNo lordThus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amAny feeling whatsoeverAny perception whatsoeverAny fabrications whatsoeverAny consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amSeeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousnessDisenchanted he becomes dispassionateThrough dispassion he is fully releasedWith full release there is the knowledge Fully released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this world That is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsAnd while this explanation was being given the minds of sixty monks through no clinging were fully released from fermentationsConsciousness without feature without end luminous all around is not experienced through the solidity of earth the liquidity of water the radiance of fire the windiness of wind the divinity of devas the allness of the AllFreed dissociated  released from ten things Bāhuna the Tathāgata dwells with unrestricted awarenessWhich tenFreed dissociated  released from form the Tathāgata dwells with unrestricted awarenessFreed dissociated  released from feeling from perception from fabrications from consciousness from birth from aging from death from suffering  stress Freed dissociated  released from defilement the Tathāgata dwells with unrestricted awarenessJust as a red blue or white lotus born in the water and growing in the water rises up above the water and stands with no water adhering to it in the same way the Tathāgata  freed dissociated  released from these ten things  dwells with unrestricted awarenessMeditation teaches you the power of your perceptionsYou come to see how the labels you apply to things the images with which you visualize things have a huge influence over what you see how they can weigh you down with suffering and stressAs the meditation develops though it gives you the tools you need to gain freedom from that influenceIn the beginning when you first notice the power of perception you can easily feel overwhelmed by how pervasive it isSuppose youre focusing on the breathThere comes a point when you begin to wonder whether youre focusing on the breath itself or on your idea of the breathOnce this question arises the normal reaction is to try to get around the idea to the raw sensation behind itBut if youre really sensitive as you do this youll notice that youre simply replacing one caricature of the breath with another more subtle oneEven the raw sensation of breathing is shaped by how you conceptualize raw sensationNo matter how hard you try to pin down an unfiltered experience of breathing you still find it shaped by your idea of what breathing actually isThe more you pursue the reality of the breath the more it recedes like a mirageThe trick here is to turn this fact to your advantageAfter all youre not meditating to get to the breathYoure meditating to understand the processes leading to suffering so that you can put an end to themThe way you relate to your perceptions is part of these processes so thats what you want to seeYou have to treat your experience of the breath not as an end in itself but as a tool for understanding the role of perception in creating suffering and stressYou do this by deperception questioning your assumptions about breathing deliberately changing those assumptions and observing what happens as a resultNow without the proper context deperception could easily wander off into random abstractionsSo you take the practice of concentration as your context providing deperception both with a general direction and with particular tasks that force it to bump up against the operative assumptions that actually shape your experience of the presentThe general direction lies in trying to bring the mind to deeper and more longlasting levels of stillness so as to eliminate more and more subtle levels of stressYoure not trying to prove which perceptions of the breath depict it most truly but simply which ones work best in which situations for eliminating stressThe objectivity youre looking for is not the objectivity of the breath but the objectivity of cause and effectThe particular tasks that teach you these lessons begin with the task of trying to get the mind to stay comfortably focused for long periods of time on the breath  and right there you run into two operative assumptions What does it mean to breatheWhat does it mean to be focusedIts common to think of the breath as the air passing in and out through the nose and this can be a useful perception to start withUse whatever blatant sensations you associate with that perception as a means of establishing mindfulness developing alertness and getting the mind to grow stillBut as your attention gets more refined you may find that level of breath becoming too faint to detectSo try thinking of the breath instead as the energy flow in the body as a full body processThen make that experience as comfortable as possibleIf you feel any blockage or obstruction in the breathing see what you can do to dissolve those feelingsAre you doing anything to create themIf you can catch yourself creating them then its easy to let them dissolveAnd what would make you create them aside from your preconceived notions of how the mechanics of breathing have to workSo question those notions Where does the breath come into the bodyDoes it come in only through the nose and mouthDoes the body have to pull the breath inIf so which sensations do the pullingWhich sensations get pulledWhere does the pulling beginAnd where is the breath pulled fromWhich parts have the breath and which ones dontWhen you feel a sensation of blockage which side of the sensation are you onThese questions may sound strange but many times your preverbal assumptions about the body are strange as wellOnly when you confront them headon with strange questions can you bring them to lightAnd only when you see them clearly can you replace them with alternative conceptsSo once you catch yourself breathing uncomfortably in line with a particular assumption turn it around to see what sensations the new assumption highlightsTry staying with those sensations as long as you can to test themIf compared to your earlier sensations associated with the breath theyre easier to stay with if they provide a more solid and spacious grounding for concentration the assumption that drew them to your attention is a useful new tool in your meditationIf the new sensations arent helpful in that way you can throw the new tool asideFor example if you have a sense of being on one side of a blockage try thinking of being on the other sideTry being on bothThink of the breath as coming into the body not through the nose or mouth but through the middle of the chest the back of the neck every pore of your skin any spot that helps reduce the felt need to push and pullOr start questioning the need to push and pull at allDo you feel that your immediate experience of the body is of the solid parts and that they have to manage the mechanics of breathing which is secondaryWhat happens if you conceive your immediate experience of the body in a different way as a field of primary breath energy with the solidity simply a label attached to certain aspects of the breathWhatever you experience as a primary body sensation think of it as already breath without your having to do anything more to itHow does that affect the level of stress and strain in the breathingAnd what about the act of staying focusedHow do you conceive thatIs it behind the breathSurrounded by breathTo what extent does your mental picture of focusing help or hinder the ease and solidity of your concentrationFor instance you may find that you think of the mind as being in one part of the body and not in othersWhat do you do when you focus attention on another partDoes the mind leave its home base  say in the head  to go there or does the other part have to be brought into the headWhat kind of tension does this createWhat happens if you think of awareness already being in that other partWhat happens when you turn things around entirely instead of the minds being in the body see what stress is eliminated when you think of the body as surrounded by a preexisting field of awarenessWhen you ask questions like this and gain favorable results the mind can settle down into deeper and deeper levels of solidityYou eliminate unnecessary tension and stress in your focus finding ways of feeling more and more at home at ease in the experience of the presentOnce the mind is settled down give it time to stay thereDont be in too great a hurry to move onHere the questions are Which parts of the process were necessary to focus inWhich can now be let goWhich do you have to hold onto in order to maintain this focus Tuning into the right level of awareness is one process staying there is anotherWhen you learn how to maintain your sense of stillness try to keep it going in all situationsWhat do you discover gets in the wayIs it your own resistance to disturbancesCan you make your stillness so porous that disturbances can go through without running into anything without knocking your center off balanceAs you get more and more absorbed in exploring these issues concentration becomes less a battle against disturbance and more an opportunity for inner explorationAnd without even thinking about them youre developing the four bases of success the desire to understand things the persistence that keeps after your exploration the close attention youre paying to cause and effect and the ingenuity youre putting into framing the questions you askAll these qualities contribute to concentration help it get settled get solid get clearAt the same time they foster discernmentThe Buddha once said that the test for a persons discernment is how he or she frames a question and tries to answer itThus to foster discernment you cant simply stick to preset directions in your meditationYou have to give yourself practice in framing questions and testing the karma of those questions by looking for their resultsUltimately when you reach a perception of the breath that allows the sensations of inandout breathing to grow still you can start questioning more subtle perceptions of the bodyIts like tuning into a radio stationIf your receiver isnt precisely tuned to the frequency of the signal the static interferes with the subtleties of whatever is being transmittedBut when youre precisely tuned every nuance comes throughThe same with your sensation of the body when the movements of the breath grow still the more subtle nuances of how perception interacts with physical sensation come to the foreThe body seems like a mist of atomic sensations and you can begin to see how your perceptions interact with that mistTo what extent is the shape of the body inherent in the mistTo what extent is it intentional  something addedWhat happens when you drop the intention to create that shapeCan you focus on the space between the droplets in the mistWhat happens thenCan you stay thereWhat happens when you drop the perception of space and focus on the knowingCan you stay thereWhat happens when you drop the oneness of the knowingCan you stay thereWhat happens when you try to stop labeling anything at allAs you settle into these more formless states its important that you not lose sight of your purpose in tuning into themYoure here to understand suffering not to overinterpret what you experienceSay for instance that you settle into an enveloping sense of space or consciousnessFrom there its easy to assume that youve reached the primordial awareness the ground of being from which all things emerge to which they all return and which is essentially untouched by the whole process of emerging and returningYou might take descriptions of the Unconditioned and apply them to what youre experiencingIf youre abiding in a state of neither perception nor nonperception its easy to see it as a nonabiding devoid of distinctions between perceiver and perceived for mental activity is so attenuated as to be virtually imperceptibleStruck with the apparent effortlessness of the state you may feel that youve gone beyond passion aversion and delusion simply by regarding them as unrealIf you latch onto an assumption like this you can easily think that youve reached the end of the path before your work is really doneYour only protection here is to regard these assumptions as forms of perception and to dismantle them as wellAnd here is where the four noble truths prove their worth as tools for dismantling any assumption by detecting the stress that accompanies itAsk if theres still some subtle stress in the concentration that has become your dwelling placeWhat goes along with that stressWhat vagrant movements in the mind are creating itWhat persistent movements in the mind are creating itYou have to watch for bothIn this way you come face to face with the perceptions that keep even the most subtle states of concentration goingAnd you see that even they are stressfulIf you replace them with other perceptions though youll simply exchange one type of stress for anotherIts as if your ascending levels of concentration have brought you to the top of a flag poleYou look down and see aging illness and death coming up the pole in pursuitYouve exhausted all the options that perception can offer so what are you going to doYou cant just stay where you areYour only option is to release your gripAnd if youre letting go fully you let go of gravity tooAlthough early Buddhism is widely believed to take a negative attitude toward the body the texts of the Pali canon do not support this beliefThey approach the body both in its positive role as an object of meditation to develop mindfulness concentration and the mental powers based on concentration and in its negative role as an object for unskillful states of mindEven in its negative role the body is not the culprit the problem is the minds attachment to the bodyOnce the body can be used in its positive role to develop mindfulness and concentration those mental qualities can be used to free the mind of its attachments to the bodyThen as many a modern meditation master has noted the mind and body can live in peaceThis study guide focuses on the primary sutta in the Pali canon dealing with the contemplation of the body The Discourse on Mindfulness Immersed in the BodyThe first section The Context establishes the general principles underlying the practice of mindfulness immersed in the body showing why attachment to the body is considered problematic in the first placeThe second section presents the sutta itselfThe remaining sections expand on points raised in the sutta Section Three dealing with the advantages of practicing mindfulness immersed in the body and Section Four expanding on the drawbacks of attachment to the bodyBecause the sutta treats the body both as an object of mindfulness and as an object of jhana or mental absorption it raises questions concerning the relationship between these two mental qualities in the practice of meditationThere is a widespread belief that they represent two sides of a great divide in Buddhist meditation practice with mindfulness on one side joined with vipassana and discernment and jhana on the other side joined with samathaThe Pali canon however presents a much more complex picture of the interrelated roles these mental qualities in the pursuit of AwakeningAnd in fact the Great Divide picture of Buddhist meditation practice conflates what the Pali canon treats as three separate albeit related issues the relationship between samatha and vipassana the relationship between mindfulness and jhana and the relationship between jhana and discernmentTo convey the original parameters of these issues this study guide ends with three sections focused on precisely these relationshipsFor supplemental reading on the issues of jhana mindfulness and insight see the articles The Path of Mindfulness and Concentration and One Tool Among ManyFor further reading on contemplation of the body seeMonks I lived in refinement utmost

their alms round had gathered at the meeting hall when this discussion arose Isnt it amazing friendsIsnt it astounding the extent to which mindfulness immersed in the body when developed  pursued is said by the Blessed One who knows who sees  the worthy one rightly selfawakened  to be of great fruit  great benefit And this discussion came to no conclusionThen the Blessed One emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the meeting hall and on arrival sat down on a seat made readyAs he was sitting there he addressed the monks For what topic are you gathered together hereAnd what was the discussion that came to no conclusionJust now lord after the meal on returning from our alms round we gathered at the meeting hall when this discussion arose Isnt it amazing friendsIsnt

great benefit This was the discussion that had come to no conclusion when the Blessed One arrivedAnd how is mindfulness immersed in the body developed how is it pursued so as to be of great fruit  great benefitThere is the case where a monk  having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building  sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the foreAlways mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes outBreathing in long he discerns that he is breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns that he is breathing out longOr breathing in short he discerns that he is breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns that he is breathing out shortHe trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the entire body and to breathe out sensitive to the entire bodyHe trains himself to breathe in calming bodily fabrication and to breathe out calming bodily fabricationAnd as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any

heavenly world Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away  reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma Through the ending of the mental effluents he remains in the effluentfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having known and made them manifest for himself right in the here  nowMonks for one in whom mindfulness immersed in the body is cultivated developed pursued given a means of transport given a grounding steadied consolidated  wellundertaken these ten benefits can be expectedThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsNow how is mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culminationThere is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the foreAlways mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out Breathing in long he discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long Or breathing in short he discerns I am breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns I am breathing out short He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication He trains himself I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to rapture and to breathe out sensitive to raptureHe trains himself to breathe in sensitive to pleasure and to breathe out sensitive to pleasureHe trains himself to breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication and to breathe out sensitive to mental fabricationHe trains himself to breathe in calming mental fabrication and to breathe out calming mental fabrication He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the mind and to breathe out sensitive to the mindHe trains himself to breathe in satisfying the mind and to breathe out satisfying the mindHe trains himself to breathe in steadying the mind and to breathe out steadying the mindHe trains himself to breathe in releasing the mind and to breathe out releasing the mind He trains himself to breathe in focusing on inconstancy and to breathe out focusing on inconstancyHe trains himself to breathe in focusing on dispassion and to breathe out focusing on dispassionHe trains himself to breathe in focusing on cessation and to breathe out focusing on cessationHe trains himself to breathe in focusing on relinquishment and to breathe out focusing on relinquishment Now on whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns that he is breathing in long or breathing out long discerns that he is breathing out long or breathing in short discerns that he is breathing in short or breathing out short discerns that he is breathing out short trains himself to breathe in out sensitive to the entire body trains himself to breathe inout calming bodily fabrication On that occasion the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldI tell you monks that this  the inout breath  is classed as a body among bodies which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe inout sensitive to rapture trains himself to breathe inout sensitive to pleasure trains himself to breathe inout sensitive to mental fabrication trains himself to breathe inout calming mental fabrication On that occasion the monk remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldI tell you monks that this  close attention to inout breaths  is classed as a feeling among feelings which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe inout sensitive to the mind trains himself to breathe inout satisfying the mind trains himself to breathe inout steadying the mind trains himself to breathe inout releasing the mind On that occasion the monk remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldI dont say that there is mindfulness of inout breathing in one of confused mindfulness and no alertness which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe inout focusing on inconstancy trains himself to breathe inout focusing on dispassion trains himself to breathe inout focusing on cessation trains himself to breathe inout focusing on relinquishment On that occasion the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldHe who sees clearly with discernment the abandoning of greed  distress is one who oversees with equanimity which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldThis is how mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culminationAnanda Lord does the Blessed One have direct experience of going to the Brahma world by means of supranormal power with a mindmade bodyThe Buddha Yes AnandaAnanda But does the Blessed One also have direct experience of going to the Brahma world by means of supranormal power with this very physical body composed of the four great elementsThe Buddha Yes Ananda Its awesome lord and amazing that the Blessed One should have direct experience of going to the Brahma world by means of supranormal power with a mindmade body and of going to the Brahma world by means of supranormal power with this very physical body composed of the four great elementsThe Buddha Tathagatas are both awesome Ananda and endowed with awesome qualitiesThey are both amazing and endowed with amazing qualitiesWhenever the Tathagata merges his body with his mind and his mind with his body and remains having alighted on the perception of ease and buoyancy with regard to the body then his body becomes lighter more pliant more malleable  more radiantJust as when an iron ball heated all day becomes lighter more pliant more malleable  more radiant in the same way whenever the Tathagata merges his body with his mind and his mind with his body and remains having alighted on the perception of ease and buoyancy with regard to the body then his body becomes lighter more pliant more malleable  more radiantNow whenever the Tathagata merges his body with his mind and his mind with his body and remains having alighted on the perception of ease and buoyancy with regard to the body then his body rises effortlessly from the earth up into the skyHe then experiences manifold supranormal powersHaving been one he becomes many having been many he becomes oneHe appearsHe vanishesHe goes unimpeded through walls ramparts  mountains as if through spaceHe dives in  out of the earth as if it were waterHe walks on water without sinking as if it were dry landSitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged birdWith his hand he touches  strokes even the sun  moon so mighty  powerfulHe exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worldsJust as a tuft of cotton seed or a ball of thistle down lightly wafted by the wind rises effortlessly from the earth up into the sky in the same way whenever the Tathagata concentrates his body in his mind  his mind in his body and remains having alighted on the perception of ease and buoyancy then his body rises effortlessly from the earth up into the skyHe then experiences manifold supranormal powerseven as far as the Brahma worldsOnce a hawk suddenly swooped down on a quail and seized itThen the quail as it was being carried off by the hawk lamented O just my bad luck and lack of merit that I was wandering out of my proper range and into the territory of othersIf only I had kept to my proper range today to my own ancestral territory this hawk would have been no match for me in battleBut what is your proper range the hawk askedWhat is your own ancestral territoryA newly plowed field with clumps of earth all turned upSo the hawk without bragging about its own strength without mentioning its own strength let go of the quailGo quail but even when you have gone there you wont escape meThen the quail having gone to a newly plowed field with clumps of earth all turned up and climbing up on top of a large clump of earth stood taunting the hawk Now come and get me you hawkNow come and get me you hawkSo the hawk without bragging about its own strength without mentioning its own strength folded its two wings and suddenly swooped down toward the quailWhen the quail knew The hawk is coming at me full speed it slipped behind the clump of earth and right there the hawk shattered its breastThis is what happens to anyone who wanders into what is not his proper range and is the territory of othersFor this reason you should not wander into what is not your proper range and is the territory of othersIn one who wanders into what is not his proper range and is the territory of others Mara gains an opening Mara gains a footholdAnd what for a monk is not his proper range and is the territory of othersThe five strands of sensualityWhich fiveForms cognizable by the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingSounds cognizable by the earSmells cognizable by the noseTastes cognizable by the tongueTactile sensations cognizable by the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingThese for a monk are not his proper range and are the territory of othersWander monks in what is your proper range your own ancestral territoryIn one who wanders in what is his proper range his own ancestral territory Mara gains no opening Mara gains no footholdAnd what for a monk is his proper range his own ancestral territoryThe four frames of referenceWhich fourThere is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldHe remains focused on feelings in  of themselves mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldThis for a monk is his proper range his own ancestral territoryThere are in the Himalayas the king of mountains difficult uneven areas where neither monkeys nor human beings wanderThere are difficult uneven areas where monkeys wander but not human beingsThere are level stretches of land delightful where both monkeys and human beings wanderIn such spots hunters set a tar trap in the monkeys tracks in order to catch some monkeysThose monkeys who are not foolish or careless by nature when they see the tar trap will keep their distanceBut any monkey who is foolish  careless by nature comes up to the tar trap and grabs it with its paw which then gets stuck thereThinking Ill free my paw he grabs it with his other pawThat too gets stuckThinking Ill free both of my paws he grabs it with his footThat too gets stuckThinking Ill free both of my paws and my foot he grabs it with his other footThat too gets stuckThinking Ill free both of my paws and my feet as well he grabs it with his mouthThat too gets stuckSo the monkey snared in five ways lies there whimpering having fallen on misfortune fallen on ruin a prey to whatever the hunter wants to do with himThen the hunter without releasing the monkey skewers him right there picks him up and goes off as he likesThis is what happens to anyone who wanders into what is not his proper range and is the territory of othersFor this reason you should not wander into what is not your proper range and is the territory of othersThere is the case where a monk seeing a form with the eye is obsessed with pleasing forms is repelled by unpleasing forms and remains with bodymindfulness unestablished with limited awarenessHe does not discern as it actually is present the awarenessrelease the discernmentrelease where any evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainderJust as if a person catching six animals of different ranges of different habitats were to bind them with a strong ropeCatching a snake he would bind it with a strong ropeCatching a crocodilea birda doga hyenaa monkey he would bind it with a strong ropeBinding them all with a strong rope and tying a knot in the middle he would set chase to themThen those six animals of different ranges of different habitats would each pull toward its own range  habitatThe snake would pull thinking Ill go into the anthill The crocodile would pull thinking Ill go into the water The bird would pull thinking Ill fly up into the air The dog would pull thinking Ill go into the village The hyena would pull thinking Ill go into the charnel ground The monkey would pull thinking Ill go into the forest And when these six animals became internally exhausted they would submit they would surrender they would come under the sway of whichever among them was the strongestIn the same way when a monk whose mindfulness immersed in the body is undeveloped  unpursued the eye pulls toward pleasing forms while unpleasing forms are repellentThe ear pulls toward pleasing soundsthe nose pulls toward pleasing smellsthe tongue pulls toward pleasing tastesthe body pulls toward pleasing tactile sensationsthe intellect pulls toward pleasing ideas while unpleasing ideas are repellentThis monks is lack of restraintAnd what is restraintThere is the case where a monk seeing a form with the eye is not obsessed with pleasing forms is not repelled by unpleasing forms and remains with bodymindfulness established with immeasurable awarenessHe discerns as it actually is present the awarenessrelease the discernmentrelease where all evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainderJust as if a person catching six animals of different ranges of different habitats were to bind them with a strong ropeand tether them to a strong post or stakeThen those six animals of different ranges of different habitats would each pull toward its own range  habitat And when these six animals became internally exhausted they would stand sit or lie down right there next to the post or stakeIn the same way when a monk whose mindfulness immersed in the body is developed  pursued the eye does not pull toward pleasing forms and unpleasing forms are not repellentThe ear does not pull toward pleasing soundsthe nose does not pull toward pleasing smellsthe tongue does not pull toward pleasing tastesthe body does not pull toward pleasing tactile sensationsthe intellect does not pull toward pleasing ideas and unpleasing ideas are not repellentThis monks is restraintThe strong post or stake is a term for mindfulness immersed in the bodyThus you should train yourselves We will develop mindfulness immersed in the bodyWe will pursue it give it a means of transport give it a groundingWe will steady it consolidate it and set about it properly Thats how you should train yourselvesSuppose monks that a large crowd of people comes thronging together saying The beauty queenThe beauty queen And suppose that the beauty queen is highly accomplished at singing  dancing so that an even greater crowd comes thronging saying The beauty queen is singingThe beauty queen is dancing Then a man comes along desiring life  shrinking from death desiring pleasure  abhorring painThey say to him Now look here misterYou must take this bowl filled to the brim with oil and carry it on your head in between the great crowd  the beauty queenA man with a raised sword will follow right behind you and wherever you spill even a drop of oil right there will he cut off your head Now what do you think monks Will that man not paying attention to the bowl of oil let himself get distracted outsideNo lordI have given you this parable to convey a meaningThe meaning is this The bowl filled to the brim with oil stands for mindfulness immersed in the bodyThus you should train yourselves We will develop mindfulness immersed in the bodyWe will pursue it give it a means of transport give it a groundingWe will steady it consolidate it and set about it properly Thats how you should train yourselvesWhoever pervades the great ocean with his awareness encompasses whatever rivulets flow down into the oceanIn the same way whoever develops  pursues mindfulness immersed in the body encompasses whatever skillful qualities are on the side of clear knowingWhen one thing is practiced  pursued the body is calmed the mind is calmed thinking  evaluating are stilled and all qualities on the side of clear knowing go to the culmination of their developmentWhich one thingMindfulness immersed in the bodyWhen one thing is practiced  pursued ignorance is abandoned clear knowing arises the conceit I am is abandoned latent tendencies are uprooted fetters are abandonedWhich one thingMindfulness immersed in the bodyThose who do not taste mindfulness of the body do not taste the DeathlessThose who taste mindfulness of the body taste the DeathlessThose who are heedless of mindfulness of the body are heedless of the DeathlessThose who comprehend mindfulness of the body comprehend the Deathless AN The body is aflameTactile sensations are aflameBodily consciousness is aflameBodily contact is aflameAnd whatever there is that arises in dependence on bodily contact  experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain  that too is aflameAflame with whatAflame with the fire of passion the fire of aversion the fire of delusionAflame I tell you with birth aging  death with sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairsSeeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with the body disenchanted with tactile sensations disenchanted with bodily consciousness disenchanted with bodily contactAnd whatever there is that arises in dependence on bodily contact experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain With that too he grows disenchantedDisenchanted he becomes dispassionateThrough dispassion he is fully releasedWith full release there is the knowledge Fully released He discerns that Birth is depleted the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThen Janussonin the brahman went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One I am of the view  opinion that there is no one who subject to death is not afraid or in terror of

was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monksMay Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeAnd what is the perception of drawbacksThere is the case where a monk  having gone to the wilderness to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling  reflects thus This body has many pains many drawbacksIn this body many kinds of disease arise such as seeingdiseases hearingdiseases nosediseases tonguediseases bodydiseases headdiseases eardiseases mouthdiseases teethdiseases cough asthma catarrh fever aging stomachache fainting dysentery

remains focused on drawbacks with regard to this bodyThis is called the perception of drawbacksI will teach you a Dhamma discourse on bondage  lack of bondageListen  pay close attentionI will speakYes

considering it thoughtfully takes food  not playfully nor for intoxication nor for putting on bulk nor for beautification  but simply for the survival  continuance of this body for ending its afflictions for the support of the holy life Thus will I destroy old feelings and not create new feelingsI will maintain myself be blameless  live in comfort Then at a later time he abandons food
