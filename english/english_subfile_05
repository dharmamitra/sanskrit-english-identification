I have said that sensual pleasures are of little satisfaction much stress much despair  greater drawbacks
I have compared sensual pleasures to a chain of bones of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks
I have compared sensual pleasures to a lump of flesh a grass torch a pit of glowing embers a dream borrowed goods the fruits of a tree a butcher's ax and chopping block swords and spears a snake's head of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks
But you worthless man through your own wrong grasp have both misrepresented us as well as injuring yourself and accumulating much demerit for yourself for that will lead to your longterm harm  suffering
Then the Blessed One said to the monks What do you think monks
Is this monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers even warm in this Doctrine  Discipline
How could he be lord
No lord
When this was said the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers sat silent abashed his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for words
Then the Blessed One seeing that the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers was sitting silent abashed his shoulders drooping his head down brooding at a loss for words said to him Worthless man you will be recognized for your own pernicious viewpoint
I will crossexamine the monks on this matter
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks do you too understand the Dhamma as taught by me in the same way that the monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers does when through his own wrong grasp both misrepresents us as well as injuring himself and accumulating much demerit for himself
No lord for in many ways the Blessed One has described obstructive acts to us and when indulged in they are genuine obstructions
The Blessed One has said that sensual pleasures are of little satisfaction much stress much despair  greater drawbacks
The Blessed One has compared sensual pleasures to a chain of bones of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks
The Blessed One has compared sensual pleasures to a lump of flesh a grass torch a pit of glowing embers a dream borrowed goods the fruits of a tree a butcher's ax and chopping block swords and spears a snake's head of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks
It's good monks that you understand the Dhamma taught by me in this way for in many ways I have described obstructive acts to you and when indulged in they are genuine obstructions
I have said that sensual pleasures are of little satisfaction much stress much despair  greater drawbacks
I have compared sensual pleasures to a chain of bones of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks
I have compared sensual pleasures to a lump of flesh a grass torch a pit of glowing embers a dream borrowed goods the fruits of a tree a butcher's ax and chopping block swords and spears a snake's head of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks
But this monk Arittha FormerlyoftheVultureKillers through his own wrong grasp has both misrepresented us as well as injuring himself and accumulating much demerit for himself and that will lead to this worthless man's longterm harm  suffering
For a person to indulge in sensual pleasures without sensual passion without sensual perception without sensual thinking That isn't possible

Monks there is the case where some worthless men study the Dhamma dialogues narratives of mixed prose and verse explanations verses spontaneous exclamations quotations birth stories amazing events question  answer sessions
Having studied the Dhamma they don't ascertain the meaning of those Dhammas with their discernment
Not having ascertained the meaning of those Dhammas with their discernment they don't come to an agreement through pondering
They study the Dhamma both for attacking others and for defending themselves in debate
They don't reach the goal for which study the Dhamma
Their wrong grasp of those Dhammas will lead to their longterm harm  suffering
Why is that
Because of the wronggraspedness of the Dhammas
Suppose there were a man needing a watersnake seeking a watersnake wandering in search of a watersnake
He would see a large watersnake and grasp it by the coils or by the tail
The watersnake turning around would bite him on the hand on the arm or on one of his limbs and from that cause he would suffer death or deathlike suffering
Why is that
Because of the wronggraspedness of the watersnake
In the same way there is the case where some worthless men study the Dhamma Having studied the Dhamma they don't ascertain the meaning of those Dhammas with their discernment

They don't reach the goal for which study the Dhamma
Their wrong grasp of those Dhammas will lead to their longterm harm  suffering
Why is that
Because of the wronggraspedness of the Dhammas
But then there is the case where some clansmen study the Dhamma Having studied the Dhamma they ascertain the meaning of those Dhammas with their discernment
Having ascertained the meaning of those Dhammas with their discernment they come to an agreement through pondering
They don't study the Dhamma either for attacking others or for defending themselves in debate
They reach the goal for which people study the Dhamma
Their right grasp of those Dhammas will lead to their longterm welfare  happiness
Why is that
Because of the rightgraspedness of the Dhammas
Suppose there were a man needing a watersnake seeking a watersnake wandering in search of a watersnake
He would see a large watersnake and pin it down firmly with a cleft stick
Having pinned it down firmly with a forked stick he would grasp it firmly by the neck
Then no matter how much the watersnake might wrap its coils around his hand his arm or any of his limbs he would not from that cause suffer death or deathlike suffering
Why is that
Because of the rightgraspedness of the watersnake
In the same way there is the case where some clansmen study the Dhamma Having studied the Dhamma they ascertain the meaning of those Dhammas with their discernment

Therefore monks when you understand the meaning of any statement of mine that is how you should remember it
But when you don't understand the meaning of any statement of mine then right there you should crossquestion me or the experienced monks
Monks I will teach you the Dhamma compared to a raft for the purpose of crossing over not for the purpose of holding onto
Listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord the monks responded to the Blessed One
The Blessed One said Suppose a man were traveling along a path
He would see a great expanse of water with the near shore dubious  risky the further shore secure  free from risk but with neither a ferryboat nor a bridge going from this shore to the other
The thought would occur to him 'Here is this great expanse of water with the near shore dubious  risky the further shore secure  free from risk but with neither a ferryboat nor a bridge going from this shore to the other
What if I were to gather grass twigs branches  leaves and having bound them together to make a raft were to cross over to safety on the other shore in dependence on the raft making an effort with my hands  feet' Then the man having gathered grass twigs branches  leaves having bound them together to make a raft would cross over to safety on the other shore in dependence on the raft making an effort with his hands  feet
Having crossed over to the further shore he might think 'How useful this raft has been to me
For it was in dependence on this raft that making an effort with my hands  feet I have crossed over to safety on the further shore
Why don't I having hoisted it on my head or carrying it on my back go wherever I like' What do you think monks Would the man in doing that be doing what should be done with the raft
No lord
And what should the man do in order to be doing what should be done with the raft
There is the case where the man having crossed over would think 'How useful this raft has been to me
For it was in dependence on this raft that making an effort with my hands  feet I have crossed over to safety on the further shore
Why don't I having dragged it on dry land or sinking it in the water go wherever I like' In doing this he would be doing what should be done with the raft
In the same way monks I have taught the Dhamma compared to a raft for the purpose of crossing over not for the purpose of holding onto
Understanding the Dhamma as taught compared to a raft you should let go even of Dhammas to say nothing of nonDhammas
Monks there are these six viewpositions
Which six
There is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes about form 'This is me this is my self this is what I am'
He assumes about feeling 'This is me this is my self this is what I am'
He assumes about perception 'This is me this is my self this is what I am'
He assumes about fabrications 'This is me this is my self this is what I am'
He assumes about what seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after pondered by the intellect 'This is me this is my self this is what I am'
He assumes about the viewposition  'This cosmos is the self
After death this I will be constant permanent eternal not subject to change
I will stay just like that for an eternity' 'This is me this is my self this is what I am'
Then there is the case where a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma assumes about form 'This is not me this is not my self this is not what I am'
He assumes about feeling 'This is not me this is not my self this is not what I am'
He assumes about perception 'This is not me this is not my self this is not what I am'
He assumes about fabrications 'This is not me this is not my self this is not what I am'
He assumes about what seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after pondered by the intellect 'This is not me this is not my self this is not what I am'
He assumes about the viewposition  'This cosmos is the self
After death this I will be constant permanent eternal not subject to change
I will stay just like that for an eternity' 'This is not me this is not my self this is not what I am'
Seeing thus he is not agitated over what is not present 
When this was said a certain monk said to the Blessed One Lord might there be agitation over what is externally not present
There might monk the Blessed One said
There is the case where someone thinks 'O it was mine
O what was mine is not
O may it be mine
O I don't obtain it' He grieves  is tormented weeps beats his breast  grows delirious
It's thus that there is agitation over what is externally not present
But lord might there be nonagitation over what is externally not present
There might monk the Blessed One said
There is the case where someone doesn't think 'O it was mine
O what was mine is not
O may it be mine
O I don't obtain it' He doesn't grieve isn't tormented doesn't weep beat his breast or grow delirious
It's thus that there is nonagitation over what is externally not present
But lord might there be agitation over what is internally not present
There might monk the Blessed One said
There is the case where someone has this view 'This cosmos is the self
After death this I will be constant permanent eternal not subject to change
I will stay just like that for an eternity' He hears a Tathagata or a Tathagata's disciple teaching the Dhamma for the elimination of all viewpositions determinations biases inclinations  obsessions for the stilling of all fabrications for the relinquishing of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding
The thought occurs to him 'So it might be that I will be annihilated
So it might be that I will perish
So it might be that I will not exist' He grieves  is tormented weeps beats his breast  grows delirious
It's thus that there is agitation over what is internally not present
But lord might there be nonagitation over what is internally not present
There might monk the Blessed One said
There is the case where someone doesn't have this view 'This cosmos is the self
After death this I will be constant permanent eternal not subject to change
I will stay just like that for an eternity' He hears a Tathagata or a Tathagata's disciple teaching the Dhamma for the elimination of all viewpositions determinations biases inclinations  obsessions for the stilling of all fabrications for the relinquishing of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding
The thought doesn't occur to him 'So it might be that I will be annihilated
So it might be that I will perish
So it might be that I will not exist' He doesn't grieve isn't tormented doesn't weep beat his breast or grow delirious
It's thus that there is nonagitation over what is internally not present
Monks you would do well to possess that possession the possession of which would be constant permanent eternal not subject to change that would stay just like that for an eternity
But do you see that possession the possession of which would be constant permanent eternal not subject to change that would stay just like that for an eternity
No lord
Very good monks
I too do not envision a possession the possession of which would be constant permanent eternal not subject to change that would stay just like that for an eternity
Monks you would do well to cling to that clinging to a doctrine of self clinging to which there would not arise sorrow lamentation pain grief  despair
But do you see a clinging to a doctrine of self clinging to which there would not arise sorrow lamentation pain grief  despair
No lord
Very good monks
I too do not envision a clinging to a doctrine of self clinging to which there would not arise sorrow lamentation pain grief  despair
Monks you would do well to depend on a viewdependency depending on which there would not arise sorrow lamentation pain grief  despair
But do you see a viewdependency depending on which there would not arise sorrow lamentation pain grief  despair
No lord
Very good monks
I too do not envision a viewdependency depending on which there would not arise sorrow lamentation pain grief  despair
Monks where there is a self would there be 'belonging to my self'
Yes lord
Or monks where there is what belongs to self would there be 'my self'
Yes lord
Monks where a self or what belongs to self are not pinned down as a truth or reality then the viewposition  'This cosmos is the self
After death this I will be constant permanent eternal not subject to change
I will stay just like that for an eternity'  Isn't it utterly  completely a fool's teaching
What else could it be lord
It's utterly  completely a fool's teaching
What do you think monks  Is form constant or inconstant Inconstant lord And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful Stressful lord And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
Is feeling constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
Is perception constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
Are fabrications constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
What do you think monks  Is consciousness constant or inconstant Inconstant lord And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful Stressful lord And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
Thus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Any feeling whatsoever
Any perception whatsoever
Any fabrications whatsoever
Any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness
Disenchanted he becomes dispassionate
Through dispassion he is fully released
With full release there is the knowledge 'Fully released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
This monks is called a monk whose crossbar is thrown off whose moat is filled in whose pillar is pulled out whose bolt is withdrawn a noble one with banner lowered burden placed down unfettered
And how is a monk one whose crossbar is thrown off
There is the case where a monk's ignorance is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
This is how a monk is one whose crossbar is thrown off
And how is a monk one whose moat is filled in
There is the case where a monk's wanderingon to birth leading on to furtherbecoming is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
This is how a monk is one whose moat is filled in
And how is a monk one whose pillar is pulled out
There is the case where a monk's craving is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
This is how a monk is one whose pillar is pulled out
And how is a monk one whose bolt is withdrawn
There is the case where a monk's five lower fetters are abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
This is how a monk is one whose bolt is withdrawn
And how is a monk a noble one with banner lowered burden placed down unfettered
There is the case where a monk's conceit 'I am' is abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
This is how a monk is a noble one with banner lowered burden placed down unfettered
And when the devas together with Indra the Brahmas  Pajapati search for the monk whose mind is thus released they cannot find that 'The consciousness of the one truly gone is dependent on this' Why is that
The one truly gone is untraceable even in the here  now

Speaking in this way teaching in this way I have been erroneously vainly falsely unfactually misrepresented by some brahmans and contemplatives 'Gotama the contemplative is one who misleads
He declares the annihilation destruction extermination of the existing being' But as I am not that as I do not say that so I have been erroneously vainly falsely unfactually misrepresented by those venerable brahmans and contemplatives 'Gotama the contemplative is one who misleads
He declares the annihilation destruction extermination of the existing being' 
Both formerly and now monks I declare only stress and the cessation of stress
And if others insult abuse taunt bother  harass the Tathagata for that he feels no hatred no resentment no dissatisfaction of heart because of that
And if others honor respect revere  venerate the Tathagata for that he feels no joy no happiness no elation of heart because of that
And if others honor respect revere  venerate the Tathagata for that he thinks 'They do me such service at this that has already been comprehended' 
Therefore monks if others insult abuse taunt bother  harass you as well you should feel no hatred no resentment no dissatisfaction of heart because of that
And if others honor respect revere  venerate you as well you should feel no joy no gladness no elation of heart because of that
And if others honor respect revere  venerate you you should think 'They do us such service at this that has already been comprehended'
Therefore monks whatever isn't yours Let go of it
Your letting go of it will be for your longterm welfare  happiness
And what isn't yours
Form isn't yours Let go of it
Your letting go of it will be for your longterm welfare  happiness
Feeling isn't yours Perception Thought fabrications Consciousness isn't yours Let go of it
Your letting go of it will be for your longterm welfare  happiness
What do you think monks If a person were to gather or burn or do as he likes with the grass twigs branches  leaves here in Jeta's Grove would the thought occur to you 'It's us that this person is gathering burning or doing with as he likes'
No lord
Why is that
Because those things are not our self nor do they belong to our self
Even so monks whatever isn't yours Let go of it
Your letting go of it will be for your longterm welfare  happiness
And what isn't yours
Form isn't yours Feeling isn't yours Perception Thought fabrications Consciousness isn't yours Let go of it
Your letting go of it will be for your longterm welfare  happiness
The Dhamma thus wellproclaimed by me is clear open evident stripped of rags
In the Dhamma thus wellproclaimed by me  clear open evident stripped of rags  there is for those monks who are arahants  whose mental effluents are ended who have reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and who are released through right gnosis  no cycle for manifestation
This is how the Dhamma wellproclaimed by me is clear open evident stripped of rags

In the Dhamma thus wellproclaimed by me  clear open evident stripped of rags  those monks who have abandoned the five lower fetters are all due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that world
This is how the Dhamma wellproclaimed by me is clear open evident stripped of rags
In the Dhamma thus wellproclaimed by me  clear open evident stripped of rags  those monks who have abandoned the three fetters with the attenuation of passion aversion  delusion are all oncereturners who on returning only one more time to this world will make an ending to stress
This is how the Dhamma wellproclaimed by me is clear open evident stripped of rags
In the Dhamma thus wellproclaimed by me  clear open evident stripped of rags  those monks who have abandoned the three fetters are all streamwinners steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for selfawakening
This is how the Dhamma wellproclaimed by me is clear open evident stripped of rags
In the Dhamma thus wellproclaimed by me  clear open evident stripped of rags  those monks who are Dhammafollowers and convictionfollowers are all headed for selfawakening
This is how the Dhamma wellproclaimed by me is clear open evident stripped of rags
In the Dhamma thus wellproclaimed by me  clear open evident stripped of rags  those monks who have a measure of conviction in me a measure of love for me are all headed for heaven
This is how the Dhamma wellproclaimed by me is clear open evident stripped of rags
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
As for the term existing being SN
and SN
state that a being is defined by hisherits objects of clinging
SN
indicates that one of the ways of overcoming clinging is to focus on how the concept of being arises without assuming the truth of the concept
And as MN SN and SN
maintain when clinging is gone one is called not a being but a tathagata  who freed from clinging cannot be classified as or identified with anything at all
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Park
Then Mahanama the Sakyan went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One For a long time now lord I have understood the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One thus 'Greed is a defilement of the mind aversion is a defilement of the mind delusion is a defilement of the mind' Yet even though I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One that greed is a defilement of the mind aversion is a defilement of the mind delusion is a defilement of the mind there are still times when the mental quality of greed invades my mind and remains when the mental quality of aversion the mental quality of delusion invades my mind and remains
The thought occurs to me What mental quality is unabandoned within me so that there are times when the mental quality of greed invades my mind and remains when the mental quality of aversion the mental quality of delusion invades my mind and remains
Mahanama that very mental quality is what is unabandoned within you so that there are times when the mental quality of greed the mental quality of aversion the mental quality of delusion invades your mind and remains
For if that mental quality were abandoned in you you would not live the household life and would not partake of sensuality
It's because that mental quality is not abandoned in you that you live the household life and partake of sensuality
Even though a disciple of the noble ones has clearly seen as it actually is with right discernment that sensuality is of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks still  if he has not attained a rapture  pleasure apart from sensuality apart from unskillful mental qualities or something more peaceful than that  he can be tempted by sensuality
But when he has clearly seen as it actually is with right discernment that sensuality is of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks and he has attained a rapture  pleasure apart from sensuality apart from unskillful mental qualities or something more peaceful than that he cannot be tempted by sensuality
I myself before my Awakening when I was still an unawakened bodhisatta saw as it actually was with right discernment that sensuality is of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks but as long as I had not attained a rapture  pleasure apart from sensuality apart from unskillful mental qualities or something more peaceful than that I did not claim that I could not be tempted by sensuality
But when I saw as it actually was with right discernment that sensuality is of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks and I had attained a rapture  pleasure apart from sensuality apart from unskillful mental qualities or something more peaceful than that that was when I claimed that I could not be tempted by sensuality
Now what Mahanama is the allure of sensuality
These five strings of sensuality
Which five
Forms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
Sounds cognizable via the ear Aromas cognizable via the nose Flavors cognizable via the tongue Tactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
Now whatever pleasure or joy arises in dependence on these five strands of sensuality that is the allure of sensuality
And what is the drawback of sensuality
There is the case where on account of the occupation by which a clansman makes a living  whether checking or accounting or calculating or plowing or trading or cattle tending or archery or as a king's man or whatever the occupation may be  he faces cold he faces heat being harassed by mosquitoes  flies wind  sun  creeping things dying from hunger  thirst
Now this drawback in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
If the clansman gains no wealth while thus working  striving  making effort he sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraught 'My work is in vain my efforts are fruitless' Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
If the clansman gains wealth while thus working  striving  making effort he experiences pain  distress in protecting it 'How will neither kings nor thieves make off with my property nor fire burn it nor water sweep it away nor hateful heirs make off with it' And as he thus guards and watches over his property kings or thieves make off with it or fire burns it or water sweeps it away or hateful heirs make off with it
And he sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraught 'What was mine is no more' Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
Again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source sensuality for the cause the reason being simply sensuality that kings quarrel with kings nobles with nobles brahmans with brahmans householders with householders mother with child child with mother father with child child with father brother with brother sister with sister brother with sister sister with brother friend with friend
And then in their quarrels brawls  disputes they attack one another with fists or with clods or with sticks or with knives so that they incur death or deadly pain
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
Again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that taking swords  shields and buckling on bows  quivers charge into battle massed in double array while arrows  spears are flying and swords are flashing and there they are wounded by arrows  spears and their heads are cut off by swords so that they incur death or deadly pain
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
Again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that taking swords  shields and buckling on bows  quivers charge slippery bastions while arrows  spears are flying and swords are flashing and there they are splashed with boiling cow dung and crushed under heavy weights and their heads are cut off by swords so that they incur death or deadly pain
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
Again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that break into windows seize plunder commit burglary ambush highways commit adultery and when they are captured kings have them tortured in many ways
They flog them with whips beat them with canes beat them with clubs
They cut off their hands cut off their feet cut off their hands  feet
They cut off their ears cut off their noses cut off their ears  noses
They subject them to the 'porridge pot' the 'polishedshell shave' the 'Rahu's mouth' the 'flaming garland' the 'blazing hand' the 'grassduty' the 'barkdress' the 'burning antelope' the 'meat hooks' the 'coingouging' the 'lye pickling' the 'pivot on a stake' the 'rolledup bed' They have them splashed with boiling oil devoured by dogs impaled alive on stakes
They have their heads cut off with swords so that they incur death or deadly pain
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
Again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that engaged in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct
Having engaged in bodily verbal and mental misconduct they  on the breakup of the body after death  reappear in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress in the future life has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
Once Mahanama when I was staying near Rajagaha on Vulture Peak Mountain a number of Niganthas were at Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili practicing continuous standing rejecting seats experiencing fierce sharp racking pains due to exertion
So in the evening rising from seclusion I went to the Niganthas at Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili and on arrival asked them 'Why are you practicing continuous standing rejecting seats experiencing fierce sharp racking pains due to exertion' When this was said the Niganthas said to me 'Friend the Nigantha Nataputta is allknowing allseeing and claims total knowledge  vision thus Whether I am walking or standing sleeping or awake knowledge  vision are continuously  continually established in me He has told us Niganthas there are evil actions that you have done in the past
Exhaust them with these painful austerities
When in the present you are restrained in body restrained in speech and restrained in mind that is the nondoing of evil action for the future
Thus with the destruction of old actions through asceticism and with the nondoing of new actions there will be no flow into the future
With no flow into the future there is the ending of action
With the ending of action the ending of stress
With the ending of stress the ending of feeling
With the ending of feeling all suffering  stress will be exhausted We approve of that prefer it and are gratified by it'
When this was said I asked them 'But friends do you know that you existed in the past and that you did not not exist'
'No friend'
'And do you know that you did evil actions in the past and that you did not not do them'
'No friend'
'And do you know that you did suchandsuch evil actions in the past'
'No friend'
'And do you know that soandso much stress has been exhausted or that soandso much stress remains to be exhausted or that with the exhaustion of soandso much stress all stress will be exhausted'
'No friend'
'But do you know what is the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities and the attainment of skillful mental qualities in the herenow'
'No friend'
'So friends it seems that you don't know that you existed in the past and that you did not not exist you don't know that you did evil actions in the past and that you did not not do them you don't know that you did suchandsuch evil actions in the past you don't know that soandso much stress has been exhausted or that soandso much stress remains to be exhausted or that with the exhaustion of soandso much stress all stress will be exhausted you don't know what is the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities and the attainment of skillful mental qualities in the herenow
That being the case those in the world who are murderers bloodyhanded doers of what is cruel when they are later reborn among human beings go forth with the Niganthas'
'But friend Gotama it's not the case that pleasure is to be attained through pleasure
Pleasure is to be attained through pain
For if pleasure were to be attained through pleasure then King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha would attain pleasure for he lives in greater pleasure than you friend Gotama'
'Surely the venerable Niganthas said that rashly and without reflecting for instead I should be asked Who lives in greater pleasure King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha or venerable Gotama'
'Yes friend Gotama we said that rashly and without reflecting but let that be
We now ask you venerable Gotama Who lives in greater pleasure King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha or venerable Gotama'
'In that case Niganthas I will question you in return
Answer as you like
What do you think Can King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha  without moving his body without uttering a word  dwell sensitive to unalloyed pleasure for seven days  nights'
'No friend
' for six days  nights for five days  nights for a day  a night'
'No friend
'Now I  without moving my body without uttering a word  can dwell sensitive to unalloyed pleasure for a day and a night for two days  nights for three four five six seven days  nights
So what do you think That being the case who dwells in greater pleasure King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha or me'
'That being the case venerable Gotama dwells in greater pleasure than King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha' That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Mahanama the Sakyan delighted in the Blessed One's words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi at Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Then early in the morning several monks put on their robes and carrying their bowls and outer robes went into Savatthi for alms
The thought occurred to them It's still too early to go into Savatthi for alms
What if we were to visit the park of the wanderers of other persuasions
So they headed to the park of the wanderers of other persuasions
On arrival they exchanged courteous greetings with the wanderers of other persuasions
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies they sat to one side
As they were sitting there the wanderers of other persuasions said to them Friends Gotama the contemplative describes the comprehension of sensuality
We too describe the comprehension of sensuality
He describes the comprehension of forms
We too describe the comprehension of forms
He describes the comprehension of feelings
We too describe the comprehension of feelings
So what is the difference what the distinction what the distinguishing factor between him and us in terms of his teaching and ours his message and ours
The monks neither delighting nor disapproving of the words of the wanderers of other persuasions got up from their seats We will learn the meaning of these words in the Blessed One's presence
Then having gone for alms in Savatthi after their meal returning from their alms round the monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they
Monks when the wanderers of other persuasions say this they are to be told 'What friends with regard to sensuality is the allure what the drawback what the escape
What with regard to forms is the allure what the drawback what the escape
What with regard to feelings is the allure what the drawback what the escape' When asked this they will not manage an answer and what is more will get themselves into trouble
Why is that
Because it lies outside their range
Monks in this world with its devas maras and brahmas in this people with its contemplatives  brahmans its royalty  commonfolk I do not see anyone who can satisfy the mind with an answer to these questions aside from a Tathagata a Tathagata's disciples or someone who has heard it from them
Now what monks is the allure of sensuality
These five strings of sensuality
Which five
Forms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
Sounds cognizable via the ear Aromas cognizable via the nose Flavors cognizable via the tongue Tactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
Now whatever pleasure or joy arises in dependence on these five strands of sensuality that is the allure of sensuality
And what is the drawback of sensuality
There is the case where on account of the occupation by which a clansman makes a living  whether checking or accounting or calculating or plowing or trading or cattletending or archery or as a king's man or whatever the occupation may be  he faces cold he faces heat being harassed by mosquitoes  flies wind  sun  creeping things dying from hunger  thirst
Now this drawback in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
If the clansman gains no wealth while thus working  striving  making effort he sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraught 'My work is in vain my efforts are fruitless' Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
If the clansman gains wealth while thus working  striving  making effort he experiences pain  distress in protecting it 'How will neither kings nor thieves make off with my property nor fire burn it nor water sweep it away nor hateful heirs make off with it' And as he thus guards and watches over his property kings or thieves make off with it or fire burns it or water sweeps it away or hateful heirs make off with it
And he sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraught 'What was mine is no more' Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
Again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source sensuality for the cause the reason being simply sensuality that kings quarrel with kings nobles with nobles brahmans with brahmans householders with householders mother with child child with mother father with child child with father brother with brother sister with sister brother with sister sister with brother friend with friend
And then in their quarrels brawls  disputes they attack one another with fists or with clods or with sticks or with knives so that they incur death or deadly pain
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
Again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that taking swords  shields and buckling on bows  quivers charge into battle massed in double array while arrows  spears are flying and swords are flashing and there they are wounded by arrows  spears and their heads are cut off by swords so that they incur death or deadly pain
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
Again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that taking swords  shields and buckling on bows  quivers charge slippery bastions while arrows  spears are flying and swords are flashing and there they are splashed with boiling cow dung and crushed under heavy weights and their heads are cut off by swords so that they incur death or deadly pain
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
Again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that break into windows seize plunder commit burglary ambush highways commit adultery and when they are captured kings have them tortured in many ways
They flog them with whips beat them with canes beat them with clubs
They cut off their hands cut off their feet cut off their hands  feet
They cut off their ears cut off their noses cut off their ears  noses
They subject them to the 'porridge pot' the 'polishedshell shave' the 'Rahu's mouth' the 'flaming garland' the 'blazing hand' the 'grassduty' the 'barkdress' the 'burning antelope' the 'meat hooks' the 'coingouging' the 'lye pickling' the 'pivot on a stake' the 'rolledup bed' They have them splashed with boiling oil devoured by dogs impaled alive on stakes
They have their heads cut off with swords so that they incur death or deadly pain
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here  now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
Again it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that engage in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct
Having engaged in bodily verbal and mental misconduct they  on the breakup of the body after death  reappear in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress in the future life has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
And what monks is the escape from sensuality
The subduing of desirepassion for sensuality the abandoning of desirepassion for sensuality That is the escape from sensuality
That any brahmans or contemplatives who do not discern as it actually is the allure of sensuality as allure the drawback of sensuality as drawback the escape from sensuality as escape would themselves comprehend sensuality or would rouse another with the truth so that in line with what he has practiced he would comprehend sensuality That is impossible
But that any brahmans or contemplatives who discern as it actually is the allure of sensuality as allure the drawback of sensuality as drawback the escape from sensuality as escape would themselves comprehend sensuality or would rouse another with the truth so that in line with what he has practiced he would comprehend sensuality That is possible
Now what monks is the allure of forms
Suppose there were a maiden of the noble caste the brahman caste or the householder class fifteen or sixteen years old neither too tall nor too short neither too thin nor too plump neither too dark nor too pale
Is her beauty  charm at that time at its height
Yes lord
Whatever pleasure  joy arise in dependence on that beauty  charm That is the allure of forms
And what is the drawback of forms
There is the case where one might see that very same woman at a later time when she's eighty ninety one hundred years old aged roofrafter crooked bentover supported by a cane palsied miserable brokentoothed grayhaired scantyhaired bald wrinkled her body all blotchy
What do you think Has her earlier beauty  charm vanished and the drawback appeared
Yes lord
This monks is the drawback of forms
Again one might see that very same woman sick in pain  seriously ill lying soiled with her own urine  excrement lifted up by others laid down by others
What do you think Has her earlier beauty  charm vanished and the drawback appeared
Yes lord
This too monks is the drawback of forms
Again one might see that very same woman as a corpse cast away in a charnel ground  one day two days three days dead bloated livid  oozing
What do you think Has her earlier beauty  charm vanished and the drawback appeared
Yes lord
This too monks is the drawback of forms
Again one might see that very same woman as a corpse cast away in a charnel ground picked at by crows vultures  hawks by dogs hyenas  various other creatures a skeleton smeared with flesh  blood connected with tendons a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood connected with tendons a skeleton without flesh or blood connected with tendons bones detached from their tendons scattered in all directions  here a hand bone there a foot bone here a shin bone there a thigh bone here a hip bone there a back bone here a rib there a breast bone here a shoulder bone there a neck bone here a jaw bone there a tooth here a skull the bones whitened somewhat like the color of shells piled up more than a year old decomposed into a powder
What do you think Has her earlier beauty  charm vanished and the drawback appeared
Yes lord
This too monks is the drawback of forms
And what monks is the escape from forms
The subduing of desirepassion for forms the abandoning of desirepassion for forms That is the escape from form
That any brahmans or contemplatives who do not discern as it actually is the allure of forms as allure the drawback of forms as drawback the escape from forms as escape would themselves comprehend form or would rouse another with the truth so that in line with what he has practiced he would comprehend form That is impossible
But that any brahmans or contemplatives who discern as it actually is the allure of forms as allure the drawback of forms as drawback the escape from forms as escape would themselves comprehend form or would rouse another with the truth so that in line with what he has practiced he would comprehend form That is possible
Now what monks is the allure of feelings
There is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
At that time he does not intend his own affliction the affliction of others or the affliction of both
He feels a feeling totally unafflicted
The unafflicted I tell you is the highest allure of feelings
Again the monk with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
At that time he does not intend his own affliction the affliction of others or the affliction of both
He feels a feeling totally unafflicted
The unafflicted I tell you is the highest allure of feelings
And what is the drawback of feelings
The fact that feeling is inconstant stressful subject to change This is the drawback of feelings
And what is the escape from feelings
The subduing of desirepassion for feelings the abandoning of desirepassion for feelings That is the escape from feelings
That any brahmans or contemplatives who do not discern as it actually is the allure of feelings as allure the drawback of feelings as drawback the escape from feelings as escape would themselves comprehend feeling or would rouse another with the truth so that in line with what he has practiced he would comprehend feeling That is impossible
But that any brahmans or contemplatives who discern as it actually is the allure of feelings as allure the drawback of feelings as drawback the escape from feelings as escape would themselves comprehend feeling or would rouse another with the truth so that in line with what he has practiced he would comprehend feeling That is possible
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks replied
The Blessed One said Monks before my selfawakening when I was still just an unawakened Bodhisatta the thought occurred to me 'Why don't I keep dividing my thinking into two sorts' So I made thinking imbued with sensuality thinking imbued with ill will  thinking imbued with harmfulness one sort and thinking imbued with renunciation thinking imbued with nonill will  thinking imbued with harmlessness another sort
And as I remained thus heedful ardent  resolute thinking imbued with sensuality arose in me
I discerned that 'Thinking imbued with sensuality has arisen in me and that leads to my own affliction or to the affliction of others or to the affliction of both
It obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to Unbinding'
As I noticed that it leads to my own affliction it subsided
As I noticed that it leads to the affliction of others to the affliction of both it obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to Unbinding it subsided
Whenever thinking imbued with sensuality had arisen I simply abandoned it dispelled it wiped it out of existence
And as I remained thus heedful ardent  resolute thinking imbued with ill will arose in me
I discerned that 'Thinking imbued with ill will has arisen in me and that leads to my own affliction or to the affliction of others or to the affliction of both
It obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to Unbinding'
As I noticed that it leads to my own affliction it subsided
As I noticed that it leads to the affliction of others to the affliction of both it obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to Unbinding it subsided
Whenever thinking imbued with ill will had arisen I simply abandoned it dispelled it wiped it out of existence
And as I remained thus heedful ardent  resolute thinking imbued with harmfulness arose in me
I discerned that 'Thinking imbued with harmfulness has arisen in me and that leads to my own affliction or to the affliction of others or to the affliction of both
It obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to Unbinding'
As I noticed that it leads to my own affliction it subsided
As I noticed that it leads to the affliction of others to the affliction of both it obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to Unbinding it subsided
Whenever thinking imbued with harmfulness had arisen I simply abandoned it dispelled it wiped it out of existence
Whatever a monk keeps pursuing with his thinking  pondering that becomes the inclination of his awareness
If a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with sensuality abandoning thinking imbued with renunciation his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with sensuality
If a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with ill will abandoning thinking imbued with nonill will his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with ill will
If a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with harmfulness abandoning thinking imbued with harmlessness his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with harmfulness
Just as in the last month of the Rains in the autumn season when the crops are ripening a cowherd would look after his cows He would tap  poke  check  curb them with a stick on this side  that
Why is that
Because he foresees flogging or imprisonment or a fine or public censure arising from that
In the same way I foresaw in unskillful qualities drawbacks degradation  defilement and I foresaw in skillful qualities rewards related to renunciation  promoting cleansing
And as I remained thus heedful ardent  resolute thinking imbued with renunciation arose in me
I discerned that 'Thinking imbued with renunciation has arisen in me and that leads neither to my own affliction nor to the affliction of others nor to the affliction of both
It fosters discernment promotes lack of vexation  leads to Unbinding
If I were to think  ponder in line with that even for a night even for a day even for a day  night I do not envision any danger that would come from it except that thinking  pondering a long time would tire the body
When the body is tired the mind is disturbed and a disturbed mind is far from concentration' So I steadied my mind right within settled unified  concentrated it
Why is that
So that my mind would not be disturbed
And as I remained thus heedful ardent  resolute thinking imbued with nonill will arose in me
I discerned that 'Thinking imbued with nonill will has arisen in me and that leads neither to my own affliction nor to the affliction of others nor to the affliction of both
It fosters discernment promotes lack of vexation  leads to Unbinding
If I were to think  ponder in line with that even for a night even for a day even for a day  night I do not envision any danger that would come from it except that thinking  pondering a long time would tire the body
When the body is tired the mind is disturbed and a disturbed mind is far from concentration' So I steadied my mind right within settled unified  concentrated it
Why is that
So that my mind would not be disturbed
And as I remained thus heedful ardent  resolute thinking imbued with harmlessness arose in me
I discerned that 'Thinking imbued with harmlessness has arisen in me and that leads neither to my own affliction nor to the affliction of others nor to the affliction of both
It fosters discernment promotes lack of vexation  leads to Unbinding
If I were to think  ponder in line with that even for a night even for a day even for a day  night I do not envision any danger that would come from it except that thinking  pondering a long time would tire the body
When the body is tired the mind is disturbed and a disturbed mind is far from concentration' So I steadied my mind right within settled unified  concentrated it
Why is that
So that my mind would not be disturbed
Whatever a monk keeps pursuing with his thinking  pondering that becomes the inclination of his awareness
If a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with renunciation abandoning thinking imbued with sensuality his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with renunciation
If a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with nonill will abandoning thinking imbued with ill will his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with nonill will
If a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with harmlessness abandoning thinking imbued with harmfulness his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with harmlessness
Just as in the last month of the hot season when all the crops have been gathered into the village a cowherd would look after his cows While resting under the shade of a tree or out in the open he simply keeps himself mindful of 'those cows' In the same way I simply kept myself mindful of 'those mental qualities'
Unflagging persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness established
My body was calm  unaroused my mind concentrated  single
Quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities I entered  remained in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations I entered  remained in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
With the fading of rapture I remained in equanimity mindful  alert and physically sensitive of pleasure
I entered  remained in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  I entered  remained in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past lives
I recollected my manifold past lives ie one birth two five ten fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many eons of cosmic contraction many eons of cosmic expansion many eons of cosmic contraction  expansion 'There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose there
There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose here' Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes  details
This was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resolute
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away  reappearance of beings
I saw  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma 'These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech  mind who reviled the Noble Ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
But these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech  mind who did not revile the Noble Ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world' Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  I saw beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma
This was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resolute
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations
I discerned as it had come to be that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations' My heart thus knowing thus seeing was released from the fermentation of sensuality released from the fermentation of becoming released from the fermentation of ignorance
With release there was the knowledge 'Released' I discerned that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
This was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resolute
Suppose monks that in a forested wilderness there were a large lowlying marsh in dependence on which there lived a large herd of deer and a certain man were to appear not desiring their benefit not desiring their welfare not desiring their rest from bondage
He would close off the safe restful path that led to their rapture and would open up a false path set out a male decoy place a female decoy and thus the large herd of deer would eventually fall into ruin disaster  decimation
Then suppose that a certain man were to appear to that same large herd of deer desiring their benefit desiring their welfare desiring their rest from bondage
He would open up the safe restful path that led to their rapture would close off the false path take away the male decoy destroy the female decoy and thus the large herd of deer would eventually come into growth increase  abundance
I have given this simile in order to convey a meaning
The meaning is this 'The large lowlying marsh' stands for sensuality
'The large herd of deer' stands for beings
'The man not desiring their benefit not desiring their welfare not desiring their rest from bondage' stands for Mara the Evil One
'The false path' stands for the eightfold wrong path ie wrong view wrong resolve wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness  wrong concentration
'The male decoy' stands for passion  delight
'The female decoy' stands for ignorance
'The man desiring their benefit desiring their welfare desiring their rest from bondage' stands for the Tathagata the Worthy One the Rightly Selfawakened One
'The safe restful path that led to their rapture' stands for the noble eightfold path ie right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness  right concentration
So monks I have opened up the safe restful path closed off the false path removed the male decoy destroyed the female
Whatever a teacher should do  seeking the welfare of his disciples out of sympathy for them  that have I done for you
Over there are the roots of trees over there empty dwellings
Practice jhana monks
Don't be heedless
Don't later fall into regret
This is our message to you
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
This discourse plays a central role in the early Buddhist analysis of conflict
As might be expected the blame for conflict lies within in the unskillful habits of the mind rather than without
The culprit in this case is a habit called papañca
Unfortunately none of the early texts give a clear definition of what the word papañca means so it's hard to find a precise English equivalent for the term
However they do give a clear analysis of how papañca arises how it leads to conflict and how it can be ended
In the final analysis these are the questions that matter  more than the precise definition of terms  so we will deal with them first before proposing a few possible translation equivalents for the word
Three passages in the discourses  DN MN and Sn
 map the causal processes that give rise to papañca and lead from papañca to conflict
Because the Buddhist analysis of causality is generally nonlinear with plenty of room for feedback loops the maps vary in some of their details
In DN the map reads like this
In Sn the map is less linear and can be diagrammed like this
perception gt the categories of papañca
perception gt name  form gt contact gt appealing  unappealing gt desire gt dearnotdear gt stinginessdivisivenessquarrelsdisputes
In MN the map is this
In this last case however the bare outline misses some of the important implications of the way this process is phrased
In the full passage the analysis starts out in an impersonal tone
Starting with feeling the notion of an agent  in this case the feeler  acting on objects is introduced
Through the process of papañca the agent then becomes a victim of hisher own patterns of thinking
What are these perceptions  categories that assail the person who papañcizes
Sn
states that the root of the categories of papañca is the perception I am the thinker From this selfreflexive thought  in which one conceives a self a thing corresponding to the concept of I  a number of categories can be derived beingnotbeing menotme minenotmine doerdoneto signifiersignified
Once one's self becomes a thing under the rubric of these categories it's impossible not to be assailed by the perceptions  categories derived from these basic distinctions
When there's the sense of identification with something that experiences then based on the feelings arising from sensory contact some feelings will seem appealing  worth getting for the self  and others will seem unappealing  worth pushing away
From this there grows desire which comes into conflict with the desires of others who are also engaging in papañca
This is how inner objectifications breed external contention
How can this process be ended
Through a shift in perception caused by the way one attends to feelings using the categories of appropriate attention
As the Buddha states in DN rather than viewing a feeling as an appealing or unappealing thing one should look at it as part of a causal process when a particular feeling is pursued do skillful or unskillful qualities increase in the mind
If skillful qualities increase the feeling may be pursued
If unskillful qualities increase it shouldn't
When comparing feelings that lead to skillful qualities notice which are more refined those accompanied with thinking and evaluation or those free of thinking and evaluation as in the higher stages of mental absorption or jhana
When seeing this there is a tendency to opt for the more refined feelings and this cuts through the act of thinking that according to MN provides the basis for papañca
In following this program the notion of agent and victim is avoided as is selfreflexive thinking in general
There is simply the analysis of causeeffect processes
One is still making use of dualities  distinguishing between unskillful and skillful  but the distinction is between processes not things
Thus one's analysis avoids the type of thinking that according to DN depends on the perceptions and categories of papañca and in this way the vicious cycle by which thinking and papañca keep feeding each other is cut
Ultimately by following this program to greater and greater levels of refinement through the higher levels of mental absorption one finds less and less to relish and enjoy in the six senses and the mental processes based on them
With this sense of disenchantment the processes of feeling and thought are stilled and there is a breakthrough to the cessation of the six sense spheres
When these spheres cease is there anything else left
Ven
Sariputta in AN warns us not to ask for to ask if there is isn't bothisandisn't neitherisnorisn't anything left in that dimension is to papañcize what is free from papañca
However this dimension is not a total annihilation of experience
It's a type of experience that DN calls consciousness without feature luminous all around where water earth fire  wind have no footing where longshort coarsefine fairfoul nameform are all brought to an end
This is the fruit of the path of arahantship  a path that makes use of dualities but leads to a fruit beyond them
It may come as cold comfort to realize that conflict can be totally overcome only with the realization of arahantship but it's important to note that by following the path recommended in DN  learning to avoid references to any notion of self and learning to view feelings not as things but as parts of a causal process affecting the qualities in the mind  the basis for papañca is gradually undercut and there are fewer and fewer occasions for conflict
In following this path one reaps its increasing benefits all along the way
Translating papañca As one writer has noted the word papañca has had a wide variety of meanings in Indian thought with only one constant in Buddhist philosophical discourse it carries negative connotations usually of falsification and distortion
The word itself is derived from a root that means diffuseness spreading proliferating
The Pali Commentaries define papañca as covering three types of thought craving conceit and views
They also note that it functions to slow the mind down in its escape from samsara
Because its categories begin with the objectifying thought I am the thinker I have chosen to render the word as objectification although some of the following alternatives might be acceptable as well selfreflexive thinking reification proliferation complication elaboration distortion
The word offers some interesting parallels to the postmodern notion of logocentric thinking but it's important to note that the Buddha's program of deconstructing this process differs sharply from that of postmodern thought
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was living among the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Park
Then in the early morning having put on his robes and carrying his bowl  outer robe he went into Kapilavatthu for alms
Having gone for alms in Kapilavatthu after the meal returning from his alms round he went to the Great Wood for the day's abiding
Plunging into the Great Wood he sat down at the root of a bilva sapling for the day's abiding
Dandapani the Sakyan out roaming  rambling for exercise also went to the Great Wood
Plunging into the Great Wood he went to where the Blessed One was under the bilva sapling
On arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he stood to one side
As he was standing there he said to the Blessed One What is the contemplative's doctrine
What does he proclaim
The sort of doctrine friend where one does not keep quarreling with anyone in the cosmos with its devas Maras  Brahmas with its contemplatives  brahmans its royalty  commonfolk the sort where perceptions no longer obsess the brahman who remains dissociated from sensuality free from perplexity his uncertainty cut away devoid of craving for becoming  non
Such is my doctrine such is what I proclaim
When this was said Dandapani the Sakyan  shaking his head wagging his tongue raising his eyebrows so that his forehead was wrinkled in three furrows  left leaning on his stick
Then when it was evening the Blessed One rose from his seclusion and went to the Banyan Park
On arrival he sat down on a seat made ready
As he was sitting there he
When this was said a certain monk said to the Blessed One Lord what sort of doctrine is it where one does not keep quarreling with anyone in the cosmos with its deities Maras  Brahmas with its contemplatives  brahmans its royalty  commonfolk where perceptions no longer obsess the brahman who remains dissociated from sensuality free from perplexity his uncertainty cut away devoid of craving for becoming  non
If monk with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions  categories of objectification assail a person there is nothing there to relish welcome or remain fastened to then that is the end of the obsessions of passion the obsessions of resistance the obsessions of views the obsessions of uncertainty the obsessions of conceit the obsessions of passion for becoming  the obsessions of ignorance
That is the end of taking up rods  bladed weapons of arguments quarrels disputes accusations divisive talebearing  false speech
That is where these evil unskillful things cease without remainder That is what the Blessed One said
Having said it the One Wellgone got up from his seat and went into his dwelling
Then not long after the Blessed One had left this thought occurred to the monks This brief statement the Blessed One made after which he went into his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning  ie 'If with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions  categories of objectification assail a person there is nothing to relish that is where these evil unskillful things cease without remainder' now who might analyze the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement Then the thought occurred to them Ven
Maha Kaccana is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his knowledgeable companions in the holy life
He is capable of analyzing the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement
Suppose we were to go to him and on arrival question him about this matter
So the monks went to Ven
Maha Kaccana and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies they sat to one side
As they were sitting there they Analyze the meaning Ven
Maha Kaccana
Friends it's as if a man needing heartwood looking for heartwood wandering in search of heartwood  passing over the root  trunk of a standing tree possessing heartwood  were to imagine that heartwood should be sought among its branches  leaves
So it is with you who  having bypassed the Blessed One when you were face to face with him the Teacher  imagine that I should be asked about this matter
For knowing the Blessed One knows seeing he sees
He is the Eye he is Knowledge he is Dhamma he is Brahma
He is the speaker the proclaimer the elucidator of meaning the giver of the Deathless the lord of the Dhamma the Tathagata
That was the time when you should have questioned him about this matter
However he answered that was how you should have remembered it
Yes friend Kaccana knowing the Blessed One knows seeing he sees
He is the Eye he is Knowledge he is Dhamma he is Brahma
He is the speaker the proclaimer the elucidator of meaning the giver of the Deathless the lord of the Dhamma the Tathagata
That was the time when we should have questioned him about this matter
However he answered that was how we should have remembered it
But you are praised by the Teacher and esteemed by your knowledgeable companions in the holy life
You are capable of analyzing the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement
Analyze the meaning Ven
Maha Kaccana without making it difficult
In that case my friends listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say friend the monks responded
Ven
Maha Kaccayana said this Friends concerning the brief statement the Blessed One made after which he went into his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning  ie 'If with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions  categories of objectification assail a person there is nothing there to relish welcome or remain fastened to then that is the end of the obsessions of passion the obsessions of resistance the obsessions of views the obsessions of uncertainty the obsessions of conceit the obsessions of passion for becoming  the obsessions of ignorance
That is the end of taking up rods  bladed weapons of arguments quarrels disputes accusations divisive talebearing  false speech
That is where these evil unskillful things cease without remainder'
Dependent on eye  forms eyeconsciousness arises
The meeting of the three is contact
With contact as a requisite condition there is feeling
What one feels one perceives
What one perceives one thinks about
What one thinks about one objectifies
Based on what a person objectifies the perceptions  categories of objectification assail himher with regard to past present  future forms cognizable via the eye
Dependent on ear  sounds earconsciousness arises
Dependent on nose  aromas noseconsciousness arises
Dependent on tongue  flavors tongueconsciousness arises
Dependent on body  tactile sensations bodyconsciousness arises
Dependent on intellect  ideas intellectconsciousness arises
The meeting of the three is contact
With contact as a requisite condition there is feeling
What one feels one perceives
What one perceives one thinks about
What one thinks about one objectifies
Based on what a person objectifies the perceptions  categories of objectification assail himher with regard to past present  future ideas cognizable via the intellect
Now when there is the eye when there are forms when there is eyeconsciousness it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of contact
When there is a delineation of contact it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of feeling
When there is a delineation of feeling it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of perception
When there is a delineation of perception it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of thinking
When there is a delineation of thinking it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of being assailed by the perceptions  categories of objectification
When there is the ear
When there is the nose
When there is the tongue
When there is the body
When there is the intellect when there are ideas when there is intellectconsciousness it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of contact
When there is a delineation of contact it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of feeling
When there is a delineation of feeling it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of perception
When there is a delineation of perception it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of thinking
When there is a delineation of thinking it is possible that one will delineate a delineation of being assailed by the perceptions  categories of objectification
Now when there is no eye when there are no forms when there is no eyeconsciousness it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of contact
When there is no delineation of contact it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of feeling
When there is no delineation of feeling it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of perception
When there is no delineation of perception it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of thinking
When there is no delineation of thinking it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of being assailed by the perceptions  categories of objectification
When there is no ear
When there is no nose
When there is no tongue
When there is no body
When there is no intellect when there are no ideas when there is no intellectconsciousness it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of contact
When there is no delineation of contact it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of feeling
When there is no delineation of feeling it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of perception
When there is no delineation of perception it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of thinking
When there is no delineation of thinking it is impossible that one will delineate a delineation of being assailed by the perceptions  categories of objectification
So concerning the brief statement the Blessed One made after which he entered his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning  ie 'If with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions  categories of objectification assail a person there is nothing there to relish welcome or remain fastened to then that is the end of the obsessions of passion the obsessions of resistance the obsessions of views the obsessions of uncertainty the obsessions of conceit the obsessions of passion for becoming  the obsessions of ignorance
That is the end of taking up rods  bladed weapons of arguments quarrels disputes accusations divisive talebearing  false speech
That is where these evil unskillful things cease without remainder'  this is how I understand the detailed meaning
Now friends if you wish having gone to the Blessed One question him about this matter
However he answers is how you should remember it
Then the monks delighting in  approving of Ven
Maha Kaccana's words got up from their seats and went to the Blessed One
On arrival having bowed down to him they sat to one side
As they were sitting there they Then Ven
Maha Kaccana analyzed the meaning using these words statements  phrases
Maha Kaccana is wise monks
He is a person of great discernment
If you had asked me about this matter I too would have answered in the same way he did
That is its meaning and that is how you should remember it
When this was said Ven
Ananda said to the Blessed One Lord it's as if a man  overcome with hunger weakness  thirst  were to come across a ball of honey
Wherever he were to taste it he would experience a sweet delectable flavor
In the same way wherever a monk of capable awareness might investigate the meaning of this Dhamma discourse with his discernment he would experience gratification he would experience confidence
What is the name of this Dhamma discourse
Then Ananda you can remember this Dhamma discourse as the 'Ball of Honey Discourse' That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Ven
Ananda delighted in the Blessed One's words
Thus have I heard
Once the Blessed One lived at Saavatthii in Jeta's Grove in Anaathapindika's monastery
Now on that occasion a monk called Arittha formerly of the vulture killers had conceived this pernicious view There are things called 'obstructions' by the Blessed One
As I understand his teaching those things are not necessarily obstructive for one who pursues them
Several monks hearing about it went to the monk Arittha formerly of the vulture killers and asked him Is it true friend Arittha that you have conceived this pernicious view There are things called by the Blessed One
As I understand his teaching those things are not necessarily obstructive for one who pursues them'
Yes indeed friends
Then those monks wishing to dissuade Arittha from that pernicious view urged admonished questioned and exhorted him thus Do not say so friend Arittha do not say so
Do not misrepresent the Blessed One
It is not right to misrepresent him
Never would the Blessed One speak like that
For in many ways indeed has the Blessed One said of those obstructive things that they are obstructions indeed and that they necessarily obstruct him who pursues them
Sense desires so he has said bring little enjoyment and much suffering and disappointment
The perils in them are greater
Sense desires are like bare bones has the Blessed One said they are like a lump of flesh like a torch of straw like a pit of burning coals like a dream like borrowed goods like a fruitbearing tree like a slaughter house like a stake of swords like a snake's head are sense desires has the Blessed One said
They bring little enjoyment and much suffering and disappointment
The perils in them are greater
Yet though the monk Arittha was thus urged admonished questioned and exhorted by those monks he still clung tenaciously and obstinately to his pernicious view saying There are things called 'obstructions' by the Blessed One
As I understand his teaching those things are not necessarily obstructive for one who pursues them
When those monks could not dissuade the monk Arittha formerly of the vulture killers from his pernicious view they went to the Blessed One and after respectfully saluting him they sat down at one side
Being seated they told the Blessed One and they said Since O Lord we could not dissuade the monk Arittha from his pernicious view we have now reported this matter to the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One addressed a certain monk thus Go O monk and tell the monk Arittha formerly of the vulture killers that the Master calls him  Yes Lord replied the monk
He went to the monk Arittha and spoke to him The Master calls you friend Arittha  Yes friend replied Arittha and he went to meet the Blessed One
Having arrived he saluted the Blessed One respectfully and sat down at one side
When he was seated the Blessed One addressed him thus
Is it true Arittha that you have conceived this pernicious view 'There are things called obstructions by the Blessed One
As I understand his teaching those things are not necessarily obstructive for him who pursues them'  Yes indeed Lord I understand the teaching of the Blessed One in this way that those things called 'obstructions' by the Blessed One are not necessarily obstructive for him who pursues them
Of whom do you know foolish man that I have taught to him the teaching in that manner
Did I not foolish man speak in many ways of those obstructive things that they are obstructions indeed and that they necessarily obstruct him who pursues them
Sense desires so I have said bring little enjoyment and much suffering and disappointment
The perils in them are greater
Sense desires are like bare bones have I said they are like a lump of flesh they are like a snake's head have I said
They bring much suffering and disappointment
The perils in them are greater
But you O foolish man have misrepresented us by what you personally have wrongly grasped
You have undermined your own and have created much demerit
This foolish man will bring you much harm and suffering for a long time
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks thus What do you think O monks has that monk Arittha formerly of the vulture killers produced any spark in this teaching and discipline  How should that be Lord
Certainly not O Lord
After these words the monk Arittha formerly of the vulture killers sat silent confused with his shoulders drooping and his head bent brooding and incapable of making a rejoinder
Then the Blessed One knowing spoke to him You will be known foolish man by what is your own pernicious view I shall now question the monks about this
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks Do you O monks also understand the teaching proclaimed by me in the same manner as this monk Arittha does who misrepresents us by what he personally has wrongly grasped who has undermined his own and created much demerit
Certainly not Lord
For in many ways has the Blessed One told us of those obstructive things that they are obstructions indeed and that they necessarily obstruct him who pursues them Good monks
It is good that you thus understand the teaching proclaimed by me
For in many ways have I spoken of those obstructive things that they are obstructions indeed and that they necessarily obstruct him who pursues them
Sense desires so have I said bring little enjoyment and much suffering and disappointment
The perils in them are greater
Sense desires are like bare bones have I said they are like a lump of flesh like a torch of straw like a pit of burning coals like a dream like borrowed goods like a fruitbearing tree like a slaughterhouse like a stake of swords like a snake's head are sense desires have I said
They bring much suffering and disappointment
The perils in them are greater
But this monk Arittha formerly of the vulture killers misrepresents us by what he personally has wrongly grasped he undermines his own and creates much demerit
This will bring to this foolish man much harm and suffering for a long time
Monks it is impossible indeed that one can pursue sense gratification without sensual desire without perceptions of sensual desire without thoughts of sensual desire
There are here O monks some foolish men who study the Teaching having studied it they do not wisely examine the purpose of those teachings
To those who do not wisely examine the purpose these teachings will not yield insight
They study the Teaching only to use it for criticizing or for refuting others in disputation
They do not experience the purpose for which they study the Teaching
To them these teachings wrongly grasped will bring harm and suffering for a long time
And why
Because of their wrong grasp of the teachings
Suppose monks a man wants a snake looks for a snake goes in search of a snake
He then sees a large snake and when he is grasping its body or its tail the snake turns back on him and bites his hand or arm or some other limb of his
And because of that he suffers death or deadly pain
And why
Because of his wrong grasp of the snake
Similarly O monks there are here some foolish men who study the Teaching having studied it they do not wisely examine the purpose of those teachings
To those who do not wisely examine the purpose these teachings will not yield insight
They study the Teaching only to use it for criticizing or for refuting others in disputation
They do not experience the purpose for which they study the Teaching
To them these teachings wrongly grasped will bring harm and suffering for a long time
And why
Because of their wrong grasp of the teachings
But there are here O monks some noble sons who study the Teaching and having studied it they examine wisely the purpose of those teachings
To those who wisely examine the purpose these teachings will yield insight
They do not study the Teaching for the sake of criticizing nor for refuting others in disputation
They experience the purpose for which they study the Teaching and to them these teachings being rightly grasped will bring welfare and happiness for a long time
And why
Because of their right grasp of the teachings
Suppose monks a man wants a snake looks for a snake goes in search of a snake
He then sees a large snake and with a forked stick he holds it firmly down
Having done so he catches it firmly by the neck
Then although the snake might entwine with its body that man's hand or arm or some other limb of his still he does not on that account suffer death or deadly pain
And why not
Because of his right grasp of the snake
Similarly O monks there are here some noble sons who study the Teaching and having learned it they examine wisely the purpose of those teachings
To those who wisely examine the purpose these teachings will yield insight
They do not study the Teaching for the sake of criticizing nor for refuting others in disputation
They experience the purpose for which they study the Teaching and to them these teachings being rightly grasped will bring welfare and happiness for a long time
And why
Because of their right grasp of the teachings
Therefore O monks if you know the purpose of what I have said you should keep it in mind accordingly
But if you do not know the purpose of what I have said you should question me about it or else those monks who are wise
I shall show you monks the Teaching's similitude to a raft as having the purpose of crossing over not the purpose of being clung to
Listen monks and heed well what I shall say  Yes Lord replied the monks
and the Blessed One spoke thus
Suppose monks there is a man journeying on a road and he sees a vast expanse of water of which this shore is perilous and fearful while the other shore is safe and free from danger
But there is no boat for crossing nor is there a bridge for going over from this side to the other
So the man thinks 'This is a vast expanse of water and this shore is perilous and fearful but the other shore is safe and free from danger
There is however no boat here for crossing nor a bridge for going over from this side to the other
Suppose I gather reeds sticks branches and foliage and bind them into a raft' Now that man collects reeds sticks branches and foliage and binds them into a raft
Carried by that raft laboring with hands and feet he safely crosses over to the other shore
Having crossed and arrived at the other shore he thinks 'This raft indeed has been very helpful to me
Carried by it laboring with hands and feet I got safely across to the other shore
Should I not lift this raft on my head or put it on my shoulders and go where I like'
What do you think about it O monks
Will this man by acting thus do what should be done with a raft  No Lord  How then monks would he be doing what ought to be done with a raft
Here monks having got across and arrived at the other shore the man thinks 'This raft indeed has been very helpful to me
Carried by it and laboring with hands and feet I got safely across to the other shore
Should I not pull it up now to the dry land or let it float in the water and then go as I please' By acting thus monks would that man do what should be done with a raft
In the same way monks have I shown to you the Teaching's similitude to a raft as having the purpose of crossing over not the purpose of being clung to
You O monks who understand the Teaching's similitude to a raft you should let go even teachings how much more false ones
There are monks these six grounds for false views
What are the six
There is here monks an uninstructed worldling who has no regard for Noble Ones who is ignorant of their teaching and untrained in it who has no regard for men of worth who is ignorant of their teaching and untrained in it he considers corporeality thus 'This is mine this I am this is my self' he considers feeling perception mental formations thus 'This is mine this I am this is my self' and what is seen heard sensed and thought what is encountered sought pursued in mind this also he considers thus 'This is mine this I am this is my self' and also this ground for views 'The universe is the Self
That I shall be after death permanent stable eternal immutable eternally the same shall I abide in that very condition'  that too he considers thus 'This is mine this I am this is my self'
But monks there is here a wellinstructed noble disciple who has regard for Noble Ones who knows their teaching and is well trained in it who has regard for men of worth who knows their teaching and is well trained in it he does not consider corporeality in this way 'This is mine this I am this is my self' he does not consider feeling perception mental formations in this way 'This is mine this I am this is my self' and what is seen heard sensed and thought what is encountered sought pursued in mind this also he does not consider in this way 'This is mine this I am this is my self' and also this ground for views 'The universe is the Self
That I shall be after death permanent stable eternal immutable eternally the same shall I abide in that very condition'  that too he does not consider thus 'This is mine this I am this is my self'
Considering thus he is not anxious about unrealities
When this was said a certain monk asked the Blessed One
Lord can there be anxiety about unrealities in the external
There can be O monk said the Blessed One
In that case monk someone thinks 'Oh I had it
That alas I have no longer
Oh may I have it again
But alas I do not get it' Hence he grieves is depressed and laments beating his breast he weeps and dejection befalls him
Thus monk is there anxiety about unrealities in the external
But Lord can there be absence of anxiety about unrealities in the external
There can be O monk said the Blessed One
In that case monk someone does not think thus 'Oh I had it
That alas I have no longer
Oh may I have it again
But alas I do not get it' Hence he does not grieve is not depressed does not lament he does not beat his breast nor does he weep and no dejection befalls him
Thus monk is there absence of anxiety about unrealities in the external
Lord can there be anxiety about unrealities in the internal
There can be monk said the Blessed One
In that case monk someone has this view 'The universe is the Self
That I shall be after death permanent stable eternal immutable eternally the same shall I abide in that very condition' He then hears a Perfect One expounding the Teaching for the removal of all grounds for views of all prejudices obsessions dogmas and biases for the stilling of all processes for the relinquishment of all substrata for the extirpation of craving for dispassion cessation Nibbaana
He then thinks 'I shall be annihilated I shall be destroyed
No longer shall I exist' Hence he grieves is depressed and laments beating his breast he weeps and dejection befalls him
Thus monk is there anxiety about unrealities in the internal
But Lord can there be absence of anxiety about unrealities in the internal
There can be monk said the Blessed One
In that case monk someone does not have this view 'The universe is the Self eternally the same shall I abide in that very condition' He then hears a Perfect One expounding the Teaching for the removal of all grounds for views of all prejudices obsessions dogmas and biases for the stilling of all processes for the relinquishing of all substrata for the extirpation of craving for dispassion cessation Nibbaana
He then does not think 'I shall be annihilated I shall be destroyed
No longer shall I exist' Hence he does not grieve is not depressed does not lament he does not beat his breast nor does he weep and no dejection befalls him
Thus monk is there absence of anxiety about unrealities in the internal
You may well take hold of a possession O monks that is permanent stable eternal immutable that abides eternally the same in its very condition
do you see monks any such possession  No Lord  Well monks I too do not see any such possession that is permanent stable eternal immutable that abides eternally the same in its very condition
You may well accept monks the assumption of a selftheory from the acceptance of which there would not arise sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair
do you see monks any such assumption of a selftheory  No Lord  Well monks I too do not see any such assumption of a selftheory from the acceptance of which there would not arise sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair
You may well rely monks on any supporting for views from the reliance on which there would not arise sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair
do you see monks any such supporting for views  No Lord  Well monks I too do not see any such supporting for views from the reliance on which there would not arise sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair
If there were a self monks would there be my self's property  So it is Lord  Or if there is a self's property would there by my self  So it is Lord  Since in truth and in fact self and self's property do not obtain O monks then this ground for views 'The universe is the Self
That I shall be after death permanent stable eternal immutable eternally the same shall I abide in that very condition'  is it not monks an entirely and perfectly foolish idea  What else should it be Lord
It is an entirely and perfectly foolish idea
What do you think monks is corporeality permanent or impermanent  Impermanent Lord  And what is impermanent is it painful or pleasant  Painful Lord  What is impermanent painful subject to change is it fit to be considered thus 'This is mine this I am this is my self'  Certainly not Lord  What do you think monks Is feeling is perception are mental formations is consciousness permanent or impermanent  Impermanent Lord  And what is impermanent is it painful or pleasant  Painful Lord  And what is impermanent painful subject to change is it fit to be considered thus 'This is mine this I am this is my self  Certainly not Lord
Therefore monks whatever corporeality whether past future or present in oneself or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near  all corporeality should with right wisdom thus be seen as it is 'This is not mine this I am not this is not my self'
Whatever feeling whatever perception whatever mental formations whatever consciousness whether past future or present in oneself or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near  all consciousness should with right wisdom thus be seen as it is 'This is not mine this I am not this is not my self'
Seeing this monks the wellinstructed noble disciple becomes disgusted with corporeality becomes disgusted with feeling with perception with mental formations with consciousness
Through his being disgusted his passion fades away
His passion having faded he is freed
In him who is freed there is the knowledge of freedom Ceased has rebirth fulfilled is the holy life the task is done there is no more of this to come thus he knows
This monk is called one who has removed the crossbar has filled the moat has broken the pillar has unbolted a Noble One who has taken down the flag put down the burden become unfettered
And how monks is that monk one who has removed the crossbar
Herein the monk has abandoned ignorance has cut it off at the root removed it from its soil like a palmyra tree brought it to utter extinction incapable of arising again
Thus has he removed the crossbar
And how monks is that monk one who has filled the moat
Herein the monk has abandoned the round of rebirths leading to renewed existence he has cut it off at the root removed it from its soil like a palmyra tree brought it to utter extinction incapable of arising again
And how has he broken the pillar
He has abandoned craving has cut it off at the root removed it from its soil like a palmyra tree brought it to utter extinction incapable of arising again
And how has he unbolted
He has abandoned the five lower fetters has cut them off at the root removed them from their soil like a palmyra tree brought them to utter extinction incapable of arising again
And how is the monk a Noble One who has taken down the flag put down the burden become unfettered
He has abandoned the conceit of self has cut it off at the root removed it from is soil like a palmyra tree brought it to utter extinction incapable of arising again
Thus is the monk a Noble One who has taken down the flag put down the burden become unfettered
When a monk's mind is thus freed O monks neither the gods with Indra nor the gods with Brahma nor the gods with the Lord of Creatures when searching will find on what the consciousness of one thus gone is based
Why is that
One who has thus gone is no longer traceable here and now so I say
So teaching so proclaiming O monks I have been baselessly vainly falsely and wrongly accused by some ascetics and brahmans 'A nihilist is the ascetic Gotama He teaches the annihilation the destruction the nonbeing of an existing individual'
As I am not as I do not teach so have I been baselessly vainly falsely and wrongly accused by some ascetics and brahmans thus 'A nihilist is the ascetic Gotama He teaches the annihilation the destruction the nonbeing of an existing individual'
What I teach now as before O monks is suffering and the cessation of suffering
If for that others revile abuse scold and insult the Perfect One on that account O monks the Perfect One will not feel annoyance nor dejection nor displeasure in his heart
And if for that others respect revere honor and venerate the Perfect One on that account the Perfect One will not feel delight nor joy nor elation in his heart
If for that others respect revere honor and venerate the Perfect One He will think 'It is towards this which was formerly fully comprehended that they perform such acts'
Therefore O monks if you too are reviled abused scolded and insulted by others you should on that account not entertain annoyance nor dejection nor displeasure in your hearts
And if others respect revere honor and venerate you on that account you should not entertain delight nor joy nor elation in your hearts
If others respect revere honor and venerate you you should think 'It is towards this which was formerly comprehended that they perform such acts'
Therefore monks give up whatever is not yours
Your giving it up will for a long time bring you welfare and happiness
What is it that is not yours
Corporeality is not yours
Give it up
Your giving it up will for a long time bring you welfare and happiness
Feeling is not yours
Give it up
Your giving it up will for a long bring you welfare and happiness
Perception is not yours
Give it up
Your giving it up will for a long time bring you welfare and happiness
Mental formations are not yours
Give them up
Your giving them up will for a long time bring you welfare and happiness
Consciousness is not yours
Give it up
Your giving it up will for a long time bring you welfare and happiness
What do you think monks if people were to carry away the grass sticks branches and leaves in this Jeta Grove or burnt them or did with them what they pleased would you think These people carry us away or burn us or do with us as they please  No Lord  Why not Because Lord that is neither our self nor the property of our self  So too monks give up what is not yours
Your giving it up will for a long time bring you welfare and happiness
What is it that is not yours
Corporeality feeling perception mental formations consciousness are not yours
Give them up
Your giving them up will for a long time bring you welfare and happiness
Monks this Teaching so well proclaimed by me is plain open explicit free of patchwork
In this Teaching that is so well proclaimed by me and is plain open explicit and free of patchwork for those who are arahants free of taints who have accomplished and completed their task have laid down the burden achieved their aim severed the fetters binding to existence who are liberated by full knowledge there is no round of existence that can be ascribed to them
Monks in this Teaching that is so well proclaimed by me and is plain open explicit and free of patchwork those monks who have abandoned the five lower fetters will all be reborn spontaneously and there they will pass away finally no more returning from that world
Monks in this Teaching that is so well proclaimed by me and is plain open explicit and free of patchwork those monks who have abandoned three fetters and have reduced greed hatred and delusion are all oncereturners and returning only once to this world will then make an end of suffering
Monks in this Teaching that is so well proclaimed by me and is plain open explicit and free of patchwork those monks who have abandoned three fetters are all streamenterers no more liable to downfall assured and headed for full Enlightenment
Monks in this Teaching that is so well proclaimed by me and is plain open explicit and free of patchwork those monks who are mature in Dhamma mature in faith are all headed for full Enlightenment
Monks in this Teaching that is so well proclaimed by me and is plain open explicit and free of patchwork those who have simply faith in me simply love for me are all destined for heaven
This said the Blessed One
Satisfied the monks rejoiced in the words of the Blessed One
Things called obstructions
Comy gives here a list of ideas and actions that obstruct either heavenly rebirth or final deliverance or both
Arittha so says Comy being a learned exponent of the Teaching was quite familiar with most of these obstructions but being unfamiliar with the Code of Discipline he conceived the view that sex indulgence was not necessarily an obstruction for a monk
Arittha is said to have used a rather sophistic argument saying If some of the five sense enjoyments are permissible even for lay adherents who are streamenterers etc why is an exception made as to the visible shape voice touch etc of women According to Comy Arittha goes so far as to charge the Buddha with exaggerating the importance of the first grave offence for a monk saying that the emphasis given to it is like the effort of one who tries to chain the ocean
The similes about sensedesires given in the following section of the discourse seem to support the commentarial reference to sexual intercourse
The similes about sensedesires
Of the ten similes the first seven were explained in detail in the Potaliya Sutta
A summary of these explanations follows here and after each of these and also for the remaining three similes and expansion is given of the oneword explanation found in the Comy to our present text
Bare bones fleshless bloodsmeared are thrown to a starving dog but cannot satisfy the animal's hunger
Similarly sensedesires give no lasting satisfaction
A lump of flesh for which birds of prey fight each other if the bird that has seized the lump of flesh does not yield it it may meet death or deadly pain from the beaks and claws of the other birds
Similarly the sensedesires are common to many ie the same sense objects may be claimed by many and may become the cause of deadly conflict
A torch of straw carried against the wind may cause severe burns to the careless man if not quickly discarded
Similarly sensedesires will severely burn ie greatly harm him who thoughtlessly and unaware of the great danger partakes of them in the belief that they will bring light and joy to his life
A pit of burning coals towards which a man is dragged by others if he cannot free himself from the grip he will be thrown into the fire and consumed by it
Similarly sensedesires are like a vast conflagration into which the victim is dragged by bad company or by his own deeds causing his rebirth in miserable states of woe
A dream of a beautiful landscape that vanishes on awakening
Similarly sensedesires are a brief illusion like a dream and disappointing after one awakens from infatuation to reality
Borrowed goods on which the borrower foolishly prides himself in public but which are withdrawn by the owners when they see the boastful man
Similarly sensedesires are temporary and not a true and lasting possession of him who enjoys them filled with vain glory
A fruit tree climbed by one who craves for the fruits but another man likewise greedy for them but unable to climb chooses another method and fells the tree and unless the first man quickly descends he will break his limbs
Similarly in the blind pursuit of sense pleasures one may break all one's limbs may suffer severe injury of body and mind
The SubComy refers also to punishment and torture incurred by reckless deeds to which people are driven by sense infatuation
A slaughter house because sensedesires are like a butcher's block
This may mean that sensedesires kill much that is noble in man and cut off his higher development
A stake of swords sensedesires are piercing penetrating deep within causing wounds where there had been none
Unfulfilled or frustrated desire or the pains of jealousy are indeed like that ancient torture of the state of swords
A snake's head sensedesires are a grave risk and peril for the present and future welfare if one walks unwarily
Dhammaa na ni jjhaanam khamanti
Comy The teachings do not become clear do not come into the range so that one cannot discern whether in the respective place of the exposition morality is spoken of or concentration insight the paths the fruits the round of existence or its ending
SubComy That is once cannot understand that the purpose of morality is the attaining of concentration the purpose of concentration the winning of insight etc
Nijjhaana has here the meaning of insight or comprehension
This phrase appears with the same meaning and in the same context in the Kiitaagiri Sutta and the Cankii Sutta that is likewise preceded by an examination of purpose Also SN
confirms our rendering Yassa khobhikkhave imedhammaa evam paññaaya mattaso nijjhaanam khamanti ayam vuccati dhammaanusaarii
The three ways of studying the teaching
Comy They the noble sons study the Teaching for the sake of crossing
There are to wit three manners of studying the Teaching studying it in the manner of the Snakesimile studying it for the sake of crossing over and studying in a treasurer's position
He who studies the Buddha's word for getting robes and other requisites or for becoming widely known that is he who learns for the sake of fame and gain his study is that of the Snakesimile but better than such a study would be for him to sleep and not to study at all
But there is one who studies the Buddha's word and when morality is the subject he fulfills morality when concentration is the subject he lets it take deep root when insight is the subject he establishes himself well in insight when the paths and fruitions are the subject he studies with the intention I shall develop the path I shall realize the fruition Only the studying of such a one is studying for the sake of crossing over
But the studying by one who has extinguished the taints is studying in the Treasurer's position For him indeed there remains nothing unpenetrated nothing unrelinquished nothing undeveloped and nothing unrealized
He is one who has penetrated the aggregates of existence who has relinquished the defilements developed the path and realized the fruition
Hence in studying the Buddha's Word he studies it as a keeper of the scriptures as a guardian of the tradition as a preserver of the continuity
Thus his study is like a treasurer
Now when those proficient in the books cannot live at one place being afraid of starvation etc if there is one who while himself going the alms round with very great fatigue as an unliberated worlding takes up studies with the thought 'Lest the exceedingly sweet Buddhaword may perish I shall keep the scriptures shall preserve the continuity and guard the tradition' in that case is his study of the Treasurer's type or is it not
 It is not
And why not
Because his study is not applied to his own situation cross over
An unliberated worldling's study will either be of the type of the Snakesimile or for the sake of crossing over while for the seven who have entered the higher training the study is only for the sake of crossing over for the saint it is only of the Treasurer's type
Grounds for false views
Comy By the words There are monks these six grounds for false views the Master wishes to show this He who takes the five aggregates of existence as 'I' and 'Mine' by way of a threefold wrong grasp he flings mud and refuse into my dispensation like this Arittha
Comy and SubComy False views themselves are grounds for subsequently arising false views like personality belief eternalism etc
Further the grounds are the subjectmatter of the views ie the five aggregates the visual objects etc
Finally they are also the conditioning factors of the false views eg ignorance senseimpression perceptions and thoughts unwisely directed attention bad company others' speech etc
These with the aggregates as the first are the eight grounds for false views as mentioned in the Patisambhidaa Magga
The term ditthitthaana also occurs in the Brahmajaala Sutta and in the commentary to it
Encountered after having been sought for or not sought for sought encountered or not encountered mentally pursued resorted to by consciousness  what was encountered or not encountered without being sought for
The terms thought encountered etc refer to the fifth aggregate ie consciousness which was not mentioned in the first part of 
The universe is the Self lit This the world this the self
That in fact an identification of the two terms is intended here will be shown in the following comments
The best explanation of the passage is furnished in the Brahmajaala Sutta where a similar phraseology is used There are monks some ascetics and brahmans who are eternalists and who proclaim self and world to be eternal subsequently the theorist is introduced as stating his view in similar terms Eternal are self and world they exist as eternally the same
The last term appears likewise in our text see Note
From this we may safely conclude that it is the identity or unity of the Self with the universe which is conveyed by our text
In the Commentary specific to our text this eternalistic view is rendered and classified in the terminology of the Dhamma
The Commentary says
This statement refers to the view 'He considers corporeality etc as the self' The canonical quotation included here in the Commentary has two implications which are of importance for understanding the reason why it was cited in this context
As very often in the commentaries the term world is explained as truly referring to the five aggregates singly or in toto
This quotation is the formula for the first of the twenty types of personalitybelief
In the first five of these twenty the self is said to be identical with each of the five aggregates
Hence the application of this quote to our textual passage signifies that the theorist conceives the world as identical with the self
The double So so  in our text should therefore be taken as standing for yo so lit what is the world that is the self
In the Comy to MN we find a similar phrase Someone considers corporeality as self what is corporeality that is 'I' what is 'I' that is corporeality
Thus he considers corporeality and self as nondual' According to this interpretation the phrase has been translated here by This universe is the Self
Mostly the first five types of personalitybelief are explained as referring to the wrong view of annihilationism

But their being quoted in our context shows that they may also apply to eternalism
We have come to this conclusion since it is improbable that in our textual passage two mutually exclusive views should have been combined in a single statement formulating the sixth ground for false views that is in the first part of that statement annihilationism and in the second eternalism
Eternally the same an Upanishadic term see BrhadaranyakaUpanisad saasvatiih samaah
This entire statement of the sixth 'ground for views' may well have been the original creed of an eternalistic doctrine
The phrasing appears rather vague in the first part and in general it is rather loosely worded
To contemporaries however the meaning may have been quite clear since it was perhaps the stock formula for teachings that were well known
Hence in this translation we have left the first part of the statement in its rather cryptic and ambiguous original form while giving the interpretations in the notes only
He is not anxious about unrealities or about the nonexisting
The verb paritassati has according to Comy the twofold connotation of fear and craving
Hence this passage may also be rendered he has no fears nor cravings concerning the nonexistent Comy and SubComy to the Brahmaajala Sutta have a long disquisition about the corresponding noun paritassana occurring also in MN SN SN SN and SN
Comy By showing herewith the taintfree saint who has no anxiety at the destruction of his own aggregates the Blessed One concludes his exposition
Attavaadupaadaanam upadiyetha
While in most translations the term upaadaana has been rendered by clinging we have followed here a suggestion of the late Bhikkhu anamoli rendering it by assumption
In this context the word assumption should be understood in the sense of a supposition in the literal sense of its Latin source adsumere to take up which closely parallels the derivation of our Paali term upaaadaana taking up strongly In this sense we have used it when translating the derivative verb upaadiyetha by you may accept Attavaadupaadaana is one of the four types of clinging conditioned by craving
This term comprises according to Comy the twenty types of personalitybelief
Quoting this passage of our text the Ven
Dr
Walpola Rahula remarks If there had been any soultheory which the Buddha had accepted he would certainly have explained it here because he asked the monks to accept that soultheory which did not produce suffering
But in the Buddha's view there is no such soultheory
Ditthinissayam nissayetha
Nissaya lit support basis
Comy explains this phrase as the sixtytwo false views headed by personalitybelief
They form the theoretical or ideological basis or support for the various creeds and speculative doctrines derived from them
SubComy The view itself is a support for views because for one with incorrect conceptions the view will serve as a prop for his firm adherence to and the propagation of his ideas Alternative renderings You may well place reliance on a view or may derive conviction from it
See Satipatthaana Sutta where in explanation of anissito the Comy mentions tanhaanissaya and ditthinissaya dependence on craving and views
The two supplementary statements in this section suggest the following implications The concepts of I and Mine are inseparably linked so also in philosophical terms are substance and attribute
If there is personalitybelief or selftheory there will be necessarily acquisitiveness or possessiveness in some form or other at least these views themselves will be held with strong tenacity and be regarded as an inalienable property
There is no pure abstract self or substance without its determination property or attribute
On the other hand acquisitiveness and possessiveness  even if of a quite unphilosophical character  cannot be without at least a tacit assumption of a proprietary self this applies also to materialistic doctrines
Since in truth and fact neither an abiding property can be established nor an abiding self either of these terms is left without its essential referent
Hence the conception of individual immortality as formulated in the sixth ground for views is found to be devoid of any basis and is therefore rejected by the Buddha as a fool's doctrine being outside of serious consideration
Comy Here a twofold voidness is shown that of self and of property belonging to a self
This section appears also in the Anguttara Nikaaya The Fives No
and
Comy explains the metaphorical expressions as follows
There are two cities one is a city of brigands the other a city of peace
Now to a great warrior of the city of peace the following thought occurs 'As long as this city of brigands exists we shall never be free from danger' So he dons his armor and goes to the city of brigands
With his sword he breaks the gate pillar together with the door wings he removes the bolt lifts the crossbar fills in the moat and lowers the flag
Such a saint has put down for good the burden of the five aggregates of kammaproducing volitions and of the defilements has fully liberated himself from the round of existence
Comy Formerly that is when still in the environ of the Bodhi tree before turning the Wheel of the Dhamma and also from the time of turning the Wheel when teaching Dhamma it was only the Four Truths that I proclaimed In our sentence the term 'suffering' includes also its roots the origination and the term 'cessation' also the path that leads to the cessation
SubComy There is no teaching of the Master that is unrelated to the Four Truths
By saying 'What I teach now as before is suffering and the cessation of suffering' the Blessed One indicates this 'Never do I teach a self that is annihilated or destroyed nor do I teach that there is any kind of self'
Free of patchwork lit devoid of the nature of a patched cloth
Comy Pilotika is a torn rag cloth patched up with stitches and knots which are similar to hypocrisy and other deceptions
SubComy substituting assumed attitudes for an actually in that individual nonexisting practice of meditation and insight
Pilotika means also refuse referring to false and unworthy monks who do not have any footing in the Buddha's dispensation
This phrase chinnapilotika seems however to point to the inner consistency of the Teaching which like a new cloth is of one piece and is not in need of patching up contradictions by artificial attempts of reconciling inconsistencies
Hence the term may freely be rendered by the single word consistent
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Vesali in the grove outside the city to the west
Now on that occasion Sunakkhatta son of the Licchavis had recently left this Dhamma and Discipline
He was making this statement before the Vesali assembly The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones
The recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him and when he teaches the Dhamma to anyone it leads him when he practices it to the complete destruction of suffering
Then when it was morning the Venerable Sariputta dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Vesali for alms
Then he heard Sunakkhatta son of the Licchavis making this statement before the Vesali assembly
When he had wandered for alms in Vesali and had returned from his almsround after his meal he went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one side and told the Blessed One what Sunakkhatta was saying
Sariputta the misguided man Sunakkhatta is angry and his words are spoken out of anger
Thinking to discredit the Tathagata he actually praises him for it is a praise of the Tathagata to say of him 'When he teaches the Dhamma to anyone it leads him when he practices it to the complete destruction of suffering'
Sariputta this misguided man Sunakkhatta will never infer of me according to Dhamma 'That Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessed'
And he will never infer of me according to Dhamma 'That Blessed One enjoys the various kinds of supernormal power having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one he appears and vanishes he goes unhindered through a wall through an enclosure through a mountain as though through space he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water he walks on water without sinking as though it were earth seated crosslegged he travels in space like a bird with his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so powerful and mighty he wields bodily mastery even as far as the Brahmaworld'
And he will never infer of me according to Dhamma 'With the divine ear element which is purified and surpasses the human that Blessed One hears both kinds of sounds the heavenly and the human those that are far as well as near'
And he will never infer of me according to Dhamma 'That Blessed One encompasses with his own mind the minds of other beings other persons
He understands a mind affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust he understands a mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate he understands a mind affected by delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion he understands a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted he understands an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted he understands a surpassed mind as surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed he understands a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated he understands a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated'
Sariputta the Tathagata has these ten Tathagata's powers possessing which he claims the herdleader's place roars his lion's roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahma
What are the ten
Here the Tathagata understands as it actually is the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible
And that is a Tathagata's power that the Tathagata has by virtue of which he claims the herdleader's place roars his lion's roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahma
Again the Tathagata understands as it actually is the results of actions undertaken past future and present with possibilities and with causes
That too is a Tathagata's power
Again the Tathagata understands as it actually is the ways leading to all destinations
That too is a Tathagata's power
Again the Tathagata understands as it actually is the world with its many and different elements
That too is a Tathagata's power
Again the Tathagata understands as it actually is how beings have different inclinations
That too is a Tathagata's power
Again the Tathagata understands as it actually is the disposition of the faculties of other beings other persons
That too is a Tathagata's power
Again the Tathagata understands as it actually is the defilement the cleansing and the emergence in regard to the jhanas liberations concentrations and attainments
That too is a Tathagata's power
Again the Tathagata recollects his manifold past lives that is one birth two births three births four births five births ten births twenty births thirty births forty births fifty births a hundred births a thousand births a hundred thousand births many aeons of worldcontraction many aeons of worldexpansion many aeons of worldcontraction and expansion 'There I was so named of such a clan with such an appearance such was my nutriment such my experience of pleasure and pain such my lifeterm and passing away from there I reappeared elsewhere and there too I was so named of such a clan with such an appearance such was my nutriment such my experience of pleasure and pain such my lifeterm and passing away from there I reappeared here' Thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives
That too is a Tathagata's power
Again with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human the Tathagata sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and he understands how beings pass on according to their actions thus 'These worthy beings who were illconducted in body speech and mind revilers of noble ones wrong in their views giving effect to wrong view in their actions on the dissolution of the body after death have reappeared in a state of deprivation in a bad destination in perdition even in hell but these worthy beings who were wellconducted in body speech and mind not revilers of noble ones right in their views giving effect to right view in their actions on the dissolution of the body after death have reappeared in a good destination even in the heavenly world' Thus with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human he sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and he understands how beings pass on according to their actions
That too is a Tathagata's power
Again by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge the Tathagata here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints
That too is a Tathagata's power that a Tathagata has by virtue of which he claims the herdleader's place roars his lion's roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahma
The Tathagata has these ten Tathagata's powers possessing which he claims the herdleader's place roars his lion's roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahma
Sariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of me 'The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones
The recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him'  unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as carried off and put there he will wind up in hell
Just as a bhikkhu possessed of virtue concentration and wisdom would here and now enjoy final knowledge so it will happen in this case I say that unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as carried off and put there he will wind up in hell
Sariputta the Tathagata has these four kinds of intrepidity possessing which he claims the herdleader's place roars his lion's roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahma
What are the four
Here I see no ground on which any recluse or brahman or god or Mara or Brahma or anyone at all in the world could in accordance with the Dhamma accuse me thus 'While you claim full enlightenment you are not fully enlightened in regard to certain things' And seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidity
I see no ground on which any recluse or anyone at all could accuse me thus 'While you claim to have destroyed the taints these taints are undestroyed by you' And seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidity
I see no ground on which any recluse or anyone at all could accuse me thus 'Those things called obstructions by you are not able to obstruct one who engages in them' And seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidity
I see no ground on which any recluse or anyone at all could accuse me thus 'When you teach the Dhamma to someone it does not lead him when he practices it to the complete destruction of suffering' And seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidity
A Tathagata has these four kinds of intrepidity possessing which he claims the herdleader's place roars his lion's roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahma
Sariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of me he will wind up in hell
Sariputta there are these eight assemblies
What are the eight
An assembly of nobles an assembly of brahmans an assembly of householders an assembly of recluses an assembly of gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings an assembly of gods of the heaven of the Thirtythree an assembly of Mara's retinue an assembly of Brahmas
Possessing these four kinds of intrepidity the Tathagata approaches and enters these eight assemblies
I recall having approached many hundred assemblies of nobles many hundred assemblies of brahmans many hundred assemblies of householders many hundred assemblies of recluses many hundred assemblies of gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings many hundred assemblies of gods of the heaven of the Thirtythree many hundred assemblies of Mara's retinue many hundred assemblies of Brahmas
And formerly I had sat with them there and talked with them and held conversations with them yet I see no ground for thinking that fear or timidity might come upon me there
And seeing no ground for that I abide in safety fearlessness and intrepidity

Sariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of me he will wind up in hell
Sariputta there are these four kinds of generation
What are the four
Eggborn generation wombborn generation moistureborn generation and spontaneous generation
What is eggborn generation
There are these beings born by breaking out of the shell of an egg this is called eggborn generation
What is wombborn generation
There are these beings born by breaking out from the caul this is called wombborn generation
What is moistureborn generation
There are these beings born in a rotten fish in a rotten corpse in rotten dough in a cesspit or in a sewer this is called moistureborn generation
What is spontaneous generation
There are gods and denizens of hell and certain human beings and some beings in the lower worlds this is called spontaneous generation
These are the four kinds of generation
Sariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of me he will wind up in hell
Sariputta there are these five destinations
What are the five
Hell the animal realm the realm of ghosts human beings and gods
I understand hell and the path and way leading to hell
And I also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell
I understand the animal realm and the path and way leading to the animal realm
And I also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in the animal realm
I understand the realm of ghosts and the path and way leading to the realm of ghosts
And I also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in the realm of ghosts
I understand human beings and the path and way leading to the human world
And I also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear among human beings
I understand the gods and the path and way leading to the world of the gods
And I also understand how one who has entered this path will on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly world
I understand Nibbana and the path and way leading to Nibbana
And I also understand how one who has entered this path will by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints
By encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus 'This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell' And then later on with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human I see that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell and is experiencing extremely painful racking piercing feelings
Suppose there were a charcoal pit deeper than a man's height full of glowing coals without flame or smoke and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same charcoal pit
Then a man with good sight on seeing him would say 'This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that he will come to this same charcoal pit' and then later on he sees that he has fallen into that charcoal pit and is experiencing extremely painful racking piercing feelings
So too by encompassing mind with mind piercing feelings
By encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus 'This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in the animal realm' And then later on with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human I see that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in the animal realm and is experiencing painful racking piercing feelings
Suppose there were a cesspit deeper than a man's height full of filth and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same cesspit
Then a man with good sight on seeing him would say 'This person so behaves that he will come to this same cesspit' and then later on he sees that he has fallen into that cesspit and is experiencing painful racking piercing feelings
So too by encompassing mind with mind piercing feelings
By encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus 'This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in the realm of ghosts' And then later on I see that he has reappeared in the realm of ghosts and is experiencing much painful feeling
Suppose there were a tree growing on uneven ground with scanty foliage casting a dappled shade and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same tree
Then a man with good sight on seeing him would say 'This person so behaves that he will come to this same tree' and then later on he sees that he is sitting or lying in the shade of that tree experiencing much painful feeling
So too by encompassing mind with mind much painful feeling
By encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus 'This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear among human beings' And then later on I see that he has reappeared among human beings and is experiencing much pleasant feeling
Suppose there were a tree growing on even ground with thick foliage casting a deep shade and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same tree
Then a man with good sight on seeing him would say 'This person so behaves that he will come to this same tree' and then later on he sees that he is sitting or lying in the shade of that tree experiencing much pleasant feeling
So too by encompassing mind with mind much pleasant feeling 
By encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus 'This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that on the dissolution of the body after death he will reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly world' And then later on I see that he has reappeared in a happy destination in the heavenly world and is experiencing extremely pleasant feelings
Suppose there were a mansion and it had an upper chamber plastered within and without shut off secured by bars with shuttered windows and in it there was a couch spread with rugs blankets and sheets with a deerskin coverlet with a canopy as well as crimson pillows for both and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed to that same mansion
Then a man with good sight on seeing him would say 'This person so behaves that he will come to this same mansion' and later on he sees that he is sitting or lying in that upper chamber in that mansion experiencing extremely pleasant feelings
So too by encompassing mind with mind extremely pleasant feelings
By encompassing mind with mind I understand a certain person thus 'This person so behaves so conducts himself has taken such a path that by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge he here and now will enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints' And then later on I see that by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge he here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints and is experiencing extremely pleasant feelings
Suppose there were a pond with clean agreeable cool water transparent with smooth banks delightful and nearby a dense wood and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather weary parched and thirsty came by a path going in one way only and directed towards that same pond
Then a man with good sight on seeing him would say 'This person so behaves that he will come to this same pond' and then later on he sees that he has plunged into the pond bathed drunk and relieved all his distress fatigue and fever and has come out again and is sitting or lying in the wood experiencing extremely pleasant feelings
So too by encompassing mind with mind extremely pleasant feelings
These are the five destinations
Sariputta when I know and see thus should anyone say of me 'The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones
The recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him'  unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as carried off and put there he will wind up in hell
Just as a bhikkhu possessed of virtue concentration and wisdom would here and now enjoy final knowledge so it will happen in this case I say that unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view then as carried off and put there he will wind up in hell
Sariputta I recall having lived a holy life possessing four factors
I have practiced asceticism  the extreme of asceticism I have practiced coarseness  the extreme of coarseness I have practiced scrupulousness  the extreme of scrupulousness I have practiced seclusion  the extreme of seclusion
Such was my asceticism Sariputta that I went naked rejecting conventions licking my hands not coming when asked not stopping when asked I did not accept food brought or food specially made or an invitation to a meal I received nothing from a pot from a bowl across a threshold across a stick across a pestle from two eating together from a pregnant woman from a woman giving suck from a woman lying with a man from where food was advertised to be distributed from where a dog was waiting from where flies were buzzing I accepted no fish or meat I drank no liquor wine or fermented brew
I kept to one house to one morsel I kept to two houses to two morsels I kept to seven houses to seven morsels
I lived on one saucerful a day on two saucerfuls a day on seven saucerfuls a day I took food once a day once every two days once every seven days and so on up to once every fortnight I dwelt pursuing the practice of taking food at stated intervals
I was an eater of greens or millet or wild rice or hideparings or moss or ricebran or ricescum or sesamum flour or grass or cowdung
I lived on forest roots and fruits I fed on fallen fruits
I clothed myself in hemp in hempmixed cloth in shrouds in refuse rags in tree bark in antelope hide in strips of antelope hide in kusagrass fabric in bark fabric in woodshavings fabric in headhair wool in animal wool in owls' wings
I was one who pulled out hair and beard pursuing the practice of pulling out hair and beard
I was one who stood continuously rejecting seats
I was one who squatted continuously devoted to maintaining the squatting position
I was one who used a mattress of spikes I made a mattress of spikes my bed
I dwelt pursuing the practice of bathing in water three times daily including the evening
Thus in such a variety of ways I dwelt pursuing the practice of tormenting and mortifying the body
Such was my asceticism
Such was my coarseness Sariputta that just as the bole of a tinduka tree accumulating over the years cakes and flakes off so too dust and dirt accumulating over the years caked off my body and flaked off
It never occurred to me 'Oh let me rub this dust and dirt off with my hand or let another rub this dust and dirt off with his hand'  it never occurred to me thus
Such was my coarseness
Such was my scrupulousness Sariputta that I was always mindful in stepping forwards and stepping backwards
I was full of pity even for a drop of water thus 'Let me not hurt the tiny creatures in the crevices of the ground' Such was my scrupulousness
Such was my seclusion Sariputta that I would plunge into some forest and dwell there
And when I saw a cowherd or a shepherd or someone gathering grass or sticks or a woodsman I would flee from grove to grove from thicket to thicket from hollow to hollow from hillock to hillock
Why was that
So that they should not see me or I see them
Just as a forestbred deer on seeing human beings flees from grove to grove from thicket to thicket from hollow to hollow from hillock to hillock so too when I saw a cowherd or a shepherd Such was my seclusion
I would go on all fours to the cowpens when the cattle had gone out and the cowherd had left them and I would feed on the dung of the young suckling calves
As long as my own excrement and urine lasted I fed on my own excrement and urine
Such was my great distortion in feeding
I would plunge into some aweinspiring grove and dwell there  a grove so aweinspiring that normally it would make a man's hair stand up if he were not free from lust
When those cold wintry nights came during the 'eightdays interval of frost' I would dwell by night in the open and by day in the grove
In the last month of the hot season I would dwell by day in the open and by night in the grove
And there came to me spontaneously this stanza never heard before
I would make my bed in a charnel ground with the bones of the dead for a pillow
And cowherd boys came up and spat on me urinated on me threw dirt at me and poked sticks into my ears
Yet I do not recall that I ever aroused an evil mind against them
Such was my abiding in equanimity

Sariputta there are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this 'Purification comes about through food' They say 'Let us live on kolafruits' and they eat kolafruits they eat kolafruit powder they drink kolafruit water and they make many kinds of kolafruit concoctions
Now I recall having eaten a single kolafruit a day
Sariputta you may think that the kolafruit was bigger at that time yet you should not regard it so the kolafruit was then at most the same size as now
Through feeding on a single kolafruit a day my body reached a state of extreme emaciation
Because of eating so little my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stems
Because of eating so little my backside became like a camel's hoof
Because of eating so little the projections on my spine stood forth like corded beads
Because of eating so little my ribs jutted out as gaunt as the crazy rafters of an old roofless barn
Because of eating so little the gleam of my eyes sank far down in their sockets looking like a gleam of water which has sunk far down in a deep well
Because of eating so little my scalp shriveled and withered as a green bitter gourd shrivels and withers in the wind and sun
Because of eating so little my belly skin adhered to my backbone thus if I touched my belly skin I encountered my backbone and if I touched my backbone I encountered my belly skin
Because of eating so little if I tried to ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands the hair rotted at its roots fell from my body as I rubbed

Sariputta there are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this 'Purification comes about through food' They say 'Let us live on beans' 'Let us live on sesamum' 'Let us live on rice' and they eat rice they eat rice powder they drink rice water and they make various kinds of rice concoctions
Now I recall having eaten a single rice grain a day
Sariputta you may think that the rice grain was bigger at that time yet you should not regard it so the rice grain was then at most the same size as now
Through feeding on a single rice grain a day my body reached a state of extreme emaciation
Because of eating so little the hair rotted at its roots fell from my body as I rubbed
Yet Sariputta by such conduct by such practice by such performance of austerities I did not attain any superhuman states any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones
Why was that
Because I did not attain that noble wisdom which when attained is noble and emancipating and leads the one who practices in accordance with it to the complete destruction of suffering
Sariputta there are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this 'Purification comes about through the round of rebirths' But it is impossible to find a realm in the round that I have not already passed through in this long journey except for the gods of the Pure Abodes and had I passed through the round as a god in the Pure Abodes I would never have returned to this world
There are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this 'Purification comes about through rebirth' But it is impossible to find a kind of rebirth that I have not been reborn in already in this long journey except for the gods of the Pure Abodes
There are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this 'Purification comes about through abode' But it is impossible to find a kind of abode that I have not already dwelt in except for the gods of the Pure Abodes
There are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this 'Purification comes about through sacrifice' But it is impossible to find a kind of sacrifice that has not already been offered up by me in this long journey when I was either a headanointed noble king or a welltodobrahman
There are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this 'Purification comes about through fireworship' But it is impossible to find a kind of fire that has not already been worshipped by me in this long journey when I was either a headanointed noble king or a welltodo brahman
Sariputta there are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view is this 'As long as this good man is still young a blackhaired young man endowed with the blessing of youth in the prime of life so long is he perfect in his lucid wisdom
But when this good man is old aged burdened with years advanced in life and come to the last stage being eighty ninety or a hundred years old then the lucidity of his wisdom is lost' But it should not be regarded so
I am now old aged burdened with years advanced in life and come to the last stage my years have turned eighty
Now suppose that I had four disciples with a hundred years' lifespan perfect in mindfulness retentiveness memory and lucidity of wisdom
Just as a skilled archer trained practiced and tested could easily shoot a light arrow across the shadow of a palm tree suppose that they were even to that extent perfect in mindfulness retentiveness memory and lucidity of wisdom
Suppose that they continuously asked me about the four foundations of mindfulness and that I answered them when asked and that they remembered each answer of mine and never asked a subsidiary question or paused except to eat drink consume food taste urinate defecate and rest in order to remove sleepiness and tiredness
Still the Tathagata's exposition of the Dhamma his explanations of factors of the Dhamma and his replies to questions would not yet come to an end but meanwhile those four disciples of mine with their hundred years' lifespan would have died at the end of those hundred years
Sariputta even if you have to carry me about on a bed still there will be no change in the lucidity of the Tathagata's wisdom
Rightly speaking were it to be said of anyone 'A being not subject to delusion has appeared in the world for the welfare and happiness of many out of compassion for the world for the good welfare and happiness of gods and humans' it is of me indeed that rightly speaking this should be said
Now on that occasion the Venerable Nagasamala was standing behind the Blessed One fanning him
Then he said to the Blessed One It is wonderful venerable sir it is marvelous
As I listened to this discourse on the Dhamma the hairs of my body stood up
Venerable sir what is the name of this discourse on the Dhamma
As to that Nagasamala you may remember this discourse on the Dhamma as 'The Hairraising Discourse' 
That is what the Blessed One said
The Venerable Nagasamala was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words

Vbh
Section explains this knowledge with reference to MN as the Buddha's knowledge of what is possible and what is impossible eg it is impossible that a person possessed of right view should regard any formations as permanent or as pleasurable or anything whatever as self while it is possible that a worldling will regard things in such an erroneous way
It is impossible for a person possessed of right view to commit the five heinous crimes while it is possible for a worldling to commit such crimes etc
etc
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's Park
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus  Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this
Bhikkhus only here is there a recluse only here a second recluse only here a third recluse only here a fourth recluse
The doctrines of others are devoid of recluses that is how you should rightly roar your lion's roar
It is possible bhikkhus that wanderers of other sects might ask 'But on the strength of what or with the support of what do the venerable ones say thus' Wanderers of other sects who ask thus may be answered in this way 'Friends four things have been declared to us by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened on seeing these in ourselves we say thus Only here is there a recluse only here a second recluse only here a third recluse only here a fourth recluse
The doctrines of others are devoid of recluses What are the four
We have confidence in the Teacher we have confidence in the Dhamma we have fulfilled the precepts and our companions in the Dhamma are dear and agreeable to us whether they are layfolk or those gone forth
These are the four things declared to us by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened on seeing which in ourselves we say as we do'
It is possible bhikkhus that wanderers of other sects might say thus 'Friends we too have confidence in the Teacher that is in our Teacher we too have confidence in the Dhamma that is in our Dhamma we too have fulfilled the precepts that is our precepts our companions in the Dhamma are dear and agreeable to us too whether they are layfolk or those gone forth
What is the distinction here friends what is the variance what is the difference between you and us'
Wanderers of other sects who ask thus may be answered in this way 'How then friends is the goal one or many' Answering rightly the wanderers of other sects would answer thus 'Friends the goal is one not many'  'But friends is that goal for one affected by lust or free from lust' Answering rightly the wanderers of other sects would answer thus 'Friends that goal is for one free from lust not for one affected by lust'  'But friends is that goal for one affected by hate or free from hate' Answering rightly they would answer 'Friends that goal is for one free from hate not for one affected by hate'  'But friends is that goal for one affected by delusion or free from delusion' Answering rightly they would answer 'Friends that goal is for one free from delusion not for one affected by delusion'  'But friends is that goal for one affected by craving or free from craving' Answering rightly they would answer 'Friends that goal is for one free from craving not for one affected by craving'  'But friends is that goal for one affected by clinging or free from clinging' Answering rightly they would answer 'Friends that goal is for one free from clinging not for one affected by clinging'  'But friends is that goal for one who has vision or for one without vision' Answering rightly they would answer 'Friends that goal is for one with vision not for one without vision'  'But friends is that goal for one who favors and opposes or for one who does not favor and oppose' Answering rightly they would answer 'Friends that goal is for one who does not favor and oppose not for one who favors and opposes'  'But friends is that goal for one who delights in and enjoys proliferation or for one who does not delight in and enjoy proliferation' Answering rightly they would answer 'Friends that goal is for one who does not delight in and enjoy proliferation not for one who delights in and enjoys proliferation'
Bhikkhus there are these two views the view of being and the view of nonbeing
Any recluses or brahmans who rely on the view of being adopt the view of being accept the view of being are opposed to the view of nonbeing
Any recluses or brahmans who rely on the view of nonbeing adopt the view of nonbeing accept the view of nonbeing are opposed to the view of being
Any recluses or brahmans who do not understand as they actually are the origin the disappearance the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of these two views are affected by lust affected by hate affected by delusion affected by craving affected by clinging without vision given to favoring and opposing and they delight in and enjoy proliferation
They are not freed from birth aging and death from sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair they are not freed from suffering I say
Any recluses or brahmans who understand as they actually are the origin the disappearance the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of these two views are without lust without hate without delusion without craving without clinging with vision not given to favoring and opposing and they do not delight in and enjoy proliferation
They are freed from birth aging and death from sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair they are freed from suffering I say

Bhikkhus there are these four kinds of clinging
What four
Clinging to sensual pleasures clinging to views clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self
Though certain recluses and brahmans claim to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging they do not completely describe the full understanding of all kinds of clinging
They describe the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures without describing the full understanding of clinging to views clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self
Why is that
Those good recluses and brahmans do not understand these three instances of clinging as they actually are
Therefore though they claim to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging they describe only the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures without describing the full understanding of clinging to views clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self
Though certain recluses and brahmans claim to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging they describe the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures and clinging to views without describing the full understanding of clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self
Why is that
They do not understand two instances therefore they describe only the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures and clinging to views without describing the full understanding of clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self
Though certain recluses and brahmans claim to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging they describe the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures clinging to views and clinging to rules and observances without describing the full understanding of clinging to a doctrine of self
They do not understand one instance therefore they describe only the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures clinging to views and clinging to rules and observances without describing the full understanding of clinging to a doctrine of self
Bhikkhus in such a Dhamma and Discipline as that it is plain that confidence in the Teacher is not rightly directed that confidence in the Dhamma is not rightly directed that fulfillment of the precepts is not rightly directed and that the affection among companions in the Dhamma is not rightly directed
Why is that
Because that is how it is when the Dhamma and Discipline is badly proclaimed and badly expounded unemancipating unconducive to peace expounded by one who is not fully enlightened
Bhikkhus when a Tathagata accomplished and fully enlightened claims to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging he completely describes the full understanding of all kinds of clinging he describes the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures clinging to views clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self
Bhikkhus in such a Dhamma and Discipline as that it is plain that confidence in the Teacher is rightly directed that confidence in the Dhamma is rightly directed that fulfillment of the precepts is rightly directed and that the affection among companions in the Dhamma is rightly directed
Why is that
Because that is how it is when the Dhamma and Discipline is well proclaimed and well expounded emancipating conducive to peace expounded by one who is fully enlightened
Now these four kinds of clinging have what as their source what as their origin from what are they born and produced
These four kinds of clinging have craving as their source craving as their origin they are born and produced from craving
Craving has what as its source
Craving has feeling as its source Feeling has what as its source
Feeling has contact as its source Contact has what as its source
Contact has the sixfold base as its source The sixfold base has what as its source
The sixfold base has mentalitymateriality as its source Mentalitymateriality has what as its source
Mentalitymateriality has consciousness as its source Consciousness has what as its source
Consciousness has formations as its source Formations have what as their source
Formations have ignorance as their source ignorance as their origin they are born and produced from ignorance
Bhikkhus when ignorance is abandoned and true knowledge has arisen in a bhikkhu then with the fading away of ignorance and the arising of true knowledge he no longer clings to sensual pleasures no longer clings to views no longer clings to rules and observances no longer clings to a doctrine of self
When he does not cling he is not agitated
When he is not agitated he personally attains Nibbana
He understands 'Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being' 
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words
The numbers enclosed in square brackets in the above text are page numbers of the Pali Text Society edition of the Pali text
Thus have I heard
At one time the Blessed One was living in the Kurus at Kammasadamma a markettown of the Kuru people
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus as follows This is the only way O bhikkhus for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation for the destruction of suffering and grief for reaching the right path for the attainment of Nibbana namely the Four Arousings of Mindfulness
What are the four
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives contemplating the body in the body ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome in this world covetousness and grief he lives contemplating the feelings in the feelings ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome in this world covetousness and grief he lives contemplating consciousness in consciousness ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome in this world covetousness and grief he lives contemplating mental objects in mental objects ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome in this world covetousness and grief
And how O bhikkhus does a bhikkhu live contemplating the body in the body
Here O bhikkhus a bhikkhu gone to the forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty place sits down bends in his legs crosswise on his lap keeps his body erect and arouses mindfulness in the object of meditation namely the breath which is in front of him
Mindful he breathes in and mindful he breathes out
He thinking 'I breathe in long' he understands when he is breathing in long or thinking 'I breathe out long' he understands when he is breathing out long or thinking 'I breathe in short' he understands when he is breathing in short or thinking 'I breathe out short' he understands when he is breathing out short
'Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe in' thinking thus he trains himself
'Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe out' thinking thus he trains himself
'Calming the activity of the body I shall breathe in' thinking thus he trains himself
'Calming the activity of the body I shall breathe out' thinking thus he trains himself
Just as a clever turner or a turner's apprentice turning long understands 'I turn long' or turning short understands 'I turn short' just so indeed O bhikkhus a bhikkhu when he breathes in long understands 'I breathe in long' or when he breathes out long understands 'I breathe out long' or when he breathes in short he understands 'I breathe in short' or when he breathes out short he understands 'I breathe out short' He trains himself with the thought 'Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe in' He trains himself with the thought 'Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe out' He trains himself with the thought 'Calming the activity of the body I shall breathe in' He trains himself with the thought 'Calming the activity of the body I shall breathe out'
Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body internally or he lives contemplating the body in the body externally or he lives contemplating the body in the body internally and externally
He lives contemplating originationthings in the body or he lives contemplating dissolutionthings in the body or he lives contemplating originationanddissolutionthings in the body
Or indeed his mindfulness is established with the thought 'The body exists' to the extent necessary just for knowledge and remembrance and he lives independent and clings to naught in the world
Thus also O bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives contemplating the body in the body
And further O bhikkhus when he is going a bhikkhu understands 'I am going' when he is standing he understands 'I am standing' when he is sitting he understands 'I am sitting' when he is lying down he understands 'I am lying down' or just as his body is disposed so he understands it
Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body internally or he lives contemplating the body in the body externally or he lives contemplating the body in the body internally and externally

And further O bhikkhus a bhikkhu in going forwards in going backwards is a person practicing clear comprehension in looking straight on in looking away from the front is a person practicing clear comprehension in bending and in stretching is a person practicing clear comprehension in wearing the shouldercloak the robes the bowl is a person practicing clear comprehension in regard to what is eaten drunk chewed and savored is a person practicing clear comprehension in defecating and in urinating is a person practicing clear comprehension in walking in standing in sitting in sleeping in waking in speaking and in keeping silence is a person practicing clear comprehension
Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body internally and clings to naught in the world
Thus also O bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives contemplating the body in the body
And further O bhikkhus a bhikkhu reflects on just this body hemmed by the skin and full of manifold impurity from the soles up and from the top of the hair down thinking thus 'There are in this body hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh fibrous threads bones marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs contents of stomach intestines mesentery feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat solid fat tars fat dissolved saliva mucus synovic fluid urine'
Just as if O bhikkhus there were a bag having two openings full of grain differing in kind namely hillpaddy paddy greengram cowpea sesamum rice and a man with seeing eyes having loosened it should reflect thinking thus 'This is hill paddy this is paddy this is greengram this is cowpea this is sesamum this is rice' In the same way O bhikkhus a bhikkhu reflects on just this body hemmed in by the skin and full of manifold impurity from the soles up and from the top of the hair down thinking thus 'There are in this body hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh fibrous threads bones marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs contents of the stomach intestines mesentery feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat solid fat tears fat dissolved saliva mucus synovic fluid urine'

And further O bhikkhus if a bhikkhu in whatever way sees whilst it is being eaten by crows hawks vultures dogs jackals or by different kinds of worms a body that had been thrown into the charnel ground he thinks of his own body thus 'This body of mine too is of the same nature as that body is going to be like that body and has not got past the condition of becoming like that body'
Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body internally or he lives contemplating the body in the body externally or he lives contemplating the body in the body internally and externally
He lives contemplating originationthings in the body or he lives contemplating dissolutionthings in the body or he lives contemplating originationanddissolutionthings in the body
Or indeed his mindfulness is established with the thought 'The body exists' to the extent necessary just for knowledge and remembrance and he lives independent and clings to naught in the world

And further O bhikkhus if a bhikkhu in whatever way sees a body thrown in the charnel ground and reduced to a skeleton together with flesh and blood held in by the tendons he thinks of his own body thus 'This body of mine too is of the same nature as that body is going to be like that body and has not got past the condition of becoming like that body'

When the enlightenment factor of energy is present he knows with understanding 'I have the enlightenment factor of energy' when the enlightenment factor of energy is absent he knows with understanding 'I have not the enlightenment factor of energy' and he understands how the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of energy comes to be and how the completion by culture of the arisen enlightenment factor of energy comes to be
When the enlightenment factor of joy is present he knows with understanding 'I have the enlightenment factor of joy' when the enlightenment factor of joy is absent he knows with understanding 'I have not the enlightenment factor of joy' and he understands how the rising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of joy comes to be and how the completion by culture of the arisen enlightenment factor of joy comes to be
When the enlightenment factor of calm is present he knows with understanding 'I have the enlightenment factor of calm' when the enlightenment factor of calm is absent he knows with understanding 'I have not the enlightenment factor of calm' and he understands how the arising of the nonarisen enlightenment factor of calm comes to be and how the completion by culture of the arisen enlightenment factor of calm comes to be

Thus he lives contemplating mental object in mental objects internally and clings to naught in the world
Thus indeed O bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives contemplating mental object in the mental objects of the seven factors of enlightenment
And further O bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives contemplating mental object in the mental objects of the Four Noble Truths
How O bhikkhus does a bhikkhu live contemplating mental object in the mental objects of the Four Noble Truths
Here O bhikkhus a bhikkhu understands 'This is suffering' according to reality he understands 'This is the origin of suffering' according to reality he understands 'This is the cessation of suffering' according to reality and he understands 'This is the road leading to the cessation of suffering' according to realty
Thus he lives contemplating mental object in mental objects internally or he lives contemplating mental objects in mental objects externally or he lives contemplating mental object in mental objects internally and externally
He lives contemplating origination things in mental objects or he lives contemplating dissolutionthings in mental objects or he lives contemplating originationanddissolutionthings in mental objects or his mindfulness is established with the thought 'Mental objects exist' to the extent necessary just for knowledge and remembrance and he lives independent and clings to naught in the world
Thus indeed O bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives contemplating mental object in the mental objects of the Four Noble Truths
O bhikkhus should any person maintain the Four Arousings of Mindfulness in this manner for seven years then by him one of two fruitions is proper to be expected Knowledge here and now or if some form of clinging is yet present the state of nonreturning
O bhikkhus let alone seven years
Should a person maintain these Four Arousings of Mindfulness in this manner for six years for five years four years three years two years one year then by him one of two fruitions is proper to be expected knowledge here and now or if some form of clinging is yet present the state of nonreturning
O bhikkhus let alone a year
Should any person maintain these Four Arousings of Mindfulness in the manner for seven months then by him one of two fruitions is proper to be expected Knowledge here and now or if some form of clinging is yet present the state of nonreturning
O bhikkhus let alone seven months
Should any person maintain these Four Arousings of Mindfulness in this manner for six months five months four months three months two months one month halfamonth then by him one of two fruitions is proper to be expected Knowledge here and now or if some form of clinging is yet present the state of nonreturning
O bhikkhus let alone halfamonth
Should any person maintain these Four Arousings of Mindfulness in this manner for a week then by him one of two fruitions is proper to be expected Knowledge here and now or if some form of clinging is yet present the state of nonreturning
Because of this was it said 'This is the only way O bhikkhus for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation for the destruction of suffering and grief for reaching the right path for the attainment of Nibbana namely the Four Arousings of Mindfulness
Thus spoke the Blessed One
Satisfied the bhikkhus approved of his words
Thus have I heard
At one time the Blessed One was living among the Kurus at Kammasadamma a market town of the Kuru people
There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhu thus Monks and they replied to him Venerable Sir The Blessed One spoke as follows
This is the only way monks for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation for the destruction of suffering and grief for reaching the right path for the attainment of Nibbana namely the four foundations of mindfulness
What are the four
Herein a monk lives contemplating the body in the body ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome in this world covetousness and grief he lives contemplating feelings in feelings ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome in this world covetousness and grief he lives contemplating consciousness in consciousness ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome in this world covetousness and grief he lives contemplating mental objects in mental objects ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome in this world covetousness and grief
And how does a monk live contemplating the body in the body
Herein monks a monk having gone to the forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty place sits down with his legs crossed keeps his body erect and his mindfulness alert
Ever mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
Breathing in a long breath he knows I am breathing in a long breath breathing out a long breath he knows I am breathing out a long breath breathing in a short breath he knows I am breathing in a short breath breathing out a short breath he knows I am breathing out a short breath
Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe in thus he trains himself
Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe out thus he trains himself
Calming the activity of the body I shall breathe in thus he trains himself
Calming the activity of the body I shall breathe out thus he trains himself
Just as a skillful turner or turner's apprentice making a long turn knows I am making a long turn or making a short turn knows I am making a short turn just so the monk breathing in a long breath knows I am breathing in a long breath breathing out a long breath he knows I am breathing out a long breath breathing in a short breath he knows I am breathing in a short breath breathing out a short breath he knows I am breathing out a short breath Experiencing the whole body I shall breathe in thus he trains himself

Because of this it was said This is the only way monks for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation for the destruction of suffering and grief for reaching the right path for the attainment of Nibbana namely the four foundations of mindfulness
Thus spoke the Blessed One
Satisfied the monks approved of his words
Right view is normally explained in terms of the four noble truths
In this discourse Ven
Sariputta expands the discussion in several directions
He begins by focusing on two concepts that underlie the structure of the four noble truths the dichotomy of skillful and unskillful action and the concept of nutriment
Focusing on the dichotomy of skillful and unskillful action draws attention to a general principle of cause and effect  the fact that actions give results  and to the particular role of action in determining one's experience of pleasure and pain Unskillful actions lead to pain skillful actions to pleasure
The search for the root of skillful and unskillful actions leads ultimately to the mind because the presence or lack of skill in any action is determined by the mental state motivating it
Thus the issue of skillful and unskillful action provides in a nutshell some of the basic principles of the four noble truths in terms of causality wise and unwise uses of causality and the dominant role of the mind in the causal chain leading to happiness or pain
The image of root carries further implications
Because the function of roots is to draw nourishment from the soil the natural question is Where do the roots of skillful and unskillful behavior draw their nourishment
This is why the next topic in the sutta is nutriment which is of two sorts physical and mental
And implicit in the idea of nutriment is the possibility for a strategy to use nutriment skillfully If the mental state being nourished is unskillful it can be overcome by depriving it of nutriment if it's skillful it can be fostered by feeding it more
This points to the possibility of training the mind through a strategy of selective feeding and starving while the analysis of mental nutriment shows precisely which events are most basic in the mental food chain contact intellectual intention and consciousness
Ven
Sariputta combines the issues of skillfulness and nutriment by approaching the topic of nutriment with a fourfold framework nutriment its origination its cessation and the path of practice leading to its cessation
This line of thinking leads naturally to the next topic in which this same framework is applied to the focal issue of the Buddha's teaching  suffering and stress  yielding the four noble truths
In this way Ven
Sariputta shows how the four noble truths derive from the two topics of skillfulunskillful and nutriment
It's interesting to note that both these topics figure prominently in discourses directed at young people
The Buddha's instruction to Rahula in MN focuses on skillful and unskillful behavior the first of the Novice's Questions on nutriment
Seeing how basic these concepts are to understanding the role of causality in putting an end to suffering the Buddha taught them to young people as an entry into the Dhamma
In this sutta Ven
Sariputta shows how these topics can perform the same function for adults
And perhaps he is also showing us the line of reasoning through which his own first glimpse of the deathless followed upon a simple statement of a causal principle
The remainder of this sutta expands on the four noble truths with a reverseorder analysis of dependent coarising
Two features of this section stand out
To begin with Ven
Sariputta points out that understanding the relationship between any two adjacent factors in the pattern of dependent coarising provides enough discernment to abandon unskillful obsessions and put an end to suffering
There is no need to comprehend the entire pattern for the whole is implicit in each paired relationship
This is a point with important practical implications
Sn
makes the same point but pairs the objects for contemplation in a different way Every factor in dependent coarising is paired directly with stress
A comparison between these two suttas provides much practical food for thought showing how the ability to see and comprehend dualities is essential to the Buddha's strategy for discernment and release
Second Ven
Sariputta here continues the pattern of dependent coarising past ignorance  the usual endpoint  to look for its origination which is mental fermentation
Because these fermentations in turn depend on ignorance the discussion shows how ignorance tends to prompt more ignorance
But as Ven
Sariputta has demonstrated throughout his discussion ignorance needn't keep propagating forever
Because it is simply a lack of knowledge in terms of the four noble truths it can be replaced by knowledge that does look at things in terms of the four noble truths  the framework derived from the topics of skillfulunskillful and nutriment
When knowledge in terms of this framework is applied at any point in the causal framework the entire framework dependent on ignorance can be brought to an end
In this way Ven
Sariputta fills in a blank contained in the stock Canonical description of Awakening
The central part of that description states He discerns as it has come to be that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are mental fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations This description however does not explain these last four insights into mental fermentation nor does it explain how they relate to the four insights into stress
In the last section of this discourse Ven
Sariputta explains the first of these issues while in the overall structure of the discourse he explains the second
Ven
Sariputta offers further explanations of right view in two other suttas in the Majjhima Nikaya
In MN he offers a wordbyword analysis of the four noble truths
In MN he analyzes the first noble truth  in particular the form clingingaggregate  showing how the comprehension of that one aggregate encompasses the comprehension of all five aggregates all four noble truths and the principle of dependent coarising
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Then Ven
Sariputta addressed the monks Friends
Yes friend the monks responded
Ven
Sariputta said 'Right view right view' it is said
To what extent is a disciple of the noble ones a person of right view one whose view is made straight who is endowed with verified confidence in the Dhamma and who has arrived at this true Dhamma
We would come from a long distance friend to learn the meaning of these words in Ven
Sariputta's presence
It would be good if Ven
Sariputta himself would enlighten us as to their meaning
Having listened to him the monks will bear it in mind
Then in that case friends listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say friend the monks responded
Ven
Sariputta said When a disciple of the noble ones discerns what is unskillful discerns the root of what is unskillful discerns what is skillful and discerns the root of what is skillful it is to that extent that he is a person of right view one whose view is made straight who is endowed with verified confidence in the Dhamma and who has arrived at this true Dhamma
Now what is unskillful
Taking life is unskillful taking what is not given sexual misconduct lying abusive speech divisive talebearing idle chatter is unskillful
Covetousness ill will wrong views are unskillful
These things are termed unskillful
And what are the roots of what is unskillful
Greed is a root of what is unskillful aversion is a root of what is unskillful delusion is a root of what is unskillful
These are termed the roots of what is unskillful
And what is skillful
Abstaining from taking life is skillful abstaining from taking what is not given from sexual misconduct from lying from abusive speech from divisive talebearing abstaining from idle chatter is skillful
Lack of covetousness lack of ill will right views are skillful
These things are termed skillful
And what are the roots of what is skillful
Lack of greed is a root of what is skillful lack of aversion is a root of what is skillful lack of delusion is a root of what is skillful
These are termed the roots of what is skillful
When a disciple of the noble ones discerns what is unskillful in this way discerns the root of what is unskillful in this way discerns what is skillful in this way and discerns the root of what is skillful in this way when  having entirely abandoned passionobsession having abolished aversionobsession having uprooted the viewconceit obsession 'I am' having abandoned ignorance  given rise to clear knowing  he has put an end to suffering  stress right in the herenow it is to this extent that a disciple of the noble ones is a person of right view one whose view is made straight who is endowed with verified confidence in the Dhamma and who has arrived at this true Dhamma
Saying Good friend having delighted in and approved of Ven
Sariputta's words the monks asked him a further question Would there be another line of reasoning by which a disciple of the noble ones is a person of right view who has arrived at this true Dhamma
There would
When a disciple of the noble ones discerns nutriment the origination of nutriment the cessation of nutriment and the way of practice leading to the cessation of nutriment then he is a person of right view who has arrived at this true Dhamma
And what is nutriment
What is the origination of nutriment

That is what Ven
Sariputta said
Gratified the monks delighted in Ven
Sariputta's words
Then the brahman Sangarava went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One I say Master Gotama
We brahmans perform sacrifices and get others to perform sacrifices
And whoever performs a sacrifice whoever gets others to perform a sacrifice they have all practiced a practice of merit  the business of a sacrifice  countless beings
But whoever leaving his family has gone forth from the home life into homelessness and tames his single self brings his single self into tune brings his single self to Unbinding his practice of merit  this business of going forth  is one only one being
Very well then brahman in that case I will crossquestion you
Answer as you see fit
What do you think
There is the case where a Tathagata appears in the world a worthy one rightlyselfawakened consummate in clearknowing  conduct one who has gone the good way knower of the cosmos unexcelled trainer of those who can be taught teacher of human  divine beings awakened blessed
He says 'Here
This is the path this is the practice that having practiced I make known the unexcelled coming ashore in the holy life having directly known  realized it for myself
Come
You too practice in such a way that you will remain in the unexcelled coming ashore in the holy life having directly known  realized it for yourselves' Thus the Teacher teaches the Dhamma and others practice for Suchness
And there are countless hundreds of them countless thousands of them countless hundreds of thousands of them
This being the case is this practice of merit  this business of goingforth  one that benefits countless beings or only one being
This being the case Master Gotama this practice of merit  this business of goingforth  is one that benefits countless beings
When this was said Ven
Ananda said to the brahman Sangarava Of these two practices brahman which appeals to you as the less complicated the less violent the more fruitful  the more rewarding
When this was said the brahman Sangarava said to Ven
Ananda Just as with Master Gotama  Master Ananda I worship them I praise them
A second time Ven
Ananda said to him I didn't ask you whom you worship and whom you praise
I ask you 'Of these two practices brahman which appeals to you as the less complicated the less violent the more fruitful  the more rewarding' A second time the brahman Sangarava said to Ven
Ananda Just as with Master Gotama  Master Ananda I worship them I praise them
A third time Ven
Ananda said to him I didn't ask you whom you worship and whom you praise
I ask you 'Of these two practices brahman which appeals to you as the less complicated the less violent the more fruitful  the more rewarding' A third time the brahman Sangarava said to Ven
Ananda Just as with Master Gotama  Master Ananda I worship them I praise them
Then the thought occurred to the Blessed One Being asked a legitimate question by Ananda up to the third time the brahman Sangarava evades it and does not reply to it
Suppose I were to get him out
So the Blessed One said to the brahman Sangarava Brahman what was the topic of conversation that arose today when the royal court sat gathered in the royal palace
Master Gotama this was the topic of conversation that arose today when the royal court sat gathered in the royal palace 'In the past there were fewer monks but more who endowed with superior human attainments displayed the miracle of psychic power
Now there are more monks but fewer who endowed with superior human attainments display the miracle of psychic power
This Master Gotama was the topic of conversation that arose today when the royal court sat gathered in the royal palace
Brahman there are these three miracles
Which three
The miracle of psychic power the miracle of telepathy  the miracle of instruction
And what is the miracle of psychic power
There is the case where a certain person wields manifold psychic powers
Having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one
He appears
He vanishes
He goes unimpeded through walls ramparts  mountains as if through space
He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water
He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land
Sitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged bird
With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun  moon so mighty  powerful
He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds
This is called the miracle of psychic power
And what is the miracle of telepathy
There is the case where a certain person reads by means of a sign 'Such is your thinking here is where your thinking is thus is your mind' And however much he may read that's exactly how it is and not otherwise
Then there is the case where a certain person reads not by means of a sign or vision but by hearing the voice of human beings nonhuman beings or devas 'Such is your thinking here is where your thinking is thus is your mind' And however much he may read that's exactly how it is and not otherwise
Then there is the case where a certain person reads not by means of a sign or vision not by hearing the voice of human beings nonhuman beings or devas but by hearing the sound of the directed thought  evaluation of a person thinking directed thoughts and evaluating 'Such is your thinking here is where your thinking is thus is your mind' And however much he may read that's exactly how it is and not otherwise
Then there is the case where a certain person reads not by means of a sign or vision not by hearing the voice of human beings nonhuman beings or devas not by hearing the sound of the directed thought  evaluation of a person thinking directed thoughts and evaluating but by having attained a concentration devoid of directed thought  evaluation and encompassing the awareness with his own awareness he discerns 'Given the way the mental fabrications of this venerable person are inclined the directed thoughts of his mind will immediately think about this' And however much he may read that's exactly how it is and not otherwise
This brahman is the miracle of telepathy
And what is the miracle of instruction
There is the case where a certain person gives instruction in this way 'Direct your thought in this way don't direct it in that
Attend to things in this way don't attend to them in that
Let go of this enter and remain in that' This is called the miracle of instruction
And these are the three miracles
Now brahman of these three miracles which one appeals to you as the highest  most sublime
Master Gotama of these three miracles the miracle of psychic power where a certain person wields manifold psychic powers exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds that is a miracle experienced only by him who does it it belongs only to him who does it
It seems to me to be of the nature of an illusion
As for the miracle where a certain person by means of a sign or vision by hearing the voice of human beings nonhuman beings or devas by hearing the sound of the directed thought  evaluation of a person thinking directed thoughts and evaluating 'Such is your thinking here is where your thinking is thus is your mind' who by having attained a concentration devoid of directed thought  evaluation and encompassing the awareness with his own awareness he discerns 'Given the way the mental fabrications of this venerable person are inclined the directed thoughts of his mind will immediately think about this' And however much he may read that's exactly how it is and not otherwise that is a miracle experienced only by him who does it it belongs only to him who does it
It seems to me to be of the nature of an illusion
As for the miracle where a certain person gives instruction in this way 'Direct your thought in this way don't direct it in that
Attend to things in this way don't attend to them in that
Let go of this enter and remain in that' this is the miracle that of the three appeals to me as the highest  most sublime
It is amazing Master Gotama
It is astounding how well this has been said by Master Gotama
And we hold that Master Gotama is endowed with these three marvels Master Gotama wields manifold psychic powers exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds
Having attained a concentration devoid of directed thought  evaluation and encompassing the awareness with his own awareness Master Gotama discerns 'Given the way the mental fabrications of this venerable person are inclined the directed thoughts of his mind will immediately think about this' Master Gotama gives instruction in this way 'Direct your thought in this way don't direct it in that
Attend to things in this way don't attend to them in that
Let go of this enter and remain in that' Of course brahman you have affronted me with your personal statement but nevertheless I will respond
Yes I wield manifold psychic powers exercise influence with my body even as far as the Brahma worlds having attained a concentration devoid of directed thought and evaluation and encompassing the awareness with my own awareness I discern 'Given the way the mental fabrications of this venerable person are inclined the directed thoughts of his mind will immediately think about this' I give instruction in this way 'Direct your thought in this way don't direct it in that
Attend to things in this way don't attend to them in that
Let go of this enter and remain in that' Aside from Master Gotama is there another monk who is endowed with these three miracles
Brahman there are not only one hundred other monks two three four five hundred other monks the monks who are endowed with these three miracles are many more than that
And Master Gotama where do those monks now live
In this very same community of monks
Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monks
May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for life
Then Vacchagotta the wanderer went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama I have heard that 'Gotama the contemplative says this Only to me should a gift be given and not to others
Only to my disciples should a gift be given and not to others
Only what is given to me bears great fruit and not what is given to others
Only what is given to my disciples bears great fruit and not what is given to the disciples of others' Now those who report this Are they reporting the Master Gotama's actual words are they not misrepresenting him with what is unfactual are they answering in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing them
For we don't want to misrepresent the Master Gotama
Vaccha whoever says this 'Gotama the contemplative says this Only to me should a gift be given Only what is given to my disciples bears great fruit and not what is given to the disciples of others' is not reporting my actual words is misrepresenting me with what is unfactual  untrue
Vaccha whoever prevents another from giving a gift creates three obstructions three impediments
Which three
He creates an obstruction to the merit of the giver an obstruction to the recipient's gains and prior to that he undermines and harms his own self
Whoever prevents another from giving a gift creates these three obstructions these three impediments
I tell you Vaccha even if a person throws the rinsings of a bowl or a cup into a village pool or pond thinking 'May whatever animals live here feed on this' that would be a source of merit to say nothing of what is given to human beings
But I do say that what is given to a virtuous person is of great fruit and not so much what is given to an unvirtuous person
And the virtuous person has abandoned five factors and is endowed with five
Which five has he abandoned
He has abandoned sensual desire ill will sloth  drowsiness restlessness  anxiety uncertainty
These are the five factors he has abandoned
And with which five is he endowed
He is endowed with the aggregate of virtue of one beyond training the aggregate of concentration of one beyond training the aggregate of discernment of one beyond training the aggregate of release of one beyond training the aggregate of knowledge  vision of release of one beyond training

I tell you What is given to one who has abandoned these five factors and is endowed with these five bears great fruit
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's Park
There the Venerable Sariputta addressed the bhikkhus thus Friends bhikkhus  Friend they replied
The Venerable Sariputta said this
'One of right view one of right view' is said friends
In what way is a noble disciple one of right view whose view is straight who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true Dhamma
Indeed friend we would come from far away to learn from the Venerable Sariputta the meaning of this statement
It would be good if the Venerable Sariputta would explain the meaning of this statement
Having heard it from him the bhikkhus will remember it
Then friends listen and attend closely to what I shall say
Yes friend the bhikkhus replied
The Venerable Sariputta said this
When friends a noble disciple understands the unwholesome the root of the unwholesome the wholesome and the root of the wholesome in that way he is one of right view whose view is straight who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true Dhamma
And what friends is the unwholesome what is the root of the unwholesome what is the wholesome what is the root of the wholesome
Killing living beings is unwholesome taking what is not given is unwholesome misconduct in sensual pleasures is unwholesome false speech is unwholesome malicious speech is unwholesome harsh speech is unwholesome gossip is unwholesome covetousness is unwholesome ill will is unwholesome wrong view is unwholesome
This is called the unwholesome
And what is the root of the unwholesome
Greed is a root of the unwholesome hate is a root of the unwholesome delusion is a root of the unwholesome
This is called the root of the unwholesome
And what is the wholesome
Abstention from killing living beings is wholesome abstention from taking what is not given is wholesome abstention from misconduct in sensual pleasures is wholesome abstention from false speech is wholesome abstention from malicious speech is wholesome abstention from harsh speech is wholesome abstention from gossip is wholesome noncovetousness is wholesome nonill will is wholesome right view is wholesome
This is called the wholesome
And what is the root of the wholesome
Nongreed is a root of the wholesome nonhate is a root of the wholesome nondelusion is a root of the wholesome
This is called the root of the wholesome
When a noble disciple has thus understood the unwholesome the root of the unwholesome the wholesome and the root of the wholesome he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust he abolishes the underlying tendency to aversion he extirpates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit 'I am' and by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge he here and now makes an end of suffering
In that way too a noble disciple is one of right view whose view is straight who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true Dhamma
Saying Good friend the bhikkhus delighted and rejoiced in the Venerable Sariputta's words
Then they asked him a further question But friend might there be another way in which a noble disciple is one of right view and has arrived at this true Dhamma  There might be friends
When friends a noble disciple understands nutriment the origin of nutriment the cessation of nutriment and the way leading to the cessation of nutriment in that way he is one of right view and has arrived at this true Dhamma

That is what the Venerable Sariputta said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Venerable Sariputta's words
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Then two brahmans  feeble old men aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of life years old  went to the Blessed One
On arrival they exchanged courteous greetings with him and after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to him Master Gotama we are brahmans  feeble old men aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of life years old
And we have done no admirable deeds no skillful deeds no deeds that allay our fears
Teach us Master Gotama
Instruct us Master Gotama for our longterm benefit  happiness
Indeed brahmans you are feeble old men aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of life years old
And you have done no admirable deeds no skillful deeds no deeds that allay your fears
This world is on fire with aging illness  death
With the world thus on fire with aging illness  death any restraint of body speech  intellect practiced here will be one's shelter cave island  refuge after death in the world beyond
Thus have I heard
Once the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Then one evening the venerable MahaCunda rose from meditative seclusion and went to the Blessed One
Having paid homage to him he sat down at one side and spoke thus to the Blessed One
Venerable sir there are these various views that arise in the world concerning selfdoctrines or worlddoctrines
Does the abandoning and discarding of such views come about in a monk who is only at the beginning of his reflections
Cunda as to those several views that arise in the world concerning selfdoctrines and worlddoctrines if in which these views arise in which they underlie and become active is seen with right wisdom as it actually is thus 'This is not mine this I am not this is not my self'  then the abandoning of these views their discarding takes place in him
It may be Cunda that some monk detached from senseobjects detached from unsalutary ideas enters into the first absorption that is born of detachment accompanied by thoughtconception and discursive thinking and filled with rapture and joy and he then might think 'I am abiding in effacement' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these that are called 'effacement' in the Noble One's discipline they are called 'abidings in ease here and now'
It may be that after the stilling of thought conception and discursive thinking he gains the inner tranquillity and harmony of the second absorption that is free of thoughtconception and discursive thinking born of concentration and filled with rapture and joy and he then might think 'I am abiding in effacement' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these that are called 'effacement' in the Noble One's discipline they are called 'abidings in ease here and now'
It may be that after the fading away of rapture the monk dwells in equanimity mindful and clearly aware and he experiences a happiness in his body of which the Noble Ones say 'Happily lives he who dwells in equanimity and is mindful'  that third absorption he wins and he then might think 'I am abiding in effacement' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these that are called 'effacement' in the Noble One's discipline they are called 'abidings in ease here and now'
It may be that with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief he enters upon and abides in the fourth absorption which is beyond pleasure and pain and has purity of mindfulness due to equanimity and he then might think 'I am abiding in effacement' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these that are called 'effacement' in the Noble One's discipline they are called 'abidings in ease here and now'
It may be that with the entire transcending of perceptions of corporeality with the disappearance of perceptions of senseresponse' with nonattention to perceptions of variety thinking 'Space is infinite' some monk enters upon and abides in the sphere of infinite space and he then might think 'I am abiding in effacement' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these that are called 'effacement' in the Noble One's discipline they are called 'peaceful abidings'
It may be that by entirely transcending the sphere of infinite space thinking 'Consciousness is infinite' some monk enters and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness and he then might think 'I am abiding in effacement' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these that are called 'effacement' in the Noble One's discipline they are called 'peaceful abidings'
It may be that by entirely transcending the sphere of infinite consciousness some monk enters and abides in the sphere of nothingness and he then might think I am abiding in effacement' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these that are called 'effacement' in the Noble One's discipline they are called 'peaceful abidings'
It may be that by entirely transcending the sphere of nothingness some monk enters and abides in the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception and he then might think 'I am abiding in effacement' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these that are called 'effacement' in the Noble one's discipline they are called 'peaceful abidings'
But herein Cunda effacement should be practiced by you
Cunda I say that even the arising of a thought concerned with salutary things is of great importance not to speak of bodily acts and words conforming
Therefore Cunda
Suppose Cunda there were an uneven road and another even road by which to avoid it and suppose there were an uneven ford and another even ford by which to avoid it
So too
Cunda as all unsalutary states lead downward and all salutary states lead upward even so Cunda
Cunda it is impossible that one who is himself sunk in the mire should pull out another who is sunk in the mire
But it is possible Cunda that one not sunk in the mire himself should pull out another who is sunk in the mire
It is not possible Cunda that one who is himself not restrained not disciplined and not quenched should make others restrained and disciplined should make them attain to the full quenching
But it is possible Cunda that one who is himself restrained disciplined and fully quenched should make others restrained and disciplined should make them attain to the full quenching
Even so Cunda
Thus Cunda I have shown to you the instruction on effacement I have shown to you the instruction on thought's arising I have shown to you the instruction on avoidance I have shown to you the instruction on the way upward I have shown to you the instruction on quenching
What can be done for his disciples by a Master who seeks their welfare and has compassion and pity on them that I have done for you Cunda
There are these roots of trees there are empty places
Meditate Cunda do not delay lest you later regret it
'This is my message to you
Thus spoke the Blessed One
Satisfied the venerable Cunda rejoiced in the Blessed One's words
According to the Comy the Thera's question concerns those who overrate the degree of their achievement ie those who believe that in their meditative practice they have achieved this or that result while actually they have not
Overestimation in that sense does not arise in ignorant common people who are entirely engrossed in worldly life nor does it arise in Noble Disciples because in a streamwinner the overestimation does not arise that he is a oncereturner etc
Selfoverestimation can occur only in one who actually practices and has temporarily subdued the defilements by way of tranquillity or insight
MahaCunda Thera being an arahant was no selfoverrater himself but in formulating his question he put himself in the place of one who is or as others say there may have been such selfoverraters among his pupils and for conveying to them the Buddha's reply he put his question
Underlie ie habitually occur
Comy This refers to views which having been indulged in repeatedly have become strong and have not been removed SubComy By ultimate elimination
Become active
Comy Wrong views have arrived at the doors of body and speech ie which have found expression in words and deeds
The common meaning of sallekha is austere practice or asceticism but in the Buddha's usage it is the radical effacing or removal of the defilements

The eight stages of meditation given here in the discourse consist of the four finematerial absorptions and the four immaterial absorptions
Comy
says that these meditative attainments are in common with the ascetics outside
Comy The overrater's meditative absorption is neither 'effacement' nor is it the 'path of practice for effacement'
And why not
Because that jhana is not used by him as a basis for insight that is after rising from jhana he does not scrutinize the formations
His jhana produces only onepointedness of mind and is as our text says an abiding in ease here and now
SubComy If one wishing to overcome the suffering of samsara goes with joyful confidence for refuge to the Triple Gem then this Refuge will be for him a supporting condition for higher virtue etc and it may gradually lead him to the attainment of the path of understanding
The Fortyfour Ways of Effacement
SubComy But why is harmlessness mentioned at the very beginning
Because it is the root of all virtues harmlessness namely is a synonym of compassion
Especially it is the rootcause of morality because it makes one refrain from immorality which has as its characteristic mark the harming of others
Just as the killing of living beings has the harming of others as its mark so also the taking away of others' property for 'robbing a man's wealth is worse than stabbing him' Similarly chastity removes the cause for the pains of child bearing etc and there is hardly a need to mention the harm done by adultery

Obvious is also the harm done to others by deception by causing dissension and by backbiting
The mark of harming others is also attached to gossip because it takes away what is beneficial and causes to arise what is not beneficial to covetousness as it causes one to take what is not given to ill will as it causes killing etc to wrong views as they are the cause of all that is unbeneficial
One who holds wrong views may in the conviction of acting righteously kill living beings and incite others to do likewise
There is nothing to say about other
Harmlessness has the characteristic mark of making one refrain from immorality which on its part has the mark of harming
Hence harmlessness is an especially strong productive cause of morality and morality again is the basis for concentration of mind while concentration is the basis for wisdom
In that way harmlessness is the root of all virtues
Furthermore in the case of the highest type of men who have noble aspirations who act considerately and wisely also their mental concentration and their wisdom just as their morality is conducive to the weal and happiness of others
In that way too compassion is the root of all virtues and therefore it has been mentioned at the beginning
Now the salutary courses of action are to show that these states are produced by harmlessness
Then follow the eight states of rightness to show that they must be brought about by basing them on morality which is the root of these virtues
Now the separation from the hindrances is included to indicate that this is the primary task for one intent on purifying the eightfold path
Then follows the cleansing from the defilements to indicate that effacement is accomplished by giving up anger etc
And the cleansing from the defilements will be successful when aided by amenability to advice noble friendship and heedful diligence
Now the seven noble qualities are included to show that they will come to perfection in him who is endowed with amenability and the other and that they on their part after having strengthened insight will lead to the paths of sanctitude

Finally the passage on 'misapprehending according to one's individual views' etc
is meant to indicate that for such a one that wrong attitude is an obstacle to the attainment of the supramundane virtues and is therefore to be avoided totally
This passage on misapprehending is also meant to show that one who by the right conduct here described is in the process of attaining one of the paths of sanctitude will be led to the acme of effacement
In this manner should be understood the purpose of stating these fortyfour modes of effacement as well as the order in which they appear in the discourse
Comy
says that a salutary thought is of great importance as it leads entirely to weal and happiness and as it is the cause for the subsequent actions conforming to it
Examples are given beginning with the intention to give almsfood to monks up to the aspiration for Buddhahood
The SubComy however says that in some cases the importance is not in the thought itself but only in the actual execution of it
This certainly applies to the intention to give alms etc
But in the efforts for effacing the defilements the formation of a mental attitude directed towards it in other words the heart's resolve is certainly an important factor
This section of the discourse has been condensed in the present translation
But he who has chosen the path of effacement as his way of practice is well advised to repeat all fortyfour items linking them with his heart's earnest resolve
Also the last two sections of the discourse have been condensed
Any salutary states of mind whether they produce rebirth or not and whether in a given rebirth they produce kamma results or not  all because of their type lead upwards
They are just like that because on the occasion of their yielding a kamma result that result will be desirable and pleasant
The connection is as follows just as unsalutary states lead downwards so it is with that one state of harmfulness for him who is harmful
Just as all salutary states lead upwards so it is with that one state of harmlessness for him who is harmless
Suppose there is a king who sends a letter to the border region and the people there unable to read it by themselves have the letter read to them by another able to do it
Having learned of the contents they respond with respect knowing it as the king's order
But they do not think that it is the letter reader's order he will receive praise only for his smooth and fluent reading of the letter
Similarly even if preachers of the ability of Sariputta Thera expound the Dhamma still they are just like readers of a letter written by another
Their sermon should truly be attributed to the Blessed One like the decree to the king
The preachers however receive their limited praise just because they expound the Dhamma with a smooth and fluent diction
Hence that statement in the discourse is correct
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Then two brahmans  feeble old men aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of life years old  went to the Blessed One
On arrival they exchanged courteous greetings with him and after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to him Master Gotama we are brahmans  feeble old men aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of life years old
And we have done no admirable deeds no skillful deeds no deeds that allay our fears
Teach us Master Gotama
Instruct us Master Gotama for our longterm benefit  happiness
Indeed brahmans you are feeble old men aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of life years old
And you have done no admirable deeds no skillful deeds no deeds that allay your fears
This world is swept away by aging by illness by death
With the world thus swept away by aging illness  death any restraint of body speech  intellect practiced here will be one's shelter cave island  refuge after death in the world beyond
Thus have I heard
Once the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
There he addressed the monks thus Monks  Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this
Monks suppose a cloth were stained and dirty and a dyer dipped it in some dye or other whether blue or yellow or red or pink it would take the dye badly and be impure in color
And why is that
Because the cloth was not clean
So too monks when the mind is defiled an unhappy destination may be expected
Monks suppose a cloth were clean and bright and a dyer dipped it in some dye or other whether blue or yellow or red or pink it would take the dye well and be pure in color
And why is that
Because the cloth was clean
So too monks when the mind is undefiled a happy destination may be expected
And what monks are the defilements of the mind
Covetousness and unrighteous greed are a defilement of the mind ill will is a defilement of the mind anger is a defilement of the mind hostility denigration domineering envy jealousy hypocrisy fraud obstinacy presumption conceit arrogance vanity negligence is a defilement of the mind
Knowing monks covetousness and unrighteous greed to be a defilement of the mind the monk abandons them
Knowing ill will to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing anger to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing hostility to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing denigration to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing domineering to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing envy to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing jealousy to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing hypocrisy to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing fraud to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing obstinacy to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing presumption to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing conceit to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing arrogance to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing vanity to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
Knowing negligence to be a defilement of the mind he abandons it
When in the monk who thus knows that covetousness and unrighteous greed are a defilement of the mind this covetousness and unrighteous greed have been abandoned when in him who thus knows that ill will is a defilement of the mind this ill will has been abandoned when in him who thus knows that negligence is a defilement of the mind this negligence has been abandoned  
 he thereupon gains unwavering confidence in the Buddha thus 'Thus indeed is the Blessed One he is accomplished fully enlightened endowed with vision and conduct sublime knower of the worlds the incomparable guide of men who are tractable the teacher of gods and men enlightened and blessed'
 he gains unwavering confidence in the Dhamma thus 'Well proclaimed by the Blessed One is the Dhamma realizable here and now possessed of immediate result bidding you come and see accessible and knowable individually by the wise
 he gains unwavering confidence in the Sangha thus 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples has entered on the good way has entered on the straight way has entered on the true way has entered on the proper way that is to say the four pairs of men the eight types of persons this Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of reverential salutation the incomparable field of merit for the world'
When he has given up renounced let go abandoned and relinquished in part he knows 'I am endowed with unwavering confidence in the Buddha in the Dhamma in the Sangha and he gains enthusiasm for the goal gains enthusiasm for the Dhamma gains gladness connected with the Dhamma
When he is gladdened joy is born in him being joyous in mind his body becomes tranquil his body being tranquil he feels happiness and the mind of him who is happy becomes concentrated
He knows 'I have given up renounced let go abandoned and relinquished in part' and he gains enthusiasm for the goal gains enthusiasm for the Dhamma gains gladness connected with the Dhamma
When he is gladdened joy is born in him being joyous in mind his body becomes tranquil when his body is tranquil he feels happiness and the mind of him who is happy becomes concentrated
If monks a monk of such virtue such concentration and such wisdom eats almsfood consisting of choice hillrice together with various sauces and curries even that will be no obstacle for him
Just as cloth that is stained and dirty becomes clean and bright with the help of pure water or just as gold becomes clean and bright with the help of a furnace so too if a monk of such virtue such concentration and such wisdom eats almsfood consisting of choice hillrice together with various sauces and curries even that will be no obstacle for him
He abides having suffused with a mind of lovingkindness one direction of the world likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth and so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides suffusing the entire universe with lovingkindness with a mind grown great lofty boundless and free from enmity and ill will
He abides having suffused with a mind of compassion of sympathetic joy of equanimity one direction of the world likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth and so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides suffusing the entire universe with equanimity with a mind grown great lofty boundless and free from enmity and ill will
He understands what exists what is low what is excellent and what escape there is from this field of perception
When he knows and sees in this way his mind becomes liberated from the canker of sensual desire liberated from the canker of becoming liberated from the canker of ignorance
When liberated there is knowledge 'It is liberated' and he knows 'Birth is exhausted the life of purity has been lived the task is done there is no more of this to come' Such a monk is called 'one bathed with the inner bathing
Now at that time the brahman Sundarika Bharadvaja was seated not far from the Blessed One and he spoke to the Blessed One thus But does Master Gotama go to the Bahuka River to bathe
What good brahman is the Bahuka River
What can the Bahuka River do
Truly Master Gotama many people believe that the Bahuka River gives purification many people believe that the Bahuka River gives merit
For in the Bahuka River many people wash away the evil deeds they have done
Then the Blessed One addressed the brahman Sundarika Bharadvaja in these stanzas
When this was said the brahman Sundarika Bharadvaja spoke thus
Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent Master Gotama
The Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by Master Gotama as though he were righting the overthrown revealing the hidden showing the way to one who is lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms
I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha
May I receive the going forth under Master Gotama may I receive the full admission
And the brahman Sundarika Bharadvaja received the going forth under the Blessed One and he received the full admission
And not long after his full admission dwelling alone secluded diligent ardent and resolute the venerable Bharadvaja by his own realization understood and attained in this very life that supreme goal of the pure life for which men of good family go forth from home life into homelessness
And he had direct knowledge thus Birth is exhausted the pure life has been lived the task is done there is no more of this to come
And the venerable Bharadvaja became one of the Arahats
The defilements to appear frequently as a group in the discourses eg in Majjh while in Majjh
No
is omitted
A list of seventeen defilements appears regularly in each last discourse of Books to of the Anguttara Nikaya which carry the title Ragapeyyala the Repetitive Text on Greed
In these texts of the Anguttara Nikaya the first two defilements in the above list are called greed and hate to which delusion is added all the fourteen other defilements are identical with the above list
Knowing
SubComy Having known it either through the incipient wisdom or through the wisdom of the two lower paths
He knows the defilements as to their nature cause cessation and means of effecting cessation This application of the formula of the Four Noble Truths to the defilements deserves close attention
Abandons them
Comy He abandons the respective defilement through the noble path where there is 'abandoning by eradication' which according to SubComy
is the final abandoning
Before the attainment of the noble paths all abandoning of defilements is of a temporary nature
See Nyanatiloka Thera Buddhist Dictionary sv
pahana
According to the Comy the sixteen defilements are finally abandoned by the noble paths in the following order
If in the last group of terms covetousness is taken in a restricted sense as referring only to the craving for the five sense objects it is finally abandoned by the path of nonreturning and this is according to Comy
the meaning intended here
All greed however including the hankering after fine material and immaterial existence is eradicated only on the path of Arahatship hence the classification under the latter in the list above
Comy
repeatedly stresses that wherever in our text abandoning is mentioned reference is to the nonreturner for also in the case of defilements overcome on streamentry the states of mind which produce those defilements are eliminated only by the path of nonreturning
The disciple's direct experience of being freed of this or that defilement becomes for him a living test of his former still imperfectly proven trust in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
Now this trust has become a firm conviction an unshakable confidence based on experience
Bhikkhu anamoli translates this paragraph thus And whatever has according to the limitation been given up has been dropped let go abandoned relinquished

In the Vibhanga of the Abhidhamma Pitaka we read in the chapter Jhanavibhanga He is a bhikkhu because he has abandoned defilements limitedly or because he has abandoned defilements without limitation
Comy When reviewing  the abandonment of the defilements and his unwavering confidence strong joy arises in the nonreturner in the thought 'Such and such defilements are now abandoned by me' It is like the joy of a king who learns that a rebellion in the frontier region has been quelled
Enthusiasm
According to Comy the word veda occurs in the Pali texts with three connotations
scripture
joy
knowledge
Here it signifies joy and the knowledge connected with that joy
Attha and dhamma are a frequently occurring pair of terms obviously intended to supplement each other
Often they mean letter and spirit of the doctrine but this hardly fits here
These two terms occur also among the four kinds of analytic knowledge
Atthapatisambhida is explained as the discriminative knowledge of the result of a cause while dhammapatisambhida is concerned with the cause or condition
The Comy
applies now the same interpretation to our present textual passage saying Atthaveda is the enthusiasm arisen in him who reviews his unwavering confidence dhammaveda is the enthusiasm arisen in him who reviews 'the abandonment of the defilement in part' which is the cause of that unwavering confidence Hence the two terms refer to the joy that has as its object the unwavering confidence in the Buddha and so forth and the joy inherent in the knowledge
Our rendering of attha b goal is supported by Comy The unwavering confidence is called attha because it has to be reached ie to be approached in the sense of a limited goal or resultant blessing
Cf
Ang tasmim dhamme atthapatisamvedi ca hoti dhammapatisamvedi ca tassa atthapatisamvedino dhammapatisamvedino pamojjam jayati This text continues as our present discourse does with the arising of joy from gladness
Attha and dhamma refer here to the meaning and text of the Buddha word
 
Comy Having shown the nonreturner's meditation on the Divine Abidings the Blessed One now shows his practice of insight aiming at Arahatship and he indicates his attainment of it by the words 'He understands what exists' etc
This nonreturner having arisen from the meditation on any of the four Divine Abidings defines as 'mind' those very states of the Divine Abidings and the mental factors associated with them
He then defines as 'matter' the heart base being the physical support and the four elements which on their part are the support of the heart base
In that way he defines as 'matter' the elements and corporeal phenomena derived from them
When defining 'mind and matter' in this manner 'he understands what exists'
Hereby a definition of the truth of suffering has been given
Then in comprehending the origin of that suffering he understands 'what is low' Thereby the truth of the origin of suffering has been defined
Further by investigating the means of giving it up he understands 'what is excellent
Hereby the truth of the path has been defined

There are these three governing principles
Which three
The self as a governing principle the cosmos as a governing principle and the Dhamma as a governing principle
And what is the self as a governing principle
There is the case where a monk having gone to a wilderness to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling reflects on this 'It is not for the sake of robes that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness it is not for the sake of almsfood for the sake of lodgings or for the sake of this or that state of becoming that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness
Simply that I am beset by birth aging  death by sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs beset by stress overcome with stress Perhaps the end of this entire mass of suffering  stress might be known Now if I were to seek the same sort of sensual pleasures that I abandoned in going forth from home into homelessness  or a worse sort  that would not be fitting for me' So he reflects on this 'My persistence will be aroused  not lax my mindfulness established  not confused my body calm  not aroused my mind centered  unified' Having made himself his governing principle he abandons what is unskillful develops what is skillful abandons what is blameworthy develops what is unblameworthy and looks after himself in a pure way
This is called the self as a governing principle
And what is the cosmos as a governing principle
There is the case where a monk having gone to a wilderness to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling reflects on this 'It is not for the sake of robes that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness it is not for the sake of almsfood for the sake of lodgings or for the sake of this or that state of becoming that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness
Simply that I am beset by birth aging  death by sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs beset by stress overcome with stress Perhaps the end of this entire mass of suffering  stress might be known Now if I having gone forth were to think thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will or thoughts of harmfulness great is the community of this cosmos
And in the great community of this cosmos there are brahmans  contemplatives endowed with psychic power clairvoyant skilled the minds of others
They can see even from afar
Even up close they are invisible
With their awareness they know the minds of others
They would know this of me Look my friends at this clansman who  though he has in good faith gone forth from the home life into homelessness  remains overcome with evil unskillful mental qualities There are also devas endowed with psychic power clairvoyant skilled the minds of others
They can see even from afar
Even up close they are invisible
With their awareness they know the minds of others
They would know this of me Look my friends at this clansman who  though he has in good faith gone forth from the home life into homelessness  remains overcome with evil unskillful mental qualities' So he reflects on this 'My persistence will be aroused  not lax my mindfulness established  not confused my body calm  not aroused my mind centered  unified' Having made the cosmos his governing principle he abandons what is unskillful develops what is skillful abandons what is blameworthy develops what is unblameworthy and looks after himself in a pure way
This is called the cosmos as a governing principle
And what is the Dhamma as a governing principle
There is the case where a monk having gone to a wilderness to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling reflects on this 'It is not for the sake of robes that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness it is not for the sake of almsfood for the sake of lodgings or for the sake of this or that state of becoming that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness
Simply that I am beset by birth aging  death by sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs beset by stress overcome with stress Perhaps the end of this entire mass of suffering  stress might be known Now the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One to be seen here  now timeless inviting all to come  see pertinent to be seen by the wise for themselves
There are fellow practitioners of the chaste life who dwell knowing  seeing it
If I  having gone forth in this welltaught Dhamma  Vinaya  were to remain lazy  heedless that would not be fitting for me' So he reflects on this 'My persistence will be aroused  not lax my mindfulness established  not confused my body calm  not aroused my mind centered  unified' Having made the Dhamma his governing principle he abandons what is unskillful develops what is skillful abandons what is blameworthy develops what is unblameworthy and looks after himself in a pure way
This is called the Dhamma as a governing principle
These are the three governing principles
Translator's note The Pali Text Society editions treat this discourse as two discourses    divided at the triple asterisk
Asian editions treat it as one numbered III
The autobiographical verse at the end of the second half  which is identical with the verse concluding AN
 fits neatly with the autobiographical first half of the discourse suggesting that the two halves were meant to go together
Monks I lived in refinement utmost refinement total refinement
My father even had lotus ponds made in our palace one where redlotuses bloomed one where white lotuses bloomed one where blue lotuses bloomed all for my sake
I used no sandalwood that was not from Varanasi
My turban was from Varanasi as were my tunic my lower garments  my outer cloak
A white sunshade was held over me day  night to protect me from cold heat dust dirt  dew
I had three palaces one for the cold season one for the hot season one for the rainy season
During the four months of the rainy season I was entertained in the rainyseason palace by minstrels without a single man among them and I did not once come down from the palace
Whereas the servants workers  retainers in other people's homes are fed meals of lentil soup  broken rice in my father's home the servants workers  retainers were fed wheat rice and meat
Even though I was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me 'When an untaught runofthemill person himself subject to aging not beyond aging sees another who is aged he is horrified humiliated  disgusted oblivious to himself that he too is subject to aging not beyond aging
If I  who am subject to aging not beyond aging  were to be horrified humiliated  disgusted on seeing another person who is aged that would not be fitting for me' As I noticed this the young person's intoxication with youth entirely dropped away
Even though I was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me 'When an untaught runofthemill person himself subject to illness not beyond illness sees another who is ill he is horrified humiliated  disgusted oblivious to himself that he too is subject to illness not beyond illness
And if I  who am subject to illness not beyond illness  were to be horrified humiliated  disgusted on seeing another person who is ill that would not be fitting for me' As I noticed this the healthy person's intoxication with health entirely dropped away
Even though I was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me 'When an untaught runofthemill person himself subject to death not beyond death sees another who is dead he is horrified humiliated  disgusted oblivious to himself that he too is subject to death not beyond death
And if I  who am subject to death not beyond death  were to be horrified humiliated  disgusted on seeing another person who is dead that would not be fitting for me' As I noticed this the living person's intoxication with life entirely dropped away
  
Monks there are these three forms of intoxication
Which three
Intoxication with youth intoxication with health intoxication with life
Drunk with the intoxication of youth an uninstructed runofthemill person engages in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct
Having engaged in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct he  on the breakup of the body after death  reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
Drunk with the intoxication of health an uninstructed runofthemill person engages in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct
Having engaged in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct he  on the breakup of the body after death  reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
Drunk with the intoxication of life an uninstructed runofthemill person engages in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct
Having engaged in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct he  on the breakup of the body after death  reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
Drunk with the intoxication of youth a monk leaves the training and returns to the lower life
Drunk with the intoxication of health a monk leaves the training and returns to the lower life
Drunk with the intoxication of life a monk leaves the training and returns to the lower life

There is the case of the sick person who will recover from that illness if he receives amenable food amenable medicine  proper nursing but not if he doesn't
Now it is because of the sick person who will recover from that illness if he receives amenable food amenable medicine  proper nursing  but not if he doesn't  that food for the sick has been allowed medicine for the sick has been allowed nursing for the sick has been allowed
And it is because there is this sort of sick person that the other sorts of sick persons are to be nursed as well

On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Varanasi in the Deer Park at Isipatana
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said Once monks there was a king named Pacetana
One day King Pacetana said to his chariot maker 'My good chariot maker in six months time from now a battle will take place
Can you make me a new pair of chariot wheels'
'Yes your majesty I can' the chariot maker replied to the king
Then in six months minus six days the chariot maker finished one wheel
King Pacetana said to him 'In six days time from now the battle will take place
Will the pair of chariot wheels be finished'
'Your majesty in these six months minus six days I have finished one wheel'
'But can you finish the second wheel in these six days'
'Yes your majesty I can' the chariot maker replied to the king
Then after finishing the second wheel in six days the chariot maker took the pair of wheels to the king and on arrival said to him 'Here is your new pair of chariot wheels all finished your majesty'
'And what is the difference between your wheel that took six months minus six days to finish and your wheel that took six days to finish
I don't see any difference between them at all'
'There is a difference between them your majesty
Look at the difference' Then the chariot maker took the chariot wheel finished in six days and set it rolling
Going as far as its momentum carried it it twirled around and around and fell to the ground
But then he took the chariot wheel finished in six months minus six days and set it rolling
Going as far as its momentum carried it it stood still as if fixed on an axle
'Now what is the reason my good chariot maker what is the cause why the chariot wheel finished in six days when set rolling goes as far as its momentum carries it and then twirling around and around falls to the ground
And what is the reason what is the cause why the chariot wheel finished in six months minus six days when set rolling goes as far as its momentum carries it and then stands still as if fixed on an axle'
'Your majesty as for the wheel finished in six days its rim is crooked with faults  flaws
Its spokes are crooked with faults  flaws
Its hub is crooked with faults  flaws
Because its rim spokes hub are crooked with faults  flaws when set rolling it goes as far as its momentum carries it and then twirling around and around falls to the ground
But as for the wheel finished in six months minus six days its rim is not crooked with no faults or flaws
Its spokes are not crooked with no faults or flaws
Its hub is not crooked with no faults or flaws
Because its rim spokes hub are not crooked with no faults or flaws when set rolling it goes as far as its momentum carries it and then stands still as if fixed on an axle'
Now monks the thought may occur to you that the chariot maker on that occasion was someone else but it shouldn't be seen in that way
I myself was the chariot maker on that occasion
I was skilled in dealing with the crookedness the faults the flaws of wood
Now I am a worthy one rightly selfawakened skilled in dealing with the crookedness faults  flaws of bodily action skilled in dealing with the crookedness faults  flaws of verbal action skilled in dealing with the crookedness faults  flaws of mental action
Any monk or nun in whom the crookedness faults  flaws of bodily action are not abandoned the crookedness faults  flaws of verbal action are not abandoned the crookedness faults  flaws of mental action are not abandoned has fallen away from this Dhamma  Discipline just like the wheel finished in six days
But any monk or nun in whom the crookedness faults  flaws of bodily action are abandoned the crookedness faults  flaws of verbal action are abandoned the crookedness faults  flaws of mental action are abandoned stands firm in this Dhamma  Discipline just like the wheel finished in six months minus six days
Thus you should train yourselves 'We will abandon crookedness faults  flaws in bodily action
We will abandon crookedness faults  flaws in verbal action
We will abandon crookedness faults  flaws in mental action' That's how you should train yourselves
Monks a fool is characterized by hisher actions
A wise person is characterized by hisher actions
It is through the activities of one's life that one's discernment shines
A person endowed with three things is to be recognized as a fool
Which three
Bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct
A person endowed with these three things is to be recognized as a fool
A person endowed with three things is to be recognized as a wise person
Which three
Good bodily conduct good verbal conduct good mental conduct
A person endowed with these three things is to be recognized as a wise person
Thus monks you should train yourselves 'We will avoid the three things that endowed with which one is to be recognized as a fool
We will undertake  maintain the three things that endowed with which one is to be recognized as a wise person' That's how you should train yourselves

Monks there are these two conditions for the arising of wrong view
Which two
The voice of another and inappropriate attention
These are the two conditions for the arising of wrong view
Monks there are these two conditions for the arising of right view
Which two
The voice of another and appropriate attention
These are the two conditions for the arising of right view
There are several problems with this interpretation the first being that it leaves no room for an event happening many times in the Canon people gaining right view simply on hearing the words of another person
One scholar has tried to get around this objection saying that the voice from another world must refer to the voice of the Buddha or to one of the noble disciples who gained Awakening on hearing the Buddha's own voice
The implication here is that only the words of these two classes of people can inspire right view
This position however is disproved by the fact that in MvI
Ven
Sariputta who at that point has not yet met the Buddha is able to inspire the arising of the Dhamma eye in Ven
Moggallana
This passage appears in the long origin story leading up to the rules dealing with ordination and proves an important point in validating the tradition of ordination that a person who has not met the Buddha can still inspire right view and even Awakening in the mind of another
So the Canon itself disproves both of these otherworldly interpretations of this statement
As for Woodward's linguistic arguments It is hard for a nonnative speaker of a dead language to know the reasoning in the mind of a native speaker in that language but it might have been the case that the Buddha avoided the word aññassa for other because it could have easily been confused for another meaning of aññassa pertaining to the knowledge of an arahant As for vaacii and aññatarassa neither of them fits the context
Vaacii is a stemform used in compounds and aññatarassa means of a certain person This leaves vaacaa statement as a possible alternative but perhaps the Buddha chose ghoso to leave room for the possibility that there are times when one can bring another to hisher senses simply by clearing one's throat
Finally concerning the passage from MN This sutta is a long series of questions and answers that abruptly switch from topic to topic so it's hard to say that the sutta provides a clear sense of context for any of its statements
That said however it's not even the case that this passage follows on a statement about abnormal powers
It actually follows on two questions about discernment which in turn follow on a discussion of the formless jhanas  apparently the abnormal powers mentioned by Woodward  and as AN and MN show it's possible to develop discernment based on these attainments without psychic powers
Monks these two people are hard to find in the world
Which two
The one who is first to do a kindness and the one who is grateful for a kindness done and feels obligated to repay it

Monks there are these two assemblies
Which two
The assembly trained in bombast and not in crossquestioning and the assembly trained in crossquestioning and not in bombast
And which is the assembly trained in bombast and not in crossquestioning
There is the case where in any assembly when the discourses of the Tathagata  deep deep in their meaning transcendent connected with emptiness  are recited the monks don't listen don't lend ear don't set their hearts on knowing them don't regard them as worth grasping or mastering
But when discourses that are literary works  the works of poets artful in sound artful in expression the work of outsiders words of disciples  are recited they listen they lend ear they set their hearts on knowing them they regard them as worth grasping  mastering
Yet when they have mastered that Dhamma they don't crossquestion one another about it don't dissect 'How is this
What is the meaning of this' They don't make open what isn't open don't make plain what isn't plain don't dispel doubt on its various doubtful points
This is called an assembly trained in bombast not in crossquestioning

On one occasion Ven
Maha Kaccana was staying at Madhura in the Gunda Forest
Then Kandarayana the brahman went to Ven
Maha Kaccana and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Maha Kaccana I have heard it said Master Kaccana that 'Kaccana the contemplative does not raise his hands in respect to aged venerable brahmans  advanced in years come to the last stage of life  nor does he rise up to greet them nor does he offer them a seat' Insofar as you don't raise your hands in respect to aged venerable brahmans  advanced in years come to the last stage of life  nor rise up to greet them nor offer them a seat that is simply not right Master Kaccana
Brahman the Blessed One  the one who knows the one who sees worthy  rightly selfawakened  has declared the level of one who is venerable and the level of one who is a youngster
Even if one is venerable  years old  yet if one partakes of sensuality lives in the midst of sensuality burns with sensual fever is chewed up by sensual thoughts and is eager in the search for sensuality then one is reckoned simply as a young fool not an elder
But if one is a youngster youthful  a blackhaired young person endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life  yet does not partake of sensuality does not live in the midst of sensuality does not burn with sensual fever is not chewed up by sensual thoughts and is not eager in the search for sensuality then one is reckoned as a wise elder
When this was said Kandarayana the brahman rose up from his seat arranged his cloak over one shoulder and bowed down at the feet of the monks who were youngsters You sirs are the venerable ones standing on the level of those who are venerable
We are the youngsters standing on the level of those who are youngsters
Magnificent Master Kaccana
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Kaccana  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monks
May Master Kaccana remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for life

Then a certain brahman approached the Blessed One
Having approached the Blessed One he exchanged friendly greetings
After pleasant conversation had passed between them he sat to one side
Having sat to one side the brahman spoke to the Blessed One thus
What does the Venerable Gotama assert what does he preach
I am one who asserts that which ought to be done brahman and one who asserts that which ought not to be done
But in what way is the Venerable Gotama one who asserts that which ought to be done and one who asserts that which ought not to be done
I say that which ought not to be done brahman of wrongdoing by body wrongdoing by speech wrongdoing by the thinking mind of manifold evil and unwholesome thoughts I say that which ought not to be done
I say that which ought to be done brahman of doing good by body doing good by speech doing good by the thinking mind of manifold wholesome thoughts I say that which ought to be done
In this way brahman I am one who preaches that which ought to be done and one who preaches that which ought not to be done
Superb Venerable Gotama
Superb Venerable Gotama
Venerable Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been turned upside down revealing what had been concealed showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark Those who have eyes see forms Just so the Venerable Gotama has illuminated the Dhamma in various ways
I go to Venerable Gotama as refuge and to the Dhamma and to the assembly of monks
From this day for as long as I am endowed with breath let Venerable Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge
Monks I will teach you the level of a person of no integrity and the level of a person of integrity
Listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said Now what is the level of a person of no integrity
A person of no integrity is ungrateful  unthankful
This ingratitude this lack of thankfulness is advocated by rude people
It is entirely on the level of people of no integrity
A person of integrity is grateful  thankful
This gratitude this thankfulness is advocated by civil people
It is entirely on the level of people of integrity
I tell you monks there are two people who are not easy to repay
Which two
Your mother  father
Even if you were to carry your mother on one shoulder  your father on the other shoulder for years and were to look after them by anointing massaging bathing  rubbing their limbs and they were to defecate  urinate right there you would not in that way pay or repay your parents
If you were to establish your mother  father in absolute sovereignty over this great earth abounding in the seven treasures you would not in that way pay or repay your parents
Why is that
Mother  father do much for their children
They care for them they nourish them they introduce them to this world
But anyone who rouses his unbelieving mother  father settles  establishes them in conviction rouses his unvirtuous mother  father settles  establishes them in virtue rouses his stingy mother  father settles  establishes them in generosity rouses his foolish mother  father settles  establishes them in discernment To this extent one pays  repays one's mother  father
Monks these two slander the Tathagata
Which two
He who explains a discourse whose meaning needs to be inferred as one whose meaning has already been fully drawn out
And he who explains a discourse whose meaning has already been fully drawn out as one whose meaning needs to be inferred
These are two who slander the Tathagata
These two qualities have a share in clear knowing
Which two
Tranquillity  insight
When tranquillity is developed what purpose does it serve
The mind is developed
And when the mind is developed what purpose does it serve
Passion is abandoned
When insight is developed what purpose does it serve
Discernment is developed
And when discernment is developed what purpose does it serve
Ignorance is abandoned
Defiled by passion the mind is not released
Defiled by ignorance discernment does not develop
Thus from the fading of passion is there awarenessrelease
From the fading of ignorance is there discernmentrelease

Bhikkhus these two bright principles protect the world
What are the two
Shame and fear of wrongdoing
If bhikkhus these two bright principles did not protect the world there would not be discerned respect for mother or maternal aunt or maternal uncle's wife or a teacher's wife or the wives of other honored persons and the world would have fallen into promiscuity as with goats sheep chickens pigs dogs and jackals
But as these two bright principles protect the world there is discerned respect for mother and the wives of other honored persons
Monks these two bright qualities guard the world
Which two
Conscience  concern
If these two bright qualities did not guard the world there would be no recognition of 'mother' here no recognition of 'mother's sister' 'uncle's wife' 'teacher's wife' or 'wife of those who deserve respect' The world would be immersed in promiscuity like rams with goats roosters with pigs or dogs with jackals

Then Ven
Ananda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him I say categorically Ananda that bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct should not be done

Given that I have declared Ananda that bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct should not be done these are the drawbacks one can expect when doing what should not be done One can fault oneself observant people on close examination criticize one one's bad reputation gets spread about one dies confused and  on the breakup of the body after death  one reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell

Abandon what is unskillful monks
It is possible to abandon what is unskillful
If it were not possible to abandon what is unskillful I would not say to you 'Abandon what is unskillful' But because it is possible to abandon what is unskillful I say to you 'Abandon what is unskillful' If this abandoning of what is unskillful were conducive to harm and pain I would not say to you 'Abandon what is unskillful' But because this abandoning of what is unskillful is conducive to benefit and pleasure I say to you 'Abandon what is unskillful'

Monks I have known two qualities through experience discontent with regard to skillful qualities and unrelenting exertion
Relentlessly I exerted myself 'Gladly would I let the flesh  blood in my body dry up leaving just the skin tendons  bones but if I have not attained what can be reached through human firmness human persistence human striving there will be no relaxing my persistence' From this heedfulness of mine was attained Awakening
From this heedfulness of mine was attained the unexcelled freedom from bondage
You too monks should relentlessly exert yourselves 'Gladly would we let the flesh  blood in our bodies dry up leaving just the skin tendons  bones but if we have not attained what can be reached through human firmness human persistence human striving there will be no relaxing our persistence' You too in no long time will reach  remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for yourselves in the here  now
Thus you should train yourselves 'We will relentlessly exert ourselves Gladly would we let the flesh  blood in our bodies dry up leaving just the skin tendons  bones but if we have not attained what can be reached through human firmness human persistence human striving there will be no relaxing our persistence' That's how you should train yourselves
Luminous monks is the mind
And it is defiled by incoming defilements
Luminous monks is the mind
And it is freed from incoming defilements
Luminous monks is the mind
And it is defiled by incoming defilements
The uninstructed runofthemill person doesn't discern that as it actually is present which is why I tell you that  for the uninstructed runofthemill person  there is no development of the mind
Luminous monks is the mind
And it is freed from incoming defilements
The wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones discerns that as it actually is present which is why I tell you that  for the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones  there is development of the mind
This statement has engendered a great deal of controversy over the centuries
The commentary maintains that mind here refers to the bhavangacitta the momentary mental state between periods when the mental stream adverts to objects but this statement raises more questions than it answers
There is no reference to the bhavangacitta or the mental stream in any of the suttas and because the commentaries compare the bhavangacitta to deep sleep why is it called luminous
And why would the perception of its luminosity be a prerequisite for developing the mind
And further if mind in this discourse means bhavangacitta what would it mean to develop the bhavangacitta
Another interpretation equates the luminosity of the mind with the consciousness without feature described as luminous in MN and DN but this interpretation also has problems
According to MN that consciousness partakes of nothing in the describable world not even the Allness of the All so how could it possibly be defiled
And because it is not realized until the goal of the practice is reached why would the perception of its luminosity be a prerequisite for developing the mind
And again if mind here means consciousness without feature how could the sutta talk of its development
A more reasonable approach to understanding the statement can be derived from taking it in context the luminous mind is the mind that the meditator is trying to develop
To perceive its luminosity means understanding that defilements such as greed aversion or delusion are not intrinsic to its nature are not a necessary part of awareness
Without this understanding it would be impossible to practice
With this understanding however one can make an effort to cut away existing defilements leaving the mind in the stage that MN calls purity in terms of mind This would correspond to the luminous level of concentration described in the standard simile for the fourth jhana And furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain
He sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness
Just as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awareness From this state it is possible to develop the discernment that not only cuts away existing defilements but also uproots any potential for them to ever arise again
Only in the stages of Awakening that follow on those acts of discernment would consciousness without feature be realized
I don't envision a single thing that is as quick to reverse itself as the mind  so much so that there is no feasible simile for how quick to reverse itself it is
Just as of all trees the balsam is foremost in terms of softness and pliancy in the same way I don't envision a single thing that when developed  cultivated is as soft  pliant as the mind
The mind when developed  cultivated is soft  pliant
Suppose there were a pool of water  sullied turbid and muddy

There are these five facts that one should reflect on often whether one is a woman or a man lay or ordained
Which five
'I am subject to aging have not gone beyond aging' This is the first fact that one should reflect on often whether one is a woman or a man lay or ordained
'I am subject to illness have not gone beyond illness'
'I am subject to death have not gone beyond death'
'I will grow different separate from all that is dear and appealing to me'
'I am the owner of my actions heir to my actions born of my actions related through my actions and have my actions as my arbitrator
Whatever I do for good or for evil to that will I fall heir'
These are the five facts that one should reflect on often whether one is a woman or a man lay or ordained
Now based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect that 'I am subject to aging have not gone beyond aging'
There are beings who are intoxicated with a youth's intoxication with youth
Because of that intoxication with youth they conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mind
But when they often reflect on that fact that youth's intoxication with youth will either be entirely abandoned or grow weaker

There are beings who are intoxicated with a healthy person's intoxication with health
Because of that intoxication with health they conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mind
But when they often reflect on that fact that healthy person's intoxication with health will either be entirely abandoned or grow weaker
Now based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect that 'I am subject to death have not gone beyond death'
There are beings who are intoxicated with a living person's intoxication with life
Because of that intoxication with life they conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mind
But when they often reflect on that fact that living person's intoxication with life will either be entirely abandoned or grow weaker
Now based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect that 'I will grow different separate from all that is dear and appealing to me'
There are beings who feel desire and passion for the things they find dear and appealing
Because of that passion they conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mind
But when they often reflect on that fact that desire and passion for the things they find dear and appealing will either be entirely abandoned or grow weaker
Now based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect that 'I am the owner of my actions heir to my actions born of my actions related through my actions and have my actions as my arbitrator
Whatever I do for good or for evil to that will I fall heir'
There are beings who conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mind

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks replied
The Blessed One said Monks the ending of the fermentations is for one who knows  sees I tell you not for one who does not know  does not see
For one who knows what  sees what
Appropriate attention  inappropriate attention
When a monk attends inappropriately unarisen fermentations arise and arisen fermentations increase
When a monk attends appropriately unarisen fermentations do not arise and arisen fermentations are abandoned
There are fermentations to be abandoned by seeing those to be abandoned by restraining those to be abandoned by using those to be abandoned by tolerating those to be abandoned by avoiding those to be abandoned by dispelling and those to be abandoned by developing
 And what are the fermentations to be abandoned by seeing
There is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  does not discern what ideas are fit for attention or what ideas are unfit for attention
This being so he does not attend to ideas fit for attention and attends to ideas unfit for attention
And what are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends to
Whatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen fermentation of sensuality arises in him and the arisen fermentation of sensuality increases the unarisen fermentation of becoming arises in him and arisen fermentation of becoming increases the unarisen fermentation of ignorance arises in him and the arisen fermentation of ignorance increases
These are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends to
And what are the ideas fit for attention that he does not attend to
Whatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen fermentation of sensuality does not arise in him and the arisen fermentation of sensuality is abandoned the unarisen fermentation of becoming does not arise in him and arisen fermentation of becoming is abandoned the unarisen fermentation of ignorance does not arise in him and the arisen fermentation of ignorance is abandoned
These are the ideas fit for attention that he does not attend to
Through his attending to ideas unfit for attention and through his not attending to ideas fit for attention both unarisen fermentations arise in him and arisen fermentations increase
This is how he attends inappropriately 'Was I in the past
Was I not in the past
What was I in the past
How was I in the past
Having been what what was I in the past
Shall I be in the future
Shall I not be in the future
What shall I be in the future
How shall I be in the future
Having been what what shall I be in the future' Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present 'Am I
Am I not
What am I
How am I
Where has this being come from
Where is it bound'
As he attends inappropriately in this way one of six kinds of view arises in him The view I have a self arises in him as true  established or the view I have no self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive notself or the view It is precisely by means of notself that I perceive self arises in him as true  established or else he has a view like this This very self of mine  the knower that is sensitive here  there to the ripening of good  bad actions  is the self of mine that is constant everlasting eternal not subject to change and will stay just as it is for eternity
This is called a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of views
Bound by a fetter of views the uninstructed runofthemill person is not freed from birth aging  death from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair
He is not freed I tell you from suffering  stress
The wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma  discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attention
This being so he does not attend to ideas unfit for attention and attends to ideas fit for attention
And what are the ideas unfit for attention that he does not attend to
Whatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen fermentation of sensuality arises in him and the arisen fermentation of sensuality increases the unarisen fermentation of becoming arises in him and arisen fermentation of becoming increases the unarisen fermentation of ignorance arises in him and the arisen fermentation of ignorance increases
These are the ideas unfit for attention that he does not attend to
And what are the ideas fit for attention that he does attend to
Whatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen fermentation of sensuality does not arise in him and the arisen fermentation of sensuality is abandoned the unarisen fermentation of becoming does not arise in him and the arisen fermentation of becoming is abandoned the unarisen fermentation of ignorance does not arise in him and the arisen fermentation of ignorance is abandoned
These are the ideas fit for attention that he does attend to
Through his not attending to ideas unfit for attention and through his attending to ideas fit for attention unarisen fermentations do not arise in him and arisen fermentations are abandoned
He attends appropriately This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress
As he attends appropriately in this way three fetters are abandoned in him identityview doubt and grasping at precepts  practices
These are called the fermentations to be abandoned by seeing
 And what are the fermentations to be abandoned by restraining
There is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately dwells restrained with the restraint of the eyefaculty
The fermentations vexation or fever that would arise if he were to dwell unrestrained with the restraint of the eyefaculty do not arise for him when he dwells restrained with the restraint of the eyefaculty
Reflecting appropriately he dwells restrained with the restraint of the earfaculty
Reflecting appropriately he dwells restrained with the restraint of the nosefaculty
Reflecting appropriately he dwells restrained with the restraint of the tonguefaculty
Reflecting appropriately he dwells restrained with the restraint of the bodyfaculty
Reflecting appropriately he dwells restrained with the restraint of the intellectfaculty
The fermentations vexation or fever that would arise if he were to dwell unrestrained with the restraint of the intellectfaculty do not arise for him when he dwells restrained with the restraint of the intellectfaculty
These are called the fermentations to be abandoned by restraining
 And what are the fermentations to be abandoned by using
There is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately uses the robe simply to counteract cold to counteract heat to counteract the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles simply for the purpose of covering the parts of the body that cause shame
Reflecting appropriately he uses almsfood not playfully nor for intoxication nor for putting on bulk nor for beautification but simply for the survival  continuance of this body for ending its afflictions for the support of the holy life thinking 'Thus will I destroy old feelings and not create new feelings
I will maintain myself be blameless  live in comfort'
Reflecting appropriately he uses lodging simply to counteract cold to counteract heat to counteract the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles simply for protection from the inclemencies of weather and for the enjoyment of seclusion
Reflecting appropriately he uses medicinal requisites that are used for curing the sick simply to counteract any pains of illness that have arisen and for maximum freedom from disease
The fermentations vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to use these things do not arise for him when he uses them
These are called the fermentations to be abandoned by using
 And what are the fermentations to be abandoned by tolerating
There is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately endures
He tolerates cold heat hunger  thirst the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles illspoken unwelcome words  bodily feelings that when they arise are painful racking sharp piercing disagreeable displeasing  menacing to life
The fermentations vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to tolerate these things do not arise for him when he tolerates them
These are called the fermentations to be abandoned by tolerating
 And what are the fermentations to be abandoned by avoiding
There is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately avoids a wild elephant a wild horse a wild bull a wild dog a snake a stump a bramble patch a chasm a cliff a cesspool an open sewer
Reflecting appropriately he avoids sitting in the sorts of unsuitable seats wandering to the sorts of unsuitable habitats and associating with the sorts of bad friends that would make his knowledgeable friends in the holy life suspect him of evil conduct
The fermentations vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to avoid these things do not arise for him when he avoids them
These are called the fermentations to be abandoned by avoiding
 And what are the fermentations to be abandoned by destroying
There is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately does not tolerate an arisen thought of sensuality
He abandons it dispels it  wipes it out of existence
Reflecting appropriately he does not tolerate an arisen thought of ill will
Reflecting appropriately he does not tolerate an arisen thought of cruelty
Reflecting appropriately he does not tolerate arisen evil unskillful mental qualities
He abandons them dispels them  wipes them out of existence
The effluents vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to dispel these things do not arise for him when he dispels them
These are called the fermentations to be abandoned by dispelling
 And what are the fermentations to be abandoned by developing
There is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately develops mindfulness as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting go
He develops analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening persistence as a factor for Awakening rapture as a factor for Awakening serenity as a factor for Awakening concentration as a factor for Awakening equanimity as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting go
The fermentations vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to develop these qualities do not arise for him when he develops them
These are called the fermentations to be abandoned by developing
When a monk's fermentations that should be abandoned by seeing have been abandoned by seeing his fermentations that should be abandoned by restraining have been abandoned by restraining his fermentations that should be abandoned by using have been abandoned by using his fermentations that should be abandoned by tolerating have been abandoned by tolerating his fermentations that should be abandoned by avoiding have been abandoned by avoiding his fermentations that should be abandoned by dispelling have been abandoned by dispelling his fermentations that should be abandoned by developing have been abandoned by developing then he is called a monk who dwells restrained with the restraint of all the fermentations
He has severed craving thrown off the fetters and  through the right penetration of conceit  has made an end of suffering  stress
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
The Buddha taught that clinging to views is one of the four forms of clinging that tie the mind to the processes of suffering
He thus recommended that his followers relinquish their clinging not only to views in their fullblown form as specific positions but also in their rudimentary form as the categories  relationships that the mind reads into experience
This is a point he makes in the following discourse which is apparently his response to a particular school of Brahmanical thought that was developing in his time  the Samkhya or classification school
This school had its beginnings in the thought of Uddalaka a ninthcentury Bphilosopher who posited a root an abstract principle out of which all things emanated and which was immanent in all things
Philosophers who carried on this line of thinking offered a variety of theories based on logic and meditative experience about the nature of the ultimate root and about the hierarchy of the emanation
Many of their theories were recorded in the Upanishads and eventually developed into the classical Samkhya system around the time of the Buddha
Although the present discourse says nothing about the background of the monks listening to it the Commentary states that before their ordination they were brahmans and that even after their ordination they continued to interpret the Buddha's teachings in light of their previous training which may well have been protoSamkhya
If this is so then the Buddha's opening lines  I will teach you the sequence of the root of all phenomena  would have them prepared to hear his contribution to their line of thinking
And in fact the list of topics he covers reads like a Buddhist Samkhya
Paralleling the classical Samkhya it contains items begins with the physical world and leads back through ever more refined  inclusive levels of being  experience culminating with the ultimate Buddhist concept Unbinding
In the pattern of Samkhya thought Unbinding would thus be the ultimate root or ground of being immanent in all things and out of which they all emanate
However instead of following this pattern of thinking the Buddha attacks it at its very root the notion of a principle in the abstract the in  out of superimposed on experience
Only an uninstructed run of the mill person he says would read experience in this way
In contrast a person in training should look for a different kind of root  the root of suffering experienced in the present  and find it in the act of delight
Developing dispassion for that delight the trainee can then comprehend the process of comingintobeing for what it is drop all participation in it and thus achieve true Awakening
If the listeners present at this discourse were indeed interested in fitting Buddhist teachings into a Samkhyan mold then it's small wonder that they were displeased  one of the few places where we read of a negative reaction to the Buddha's words
They had hoped to hear his contribution to their project but instead they hear their whole pattern of thinking  theorizing attacked as ignorant  illinformed
The Commentary tells us though they were later able to overcome their displeasure and eventually attain Awakening on listening to the discourse reported in AN
Although at present we rarely think in the same terms as the Samkhya philosophers there has long been  and still is  a common tendency to create a Buddhist metaphysics in which the experience of emptiness the Unconditioned the Dharmabody Buddhanature rigpa etc is said to function as the ground of being from which the All  the entirety of our sensory  mental experience  is said to spring and to which we return when we meditate
Some people think that these theories are the inventions of scholars without any direct meditative experience but actually they have most often originated among meditators who label a particular meditative experience as the ultimate goal identify with it in a subtle way and then view that level of experience as the ground of being out of which all other experience comes
Any teaching that follows these lines would be subject to the same criticism that the Buddha directed against the monks who first heard this discourse
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Ukkattha in the shade of a royal Sal tree in the Very Blessed Grove
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said Monks I will teach you the sequence of the root of all phenomena
Listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say sir they responded
The Blessed One said There is the case monks where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  perceives earth as earth

That is what the Blessed One said
Displeased the monks did not delight in the Blessed One's words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi at Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Then Janussonin the brahman went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama the sons of good families who have gone forth from the home life into homelessness out of conviction in Master Gotama is Master Gotama their leader
Is Master Gotama their helper
Is Master Gotama their inspirer
Do they take Master Gotama as their example
Yes brahman so it is
The sons of good families who have gone forth from the home life into homelessness out of conviction in me I am their leader
I am their helper
I am their inspirer
They take me as their example
But Master Gotama it's not easy to endure isolated forest or wilderness dwellings
It's not easy to maintain seclusion not easy to enjoy being alone
The forests as it were plunder the mind of a monk who has not attained concentration
Yes brahman so it is
It's not easy to endure isolated forest or wilderness dwellings
It's not easy to maintain seclusion not easy to enjoy being alone
The forests as it were plunder the mind of a monk who has not attained concentration
Before my Awakening when I was still an unawakened Bodhisatta the thought occurred to me as well 'It's not easy to endure isolated forest or wilderness dwellings
It's not easy to maintain seclusion not easy to enjoy being alone
The forests as it were plunder the mind of a monk who has not attained concentration'
The thought occurred to me 'When brahmans or contemplatives who are unpurified in their bodily activities resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings it's the fault of their unpurified bodily activities that they give rise to unskillful fear  terror
But it's not the case that I am unpurified in my bodily activities when I resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings
I am purified in my bodily activities
I am one of those noble ones who are purified in their bodily activities when they resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings' Seeing in myself this purity of bodily activities I felt even more undaunted about staying in the wilderness
The thought occurred to me 'When brahmans or contemplatives who are unpurified in their verbal activities unpurified in their mental activities unpurified in their livelihood resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings it's the fault of their unpurified livelihood that they give rise to unskillful fear  terror
But it's not the case that I am unpurified in my livelihood when I resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings
I am purified in my livelihood
I am one of those noble ones who are purified in their livelihood when they resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings' Seeing in myself this purity of livelihood I felt even more undaunted about staying in the wilderness
The thought occurred to me 'When brahmans or contemplatives who are covetous  fiercely passionate for sensual pleasures I am not covetous'
'When brahmans or contemplatives who have minds of ill will with destructive attitudes I have a mind of good will'
'When brahmans or contemplatives who are overcome by sloth  drowsiness I am devoid of sloth  drowsiness'
'When brahmans or contemplatives who are restless  with an unstill mind I have a still mind'
'When brahmans or contemplatives who are uncertain  doubting I have gone beyond uncertainty'
'When brahmans or contemplatives who are given to praising themselves  disparaging others I do not praise myself or disparage others'
'When brahmans or contemplatives who tend toward panic  dread I have gone beyond horripilation'
'When brahmans or contemplatives who are desirous of gains offerings  fame I have few wants'
'When brahmans or contemplatives who are lazy  lacking in persistence My persistence is aroused'
'When brahmans or contemplatives who are muddled in their mindfulness  unalert I have mindfulness established'
'When brahmans or contemplatives who are unconcentrated with straying minds I am consummate in concentration'
The thought occurred to me 'When brahmans or contemplatives who are drooling idiots resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings it's the fault of their drooling idiocy that they give rise to unskillful fear  terror
But it's not the case that I am a drooling idiot when I resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings
I am consummate in discernment
I am one of those noble ones who are consummate in discernment when they resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings' Seeing in myself this consummate discernment I felt even more undaunted about staying in the wilderness
The thought occurred to me 'What if  on recognized designated nights such as the eighth fourteenth  fifteenth of the lunar fortnight  I were to stay in the sort of places that are aweinspiring and make your hair stand on end such as parkshrines forestshrines  treeshrines
Perhaps I would get to see that fear  terror' So at a later time  on recognized designated nights such as the eighth fourteenth  fifteenth of the lunar fortnight  I stayed in the sort of places that are aweinspiring and make your hair stand on end such as parkshrines forestshrines  treeshrines
And while I was staying there a wild animal would come or a peacock would make a twig fall or wind would rustle the fallen leaves
The thought would occur to me 'Is this that fear  terror coming' Then the thought occurred to me 'Why do I just keep waiting for fear
What if I in whatever state I'm in when fear  terror come to me were to subdue that fear  terror in that very state' So when fear  terror came to me while I was walking back  forth I would not stand or sit or lie down
I would keep walking back  forth until I had subdued that fear  terror
When fear  terror came to me while I was standing I would not walk or sit or lie down
I would keep standing until I had subdued that fear  terror
When fear  terror came to me while I was sitting I would not lie down or stand up or walk
I would keep sitting until I had subdued that fear  terror
When fear  terror came to me while I was lying down I would not sit up or stand or walk
I would keep lying down until I had subdued that fear  terror
There are some brahmans  contemplatives brahman who have the perception of 'day' when it is night and of 'night' when it is day
This I tell you is their being in a dwelling of delusion
As for me I have the perception of 'day' when it is day and of 'night' when it is night
If anyone when speaking rightly were to say 'A being not subject to delusion has appeared in the world for the benefit  happiness of many out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of human  divine beings' he would rightly be speaking of me
Unflagging persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness established
My body was calm  unaroused my mind concentrated  single
Quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities I entered  remained in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations I entered  remained in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
With the fading of rapture I remained in equanimity mindful  alert and physically sensitive of pleasure
I entered  remained in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  I entered  remained in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past lives
I recollected my manifold past lives ie one birth two five ten fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many eons of cosmic contraction many eons of cosmic expansion many eons of cosmic contraction  expansion 'There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose there
There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose here' Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes  details
This was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resolute
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away  reappearance of beings
I saw  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma 'These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech  mind who reviled noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
But these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech  mind who did not revile noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world' Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  I saw beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma
This was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resolute
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations
I discerned as it had come to be that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations' My heart thus knowing thus seeing was released from the fermentation of sensuality released from the fermentation of becoming released from the fermentation of ignorance
With release there was the knowledge 'Released' I discerned that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
This was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resolute
Now brahman if the thought should occur to you 'Perhaps Gotama the contemplative is even today not free of passion not free of aversion not free of delusion which is why he resorts to isolated forest  wilderness dwellings' it should not be seen in that way
It's through seeing two compelling reasons that I resort to isolated forest  wilderness dwellings seeing a pleasant abiding for myself in the present and feeling sympathy for future generations
How truly future generations have been shown sympathy by Master Gotama in the manner of one who is worthy  rightly selfawakened
Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monks
May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life
Thus have I heard
Once the Bhagāva was staying at the Jetavana monastery of Anāthapiṇḍika in Sāvatthi
At that time the Bhagāva addressed the bhikkhus saying Bhikkhus And they answered him Venerable Sir Then the Bhagāva uttered these words
Very well Venerable Sir replied the bhikkhus to the Bhagāva who delivered this discourse
Bhikkhus
In the world the ignorant worldling who is not in the habit of seeing the Ariyas who is not proficient in the dhamma of the Ariyas and who is not trained and disciplined in the dhamma of the Ariyas who is not in the habit of seeing the Virtuous who is not proficient in the dhamma of the Virtuous and who is not trained and disciplined in the dhamma of the Virtuous does not know the factors which should be considered attentively and the factors which should not be considered attentively
Not discriminating the factors which should be considered attentively from the factors which should not be considered attentively he considers attentively the factors which should not be considered and does not consider attentively the factors which should be considered
What are the factors which are considered attentively though they should not be considered
Bhikkhus
In one who considers attentively certain factors there arises the defilement of sensepleasure that has not yet arisen and there also is an increase of the defilement of sensepleasure that has already arisen there arises the defilement of hankering after better existence that has not yet arisen and there also is an increase of the defilement of hankering after better existence that has already arisen there arises the defilement of ignorance that has not yet arisen and there also is an increase of the defilement of ignorance that has already arisen
These are the factors which are considered attentively though they should not be considered
What are the factors which are not considered attentively though they should be considered
Bhikkhus
In one who considers attentively certain factors there does not arise the defilement of sensepleasure that has not yet arisen and the defilement of sensepleasure also that has already arisen is removed there does not arise the defilement of hankering after better existence that has not yet arisen and the defilement of hankering after better existence also that has already arisen is removed there does not arise the defilement of ignorance that has not yet arisen and the defilement of ignorance also that has already arisen is removed
These are the factors which are not considered attentively though they should be considered
Because such a person considers attentively the factors which should not be considered and does not consider attentively the factors which should be considered there arise in him āsavas that have not yet arisen and there increase in him āsavas that have already arisen
Also as regards the present uncertainty arises in him thus 'Do I exist
Do I not exist
Who am I
How am I
From where has this soul come
Where will this soul go'
Bhikkhus
This wrong view is called a false belief a jungle of false beliefs a desert of false beliefs a thorny spike of false beliefs an agitation of false beliefs and a fetter of false beliefs
Bhikkhus
The ignorant worldling who is bound up with the fetter of false beliefs cannot escape rebirth ageing death grief lamentation pain distress and despair
I declare that he cannot escape dukkha
Bhikkhus
The instructed ariya disciple who sees the Ariyas who is skilled in their dhammas and who is trained and disciplined in their dhammas who sees the Virtuous who is skilled in their dhammas and who is trained and disciplined in their dhammas knows the factors which should be considered attentively and the factors which should not be considered attentively
Discriminating the factors which should be considered attentively from the factors which should not be considered attentively he does not consider attentively the factors which should not be considered and considers attentively the factors which should be considered
Bhikkhus
What are the factors which are not considered attentively as they should not be considered
Bhikkhus
In one who considers attentively certain factors there arises the defilement of sensepleasure that has not yet arisen and there also is an increase of the defilement of sensepleasure that has already arisen there arises the defilement of hankering after better existence that has not yet arisen and there also is an increase of the defilement of hankering after better existence that has already arisen there arises the defilement of ignorance that has not yet arisen and there also is an increase of the defilement of ignorance that has already arisen
These are the factors which are not considered attentively as they should not be considered
What are the factors which are considered attentively as they should be considered
Bhikkhus
In one who considers attentively certain factors there does not arise the defilement of sensepleasure that has not yet arisen and the defilement of sensepleasure also that has already arisen is removed there does not arise the defilement of hankering after better existence that has not yet arisen and the defilement of hankering after better existence also that has already arisen is removed there does not arise the defilement of ignorance that has not yet arisen and the defilement of ignorance also that has already arisen is removed
These are the factors which are considered attentively as they should be considered
Because such a person does not consider attentively the factors which should not be considered and considers attentively the factors which should be considered there do not arise in him āsavas that have not yet arisen and the āsavas that have already arisen disappear
Bhikkhus
What are the āsavas that should be removed through restraint
Bhikkhus
In this Teaching the bhikkhu reflecting properly abides in the restraint of his faculty of sight
savas and other destructive and burning defilements may arise in the bhikkhu who does not abide in the restraint of his faculty of sight with proper reflection
Those āsavas and other destructive and burning defilements do not arise in the bhikkhu who abides in the restraint of his faculty of sight with proper reflection
Reflecting properly the bhikkhu abides in the restraint of his faculty of hearing abides in the restraint of his faculty of smell abides in the restraint of his faculty of taste abides in the restraint of his faculty of touch abides in the restraint of his faculty of thought
savas and other destructive and burning defilements may arise in the bhikkhu who does not abide in the restraint of his faculty of thought with proper reflection
Those āsavas and other destructive and burning defilements do not arise in the bhikkhu who abides in the restraint of his faculty of thought with proper reflection
Bhikkhus
savas and other destructive and burning defilements may arise in the bhikkhu who does not abide in the restraint of his faculties with proper reflection
Those āsavas and other destructive and burning defilements do not arise in the bhikkhu who abides in the restraint of his faculties with proper reflection
Bhikkhus
These are called the āsavas that are to be removed through restraint
Bhikkhus
What are the āsavas that are to be removed through proper use
Bhikkhus
In this Teaching the bhikkhu wears the robes reflecting properly
He wears the robes only for protection from cold heat gadflies mosquitoes wind heat of the sun snakes scorpions and lice and just to cover up his nakedness
Reflecting properly he takes almsfood
He does so not for enjoyment not for vanity not for improvement of the body not for a better complexion but only to sustain the physical body to have just enough nourishment for maintaining life to appease hunger and to carry out the Noble Practice of Purity
'By this almsfood I shall remove the existing discomfort and shall prevent the arising of new discomfort
I shall have just enough nourishment to maintain life and to lead a blameless life with good health'
Reflecting properly he makes use of his monastic living place
He does so only for protection from cold heat gadflies mosquitoes wind heat of the sun snakes scorpions and lice and inclement weather and for the purpose of solitary seclusion
Reflecting properly he makes use of medicines and medicinal requisites for curing illness
He uses them only to remove oppressive ailments that arise and only to be completely free from ailment
Bhikkhus
savas and other destructive and burning defilements may arise in the bhikkhu who does not use the four requisites with proper reflection
Those āsavas and other destructive and burning defilements do not arise in the bhikkhu who makes use of the four requisites with proper reflection
Bhikkhus
These are called the āsavas that are to be removed through proper use
Bhikkhus
In this Teaching the bhikkhu reflecting properly can endure cold heat hunger thirst gadflies mosquitoes wind heat of the sun snakes scorpions and lice
He can endure illspoken and unwholesome words
He has the nature of being able to endure severe cruel excruciatingly sharp disagreeable unpleasant deadly and painful sensations which arise in the body
Bhikkhus
savas and other destructive and burning defilements may arise in the bhikkhu who cannot endure such painful sensations
Those āsavas and other destructive and burning defilements do not arise in the bhikkhu who endures such painful sensations with proper reflection
Bhikkhus
These are called the āsavas that are to be removed through forbearance
Bhikkhus
In this Teaching the bhikkhu reflecting properly avoids a fierce elephant a fierce horse a fierce ox a fierce dog a snake a treestump a thorny place an abyss a precipice a refusepit and a cesspool
If a bhikkhu dwells in such an improper place resorts to such an improper resort and keeps company with evil friends his wise fellowbhikkhus would suspect him of involving himself in evil circumstances
Reflecting properly he avoids improper places improper resorts and evil friends
Bhikkhus
savas and other destructive and burning defilements may arise in the bhikkhu who does not avoid such improprieties with proper reflection
Those āsavas and other destructive and burning defilements do not arise in the bhikkhu who avoids such improprieties with proper reflection
Bhikkhus
These are called the āsavas that are to be removed through avoidance
Bhikkhus
In this Teaching the bhikkhu reflecting properly does not tolerate but forsakes rejects gets rid of and prevents the repeated arising in him of the arisen sensual thoughts the arisen thoughts of malice the arisen thoughts of injuring another does not tolerate but forsakes rejects gets rid of and prevents the repeated arising in him of evil and demeritorious thoughts whenever they arise
Bhikkhus
savas and other destructive and burning defilements may arise in the bhikkhu who does not reject such demeritorious thoughts with proper reflection
Those āsavas and other destructive and burning defilements do not arise in the bhikkhu who rejects such demeritorious thoughts with proper reflection
Bhikkhus
These are called the āsavas that are to be removed through rejection
Bhikkhus
In this Teaching the bhikkhu reflecting properly cultivates the enlightenmentfactor of mindfulness that is directed to detachment from defilements freedom from attachment cessation of defilements and that promotes and develops the uprooting of defilements and speedy attainment of Nibbāna
Reflecting properly he cultivates the enlightenmentfactor of investigative knowledge of phenomena cultivates the enlightenmentfactor of effort cultivates the enlightenmentfactor of delightful satisfaction cultivates the enlightenmentfactor of serenity cultivates the enlightenmentfactor of concentration he cultivates the enlightenmentfactor of equanimity that is directed to detachment from defilements freedom from attachment cessation of defilements and that promotes and develops the uprooting of defilements and speedy attainment of Nibbāna
Bhikkhus
savas and other destructive and burning defilements may arise in the bhikkhu who does not cultivate these Seven Factors of Enlightenment
Those āsavas and other destructive and burning defilements do not arise in the bhikkhu who cultivates them with proper reflection
Bhikkhus
These are called the āsavas that are to be removed through cultivation
Thus the Bhagavā said
Delighted the bhikkhus rejoiced at the words of the Bhagavā
savas defilements that befuddle the mind They are like liquor long fermented
They convey the idea of something flowing out that intoxicates or befuddles the mind
savas are usually classified into four categories kāmāsava or gross attachment to and craving for the five senseobjects bhavāsava or craving for better existence such as the rūpa and arūpa planes of existence in the belief that they are permanent stable and constant this craving occurs together with sassata diṭṭhi avijjāsava or the defilement of lack of comprehension of the Four Ariya Truths through Magga Insight diṭṭhāsava or the defilement that is false belief
In this Sutta however the last is not mentioned
It may be taken as part of bhavāsava
Although the āsavas are variously classified they are basically only lobha diṭṭhi and moha
The most crucial point in  is the practice of the four Satipaṭṭhānas
It is the one and only way for the attainment of maggas and phalas and also for the realization of Nibbāna
As a matter of fact the Seven Bojjhaṅgas cannot take place without the practice of the four Satipaṭṭhānas
When a yogī practices the Satipaṭṭhānas he will achieve first of all mental concentration
When it becomes sufficiently strong he will achieve stage by stage thirteen vipassanā ñāṇas which will enable him to perceive the true nature of mind and body before he achieves maggas
Bojjhaṅgas are the factors of enlightenment which one must have while he is passing through these thirteen vipassanā ñāṇas
Sati means mindfulness
Dhammavicaya means mindfulness of nāma and rūpa and their appearance and disappearance
Vīriya means diligence
Pīti means the emotion of joy
Passadhi means composure
Samādhi means mental concentration
Upekkhā means equanimity
Briefly speaking in the course of the practice of the Satipaṭṭhānas if one knows he has the bojjhaṅgas hen he has them and knows he does not have them hen they disappear and if he knows why he has them when he has them and why he does not have them when he has lost them he is deemed to be a person who is endowed with these seven factors of enlightenment
And the Buddha taught that such a person is one who will pass through the vipassanā ñāṇas and achieve maggas speedily
Very well then my friend I will give you an analogy for there are cases where it is through the use of an analogy that intelligent people can understand the meaning of what is being said

Because Pali has many ways of expressing the word 'and' I have  to avoid monotony  used the ampersand to join lists of words  short phrases and the word 'and' to join long phrases  clauses
To study ancient texts is like visiting a foreign city Time  inclination determine whether you want a quick prepackaged tour of the highlights a less structured opportunity for personal exploration or both
This book on the connotations of the words nibbāna  upādāna in the early Buddhist texts is organized on the assumption that both approaches to the topic have their merits and so it consists of two separate but related parts
Part I The Abstract is the quick tour  a brief survey to highlight the main points of the argument
Part II The Essay is a chance to make friends with the natives soak up the local atmosphere and gain your own insights
It takes a more oblique approach to the argument letting the texts themselves point the way with a minimum of interference so that you may explore  ponder them at leisure
Part I is for those who need their bearings and who might get impatient with the seeming indirection of Part II Part II is for those who are interested in contemplating the nuances the tangential connections  the sense of context that usually get lost in a more structured approach
Either part may be read on its own but I would like to recommend that anyone seriously interested in the Buddha's teachings take the time to read reflectively the translations that form the main body of Part People in the West even committed Buddhists are often remarkably ignorant of the Buddha's original teachings as presented in the early texts
Much of what they know has been filtered for them at second or third hand without their realizing what was added or lost in the filtration
Although the quotations in Part II by their sheer length  numbers may at times seem like overkill they are important for the context they give to the teachings
Once the teachings have context you can have a surer sense of what is true Buddha Dhamma and what are filtration products
This book has been many years in preparation
It began from a casual remark made one evening by my meditation teacher  Phra Ajaan Fuang Jotiko  to the effect that the mind released is like fire that has gone out The fire is not annihilated he said but is still there diffused in the air it simply no longer latches on to any fuel
This remark gave me food for thought for a long time afterwards
When I came to learn Pali my first interest was to explore the early texts to learn what views they contained about the workings of fire and how these influenced the meaning of nibbāna  literally 'extinguishing'  as a name for the Buddhist goal
The result of my research is this book
Many people have helped in this project directly or indirectly and I would like to acknowledge my debts to them
First of all Phra Ajaan Fuang Jotiko in addition to being the original inspiration for the research provided me with the training that has formed the basis for many of the insights presented here
The example of his life  teachings was what originally convinced me of Buddhism's worth

This timeline chronicles some of the significant events and personalities in the evolution of Theravada Buddhism that in one way or another figure prominently in the readings found elsewhere on this website
This is not meant to be a comprehensive chronology
The sources used in constructing this timeline often assumed different dates for the Buddha's nativity
For this reason I have occasionally had to interpolate in order to fit events onto a reasonably consistent timeline
Nevertheless this chronology should provide a fairly clear picture of the relative sequence of events if not the absolute dates on which they occurred
For a general introduction to Theravada Buddhism please see What is Theravada Buddhism
During the fullmoon night of July the Buddha delivers his first discourse near Varanasi introducing the world to the Four Noble Truths and commencing a year career of teaching the religion he called Dhammavinaya

BE  Buddhist Era
Year of the Buddhist Era calendar is the year of the Buddha's Parinibbana which occurred in the Buddha's eightieth year
The actual date of the Buddha's birth is unknown
According to Buddhist tradition the Buddha's birth took place in BCE although some recent estimates place the Buddha's birth much later  perhaps as late as BCE
BCE is one commonly accepted date for the Buddha's birth and the historical date for that event that I adopt here
Events in the timeline prior to CE are shown with two CE dates the date based on the traditional nativity of BCE followed by the date based on the historical date of BCE
After CE the historical date is dropped since these dates are more appropriate only in discussions of earlier events
To calculate the CE date corresponding to an event in the Buddhist traditional calendar subtract years from the BE date
The BE dates of welldocumented historical events may be off by one year since the CE and BE calendars start their years on different months
So this is what you think of me 'The Blessed One sympathetic seeking our wellbeing teaches the Dhamma out of sympathy' Then you should train yourselves  harmoniously cordially and without dispute  in the qualities I have pointed out having known them directly the four frames of reference the four right exertions the four bases of power the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors for Awakening the noble eightfold path
This book has been several years in the making
In the course of assembling it I have used some of the material it contains to lead study courses at the Barre Center of Buddhist Studies Barre Massachusetts at Awareness Grove Laguna Beach California with the Insight Meditation Society of Orange County the San Diego Vipassana Community and the Open Door Sangha of Santa Barbara
The feedback coming from the participants in these courses has helped force me to clarify the presentation and to make explicit the connections between the words of the teachings and their application in practice
It has been encouraging to see that people in America  contrary to their reputation in other parts of the world  are interested in learning authentic Buddhist teachings and integrating them into their lives
This encouragement is what has given me the impetus to turn this material into a book
In addition to the participants at the above courses Dorothea Bowen John Bullitt Jim Colfax Charles Hallisey Karen King Mu Soeng Andrew Olendzki Gregory M
Smith and Jane Yudelman have read and offered valuable comments on earlier incarnations of the manuscript
John Bullitt also helped with the Index
The finished book owes a great deal to all of these people
Any mistakes that remain of course are my own responsibility
I dedicate this book to all of my teachers and in particular to Phra Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo the teacher of my primary teacher Phra Ajaan Fuang Jotiko
The example of Ajaan Lee's life has had a large influence on my own in more ways than I can ever really repay
His teaching of the Buddhist path as a skill  as expressed in the Wings to Awakening and embodied in the practice of breath meditation  provided the original and ongoing inspiration for writing this book
I offer it to his memory with the highest respect

Because Pali has many ways of expressing the word and I have  to avoid monotony  used the ampersand to join lists of words and short phrases and the word and to join long phrases and clauses
Many anthologies of the Buddha's teachings have appeared in English but this is the first to be organized around the set of teachings that the Buddha himself said formed the heart of his message the Wings to Awakening
The material is arranged in three parts preceded by a long Introduction
The Introduction tries to define the concept of Awakening so as to give a clear sense of where the Wings to Awakening are headed
It does this by discussing the Buddha's accounts of his own Awakening with special focus on the way in which the principle of skillful kamma formed both the how and the what of that Awakening the Buddha was able to reach Awakening only by developing skillful kamma  this is the how his understanding of the process of developing skillful kamma is what sparked the insights that constituted Awakening  this is the what
With this background established the remainder of the book focuses in detail on the Wings to Awakening as an expanded analysis of the how Part One focuses on aspects of the principle of skillful kamma that shaped the way the Wings to Awakening are formulated
Part Two goes through the seven sets that make up the Wings to Awakening themselves the four foundations of mindfulness the four right exertions the four bases for power the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors for Awakening and the noble eightfold path
Part Three reduces all the terms in the seven sets to the five faculties and then deals with those faculties in detail
With the fifth and final faculty discernment the book concludes by returning to the what of Awakening showing how discernment focuses on the Wings themselves as topics to be observed in such a way that they will spark the insights leading to total release
Thus the organization of the book is somewhat circular
As with any circle there are several points where the book can be entered
I would recommend two to begin with
The first is to read straight through the book from beginning to end gaining a systematic framework for the material from Parts One and Two which explain why the seven sets are organized as they are and then focusing more on individual elements in the sets in Part Three
This way of approaching the material has the advantage of giving an overall perspective on the topic before going into the details making the role and meaning of the details clear from the start
However this approach is the reverse of what actually happens in the practice
A practicing meditator must learn first to focus on individual phenomena in and of themselves and then through observation and experimentation to discover their interrelationships
For this reason some readers  especially those who find the discussion of causal relationships in Parts One and Two too abstract to be helpful  may prefer to skip from the Introduction straight to sections A through E of Part Three to familiarize themselves with teachings that may connect more directly with their own experience
They may then return later to Parts One and Two to gain a more overall perspective on how the practice is meant to deal with those experiences
Regardless of which approach you take to the material you should discover fairly quickly that the relationships among the overall patterns and individual elements in the Wings are very complex
This complexity reflects the nonlinear nature of the Buddha's teachings on causal relationships and is reflected in the many crossreferences among the various parts of the book
In this way the structure of this book instead of being a simple circle is actually a pattern of many loops within loops
Thus a third way to read it  for those familiar enough with the material to want to explore unexpected connections  would be to follow the crossreferences to see where they lead
Parts One through Three of the book are each divided into sections consisting of passages translated from discourses in the Pali Canon which is apparently the earliest extant record of the Buddha's teachings
Each section is introduced where necessary with an essay
These essays are printed in sans serif type to distinguish them clearly from the translated passages
They are attempts to provide context  and thus meaning  for the passages to show how they relate to one another to specific issues in the practice and to the path of practice as a whole
They are not meant to anticipate or answer every possible question raised by the passages
Instead they are aimed at giving an idea of the kinds of questions that can be most fruitfully brought to the passages so that the lessons contained in the passages can properly be applied to the practice
As the Buddha has pointed out the attitude of appropriate attention the ability to focus on the right questions is one of the most important skills to develop in the course of the practice
This skill is much more fruitful than an attitude that tries to come to the practice armed with all the right answers in advance
The context provided by the essays is threefold doctrinal placing the passages within the structure of the Buddha's teachings taken as a whole historical relating them to what is known of the intellectual and social history of the Buddha's time and practical applying them to the actual practice of the Buddhist path in the present
The first and foremost sources for the doctrinal context are the discourses in the Canon itself
The Buddha and his noble disciples are by far the most reliable guides to the meaning of their own words
Often a teaching that seems vague or confusing when encountered on its own in a single discourse becomes clearer when viewed in the context of several discourses that treat it from a variety of angles just as it is easier to get a sense of a building from a series of pictures taken from different perspectives than from a single snapshot
This approach to understanding the discourses is instructive not only when discourse x explicitly defines a term mentioned in discourse y but also when patterns of imagery and terminology permeate many passages
Two cases in point in separate contexts the discourses compare suffering to fire and the practice of training the mind in meditation to the art of tuning and playing a musical instrument
In each case technical terms  from physics in the first instance from music theory in the second  are applied to the mind in a large number of contexts
Thus it is helpful to understand where the terms are coming from in order to grasp their connotations and to gain an intuitive sense  based on our own familiarity with fire and music  of what they mean
In a few instances I have cited alternative versions of the discourses  such as those contained in the Sarvāstivādin Canon preserved in Chinese translation  to throw light on passages in the Pali
Although the Sarvāstivādin Canon as a whole seems to be later than the Pali there is no way of knowing whether particular Sarvāstivādin discourses are earlier or later than their Pali counterparts so the comparisons drawn between the two are intended simply as food for thought
I have also drawn occasionally on the Pali Abhidhamma and commentaries which postdate the discourses by several centuries
Here however I have had to be selective
These texts employ a systematic approach to interpreting the discourses that fits some teachings better than others
There are instances where a particular teaching has one meaning in terms of this system and another when viewed in the context of the discourses themselves
Thus I have taken specific insights from these texts where they seem genuinely to illuminate the meaning of the discourses but without adopting the overall structure they impose on the teachings
To provide historical context I have drawn on a variety of sources
Again the foremost source here is the Pali Canon itself both in what it has to say explicitly about the social and intellectual milieu of the Buddha's time and in what it says implicitly about the way the intellectual disciplines of the Buddha's time  such as science mathematics and music theory  helped to shape the way the Buddha expressed his thought
I have also drawn on secondary sources where these do a useful job of fleshing out themes present in the Pali Canon
These secondary sources are cited in the Bibliography
Because the Pali tradition is still a living one the doctrinal and historical contexts do not account for the full range of meanings that practicing Buddhists continue to find in the texts
To provide this living dimension I have drawn on the teachings of modern practice traditions where these seem to harmonize with the message of the Canon and add an illuminating perspective
Most of these teachings are drawn from the Thai Forest Tradition but I have also drawn on other traditions as well
I have followed a traditional Buddhist practice in not identifying the sources for these teachings and for two reasons first in many ways I owe every insight offered in this book to the training I have received from my teachers in the Forest Tradition and it seems artificial to credit them for some points and not for others second there is the possibility that I have misunderstood some of their teachings or taken them out of context so I don't want to risk crediting my misunderstandings to them
In providing a more modern context for the passages presented in this book however I have not tried to interpret the teachings in terms of modern psychology or sociology
The Buddha's message is timeless and direct
It does not need to be translated into the passing fashions of disciplines that are in many ways more removed than it is from the realities of direct experience and more likely to grow out of date
However there are two modern disciplines that I have drawn on to help explain some of the more formal aspects of the Buddha's mode of speech and his analysis of causal principles
The first discipline is phenomenology the branch of philosophy that deals with phenomena as they are directly experienced in and of themselves
There are many schools of modern phenomenology and it is not my purpose to try to equate the Buddha's teachings with any one of them
However the Buddha does recommend a mode of perception that he calls entry into emptiness  in which one simply notes the presence or absence of phenomena without making further assumptions about them
This approach resembles what in modern philosophy could be called radical phenomenology a mode of perception that looks at experiences and processes simply as events with no reference to the question of whether there are any things lying behind those events or of whether the events can be said really to exist
Because of this resemblance the word phenomenology is useful in helping to explain the source of the Buddha's descriptions of the workings of kamma and the process of dependent coarising in particular
Once we know where he is coming from it is easier to make sense of his statements and to use them in their proper context
I have made similar use of modern science  chaos theory in particular
There are many parallels between Buddhist theories of causation and modern deterministic chaos theory
Examples and terminology drawn from the latter  such as feedback scale invariance resonance and fluid turbulence  are very useful in explaining the former
Again in using these parallels I am not trying to equate Buddhist teachings with chaos theory or to engage in pseudoscience
Fashions in science change so rapidly that we do the Buddha's teachings no favor in trying to prove them in light of current scientific paradigms
Here I am simply pointing out similarities as a way of helping to make those teachings intelligible in modern terms
Deterministic chaos theory is the only modern body of knowledge that has worked out a vocabulary for the patterns of behavior described in Buddhist explanations of causality and so it seems a natural source to draw on both to describe those patterns and to point out some of their less obvious implications
In doing so I realize that I run the risk of alienating nonscientists who feel intimidated by scientific terminology as well as scientists who resent the application of terminology from their disciplines to nonscientific fields
To both groups I can say only that the terms in and of themselves are not scientific Much of our current everyday terminology for explaining causal relations is derived from the science of the eighteenth century I expect that it will only be a matter of time before the terminology of more recent science will percolate into everyday usage
For the purpose of this book it is important to point out that when the Buddha talked about causality his notion of causal relations did not correspond to our ordinary linear picture of causal chains
If this point is not grasped the common tendency is to judge the Buddha's descriptions of causality against our own and to find them either confusing or confused
Viewing them in the light of deterministic chaos theory however helps us to see that they are both coherent and of practical use
Another example of an analogy drawn from modern science is the term holographic which I have used to describe some formulations of the Buddhist path
When a hologram is made of an object an image of the entire object  albeit fairly fuzzy  can be made from even small fragments of the hologram
In the same way some formulations of the path contain a rough version of the entire path complete in each individual step
In my search for an adjective to describe such formulations holographic seemed the best choice
If you are unfamiliar with the terminology of phenomenology chaos theory and holograms read section IA on skillfulness to find the doctrinal context in which these terms can be related to an immediate experience the process of developing a skill
The approach of phenomenology relates to the fact that on the night of his Awakening the Buddha focused his attention directly on the mental process of developing skillful states in the mind without referring to who or what was developing the skill or to whether there was any sort of substratum underlying the process
Chaos theory relates to the patterns of causality that the Buddha discerned while observing this process whereby the effects of action can in turn become causal factors influencing new action
Holography relates to his discovery that skillfulness is developed by taking clusters of good qualities already present in the mind and using them to strengthen one another each step along the way
Once these familiar reference points are understood the abstract terms describing them should become less foreign and more helpful
In providing doctrinal historical and practical context based on all the abovementioned sources the essays are meant to give an entry into the mental horizons and landscape of the texts they introduce
They are also meant to suggest how the texts may be used for their intended purpose to help eliminate obstacles to the release of the mind
Although some of the essays address controversial questions the textual passages are not meant to prove the points made in the essays
In assembling this anthology I first gathered and translated the passages from the Canon
Only then after contemplating what I had gathered did I add the essays
For this reason any reader who disagrees with the positions presented in the essays should still find the translations useful for hisher own purposes
I am painfully aware that some of the essays especially those in Part I tend to overpower the material they are designed to introduce but this is because the themes in Part I play a pervasive role in the Buddha's teachings as a whole
Thus I had to deal with them in considerable detail to point out how they relate not only to the passages in Part I but also to themes raised in the rest of the book
Although the essays should go far toward familiarizing the reader with the conceptual world and relevance of the textual passages there are other aspects of the passages that might prove daunting to the uninitiated and so I would like to deal with them here
To begin with the teachings on the Wings to Awakening are interrelated in very complex ways
Because books must be arranged in linear sequence taking one thing at a time in a row this means that no book can do justice to all the side avenues and underground passageways that connect elements in one set of teachings to those in another
For this reason I have organized the material in line with the order of the sets as given in the Canon but  as mentioned above  have extensively crossreferenced it for the sake of readers who want to explore connections that fall outside the linear pattern
Crossreferences are given in brackets and take three forms
An example that looks like this   is a reference to a passage from the Pali Canon translated in this book
One that looks like this   is a reference to an essay introducing a section in this case Section E in Part One that looks like this   is a reference to a passage from the Pali Canon not translated here
The abbreviations used in these last references are explained on the Abbreviations page
Many passages falling in this last category are translated in my book The Mind Like Fire Unbound in which case the reference will include the abbreviation MFU followed by the number of the page on which the passage is located in that book
My hope is that these crossreferences will open up useful lines of thought to whoever takes the time to explore them
Another potential difficulty for the uninitiated reader lies in the style of the passages
The Pali Canon was for years an entirely oral tradition
As a result it tends to be terse in some areas and repetitive in others
I've made an effort to cut out as many of the repetitions as possible but I'll have to ask your patience for those that remain
Think of them as the refrains in a piece of music
Also when the Buddha is referring to monks doing this and that keep in mind that his audience was frequently composed entirely of monks
The commentaries state that the word monk includes anyone  male or female lay or ordained  who is serious about the practice and this meaning should always be kept in mind
I apologize for the gender bias in the translations
Although I have tried to figure out ways to minimize it I find myself stymied because it is so thoroughly embedded in a literature originally addressed to monks
I trust however that none of these difficulties will prove insurmountable and that you will find as I have that the teachings of the Pali Canon more than reward the effort put into exploring them
The reality of the Wings to Awakening lies in the qualities of the mind
The words with which they are expressed in the Pali Canon are simply pointers
These pointers have to be tested in the light of serious practice but my conviction is that of all the meditation teachers the human race has ever seen the Buddha is still the best
His words should be read repeatedly reflectively and put to test in the practice
My hope in gathering his teachings in this way is that they will give you useful insights for training the mind so that someday you won't have to read about Awakening but will be able to know it for yourself
The Wings to Awakening constitute the Buddha's own list of his most important teachings
Toward the end of his life he stated several times that as long as the teachings in this list were remembered and put into practice his message would endure
Thus the Wings cover in the Buddha's eyes the words and skills most worth mastering and passing along to others
When discussing the Buddha's teachings the best place to start is with his Awakening
That way one will know where the teachings are coming from and where they are aimed
To appreciate the Awakening though we have to know what led Prince Siddhattha Gotama  the Buddha before his Awakening  to seek it in the first place
According to his own account the search began many lifetimes ago but in this lifetime it was sparked by the realization of the inevitability of aging illness and death
In his words
I lived in refinement utmost refinement total refinement
My father even had lotus ponds made in our palace one where red lotuses bloomed one where white lotuses bloomed one where blue lotuses bloomed all for my sake
I used no sandalwood that was not from Vārāṇasī
My turban was from Vārāṇasī as were my tunic my lower garments  my outer cloak
A white sunshade was held over me day  night to protect me from cold heat dust dirt  dew
I had three palaces one for the cold season one for the hot season one for the rainy season
During the four months of the rainy season I was entertained in the rainyseason palace by minstrels without a single man among them and I did not once come down from the palace
Whereas the servants workers  retainers in other people's homes are fed meals of lentil soup  broken rice in my father's home the servants workers  retainers were fed wheat rice  meat
Even though I was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me 'When an untaught runofthemill person himself subject to aging not beyond aging sees another who is aged he is horrified humiliated  disgusted oblivious to himself that he too is subject to aging not beyond aging
If I  who am subject to aging not beyond aging  were to be horrified humiliated  disgusted on seeing another person who is aged that would not be fitting for me' As I noticed this the young person's intoxication with youth entirely dropped away
Even though I was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me 'When an untaught runofthemill person himself subject to illness not beyond illness sees another who is ill he is horrified humiliated  disgusted oblivious to himself that he too is subject to illness not beyond illness
And if I  who am subject to illness not beyond illness  were to be horrified humiliated  disgusted on seeing another person who is ill that would not be fitting for me' As I noticed this the healthy person's intoxication with health entirely dropped away
Even though I was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me 'When an untaught runofthemill person himself subject to death not beyond death sees another who is dead he is horrified humiliated  disgusted oblivious to himself that he too is subject to death not beyond death
And if I  who am subject to death not beyond death  were to be horrified humiliated  disgusted on seeing another person who is dead that would not be fitting for me' As I noticed this the living person's intoxication with life entirely dropped away
Before my selfawakening when I was still just an unawakened Bodhisatta being subject myself to birth aging illness death sorrow  defilement I sought what was subject to birth aging illness death sorrow  defilement
The thought occurred to me 'Why am I being subject myself to birth defilement seeking what is subject to birth defilement
What if I were to seek the unborn unaging unailing undying sorrowless undefiled unexcelled security from bondage Unbinding'
So at a later time when I was still young blackhaired endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life I shaved off my hair  beard  though my parents wished otherwise and were grieving with tears on their faces  and I put on the ochre robe and went forth from the home life into homelessness
These passages are universal in their import but a fuller appreciation of why the young prince left home for the life of a homeless wanderer requires some understanding of the beliefs and social developments of his time
Prince Siddhattha lived in an aristocratic republic in northern India during the sixth century BCE a time of great social upheaval
A new monetary economy was replacing the older agrarian economy
Absolute monarchies in alliance with the newly forming merchant class were swallowing up the older aristocracies
As often happens when an aristocratic elite is being disenfranchised people on all levels of society were beginning to call into question the beliefs that had supported the older order and were looking to science and other alternative modes of knowledge to provide them with a new view of life
The foremost science in North India at that time was astronomy
New precise observations of planetary movements combined with newly developed means of calculation had led astronomers to conclude that time was measured in aeons incomprehensibly long cycles that repeat themselves endlessly
Taking up these conclusions philosophers of the time tried to work out the implications of this vast temporal frame for the drama of human life and the quest for ultimate happiness
These philosophers fell into two broad camps those who conducted their speculations within the traditions of the Vedas early Indian religious and ritual texts that provided the orthodox beliefs of the old order and other unorthodox groups called the Samaṇas who questioned the authority of the Vedas
Modern etymology derives the word Samaṇa from striver but the etymology of the time derived it from sama which means to be on pitch or in tune The Samaṇa philosophers were trying to find a way of life and thought that was in tune not with social conventions but with the laws of nature as these could be directly contemplated through scientific observation personal experience reason meditation or shamanic practices such as the pursuit of altered states of consciousness through fasting or other austerities
Many of these forms of contemplation required that one abandon the constraints and responsibilities of the home life and take up the life of a homeless wanderer
This was the rationale behind Prince Siddhattha's decision to leave the home life in order to see if there might be a true happiness beyond the sway of aging illness and death
Already by his time philosophers of the Vedic and Samaṇa schools had developed widely differing interpretations of what the laws of nature were and how they affected the pursuit of true happiness
Their main points of disagreement were two
 Survival beyond death
Most Vedic and Samaṇa philosophers assumed that a person's identity extended beyond this lifetime aeons before birth back into the past and after death on into the future although there was some disagreement as to whether one's identity from life to life would change or remain the same
The Vedas had viewed rebirth in a positive light but by the time of Prince Siddhattha the influence of the newly discovered astronomical cycles had led those who believed in rebirth to regard the cycles as pointless and restrictive and release as the only possibility for true happiness
There was however a Samaṇa school of hedonist materialists called Lokāyatans who denied the existence of any identity beyond death and insisted that happiness could be found only by indulging in sensual pleasures here and now
 Causality
Most philosophers accepted the idea that human action played a causative role in providing for one's future happiness both in this life and beyond
Views about how this causal principle worked though differed from school to school
For some Vedists the only effective action was ritual
The Jains a Samaṇa school taught that all action fell under linear deterministic causal laws and formed a bond to the recurring cycle
Present experience they said came from past actions present actions would shape future experience
This linear causality was also materialistic physical action created āsavas  sticky substances on the soul that kept it attached to the cycle
According to them the only escape from the cycle lay in a life of nonviolence and inaction culminating in a slow suicide by starvation which would burn the āsavas away thus releasing the soul
Some Upanishads  postVedic speculative texts  expressed causality as a morally neutral purely physical process of evolution
Others stated that moral laws were intrinsic to the nature of causality rather than being mere social conventions and that the morality of an action determined how it affected one's future course in the round of rebirth
Whether these last texts were composed before or after the Buddha taught this view though no one knows
At any rate all preBuddhist thinkers who accepted the principle of causality however they expressed it saw it as a purely linear process
On the other side of the issue the Lokāyatans insisted that no causal principle acted between events and that all events were spontaneous and selfcaused
This meant that actions had no consequences and one could safely ignore moral rules in one's pursuit of sensual pleasure
One branch of another Samaṇa school the jīvakas insisted that causality was illusory
The only truly existent things they said were the unchanging substances that formed the building blocks of the universe
Because causality implied change it was therefore unreal
As a result human action had no effect on anything of any substance  including happiness  and so was of no account
Another branch of the same school which specialized in astrology insisted that causality was real but totally deterministic
Human life was entirely determined by impersonal amoral fate written in the stars human action played no role in providing for one's happiness or misery morality was purely a social convention
Thus they insisted that release from the round of rebirth came only when the round worked itself out
Peace of mind could be found by accepting one's fate and patiently waiting for the cycle like a ball of string unwinding to come to its end
These divergent viewpoints formed the intellectual backdrop for Prince Siddhattha's quest for ultimate happiness
In fact his Awakening may be seen as his own resolution of these two issues
The Pali Canon records several different versions of the Buddha's own descriptions of his Awakening
These descriptions are among the earliest extended autobiographical accounts in human history
The Buddha presents himself as an explorer and experimenter  and an exceedingly brave one at that putting his life on the line in the search for an undying happiness
After trying several false paths including formless mental absorptions and physical austerities he happened on the path that eventually worked bringing the mind into the present by focusing it on the breath and then making a calm mindful analysis of the processes of the mind as they presented themselves directly to his immediate awareness
Seeing these processes as inconstant stressful and notself he abandoned his sense of identification with them
This caused them to disband and what remained was Deathlessness beyond the dimensions of time and space
This was the happiness for which he had been seeking
In one passage of the Pali canon the Buddha noted that what he had come to realize in the course of his Awakening could be compared to the leaves of an entire forest what he taught to others was like a mere handful of leaves
The latter part comprised the essential points for helping others to attain Awakening themselves
The part he had kept back would have been useless for that purpose
Thus when we discuss the Buddha's Awakening we must keep in mind that we know only a small sliver of the total event
However the sliver we do know is designed to aid in our own Awakening
That is the part we will focus on here keeping the Buddha's purpose for teaching it constantly in mind
When the Buddha later analyzed the process of Awakening he stated that it consisted of two kinds of knowledge
First there is the knowledge of the regularity of the Dhamma after which there is the knowledge of Unbinding
The regularity of the Dhamma here denotes the causal principle that underlies all fabricated experience ie experience made up of causal conditions and influences
Knowing this principle means mastering it one can not only trace the course of causal processes but also escape from them by skillfully letting them disband
The knowledge of Unbinding is the realization of total freedom that comes when one has disbanded the causal processes of the realm of fabrication leaving the freedom from causal influences that is termed the Unfabricated
The Buddha's choice of the word Unbinding  which literally means the extinguishing of a fire  derives from the way the physics of fire was viewed at his time
As fire burned it was seen as clinging to its fuel in a state of entrapment and agitation
When it went out it let go of its fuel growing calm and free
Thus when the Indians of his time saw a fire going out they did not feel that they were watching extinction
Rather they were seeing a metaphorical lesson in how freedom could be attained by letting go
The first knowledge that of the regularity of the Dhamma is the describable part of the process of Awakening the second knowledge that of Unbinding though indescribable is what guarantees the worth of the first
When one has been totally freed from all suffering and stress one knows that one has properly mastered the realm of fabrication and can vouch for the usefulness of the insights that led to that freedom
Truth here is simply the way things work true knowledge is gauged by how skillfully one can manipulate them
There are many places in the Pali Canon where the Buddha describes his own act of Awakening to the first knowledge as consisting of three insights
The first two insights were not the exclusive property of the Buddhist tradition
Shamanic traditions throughout the world have reported seers who have had similar insights
The third insight however went beyond shamanism into a phenomenology of the mind ie a systematic account of phenomena as they are directly experienced
This insight was exclusively Buddhist although it was based on the previous two
Because it was multifaceted the Canon describes it from a variety of standpoints stressing different aspects as they apply to specific contexts
In the course of this book we too will explore specific facets of this insight from different angles
Here we will simply provide a general outline to show how the principle of skillful kamma underlay the main features of this insight
The Bodhisatta's realization in his second insight that kamma determines how beings fare in the round of rebirth caused him to focus on the question of kamma in his third insight
And because the second insight pointed to right and wrong views as the factors determining the quality of kamma he looked into the possibility that kamma was primarily a mental process rather than a physical one as the Vedists and Jains taught
As a result he focused on the mental kamma that was taking place at that very moment in his mind to understand the process more clearly
In particular he wanted to see if there might be a type of right view that instead of continuing the round of rebirth would bring release from it
To do this he realized that he would have to make his powers of discernment more skillful this meant that the process of developing skillfulness would have to be the kamma that he would observe
Now in the process of developing a skill two major assumptions are made that there is a causal relationship between acts and their results and that good results are better than bad
If these assumptions were not valid there would be no point in developing a skill
The Bodhisatta noticed that this point of view provided two variables  causes and results and favorable and unfavorable  that divided experience into four categories which he later formulated as the four noble truths stress its origination its cessation and the path to its cessation
Each category he further realized entailed a duty
Stress had to be comprehended its cause abandoned its cessation realized and the path to its cessation developed
In trying to comprehend stress and its relationship to kamma the Bodhisatta discovered that contrary to the teachings of the Jains kamma was not something extrinsic to the cycle of rebirth that bound one to the cycle
Rather the common cycle of kamma result and reaction was the cycle of rebirth in and of itself and the binding agent in the cycle was not kamma itself but rather an optional part of the reaction to the results of kamma
The Bodhisatta analyzed the cycle of kamma result and reaction into the following terms kamma is intention its result feeling the reaction to that feeling perception and attention  ie attention to perceptions about the feeling  which together form the views that color further intentions
If perception and attention are clouded by ignorance craving and clinging they lead to stress and further ignorance forming the basis for intentions that keep the cycle in motion
In his later teachings the Buddha identified these clouding factors  forms of clinging together with their resultant states of becoming and ignorance  as the āsavas or effluents that act as binding agents to the cycle
In this way he took a Jain term and gave it a new meaning mental rather than physical
At the same time his fullscale analysis of the interaction between kamma and the effluents formed one of the central points of his teaching termed dependent coarising
The fact that it is possible to develop a skill suggested to the Bodhisatta while he was developing his third insight that the craving and clinging that cloud one's perceptions and attention did not necessarily follow on the feeling that resulted from kamma
Otherwise there would be no way to develop skillful intentions
Thus craving and clinging could be abandoned
This would require steady and refined acts of attention and intention which came down to welldeveloped concentration and discernment the central qualities in the path to the cessation of stress
Concentration gave discernment the focus and solidity it needed to see clearly while discernment followed the twofold pattern that attention must play in the development of any skill sensitivity to the context of the act formed by preexisting factors coming from the past together with sensitivity to the act itself formed by present intentions
In other words discernment had to see the results of an action as stemming from a combination of past and present causes
As the more blatant forms of craving clinging and ignorance were eradicated with the continued refinement of concentration and discernment there came a point where the only acts of attention and intention left to analyze were the acts of concentration and discernment in and of themselves
The feedback loop that this process entailed  with concentration and discernment shaping one another in the immediate present  brought the investigation into such close quarters that the terms of analysis were reduced to the most basic words for pointing to present experiences this and that The double focus of discernment in terms of past and present influences was reduced to the most basic conditions that make up the experience of the present on the one hand and time on the other
Attention to present participation in the causal process was reduced to the basic condition for the experience of the present ie mutual presence while attention to influences from the past was reduced to the basic condition for the experience of time ie the dependence of one event on another
These expressions later formed the basic formula of the Buddha's teachings on causality which he termed thisthat conditionality to emphasize that the formula described patterns of events viewed in a mode of perception empty of any assumptions outside of what could be immediately perceived
After reaching this point there was nothing further that concentration and discernment  themselves being conditioned by time and the present  could do
When all residual attachments even to these subtle realizations were let go there thus followed a state called nonfashioning in which the mind made absolutely no present input into experience
With no present input to maintain experience of time and the present the cycle of fabricated experience disbanded
This formed an opening to the Unfabricated the undying happiness that the Bodhisatta now the Buddha had sought
This was the knowledge of Unbinding or total release
The texts say that the Buddha spent a total of days after his Awakening sensitive to the bliss of release reviewing the implications of the insights that had brought about his Awakening
At the end of this period he thought of teaching other living beings
At first the subtlety and complexity of his Awakening made him wonder if anyone would be able to understand and benefit from his teachings
However after he ascertained through his new powers of mind that there were those who would understand he made the decision to teach determining that he would not enter total Unbinding until he had established his teachings  his doctrine and discipline  on a solid basis for the longterm benefit of human and divine beings
The two primary knowledges that constituted the Awakening  knowledge of the regularity of the Dhamma and knowledge of Unbinding  played a major role in shaping what the Buddha taught and how he taught it
Of the two the knowledge of Unbinding was the more important
It not only guaranteed the truth of the other knowledge but also constituted the Buddha's whole purpose in teaching he wanted others to attain this happiness as well
However because the first knowledge was what led to the second it provided the guidelines that the Buddha used in determining what would be useful to communicate to others so that they too would arrive at the knowledge of Unbinding of their own accord
These guidelines were nothing other than the three insights of which this knowledge was composed recollection of past lives insight into the death and rebirth of beings and insight into the ending of the mental effluents
As became clear during the Buddha's teaching career not all those who would reach the knowledge of Unbinding would need to gain direct insight into previous lifetimes or into the death and rebirth of other beings but they would have to gain direct insight into the ending of the mental effluents
The mastery of causality that formed the heart of this insight thus formed the heart of his teaching with the first two insights providing the background against which the teachings were to be put into practice
As we noted above the three insights taken together provided answers to the questions that had provoked Prince Siddhattha's quest for Awakening in the first place
His remembrance of previous lives showed on the one hand that death is not annihilation but on the other hand that there is no core identity that remains unchanged or makes steady upward progress through the process of rebirth
One life follows another as one dream may follow another with similar wide swings in one's sense of who or where one is
Thus there is no inherent security in the process
The second insight  into the death and rebirth of beings throughout the cosmos  provided part of the answer to the questions surrounding the issue of causality in the pursuit of happiness
The primary causal factor is the mind and in particular the moral quality of the intentions comprising its thoughts words and deeds and the rightness of the views underlying them
Thus moral principles are inherent in the functioning of the cosmos rather than being mere social conventions
For this reason any quest for happiness must focus on mastering the quality of the mind's views and intentions
The third insight  into the ending of the mental effluents  showed that escape from the cycle of rebirth could be found not through ritual action or total inaction but through the skillful development of a type of right view that abandoned the effluents that kept the cycle of kamma stress and ignorance in motion
As we have seen this type of right view went through three stages of refinement as the third insight progressed the four noble truths dependent coarising and thisthat conditionality
We will discuss the first two stages in detail elsewhere in this book
Here we will focus on thisthat conditionality the most radical aspect of the Buddha's third insight
In terms of its content it explained how past and present intentions underlay all experience of time and the present
The truth of this content was shown by its role in disbanding all experience of time and the present simply by bringing present intentions to a standstill
Small wonder then that this principle provided the most fundamental influence in shaping the Buddha's teaching
The Buddha expressed thisthat conditionality in a simplelooking formula
There are many possible ways of interpreting this formula but only one does justice both to the way the formula is worded and to the complex fluid manner in which specific examples of causal relationships are described in the Canon
That way is to view the formula as the interplay of two causal principles one linear and the other synchronic that combine to form a nonlinear pattern
The linear principle  taking and as a pair  connects events rather than objects over time the synchronic principle  and  connects objects and events in the present moment
The two principles intersect so that any given event is influenced by two sets of conditions input acting from the past and input acting from the present
Although each principle seems simple the fact that they interact makes their consequences very complex
To begin with every act has repercussions in the present moment together with reverberations extending into the future
Depending on the intensity of the act these reverberations can last for a very short or a very long time
Thus every event takes place in a context determined by the combined effects of past events coming from a wide range in time together with the effects of present acts
These effects can intensify one another can coexist with little interaction or can cancel one another out
Thus even though it is possible to predict that a certain type of act will tend to give a certain type of result  for example acting on anger will lead to pain  there is no way to predict when or where that result will make itself felt
The complexity of the system is further enhanced by the fact that both causal principles meet at the mind
Through its views and intentions the mind takes a causal role in keeping both principles in action
Through its sensory powers it is affected by the results of the causes it has set in motion
This creates the possibility for the causal principles to feed back into themselves as the mind reacts to the results of its own actions
These reactions can take the form of positive feedback loops intensifying the original input and its results much like the howl in a speaker placed next to the microphone feeding into it
They can also create negative feedback loops counteracting the original input much like the action of a thermostat that turns off a heater when the temperature in a room is too high and turns it on again when it gets too low
Because the results of actions can be immediate and the mind can then react to them immediately these feedback loops can at times quickly spin out of control at other times they may act as skillful checks on one's behavior
For example a man may act out of anger which gives him an immediate sense of disease to which he may react with further anger thus creating a snowballing effect
On the other hand he may come to understand that the anger is causing his disease and so immediately does what he can to stop it
However there can also be times when the results of his past actions may obscure the disease he is causing himself in the present so that he does not immediately react to it one way or another
In this way the combination of two causal principles  influences from the past interacting with those in the immediate present  accounts for the complexity of causal relationships as they function on the level of immediate experience
However the combination of the two principles also opens the possibility for finding a systematic way to break the causal web
If causes and effects were entirely linear the cosmos would be totally deterministic and nothing could be done to escape from the machinations of the causal process
If they were entirely synchronic there would be no relationship from one moment to the next and all events would be arbitrary
The web could break down totally or reform spontaneously for no reason at all
However with the two modes working together one can learn from causal patterns observed from the past and apply one's insights to disentangling the same causal patterns acting in the present
If one's insights are true one can then gain freedom from those patterns
For this reason the principle of thisthat conditionality provides an ideal foundation both theoretical and practical for a doctrine of release
And as a teacher the Buddha took full advantage of its implications using it in such a way that it accounts not only for the presentation and content of his teachings but also for their organization their function and their utility
It even accounts for the need for the teachings and for the fact that the Buddha was able to teach them in the first place
We will take up these points in reverse order
The fact of the teaching As noted above thisthat conditionality is a combination of two causal modes linear activity connecting events over time and synchronic causality connecting objects in the present
The fact that the causal principle was not totally linear accounts for the fact that the Buddha was able to break the causal circle as soon as he had totally comprehended it and did not have to wait for all of his previous kamma to work itself out first
The fact that the principle was not totally synchronic however accounts for the fact that he survived his Awakening and lived to tell about it
Although his actions created no new kammic results after his Awakening he continued to live and teach under the influence of the kamma he had created before his Awakening finally passing away only when those kammic influences totally worked themselves out
Thus the combination of the two patterns allowed for an experience of the Unfabricated that could be survived opening the opportunity for the Buddha to teach others about it before his total Unbinding
The need for the teachings Thisthat conditionality even though it can be expressed in a simple formula is very complex in its workingout
As a result the conditions of time and the present are bewildering to most people
This is particularly true in the process leading up to suffering and stress
As  states beings react to suffering in two ways bewilderment and a search for a way out
If the conditions for suffering were not so complex it would be the result of a simple regular process that would not be so confusing
People would be able to understand it without any need for outside teachings
The fact of its actual complexity however explains why people find it bewildering and as a result of their bewilderment have devised a wide variety of unskillful means to escape from it recourse to such external means as magic ritual revenge and force and to such internal means as denial repression selfhatred and prayer
Thus the complexity of thisthat conditionality accounts for the lack of skill that people bring to their lives  creating more suffering and stress in their attempts to escape suffering and stress  and shows that this lack of skill is a result of ignorance
This explains the need for a teaching that points out the true nature of the causal system operating in the world so that proper understanding of the system can lead people to deal with it skillfully and actually gain the release they seek
The utility of the teachings The fact that thisthat conditionality allows for causal input from the present moment means that the causal process is not totally deterministic
Although linear causality places restrictions on what can be done and known in any particular moment synchronic causality allows some room for free will
Human effort can thus make a difference in the immediate present
At the same time the fact that the principle of thisthat conditionality is expressed in impersonal terms means that the Buddha's insights did not depend on any power peculiar to him personally
As he noted in recounting his experience the realizations he attained were such that anyone who developed the mind to the same pitch of heedfulness ardency and resolution and then directed it to the proper task would be able to attain them as well
For these reasons the act of teaching would not be futile because the mental qualities needed for the task of Awakening were available to other people who would have the freedom to develop them if they wanted to
The function of the teachings As chaos theory has shown in graphic terms any causal system that contains three or more feedback loops can develop into incredible complexity with small but wellplaced changes in input tipping the balance from complex order to seeming chaos or from chaos to order in the twinkling of an eye
A similar observation applies to thisthat conditionality
Given the inherent complexity and instability of such a system a simple description of it would be futile the complexity would boggle the mind and the instability would ensure that any such description would not be helpful for long
At the same time the instability of the system makes it imperative for anyone immersed in such a system to find a way out for instability threatens any true chance for lasting peace or happiness
The complexity of the system requires that one find a reliable analysis of the sensitive points in the system and how they can be skillfully manipulated in a way that brings the system down from within
All of these considerations play a role in determining the function for which the Buddha designed his teachings
They are meant to act as a guide to skillful ways of understanding the principles underlying the causal system and to skillful ways of manipulating the causal factors so as to gain freedom from them
The concept of skillful and unskillful thoughts words and deeds thus plays a central role in the teaching
In fact the teachings themselves are meant to function as skillful thoughts toward the goal of Awakening
The Buddha was very clear on the point that he did not mean for his teachings to become a metaphysical system or for them to be adhered to simply for the sake of their truth value
He discussed metaphysical topics only when they could play a role in skillful behavior
Many metaphysical questions  such as whether or not there is a soul or self whether or not the world is eternal whether or not it is infinite etc
 he refused to answer on the grounds that they were either counterproductive or irrelevant to the task at hand that of gaining escape from the stress and suffering inherent in time and the present
Although the Buddha insisted that all of his teachings were true  none of his skillful means were useful fictions  they were to be put aside when one had fully benefited from putting them into practice
In his teachings true but conditioned knowledge is put into service to an unconditioned goal a release so total that no conditioned truths can encompass it
Because a meditator has to use causal factors in order to disband the causal system heshe has to make use of factors that eventually have to be transcended
This pattern of developing qualities in the practice that one must eventually let go as one attains the Unfabricated is common throughout the Buddha's teachings
Eventually even skillfulness itself has to be transcended
The organization of the teachings The fact that the causal system contains many feedback loops means that a particular causal connection  either one that continues the system or one designed to disband it  can follow one of several paths
Thus there is a need for a variety of explanations for people who find themselves involved in these different paths
This need explains the topical organization of the Buddha's teachings in his discourses
In talking to different people or to the same people at different times he gave different accounts of the causal links leading up to stress and suffering and to the knowledge that can bring that stress and suffering to an end
Those who have tried to form a single consistent account of Buddhist causal analyses have found themselves stymied by this fact and have often discounted the wide variety of analyses by insisting that only one of them is the true Buddhist analysis or that only the general principle of mutual causality is important the individual links of the analyses being immaterial or that the Buddha did not really understand causality at all
None of these positions do justice to the Buddha's skill as a teacher of this person and that each caught at different junctures in the feedback loops of thisthat conditionality
As we will see when we consider the Wings to Awakening in detail the Buddha listed different ways of envisioning the causal factors at work in developing the knowledge needed to gain release from the realm of fabrication
Although the lists follow different lines of thisthat conditionality he insisted that they were equivalent
Thus any fair account of his teachings must make room for the variety of paths he outlined and for the fact that each is helpfully specific and precise
The content of the teachings Perhaps one of the most radical aspects of the Buddha's teachings is the assertion that the factors at work in the cosmos at large are the same as those at work in the way each individual mind processes experience
These processes rather than the sensory data that they process are primary in one's experience of the cosmos
If one can disband the act of processing one is freed from the cosmic causal net
What this means in the case of the individual mind  engaged in and suffering from the processes of time and the present  is that the way out is to be found by focusing directly on the processing of present experience for that is where the crucial issues play themselves out most clearly
Here and now is where everything important is happening not there and then
At the same time the skills needed to deal with these issues are skills of the mind proper ways of analyzing what one experiences and proper qualities of mind to bring to the analysis to make it as clear and effective as possible
This boils down to the proper frame of reference the proper quality of awareness and the proper mode of analysis
These are precisely the topics covered in the Wings to Awakening although as one's skill develops they coalesce the quality of awareness itself becomes the frame of reference and the object to which the analysis is applied
The presentation of the teaching Because the Buddha's listeners were already caught in the midst of the web of thisthat conditionality he had to present his message in a way that spoke to their condition
This meant that he had to be sensitive both to the linear effects of past kamma that might either prevent or support the listener's ability to benefit from the teaching and to the listener's current attitudes and concerns
A person whose adverse past kamma prevented Awakening in this lifetime might benefit from a more elementary teaching that would put himher in a better position to gain Awakening in a future lifetime
Another person's past kamma might open the possibility for Awakening in this lifetime but hisher present attitude might have to be changed before heshe was willing to accept the teaching
A second complication entailed by the principle of thisthat conditionality is that it has to be known and mastered at the level of direct experience in and of itself
This mastery is thus a task that each person must do for him or herself
No one can master direct experience for anyone else
The Buddha therefore had to find a way to induce his listeners to accept his diagnosis of their sufferings and his prescription for their cure
He also had to convince them to believe in their own ability to follow the instructions and obtain the desired results
To use a traditional Buddhist analogy the Buddha was like a doctor who had to convince his patients to administer a cure to themselves much as a doctor has to convince his patients to follow his directions in taking medicine getting exercise changing their diet and lifestyle and so forth
The Buddha had an additional difficulty however in that his definition of health  Unbinding  was something that none of his listeners had yet experienced for themselves
Hence the most important point of his teaching was something that his listeners would have to take on faith
Only when they had seen the results of putting the teachings into practice for themselves would faith no longer be necessary
Thus for every listener faith in the Buddha's Awakening was a prerequisite for advanced growth in the teaching
Without faith in the fact of the Buddha's knowledge of Unbinding one could not fully accept his prescription
Without faith in the regularity of the Dhamma  including conviction in the principle of kamma and the impersonality of the causal law making the path open in principle to everyone  one could not fully have faith in one's own ability to follow the path
Of course this faith would then be confirmed step by step as one followed the teaching and began gaining results but full confirmation would come only with an experience of Awakening
Prior to that point one's trust bolstered only by partial results would have to be a matter of faith
Acquiring this faith is called going for refuge in the Buddha
The refuge here derives from the fact that one has placed trust in the truth of the Buddha's Awakening and expects that by following his teachings  in particular the principle of skillful kamma  one protects oneself from creating further suffering for oneself or others eventually reaching true unconditioned happiness
This act of going for refuge is what qualifies one as a Buddhist  as opposed to someone simply interested in the Buddha's teachings  and puts one in a position to benefit fully from what the Buddha taught
The Buddha employed various means of instilling faith in his listeners but the primary means fall into three classes his character his psychic powers and his powers of reason
When he gave his first sermon  to the Five Brethren his former compatriots  he had to preface his remarks by reminding them of his honest and responsible character before they would willingly listen to him
When he taught the Kassapa brothers he first had to subdue their pride with a dazzling array of psychic feats
In most cases however he needed only to reason with his listeners and interlocutors although here again he had to be sensitive to the level of their minds so that he could lead them step by step taking them from what they saw as immediately apparent and directing them to ever higher and more subtle points
The typical pattern was for the Buddha to begin with the immediate joys of generosity and virtue followed by the longerterm sensual rewards of these qualities in line with the principle of kamma then the ultimate drawbacks of those sensual rewards and finally the benefits of renunciation
If his listeners could follow his reasoning this far they would be ready for the more advanced teachings
We often view reason as something distinct from faith but for the Buddha it was simply one way of instilling faith or conviction in his listeners
At several points in the Pali Canon he points out the fallacies that can result when one draws reasoned conclusions from a limited range of experience from false analogies or from inappropriate modes of analysis
Because his teachings could not be proven prior to an experience of Awakening he recognized that the proper use of reason was not in trying to prove his teachings but simply in showing that they made sense
People can make sense of things when they see them as similar to something they already know and understand
Thus the main function of reason in presenting the teachings is in finding proper analogies for understanding them hence the many metaphors and similes used throughout the texts
Faith based on reason and understanding the Buddha taught was more solid than unreasoned faith but neither could substitute for the direct knowledge of the regularity of the Dhamma and of Unbinding for only the experience of Unbinding was a guarantee of true knowledge
Nevertheless faith was a prerequisite for attaining that direct knowledge
Only when the initial presentation of the teaching had aroused faith in the listener would heshe be in a position to benefit from a lessadorned presentation of the content and put it into practice
The need for various ways of presenting his points on a wide range of levels meant that the body of the Buddha's teachings grew ever more varied and immense with time
As his career drew to a close he found it necessary to highlight the essential core of the teaching the unadorned content so that the more timeless aspects of his message would remain clear in his followers' minds
Societies and cultures inevitably change so that what counts as effective persuasion in one time and place may be ineffective in another
The basic structure of thisthat conditionality does not change however the qualities of the mind needed for mastering causality and realizing the Unfabricated will always remain the same
The Buddha thus presented the Wings to Awakening as the unadorned content the timeless essential core
Even here however the principle of thisthat conditionality affected his presentation
He needed to find principles that would be relatively immune to changes in society and culture
He needed a mode of presentation that was simple enough to memorize but not so simplistic as to distort or limit the teaching
He also needed words that would point not to abstractions but to the immediate realities of awareness in the listener's own mind
And finally he needed a useful framework for the teaching as a whole so that those who wanted to track down specific points would not lose sight of how those points fit into the larger picture of the practice
His solution was to give lists of mental qualities as we noted above rather than any of the more abstruse philosophical doctrines that are often cited as distinctively Buddhist
These mental qualities are immediately present to at least some extent in every human mind
Thus they retain a constant meaning no matter what changes occur in one's mental landscape or cultural horizons
The Buddha presents them in seven alternative interconnected lists
Each list  when all of its implications are worked out  is equivalent to all of the others in its effects but each takes a distinctive approach to the practice
Thus the lists provide enough variety to meet the needs of people caught in different parts of the causal network
As one searches the texts for explanations of the meaning of specific terms and factors in the lists one finds that the lists connect  directly or indirectly  with everything there
At the same time the categories of the lists because they point to qualities in the mind encourage the listener to regard the teachings not as a system in and of themselves but as tools for looking directly into hisher own mind where the sources and solutions to the problem of suffering lie
As a result although the lists are short and simple they are an effective introduction to the teaching and a guide to its practice
From his experience with thisthat conditionality on the path the Buddha had seen that if one develops the mental qualities listed in any one of these seven sets focuses them on the present keeping in mind the four frames of reference and analyzing what appears to one's immediate awareness in terms of the categories of the four noble truths one will inevitably come to the same realizations that he did the regularity of the Dhamma and the reality of Unbinding
This was the happiness he himself sought and found and that he wanted others to attain
In addition to the seven lists the Buddha left behind a monastic order designed not only so that the teachings would be memorized from generation to generation but also so that future generations would have living examples of the teaching to learn from and a conducive social environment in which to put them into practice
This environment was intended as a gift not only for those who would ordain but also for those lay people who associated with the order taking the opportunity to develop their own generosity morality and mindfulness in the process
Associating with others who are following a sensitive disciplinary code forces one to become more sensitive and disciplined oneself
Although our concern in this book is with the Dhamma or the teaching of the Wings to Awakening we should not forget that the Buddha named his teaching DhammaVinaya
The Vinaya was the set of rules and regulations he established for the smooth running of the order
Dhamma is the primary member of the compound but the Vinaya forms the context that helps keep it alive
They meet in a common focus on the factor of intention
The Vinaya uses its rules not only to foster communal order but also to sensitize individual practitioners to the element of intention in all their actions
The Dhamma then makes use of this sensitivity as a means of fostering the insights that lead to Awakening
After he had placed the DhammaVinaya on a sure footing the Buddha passed away into total Unbinding
This event has provoked a great deal of controversy within and without the Buddhist tradition some people saying that if the Buddha was truly compassionate he should have taken repeated rebirth so that the rest of humanity could continue to benefit from the excellent qualities that he had built into his mind
His total Unbinding however can be seen as one of his greatest kindnesses to his followers
He showed by example that although the path to true happiness entails generosity and kindness to others the goal of the path needs no justification in terms of anything else
The limitless freedom of Unbinding is a worthy end for its own sake
Society's usual demand that people must justify their actions by appeal to the continued smooth functioning of society or the happiness of others has no sway over the innate worth of this level
The Buddha made use of the kammic residue remaining after his Awakening to make a free gift of the DhammaVinaya to all who care about genuine happiness and health but when those residues were exhausted he took the noble way of true health as an example and challenge to us all
Thus the DhammaVinaya can be seen as the Buddha's generous gift to posterity
The rules of the Vinaya offer an environment for practice while the Wings to Awakening are an invitation and guide to that practice leading to true happiness
Anyone anywhere who is seriously interested in true happiness is welcome to focus on the qualities listed here to see if thisthat conditionality is indeed the causal principle governing the dimensions of time and the present and to test if it can be mastered in a way that leads to the promised result freedom transcending those dimensions totally beyond measure and unbound
Of all the concepts central to Buddhism merit is one of the least known and least appreciated in the West
This is perhaps because the pursuit of merit seems to be a lowly practice focused on getting and selfing whereas higher Buddhist practice focuses on letting go particularly of any sense of self
Because we in the West often feel pressed for time we don't want to waste our time on lowly practices and instead want to go straight to the higher levels
Yet the Buddha repeatedly warns that the higher levels cannot be practiced in a stable manner unless they develop on a strong foundation
The pursuit of merit provides that foundation
To paraphrase a modern Buddhist psychologist one cannot wisely let go of one's sense of self until one has developed a wise sense of self
The pursuit of merit is the Buddhist way to develop a wise sense of self
The following readings show how this is done
They begin with a section on basic wisdom which shows how the questions that lead ultimately to the wisdom of letting go first focus on things to hold onto the skillful traits that on the beginning level provide a secure place to stand while letting go of character traits that are obviously harmful
Buddhist wisdom famously focuses in the characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself but the application of that wisdom grows out of the pursuit of what is relatively constant and pleasant and requires a mature sense of self able to plan for the future to sacrifice shortterm happiness for longterm happiness to consider the needs of others and to develop a strong sense of selfreliance in the pursuit of a happiness that is wise pure and compassionate
The section on merit then sets out in general terms the types of meritorious activities that conduce to that happiness focusing primarily on three giving virtue and meditation
The next three sections focus on the ways in which each of these activities can be pursued so as to produce the most happiness
For instance the section on giving discusses how the happiness of generosity can be maximized by wisely choosing the proper motivation for giving a gift a proper gift and a proper recipient for one's gift
The section on virtue shows how to learn from one's past mistakes without succumbing to debilitating feelings of guilt
The section on meditation discusses not only how the development of good will  the meditative practice most often cited in conjunction with merit  can lead to happiness both now and in the future but also how it can help minimize the bad results of one's past unwise actions
All three of these forms of merit conduce to the highest form of merit the realization of streamentry the first glimpse of the deathless
Thus the penultimate section of this study guide focuses on the happiness and wellbeing that derive from this attainment
For all the rewards of meritorious action however the concluding section serves as a reminder that the pursuit of happiness ultimately leads beyond the pursuit of merit
In fact this study guide is planned as part of a twopart study guide covering the Buddhist approach to the pursuit of happiness with the second part discussing the teachings on the three characteristics as the next stage in this approach as they lead to the deathless happiness attained with arahantship
Still it would be a mistake to view the two stages as radically separate
In the course of developing a wise sense of self in the pursuit of merit one is already learning how to let go of unwise ways of selfing as one learns to overcome stinginess apathy and hardheartedness through the development of giving virtue and good will
The teachings on the three characteristics simply carry this same process of deselfing for the sake of an even truer happiness to a higher pitch
There are some cases in which a person overcome with pain his mind exhausted grieves mourns laments beats his breast  becomes bewildered
Or one overcome with pain his mind exhausted comes to search outside 'Who knows a way or two to stop this pain' I tell you monks that stress results either in bewilderment or in search
This is the way leading to discernment when visiting a brahman or contemplative to ask 'What is skillful venerable sir
What is unskillful
What is blameworthy
What is blameless
What should be cultivated
What should not be cultivated
What when I do it will be for my longterm harm  suffering
Or what when I do it will be for my longterm welfare  happiness'
What do you think Rahula What is a mirror for
For reflection sir
In the same way Rahula bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts are to be done with repeated reflection
Whenever you want to perform a bodily act you should reflect on it 'This bodily act I want to perform  would it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it would lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it would be an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then any bodily act of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do
But if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction it would be a skillful bodily action with happy consequences happy results then any bodily act of that sort is fit for you to do
While you are performing a bodily act you should reflect on it 'This bodily act I am doing  is it leading to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it is leading to selfaffliction to affliction of others or both you should give it up
But if on reflection you know that it is not you may continue with it
Having performed a bodily act you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then you should confess it reveal it lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy life
Having confessed it you should exercise restraint in the future
But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful bodily action with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed  joyful training day  night in skillful mental qualities
Having performed a mental act you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful mental act with painful consequences painful results then you should feel distressed ashamed  disgusted with it
Feeling distressed you should exercise restraint in the future
But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful mental action with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed  joyful training day  night in skillful mental qualities
Rahula all those brahmans  contemplatives in the course of the past who purified their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts did it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts in just this way
All those brahmans  contemplatives in the course of the future who will purify their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts will do it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts in just this way
All those brahmans  contemplatives at present who purify their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts do it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts in just this way
Thus Rahula you should train yourself 'I will purify my bodily acts through repeated reflection
I will purify my verbal acts through repeated reflection
I will purify my mental acts through repeated reflection' That's how you should train yourself
As for the course of action that is unpleasant to do but that when done leads to what is profitable it's in light of this course of action that one may be known  in terms of manly stamina manly persistence manly effort  as a fool or a wise person
For a fool doesn't reflect 'Even though this course of action is unpleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is profitable' So he doesn't do it and thus the nondoing of that course of action leads to what is unprofitable for him
But a wise person reflects 'Even though this course of action is unpleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is profitable' So he does it and thus the doing of that course of action leads to what is profitable for him
As for the course of action that is pleasant to do but that when done leads to what is unprofitable it's in light of this course of action that one may be known  in terms of manly stamina manly persistence manly effort  as a fool or a wise person
For a fool doesn't reflect 'Even though this course of action is pleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is unprofitable' So he does it and thus the doing of that course of action leads to what is unprofitable for him
But a wise person reflects 'Even though this course of action is pleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is unprofitable' So he doesn't do it and thus the nondoing of that course of action leads to what is profitable for him
And what is the self as a governing principle
There is the case where a monk having gone to a wilderness to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling reflects on this 'It's not for the sake of robes that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness it's not for the sake of almsfood for the sake of lodgings or for the sake of this or that state of becoming that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness
Simply that I am beset by birth aging  death by sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs beset by stress overcome with stress Perhaps the end of this entire mass of suffering  stress might be known Now if I were to seek the same sort of sensual pleasures that I abandoned in going forth from home into homelessness  or a worse sort  that would not be fitting for me' So he reflects on this 'My persistence will be aroused  not lax my mindfulness established  not confused my body calm  not aroused my mind centered  unified' Having made himself his governing principle he abandons what is unskillful develops what is skillful abandons what is blameworthy develops what is unblameworthy and looks after himself in a pure way
This is called the self as a governing principle
'This body comes into being through conceit
And yet it is by relying on conceit that conceit is to be abandoned' Thus it was said
And in reference to what was it said
There is the case sister where a monk hears 'The monk named suchandsuch they say through the ending of the fermentations has entered  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known  realized them for himself right in the here  now' The thought occurs to him 'The monk named suchsuch they say through the ending of the fermentations has entered  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known  realized them for himself right in the here  now
Then why not me' Then at a later time he abandons conceit having relied on conceit
These four types of action have been understood realized  made known by me
Which four
There is action that is dark with dark result action that is white with white result action that is dark  white with dark  white result and action that is neither dark nor white with neither dark nor white result leading to the ending of action
And what is action that is dark with dark result
There is the case where a certain person fabricates an injurious bodily fabrication an injurious verbal fabrication an injurious mental fabrication He rearises in an injurious world where he is touched by injurious contacts He experiences feelings that are exclusively painful like those of the beings in hell
This is called action that is dark with dark result
And what is action that is white with white result
There is the case where a certain person fabricates an uninjurious bodily fabrication an uninjurious verbal fabrication an uninjurious mental fabrication He rearises in an uninjurious world where he is touched by uninjurious contacts He experiences feelings that are exclusively pleasant like those of the Everradiant Devas
This is called kamma that is white with white result
And what is action that is dark  white with dark  white result
There is the case where a certain person fabricates a bodily fabrication that is injurious  uninjurious a verbal fabrication that is injurious  uninjurious a mental fabrication that is injurious  uninjurious He rearises in an injurious  uninjurious world where he is touched by injurious  uninjurious contacts He experiences injurious  uninjurious feelings pleasure mingled with pain like those of human beings some devas and some beings in the lower realms
This is called kamma that is dark  white with dark  white result
And what is action that is neither dark nor white with neither dark nor white result leading to the ending of action
The intention right there to abandon this action that is dark with dark result this action that is white with white result this action that is dark  white with dark  white result
This is called action that is neither dark nor white with neither dark nor white result leading to the ending of action
And what is action that is neither dark nor white with neither dark nor white result leading to the ending of action
Right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
So aiming at Suppabuddha the leper the Blessed One gave a stepbystep talk ie a talk on generosity on virtue on heaven he declared the drawbacks degradation  corruption of sensual passions and the rewards of renunciation
Then when he saw that Suppabuddha the leper's mind was ready malleable free from hindrances elated  bright he then gave the Dhammatalk peculiar to Awakened Ones ie stress origination cessation  path
And just as a clean cloth free of stains would properly absorb a dye in the same way as Suppabuddha the leper was sitting in that very seat the dustless stainless Dhamma eye arose within him Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard Monks don't be afraid of acts of merit
This is another way of saying what is blissful desirable pleasing endearing charming  ie acts of merit
I am cognizant that having long performed meritorious deeds I long experienced desirable pleasing endearing charming results
Having developed a mind of good will for seven years then for seven aeons of contraction  expansion I didn't return to this world
Whenever the aeon was contracting I went to the realm of Streaming Radiance
Whenever the aeon was expanding I reappeared in an empty Brahmaabode
There I was the Great Brahman the Unconquered Conqueror Allseeing  Wielder of Power
Then for thirtysix times I was Sakka ruler of the gods
For many hundreds of times I was a king a wheelturning emperor a righteous king of Dhamma conqueror of the four corners of the earth maintaining stable control over the countryside endowed with the seven treasures  to say nothing of the times I was a local king
The thought occurred to me 'Of what action of mine is this the fruit of what action the result that I now have such great power  might' Then the thought occurred to me 'This is the fruit of my three action the result of three types of action that I now have such great power  might ie generosity selfcontrol  restraint'
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard There are these three grounds for meritorious activity
Which three
The ground for meritorious activity made of generosity the ground for meritorious activity made of virtue and the ground for meritorious activity made of development
These are the three grounds for meritorious activity
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard I have seen beings who  endowed with bodily good conduct verbal good conduct  mental good conduct who did not revile noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  at the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destination the heavenly world
It is not from having heard this from other brahmans  contemplatives that I tell you that I have seen beings who  endowed with bodily good conduct verbal good conduct  mental good conduct who did not revile noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  at the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destination the heavenly world
It is from having known it myself seen it myself realized it myself that I tell you that I have seen beings who  endowed with bodily good conduct verbal good conduct  mental good conduct who did not revile noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  at the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destination the heavenly world

As he was sitting to one side King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One Just now lord while I was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in my awareness 'Who are dear to themselves and who are not dear to themselves' Then it occurred to me 'Those who engage in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct are not dear to themselves
Even though they may say We are dear to ourselves still they aren't dear to themselves
Why is that
Of their own accord they act toward themselves as an enemy would act toward an enemy thus they aren't dear to themselves
But those who engage in good bodily conduct good verbal conduct  good mental conduct are dear to themselves
Even though they may say We aren't dear to ourselves still they are dear to themselves
Why is that
Of their own accord they act toward themselves as a dear one would act toward a dear one thus they are dear to themselves' That's the way it is great king
That's the way it is
Those who engage in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct are not dear to themselves
Even though they may say 'We are dear to ourselves' still they aren't dear to themselves
Why is that
Of their own accord they act toward themselves as an enemy would act toward an enemy thus they aren't dear to themselves
But those who engage in good bodily conduct good verbal conduct  good mental conduct are dear to themselves
Even though they may say 'We aren't dear to ourselves' still they are dear to themselves
Why is that
Of their own accord they act toward themselves as a dear one would act toward a dear one thus they are dear to themselves
That is what the Blessed One said
Having said that the One WellGone the Teacher said further
As he was sitting to one side King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One Is there lord any one quality that keeps both kinds of benefits secure  benefits in this life  benefits in lives to come
There is one quality great king that keeps both kinds of benefits secure  benefits in this life  benefits in lives to come
But what venerable sir is that one quality
Heedfulness great king
Just as the footprints of all living beings with legs can be encompassed by the footprint of the elephant and the elephant's footprint is declared to be supreme among them in terms of its great size in the same way heedfulness is the one quality that keeps both kinds of benefits secure  benefits in this life  benefits in lives to come
That is what the Blessed One said
Having said that the One WellGone the Teacher said further
Without abandoning these five qualities one is incapable of entering  remaining in the first jhana second jhana the third jhana the fourth jhana incapable of realizing the fruit of streamentry the fruit of oncereturning the fruit of nonreturning arahantship
Which five
Stinginess as to one's monastery one's family one's gains one's status and stinginess as to the Dhamma
And what is the treasure of generosity
There is the case of a disciple of the noble ones his awareness cleansed of the stain of stinginess living at home freely generous openhanded delighting in being magnanimous responsive to requests delighting in the distribution of alms
This is called the treasure of generosity
Then another deva exclaimed in the Blessed One's presence
These are the five rewards of generosity One is dear and appealing to people at large one is admired by good people one's good name is spread about one does not stray from the rightful duties of the householder and with the breakup of the body at death one reappears in a good destination in the heavenly worlds
If beings knew as I know the results of giving and sharing they would not eat without have given nor would the stain of miserliness overcome their minds
Even if it were their last bite their last mouthful they would not eat without having shared if there were someone to receive their gift
But because beings do not know as I know the results of giving and sharing they eat without have given
The stain of miserliness overcomes their minds
Asibandhakaputta the headman said to the Blessed One Venerable sir doesn't the Blessed One in many ways praise kindness protection  sympathy for families
Yes headman the Tathagata in many ways praises kindness protection  sympathy for families
Then how venerable sir is the Blessed One together with a large community of monks wandering on tour around Nalanda in the midst of famine a time of scarcity when the crops are white with blight and turned to straw
The Blessed One is practicing for the ruin of families
The Blessed One is practicing for the demise of families
The Blessed One is practicing for the downfall of families
Headman recollecting back over aeons I do not know any family to have been brought to downfall through the giving of cooked alms
On the contrary Whatever families are rich with much wealth with many possessions with a great deal of money a great many accoutrements of wealth a great many commodities all have become so from giving from truth from restraint
In giving a meal the donor gives five things to the recipient
Which five
Heshe gives life beauty happiness strength  quickwittedness
Having given life heshe has a share in long life either human or divine
Having given beauty heshe has a share in beauty either human or divine
Having given happiness heshe has a share in happiness either human or divine
Having given strength heshe has a share in strength either human or divine
Having given quickwittedness heshe has a share in quickwittedness either human or divine
In giving a meal the donor gives these five things to the recipient
Then a certain devata in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta's Grove went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him stood to one side
As she was standing there she recited these verses in the Blessed One's presence
Now on that occasion Princess Sumana  with an entourage of ladiesinwaiting riding on carriages  went to where the Buddha was staying
On arrival having bowed down she sat to one side
As she was sitting there she said to the Blessed One Suppose there were two disciples of the Blessed One equal in conviction virtue and discernment but one was a giver of alms and the other was not
At the breakup of the body after death they would reappear in a good destination in the heavenly world
Having become devas would there be any distinction any difference between the two
Yes there would said the Blessed One
The one who was a giver of alms on becoming a deva would surpass the other in five areas in divine life span divine beauty divine pleasure divine status and divine power And if they were to fall from there and reappear in this world Having become human beings would there be any distinction any difference between the two
Yes there would said the Blessed One
The one who was a giver of alms on becoming a human being would surpass the other in five areas in human life span human beauty human pleasure human status and human power And if they were to go forth from home into the homeless life of a monk Having gone forth would there be any distinction any difference between the two
Yes there would said the Blessed One
The one who was a giver of alms on going forth would surpass the other in five areas He would often be asked to make use of robes it would be rare that he wouldn't be asked
He would often be asked to take food to make use of shelter to make use of medicine it would be rare that he wouldn't be asked
His companions in the holy life would often treat him with pleasing actions pleasing words pleasing thoughts and present him with pleasing gifts and rarely with unpleasing And if both were to attain arahantship would there be any distinction any difference between their attainments of arahantship
In that case I tell you that there would be no difference between the two as to their release
It's awesome lord and astounding
Just this is reason enough to give alms to make merit in that it benefits one as a deva as a human being and as a monk
Then Janussonin the brahman went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama you know that we brahmans give gifts make offerings 'May this gift accrue to our dead relatives
May our dead relatives partake of this gift' Now Master Gotama does that gift accrue to our dead relatives
Do our dead relatives partake of that gift
In possible places brahman it accrues to them but not in impossible places
And which Master Gotama are the possible places
Which are the impossible places
There is the case brahman where a certain person takes life takes what is not given engages in sensual misconduct engages in false speech engages in divisive speech engages in abusive speech engages in idle chatter is covetous bears ill will and has wrong views

He lives there he remains there by means of whatever is the food of hungry shades
He lives there he remains that by means of whatever his friends or relatives give in dedication to him
This is the possible place for that gift to accrue to one staying there
But Master Gotama if that dead relative does not reappear in that possible place who partakes of that gift
Other dead relatives brahman who have reappeared in that possible place
But Master Gotama if that dead relative does not reappear in that possible place and other dead relatives have not reappeared in that possible place then who partakes of that gift
It's impossible brahman it cannot be that over this long time that possible place is devoid of one's dead relatives
But at any rate the donor does not go without reward
Does Master Gotama describe any preparation for the impossible places
Brahman I do describe a preparation for the impossible places
There is the case where a certain person takes life takes what is not given engages in sensual misconduct engages in false speech engages in divisive speech engages in abusive speech engages in idle chatter is covetous bears ill will and has wrong views
But he gives food drink cloth vehicles garlands scents creams bed lodging  lamps to brahmans  contemplatives
With the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of elephants
There he receives food drink flowers  various ornaments
It's because he took life took what is not given engaged in sensual misconduct engaged in false speech engaged in divisive speech engaged in abusive speech engaged in idle chatter was covetous bore ill will and had wrong views that he reappears in the company of elephants

But at any rate brahman the donor does not go without reward
It's amazing Master Gotama it's astounding how it's enough to make one want to give a gift enough to make one want to make an offering where the donor does not go without reward
That's the way it is brahman
That's the way it is
The donor does not go without reward
Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monks
May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life
Then Ven
Sariputta together with the lay followers from Campa went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Might there be the case where a person gives a gift of a certain sort and it does not bear great fruit or great benefit whereas another person gives a gift of the same sort and it bears great fruit and great benefit
Yes Sariputta there would Why lord
Sariputta there is the case where a person gives a gift seeking his own profit with a mind attached seeking to store up for himself 'I'll enjoy this after death' He gives his gift  food drink clothing a vehicle a garland perfume  ointment bedding shelter  a lamp  to a brahman or a contemplative
What do you think Sariputta
Might a person give such a gift as this
Yes lord
Having given this gift seeking his own profit  with a mind attached seeking to store up for himself 'I'll enjoy this after death'  on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of the Four Great Kings
Then having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this world
Then there is the case of a person who gives a gift not seeking his own profit not with a mind attached not seeking to store up for himself nor 'I'll enjoy this after death' Instead he gives a gift with the thought 'Giving is good' He gives his gift  food drink clothing a vehicle a garland perfume  ointment bedding shelter  a lamp  to a brahman or a contemplative
What do you think Sariputta
Might a person give such a gift as this
Yes lord
Having given this gift with the thought 'Giving is good' on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of the devas of the Thirtythree
Then having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this world
Or instead of thinking 'Giving is good' he gives a gift with the thought 'This was given in the past done in the past by my father  grandfather
It would not be right for me to let this old family custom be discontinued' on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of the devas of the Hours
Then having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this world
Or instead he gives a gift with the thought 'I am welloff
These are not welloff
It would not be right for me being welloff not to give a gift to those who are not welloff' on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of the Contented devas
Then having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this world
Or instead he gives a gift with the thought 'Just as there were the great sacrifices of the sages of the past  Atthaka Vamaka Vamadeva Vessamitta Yamataggi Angirasa Bharadvaja Vasettha Kassapa  Bhagu  in the same way will this be my distribution of gifts' on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of the devas who delight in creation
Then having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this world
Or instead he gives a gift with the thought 'When this gift of mine is given it makes the mind serene
Gratification  joy arise' on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of the devas who have power over the creations of others
Then having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a returner coming back to this world
Or instead of thinking 'When this gift of mine is given it makes the mind serene
Gratification  joy arise' he gives a gift with the thought 'This is an ornament for the mind a support for the mind' He gives his gift  food drink clothing a vehicle a garland perfume  ointment bedding shelter  a lamp  to a brahman or a contemplative
What do you think Sariputta
Might a person give such a gift as this
Yes lord
Having given this not seeking his own profit not with a mind attached not seeking to store up for himself nor 'I'll enjoy this after death'
 nor with the thought 'Giving is good'
 nor with the thought 'This was given in the past done in the past by my father  grandfather
It would not be right for me to let this old family custom be discontinued'
 nor with the thought 'I am welloff
These are not welloff
It would not be right for me being welloff not to give a gift to those who are not welloff' nor with the thought 'Just as there were the great sacrifices of the sages of the past  Atthaka Vamaka Vamadeva Vessamitta Yamadaggi Angirasa Bharadvaja Vasettha Kassapa  Bhagu  in the same way this will be my distribution of gifts'
 nor with the thought 'When this gift of mine is given it makes the mind serene
Gratification  joy arise'
 but with the thought 'This is an ornament for the mind a support for the mind'  on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the company of Brahma's Retinue
Then having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty he is a nonreturner
He does not come back to this world
This Sariputta is the cause this is the reason why a person gives a gift of a certain sort and it does not bear great fruit or great benefit whereas another person gives a gift of the same sort and it bears great fruit and great benefit

There are these five seasonable gifts

So Prince Payasi established a donation for brahmans contemplatives indigents hoboes paupers  beggars
And in that donation he gave food of this sort unhusked rice porridge together with pickle brine
And he gave rough cloth with knotted fringe
Now a brahman youth named Uttara was the superintendent of that donation
As he was giving the donation he dedicated it in this wayThrough this donation may I be associated with Prince Payasi in this life but not in the next Prince Payasi heard that Uttara when giving the donation dedicated it in this way Through this donation may I be associated with Prince Payasi in this life but not in the next So having summoned him he said to him Is it true dear boy that when giving the donation you dedicated in this way 'Through this donation may I be associated with Prince Payasi in this life but not in the next'
Yes sir
But why do you dedicate it in this way
Don't we who wish to gain merit hope for the fruit of our donation
But sir the food in the donation is like this unhusked rice porridge together with pickle brine
You wouldn't want to touch it with your foot much less eat it
And the rough cloth with knotted fringe You wouldn't want to touch it with your foot much less wear it
You are dear  charming to us so how can we connect what is dear  charming with what is not charming
Then in that case my dear boy establish the sort of food that I eat and the sort of cloth that I wear
Responding Yes sir Uttara the brahman youth established the sort of food that Prince Payasi ate and the sort of cloth that Prince Payasi wore
Then Prince Payasi  having given the donation inattentively having given the donation not with his own hand having given the donation thoughtlessly having given the donation as if he were throwing it away  on the breakup of the body after death reappeared in the company of the devas of the Four Great Kings in the empty Serisaka palace
But Uttara the brahman youth who was the superintendent of the donation  having given the donation attentively having given the donation with his own hand having given the donation thoughtfully having given the donation not as if he were throwing it away  on the breakup of the body after death reappeared in the good destination the heavenly world in the company of the devas of the Thirtythree
And how is a donation endowed with six factors
There is the case where the donor has three factors and the recipients have three
And which are the donor's three factors
There is the case where the donor before giving is happy
While giving hisher mind is clear  confident
After giving heshe is gratified
There are the donor's three factors
And which are the recipients' three factors
There is the case where the recipients are free from passion or are practicing for the subduing of passion they are free of aversion or are practicing for the subduing of aversion they are free of delusion or are practicing for the subduing of delusion
These are the recipients' three factors Now it is not easy to take the measure of the merit of a donation thus endowed with six factors as 'just this much bonanza of merit bonanza of skillfulness nourishment of bliss heavenly ripening in bliss leading to heaven leading to what is agreeable pleasing charming happy  beneficial' It is reckoned simply as a great mass of merit that is unreckonable immeasurable
Just as it is not easy to take the measure of the water in the great ocean as 'just this many pails of water or hundreds of pails of water or thousands of pails of water or hundreds of thousands of pails of water' It is reckoned simply as a great mass of water that is unreckonable immeasurable
In the same way it is not easy to take the measure of the merit of a donation thus endowed with six factors as 'just this much bonanza of merit bonanza of skillfulness nourishment of bliss heavenly ripening in bliss leading to heaven leading to what is agreeable pleasing charming happy  beneficial' It is reckoned simply as a great mass of merit that is unreckonable immeasurable
Then King Pasenadi Kosala went to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Well now great king where are you coming from in the middle of the day
Just now lord a moneylending householder died in Savatthi
I have come from conveying his heirless fortune to the royal palace ten million in silver to say nothing of the gold
But even though he was a moneylending householder his enjoyment of food was like this he ate broken rice  pickle brine
His enjoyment of clothing was like this he wore three lengths of hempen cloth
His enjoyment of a vehicle was like this he rode in a dilapidated little cart with an awning of leaves
That's the way it is great king
That's the way it is
Once in the past that moneylending householder provided alms for the Private Buddha named Tagarasikhi
Saying 'Give alms to the contemplative' he got up from his seat and left
After giving though he felt regret 'It would have been better if my slaves or servants had eaten those alms' Now the result of his action in having provided alms for the Private Buddha named Tagarasikhi was that he appeared seven times in a good destination the heavenly world
And through the remaining result of that action he acted as moneylender seven times in this very same Savatthi
But the result of his action in feeling regret after giving alms  'It would have been better if my slaves or servants had eaten those alms'  was that his mind didn't lend itself to the lavish enjoyment of food didn't lend itself to the lavish enjoyment of clothing didn't lend itself to the lavish enjoyment of a vehicle didn't lend itself to the lavish enjoyment of the five strings of sensuality
Then Vacchagotta the wanderer went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama I have heard that 'Gotama the contemplative says this Only to me should a gift be given and not to others
Only to my disciples should a gift be given and not to others
Only what is given to me bears great fruit and not what is given to others
Only what is given to my disciples bears great fruit and not what is given to the disciples of others' Now those who report this Are they reporting the Master Gotama's actual words are they not misrepresenting him with what is unfactual are they answering in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing them
For we don't want to misrepresent the Master Gotama
Vaccha whoever says this 'Gotama the contemplative says this Only to me should a gift be given Only what is given to my disciples bears great fruit and not what is given to the disciples of others is not reporting my actual words is misrepresenting me with what is unfactual  untrue
Vaccha whoever prevents another from giving a gift creates three obstructions three impediments
Which three
He creates an obstruction to the merit of the giver an obstruction to the recipient's gains and prior to that he undermines and harms his own self
Whoever prevents another from giving a gift creates these three obstructions these three impediments
I tell you Vaccha even if a person throws the rinsings of a bowl or a cup into a village pool or pond thinking 'May whatever animals live here feed on this' that would be a source of merit to say nothing of what is given to human beings
But I do say that what is given to a virtuous person is of great fruit and not so much what is given to an unvirtuous person
As he was sitting to one side King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One Where lord should a gift be given
Wherever the mind feels confidence great king
But a gift given where lord bears great fruit
This is one thing great king  'Where should a gift be given'  while this  'A gift given where bears great fruit'  is something else entirely
What is given to a virtuous person  rather than to an unvirtuous one  bears great fruit
In that case great king I will ask you a counterquestion
Answer as you see fit
What do you think great king
There is the case where you have a war at hand a battle imminent
A noblewarrior youth would come along  untrained unpracticed undisciplined undrilled fearful terrified cowardly quick to flee
Would you take him on
Would you have any use for a man like that
No lord I wouldn't take him on
I wouldn't have any use for a man like that
Then a brahman youth a merchant youth a laborer youth would come along  untrained unpracticed undisciplined undrilled fearful terrified cowardly quick to flee
Would you take him on
Would you have any use for a man like that
No lord I wouldn't take him on
I wouldn't have any use for a man like that
Now what do you think great king
There is the case where you have a war at hand a battle imminent
A noblewarrior youth would come along  trained practiced disciplined drilled fearless unterrified not cowardly not quick to flee
Would you take him on
Would you have any use for a man like that
Yes lord I would take him on
I would have use for a man like that
Then a brahman youth a merchant youth a laborer youth would come along  trained practiced disciplined drilled fearless unterrified not cowardly not quick to flee
Would take you him on
Would you have any use for a man like that
Yes lord I would take him on
I would have use for a man like that
In the same way great king
When someone has gone forth from the home life into homelessness  no matter from what clan  and he has abandoned five factors and is endowed with five what is given to him bears great fruit
And which five factors has he abandoned

These are the five factors he has abandoned
And with which five factors is he endowed
He is endowed with the aggregate of virtue of one beyond training the aggregate of concentration of one beyond training the aggregate of discernment of one beyond training the aggregate of release of one beyond training the aggregate of knowledge  vision of release of one beyond training
These are the five factors with which he is endowed
What is given to one who has abandoned five factors and is endowed with five factors in this way bears great fruit

Then King Pasenadi Kosala descending from the palace went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now I was together with Queen Mallika in the upper palace
I said to her 'Is there anyone more dear to you than yourself'
'No your majesty' she answered
'There is no one more dear to me than myself
And what about you your majesty
Is there anyone more dear to you than yourself'
'No Mallika
There is no one more dear to me than myself' Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed

As he was sitting to one side King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One Just now lord while I was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in my awareness 'Who have themselves protected and who leave themselves unprotected' Then it occurred to me 'Those who engage in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct leave themselves unprotected
Even though a squadron of elephant troops might protect them a squadron of cavalry troops a squadron of chariot troops a squadron of infantry troops might protect them still they leave themselves unprotected
Why is that
Because that's an external protection not an internal one
Therefore they leave themselves unprotected
But those who engage in good bodily conduct good verbal conduct  good mental conduct have themselves protected
Even though neither a squadron of elephant troops a squadron of cavalry troops a squadron of chariot troops nor a squadron of infantry troops might protect them still they have themselves protected
Why is that
Because that's an internal protection not an external one
Therefore they have themselves protected' That's the way it is great king

Then the thought occurred to me 'I've had enough of this judging
Let some other fine fellow be known for his judgments' That's the way it is great king
That's the way it is
Even affluent nobles affluent brahmans  affluent householders tell deliberate lies with sensuality as the cause sensuality as the reason simply for the sake of sensuality

There are headman some brahmans  contemplatives who hold a doctrine  view like this 'All those who kill living beings experience pain  distress in the here  now
All those who take what is not given who engage in illicit sex who tell lies experience pain  distress in the here  now'
Now there is the case where a certain person is seen garlanded  adorned freshly bathed  groomed with hair  beard trimmed enjoying the sensualities of women as if he were a king
They ask about him 'My good man what has this man done that he has been garlanded  adorned as if he were a king' They answer 'My good man this man attacked the king's enemy and took his life
The king gratified with him rewarded him
That is why he is garlanded  adorned as if he were a king'

That is why the rulers having had him seized inflicted such a punishment upon him'
Now what do you think headman have you ever seen or heard of such a case
I have seen this lord have heard of it and will hear of it
So headman when those brahmans  contemplatives who hold a doctrine and view like this say 'All those who kill living beings experience pain  distress in the here  now' do they speak truthfully or falsely  Falsely lord
And those who babble empty falsehood are they moral or immoral
Immoral lord

And is it proper to place confidence in those who hold wrong view
No lord

Now what do you think headman have you ever seen or heard of such a case
I have seen this lord have heard of it and will hear of it
So headman when those brahmans  contemplatives who hold a doctrine  view like this say 'All those who tell lies experience pain  distress in the here  now' do they speak truthfully or falsely Is it proper to place confidence in those who hold wrong view  No lord

Then Asibandhakaputta the headman a disciple of the Niganthas went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Headman how does Nigantha Nataputta teach the Dhamma to his disciples
Nigantha Nataputta teaches the Dhamma to his disciples in this way lord 'All those who take life are destined for the plane of deprivation are destined for hell
All those who steal All those who indulge in illicit sex All those who tell lies are destined for the plane of deprivation are destined for hell
Whatever one keeps doing frequently by that is one led' That's how Nigantha Nataputta teaches the Dhamma to his disciples
If it's true that 'Whatever one keeps doing frequently by that is one led' then no one is destined for the plane of deprivation or destined to hell in line with Nigantha Nataputta's words
What do you think headman If a man is one who takes life then taking into consideration time spent doing  not doing whether by day or by night which time is more the time he spends taking life or the time he spends not taking life
 the time he spends taking life is less lord and the time he spends not taking life is certainly more
If it's true that 'Whatever one keeps doing frequently by that is one led' then no one is destined for the plane of deprivation or destined to hell in line with Nigantha Nataputta's words
What do you think headman If a man is one who steals indulges in illicit sex tells lies then taking into consideration time spent doing  not doing whether by day or by night which time is more the time he spends telling lies or the time he spends not telling lies
 the time he spends telling lies is less lord and the time he spends not telling lies is certainly more
If it's true that 'Whatever one keeps doing frequently by that is one led' then no one is destined for the plane of deprivation or destined to hell in line with Nigantha Nataputta's words
There's the case headman where a certain teacher holds this doctrine holds this view 'All those who take life are destined for the plane of deprivation are destined for hell
All those who steal All those who indulge in illicit sex All those who tell lies are destined for the plane of deprivation are destined for hell' A disciple has faith in that teacher and the thought occurs to him 'Our teacher holds this doctrine holds this view All those who take life are destined for the plane of deprivation are destined for hell There are living beings that I have killed
I too am destined for the plane of deprivation am destined for hell' He fastens onto that view
If he doesn't abandon that doctrine doesn't abandon that state of mind doesn't relinquish that view then as if he were to be carried off he would thus be placed in hell
 'Our teacher holds this doctrine holds this view 'All those who steal All those who indulge in illicit sex All those who tell lies are destined for the plane of deprivation are destined for hell' There are lies that I have told
I too am destined for the plane of deprivation am destined for hell' He fastens onto that view
If he doesn't abandon that doctrine doesn't abandon that state of mind doesn't relinquish that view then as if he were to be carried off he would thus be placed in hell
There is the case headman where a Tathagata appears in the world worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in clear knowing  conduct wellgone a knower of the cosmos unexcelled trainer of those to be tamed teacher of human  divine beings awakened blessed
He in various ways criticizes  censures the taking of life and says 'Abstain from taking life' He criticizes  censures stealing and says 'Abstain from stealing' He criticizes  censures indulging in illicit sex and says 'Abstain from indulging in illicit sex' He criticizes  censures the telling of lies and says 'Abstain from the telling of lies'
A disciple has faith in that teacher and reflects 'The Blessed One in a variety of ways criticizes  censures the taking of life and says Abstain from taking life There are living beings that I have killed to a greater or lesser extent
That was not right
That was not good
But if I become remorseful for that reason that evil deed of mine will not be undone' So reflecting thus he abandons right then the taking of life and in the future refrains from taking life
This is how there comes to be the abandoning of that evil deed
This is how there comes to be the transcending of that evil deed
 'The Blessed One in a variety of ways criticizes  censures stealing indulging in illicit sex the telling of lies and says Abstain from the telling of lies There are lies I have told to a greater or lesser extent
That was not right
That was not good
But if I become remorseful for that reason that evil deed of mine will not be undone' So reflecting thus he abandons right then the telling of lies and in the future refrains from telling lies
This is how there comes to be the abandoning of that evil deed
This is how there comes to be the transcending of that evil deed
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Nalanda in the Pavarika Mango Grove
Then Asibandhakaputta the headman went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One The brahmans of the Western lands lord  those who carry water pots wear garlands of water plants purify with water  worship fire  can take a dead person lift it out instruct it  send it to heaven
But the Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened can arrange it so that all the world at the breakup of the body after death reappears in a good destination the heavenly world
Very well then headman I will question you on this matter
Answer as you see fit
What do you think There is the case where a man is one who takes life steals indulges in illicit sex is a liar one who speaks divisive speech harsh speech  idle chatter is greedy bears thoughts of illwill  holds to wrong views
Then a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart 'May this man at the breakup of the body after death reappear in a good destination the heavenly world' What do you think would that man  because of the prayers praise  circumambulation of that great crowd of people  at the breakup of the body after death reappear in a good destination the heavenly world
No lord
Suppose a man were to throw a large boulder into a deep lake of water and a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart 'Rise up O boulder
Come floating up O boulder
Come float to the shore O boulder' What do you think would that boulder  because of the prayers praise  circumambulation of that great crowd of people  rise up come floating up or come float to the shore
No lord
So it is with any man who takes life steals indulges in illicit sex is a liar one who speaks divisive speech harsh speech  idle chatter is greedy bears thoughts of illwill  holds to wrong views
Even though a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart  'May this man at the breakup of the body after death reappear in a good destination the heavenly world'  still at the breakup of the body after death he would reappear in destitution a bad destination the lower realms hell
Now what do you think There is the case where a man is one who refrains from taking life from stealing  from indulging in illicit sex he refrains from lying from speaking divisive speech from harsh speech  from idle chatter he is not greedy bears no thoughts of illwill  holds to right view
Then a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart 'May this man at the breakup of the body after death reappear in destitution a bad destination the lower realms hell' What do you think would that man  because of the prayers praise  circumambulation of that great crowd of people  at the breakup of the body after death reappear in destitution a bad destination the lower realms hell
No lord
Suppose a man were to throw a jar of ghee or a jar of oil into a deep lake of water where it would break
There the shards  jarfragments would go down while the ghee or oil would come up
Then a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart 'Sink O gheeoil
Submerge O gheeoil
Go down O gheeoil' What do you think would that gheeoil because of the prayers praise  circumambulation of that great crowd of people sink submerge or go down
No lord
So it is with any man who refrains from taking life from stealing  from indulging in illicit sex refrains from lying from speaking divisive speech from harsh speech  from idle chatter is not greedy bears no thoughts of illwill  holds to right view
Even though a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart  'May this man at the breakup of the body after death reappear in a destitution a bad destination the lower realms hell'  still at the breakup of the body after death he would reappear in a good destination the heavenly world
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard All the grounds for making merit leading to spontaneously arising do not equal onesixteenth of awarenessrelease through good will
Good will  surpassing them  shines blazes  dazzles
Just as the radiance of all the stars does not equal onesixteenth of the radiance of the moon as the moon  surpassing them  shines blazes  dazzles even so all the grounds for making merit leading to spontaneously arising in heaven do not equal onesixteenth of awarenessrelease through good will
Good will  surpassing them  shines blazes  dazzles
Just as in the last month of the rains in autumn when the sky is clear  cloudless the sun on ascending the sky overpowers the space immersed in darkness shines blazes  dazzles even so all the grounds for making merit leading to spontaneously arising in heaven do not equal onesixteenth of awarenessrelease through good will
Good will  surpassing them  shines blazes  dazzles
Just as in the predawn darkness the morning star shines blazes  dazzles even so all the grounds for making merit leading to spontaneously arising in heaven do not equal onesixteenth of awarenessrelease through good will
Good will  surpassing them  shines blazes  dazzles
Now what are the roots of unskillful things
Greed is a root of unskillful things aversion is a root of unskillful things delusion is a root of unskillful things
These are termed the roots of unskillful things
And what are the roots of skillful things
Lack of greed is a root of skillful things lack of aversion is a root of skillful things lack of delusion is a root of skillful things
These are termed the roots of skillful things
Then the Kalamas of Kesaputta went to the Blessed One
On arrival some of them bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side
Some of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and after an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies sat to one side
Some of them sat to one side having saluted him with their hands palmtopalm over their hearts
Some of them sat to one side having announced their name  clan
Some of them sat to one side in silence
As they sat there the Kalamas of Kesaputta said to the Blessed One Lord there are some brahmans  contemplatives who come to Kesaputta
They expound  glorify their own doctrines but as for the doctrines of others they deprecate them revile them show contempt for them  disparage them
And then other brahmans  contemplatives come to Kesaputta
They expound  glorify their own doctrines but as for the doctrines of others they deprecate them revile them show contempt for them  disparage them
They leave us absolutely uncertain  in doubt Which of these venerable brahmans  contemplatives are speaking the truth and which ones are lying
Of course you are uncertain Kalamas
Of course you are in doubt
When there are reasons for doubt uncertainty is born
So in this case Kalamas don't go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by logical conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought 'This contemplative is our teacher' When you know for yourselves that 'These qualities are unskillful these qualities are blameworthy these qualities are criticized by the wise these qualities when undertaken  carried out lead to harm  to suffering'  then you should abandon them
What do you think Kalamas
When greed arises in a person does it arise for welfare or for harm
For harm lord
And this greedy person overcome by greed his mind possessed by greed kills living beings takes what is not given goes after another person's wife tells lies and induces others to do likewise all of which is for longterm harm  suffering
Yes lord
So as I said Kalamas 'Don't go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by logical conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought This contemplative is our teacher When you know for yourselves that These qualities are unskillful these qualities are blameworthy these qualities are criticized by the wise these qualities when undertaken  carried out lead to harm  to suffering  then you should abandon them' Thus was it said
And in reference to this was it said
Now Kalamas don't go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by logical conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought 'This contemplative is our teacher' When you know for yourselves that 'These qualities are skillful these qualities are blameless these qualities are praised by the wise these qualities when undertaken  carried out lead to welfare  to happiness'  then you should enter  remain in them
What do you think Kalamas
When lack of greed arises in a person does it arise for welfare or for harm
For welfare lord
And this ungreedy person not overcome by greed his mind not possessed by greed doesn't kill living beings take what is not given go after another person's wife tell lies or induce others to do likewise all of which is for longterm welfare  happiness
Yes lord
So as I said Kalamas 'Don't go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by logical conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought This contemplative is our teacher When you know for yourselves that These qualities are skillful these qualities are blameless these qualities are praised by the wise these qualities when undertaken  carried out lead to welfare  to happiness  then you should enter  remain in them' Thus was it said
And in reference to this was it said
Now Kalamas one who is a disciple of the noble ones  thus devoid of greed devoid of ill will undeluded alert  resolute  keeps pervading the first direction  as well as the second direction the third  the fourth  with an awareness imbued with good will
Thus he keeps pervading above below  all around everywhere  in every respect the allencompassing world with an awareness imbued with good will abundant expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill will
He keeps pervading the first direction  as well as the second direction the third  the fourth  with an awareness imbued with compassion
Thus he keeps pervading above below  all around everywhere  in every respect the allencompassing world with an awareness imbued with compassion abundant expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill will
He keeps pervading the first direction  as well as the second direction the third  the fourth  with an awareness imbued with appreciation
Thus he keeps pervading above below  all around everywhere  in every respect the allencompassing world with an awareness imbued with appreciation abundant expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill will
He keeps pervading the first direction  as well as the second direction the third  the fourth  with an awareness imbued with equanimity
Thus he keeps pervading above below  all around everywhere  in every respect the allencompassing world with an awareness imbued with equanimity abundant expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill will
Now Kalamas one who is a disciple of the noble ones  his mind thus free from hostility free from ill will undefiled  pure  acquires four assurances in the herenow
'If there is a world after death if there is the fruit of actions rightly  wrongly done then this is the basis by which with the breakup of the body after death I will reappear in a good destination the heavenly world' This is the first assurance he acquires
'But if there is no world after death if there is no fruit of actions rightly  wrongly done then here in the present life I look after myself with ease  free from hostility free from ill will free from trouble' This is the second assurance he acquires
'If evil is done through acting still I have willed no evil for anyone
Having done no evil action from where will suffering touch me' This is the third assurance he acquires
'But if no evil is done through acting then I can assume myself pure in both respects' This is the fourth assurance he acquires
One who is a disciple of the noble ones  his mind thus free from hostility free from ill will undefiled  pure  acquires these four assurances in the herenow
Then a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to him Lord just now in Savatthi a certain monk died after having been bitten by a snake
Then it's certain monks that that monk didn't suffuse the four royal snake lineages with a mind of good will
For if he had suffused the four royal snake lineages with a mind of good will he would not have died after having been bitten by a snake
Which four
The Virupakkha royal snake lineage the Erapatha royal snake lineage the Chabyaputta royal snake lineage the Dark Gotamaka royal snake lineage
It's certain that that monk didn't suffuse these four royal snake lineages with a mind of good will
For if he had suffused these four royal snake lineages with a mind of good will he would not have died after having been bitten by a snake
I allow you monks to suffuse these four royal snake lineages with a mind of good will for the sake of selfprotection selfguarding selfpreservation

No lord
Why is that
Because this great earth is deep  enormous
It can't easily be made to be without earth
The man would reap only a share of weariness  disappointment

Suppose that a man were to drop a salt crystal into a small amount of water in a cup
What do you think
Would the water in the cup become salty because of the salt crystal and unfit to drink
Yes lord
Why is that
There being only a small amount of water in the cup it would become salty because of the salt crystal and unfit to drink
Now suppose that a man were to drop a salt crystal into the River Ganges
What do you think
Would the water in the River Ganges become salty because of the salt crystal and unfit to drink
No lord
Why is that
There being a great mass of water in the River Ganges it would not become salty because of the salt crystal or unfit to drink
In the same way there is the case where a trifling evil deed done by one individual takes him to hell and there is the case where the very same sort of trifling deed done by the other individual is experienced in the here  now and for the most part barely appears for a moment
There is the case where a certain person is thrown into jail for half a dollar is thrown into jail for a dollar is thrown into jail for one hundred dollars
And there is the case where another person is not thrown into jail for half a dollar is not thrown into jail for a dollar is not thrown into jail for one hundred dollars
Now what sort of person is thrown into jail for half a dollar for a dollar for one hundred dollars
There is the case where a person is poor of little wealth of few possessions
This is the sort of person who is thrown into jail for half a dollar for a dollar for one hundred dollars
And what sort of person is not thrown into jail for half a dollar for a dollar for one hundred dollars
There is the case where a person is wealthy with many belongings many possessions
This is the sort of person who is not thrown into jail for half a dollar for a dollar for one hundred dollars
In the same way there is the case where a trifling evil deed done by one individual takes him to hell and there is the case where the very same sort of trifling deed done by the other individual is experienced in the here  now and for the most part barely appears for a moment
It's just as when a goat butcher is empowered to beat or bind or slay or treat as he likes a certain person who steals a goat but is not empowered to beat or bind or slay or treat as he likes another person who steals a goat
Now when what sort of person has stolen a goat is the goat butcher empowered to beat him or bind him or slay him or treat him as he likes
There is the case where a person is poor of little wealth of few possessions
This is the sort of person who when he has stolen a goat the goat butcher is empowered to beat or bind or slay or treat as he likes
And when what sort of person has stolen a goat is the goat butcher not empowered to beat him or bind him or slay him or treat him as he likes
There is the case where a person is wealthy with many belongings many possessions a king or a king's minister
This is the sort of person who when he has stolen a goat the goat butcher is not empowered to beat or bind or slay or treat as he likes
All he can do is go with his hands clasped before his heart and beg 'Please dear sir give me a goat or the price of a goat'
In the same way there is the case where a trifling evil deed done by one individual takes him to hell and there is the case where the very same sort of trifling deed done by the other individual is experienced in the here  now and for the most part barely appears for a moment
Now a trifling evil deed done by what sort of individual takes him to hell
There is the case where a certain individual is undeveloped in the body undeveloped in virtue undeveloped in mind undeveloped in discernment restricted smallhearted dwelling with suffering
A trifling evil deed done by this sort of individual takes him to hell
Now a trifling evil deed done by what sort of individual is experienced in the here  now and for the most part barely appears for a moment
There is the case where a certain individual is developed in the body developed in virtue developed in mind developed in discernment unrestricted largehearted dwelling with the immeasurable
A trifling evil deed done by this sort of individual is experienced in the here  now and for the most part barely appears for a moment
Monks for anyone who says 'In whatever way a person makes kamma that is how it is experienced' there is no living of the holy life there is no opportunity for the right ending of stress
But for anyone who says 'When a person makes kamma to be felt in such  such a way that is how its result is experienced' there is the living of the holy life there is the opportunity for the right ending of stress
There is the case where a monk might say 'Although good will has been developed pursued handed the reins taken as a basis steadied consolidated and wellundertaken by me as my awarenessrelease still ill will keeps overpowering my mind' He should be told 'Don't say that
You shouldn't speak in that way
Don't misrepresent the Blessed One for it's not right to misrepresent the Blessed One and the Blessed One wouldn't say that
It's impossible there is no way that  when good will has been developed pursued handed the reins taken as a basis steadied consolidated and wellundertaken as an awarenessrelease  ill will would still keep overpowering the mind
That possibility doesn't exist for this is the escape from ill will good will as an awarenessrelease'
Furthermore there is the case where a monk might say 'Although compassion has been developed pursued handed the reins taken as a basis steadied consolidated and wellundertaken by me as my awarenessrelease still viciousness keeps overpowering my mind' He should be told 'Don't say that
You shouldn't speak in that way
Don't misrepresent the Blessed One for it's not right to misrepresent the Blessed One and the Blessed One wouldn't say that
It's impossible there is no way that  when compassion has been developed pursued handed the reins taken as a basis steadied consolidated and wellundertaken as an awarenessrelease  viciousness would still keep overpowering the mind
That possibility doesn't exist for this is the escape from viciousness compassion as an awarenessrelease'
Furthermore there is the case where a monk might say 'Although appreciation has been developed pursued handed the reins taken as a basis steadied consolidated and wellundertaken by me as my awarenessrelease still resentment keeps overpowering my mind' He should be told 'Don't say that
You shouldn't speak in that way
Don't misrepresent the Blessed One for it's not right to misrepresent the Blessed One and the Blessed One wouldn't say that
It's impossible there is no way that  when appreciation has been developed pursued handed the reins taken as a basis steadied consolidated and wellundertaken as an awarenessrelease  resentment would still keep overpowering the mind
That possibility doesn't exist for this is the escape from resentment appreciation as an awarenessrelease'
Furthermore there is the case where a monk might say 'Although equanimity has been developed pursued handed the reins taken as a basis steadied consolidated and wellundertaken by me as my awarenessrelease still passion keeps overpowering my mind' He should be told 'Don't say that
You shouldn't speak in that way
Don't misrepresent the Blessed One for it's not right to misrepresent the Blessed One and the Blessed One wouldn't say that
It's impossible there is no way that  when equanimity has been developed pursued handed the reins taken as a basis steadied consolidated and wellundertaken as an awarenessrelease  passion would still keep overpowering the mind
That possibility doesn't exist for this is the escape from passion equanimity as an awarenessrelease'
And how is awarenessrelease through good will developed what is its destiny what is its excellence its reward  its consummation
There is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for Awakening accompanied by good will dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting go
He develops analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening persistence as a factor for Awakening rapture as a factor for Awakening serenity as a factor for Awakening concentration as a factor for Awakening equanimity as a factor for Awakening accompanied by good will dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting go
If he wants he remains percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome
If he wants he remains percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome
If he wants he remains percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome  what is
If he wants he remains percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not
If he wants  in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not  cutting himself off from both he remains equanimous alert  mindful
Or he may enter  remain in the beautiful liberation
I tell you monks awarenessrelease through good will has the beautiful as its excellence  in the case of one who has penetrated to no higher release
And how is awarenessrelease through compassion developed what is its destiny what is its excellence its reward  its consummation
There is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for Awakening accompanied by compassion etc If he wants  in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not  cutting himself off from both he remains equanimous alert  mindful
Or with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity 'Infinite space' he enters  remains in the sphere of the infinitude of space
I tell you monks awarenessrelease through compassion has the sphere of the infinitude of space as its excellence  in the case of one who has penetrated to no higher release
And how is awarenessrelease through appreciation developed what is its destiny what is its excellence its reward  its consummation
There is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for Awakening accompanied by appreciation etc If he wants  in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not  cutting himself off from both he remains equanimous alert  mindful

Or with the complete transcending of the sphere of infinitude of consciousness thinking 'There is nothing' he enters  remains in the sphere of nothingness
I tell you monks awarenessrelease through equanimity has the sphere of nothingness as its excellence  in the case of one who has penetrated to no higher release
There is the case where an individual keeps pervading the first direction  as well as the second direction the third  the fourth  with an awareness imbued with good will
Thus he keeps pervading above below  all around everywhere  in every respect the allencompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with good will abundant expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill will
He savors that longs for that finds satisfaction through that
Staying there  fixed on that dwelling there often not falling away from that  then when he dies he reappears in conjunction with the devas of Brahma's retinue
The devas of Brahma's retinue monks have a lifespan of an eon
A runofthemill person having stayed there having used up all the lifespan of those devas goes to hell to the animal womb to the state of the hungry shades
But a disciple of the Blessed One having stayed there having used up all the lifespan of those devas is unbound right in that state of being
This monks is the difference this the distinction this the distinguishing factor between an educated disciple of the noble ones and an uneducated runofthemill person when there is a destination a reappearing
Again there is the case where an individual keeps pervading the first direction  as well as the second direction the third  the fourth  with an awareness imbued with compassion Staying there  fixed on that dwelling there often not falling away from that  then when he dies he reappears in conjunction with the Abhassara devas
The Abhassara devas monks have a lifespan of two eons
A runofthemill person having stayed there having used up all the lifespan of those devas goes to hell to the animal womb to the state of the hungry shades
But a disciple of the Blessed One having stayed there having used up all the lifespan of those devas is unbound right in that state of being
This monks is the difference this the distinction this the distinguishing factor between an educated disciple of the noble ones and an uneducated runofthemill person when there is a destination a reappearing
Again there is the case where an individual keeps pervading the first direction  as well as the second direction the third  the fourth  with an awareness imbued with appreciation Staying there  fixed on that dwelling there often not falling away from that  then when he dies he reappears in conjunction with the Subhakinha devas
The Subhakinha devas monks have a lifespan of four eons
A runofthemill person having stayed there having used up all the lifespan of those devas goes to hell to the animal womb to the state of the hungry shades
But a disciple of the Blessed One having stayed there having used up all the lifespan of those devas is unbound right in that state of being
This monks is the difference this the distinction this the distinguishing factor between an educated disciple of the noble ones and an uneducated runofthemill person when there is a destination a reappearing
Again there is the case where an individual keeps pervading the first direction  as well as the second direction the third  the fourth  with an awareness imbued with equanimity
Thus he keeps pervading above below  all around everywhere  in every respect the allencompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with equanimity abundant expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill will
He savors that longs for that finds satisfaction through that
Staying there  fixed on that dwelling there often not falling away from that  then when he dies he reappears in conjunction with the Vehapphala devas
The Vehapphala devas monks have a lifespan of eons
A runofthemill person having stayed there having used up all the lifespan of those devas goes to hell to the animal womb to the state of the hungry shades

This monks is the difference this the distinction this the distinguishing factor between an educated disciple of the noble ones and an uneducated runofthemill person when there is a destination a reappearing
 AN
Then a certain monk went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One It would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief so that having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One I might dwell alone in seclusion heedful ardent  resolute
But it is in just this way that some worthless men make a request but then having been told the Dhamma think they should tag along right behind me
May the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma in brief
May the One Wellgone teach me the Dhamma in brief
It may well be that I will understand the Blessed One's words
It may well be that I will become an heir to the Blessed One's words
Then monk you should train yourself thus 'My mind will be established inwardly wellcomposed
No evil unskillful qualities once they have arisen will remain consuming the mind' That's how you should train yourself
Then you should train yourself thus 'Goodwill as my awarenessrelease will be developed pursued given a means of transport given a grounding steadied consolidated  wellundertaken' That's how you should train yourself
When you have developed this concentration in this way you should develop this concentration with directed thought  evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  a modicum of evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  no evaluation you should develop it accompanied by rapture not accompanied by rapture endowed with a sense of enjoyment you should develop it endowed with equanimity
When this concentration is thus developed thus welldeveloped by you you should then train yourself thus 'Compassion as my awarenessrelease Appreciation as my awarenessrelease Equanimity as my awarenessrelease will be developed pursued given a means of transport given a grounding steadied consolidated  wellundertaken' That's how you should train yourself
When you have developed this concentration in this way you should develop this concentration with directed thought  evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  a modicum of evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  no evaluation you should develop it accompanied by rapture not accompanied by rapture endowed with a sense of enjoyment you should develop it endowed with equanimity
When this concentration is thus developed thus welldeveloped by you you should then train yourself thus 'I will remain focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world' That's how you should train yourself
When you have developed this concentration in this way you should develop this concentration with directed thought  evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  a modicum of evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  no evaluation you should develop it accompanied by rapture not accompanied by rapture endowed with a sense of enjoyment you should develop it endowed with equanimity
When this concentration is thus developed thus welldeveloped by you you should train yourself 'I will remain focused on feelings in  of themselves the mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world' That's how you should train yourself
When you have developed this concentration in this way you should develop this concentration with directed thought  evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  a modicum of evaluation you should develop it with no directed thought  no evaluation you should develop it accompanied by rapture not accompanied by rapture endowed with a sense of enjoyment you should develop it endowed with equanimity
When this concentration is thus developed thus welldeveloped by you then wherever you go you will go in comfort
Wherever you stand you will stand in comfort
Wherever you sit you will sit in comfort
Wherever you lie down you will lie down in comfort
Then that monk having been admonished by the admonishment from the Blessed One got up from his seat and bowed down to the Blessed One circled around him keeping the Blessed One to his right side and left
Then dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now
He knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus he became another one of the Arahants
There is the case where an individual keeps pervading the first direction  as well as the second direction the third  the fourth  with an awareness imbued with good will
Thus he keeps pervading above below  all around everywhere  in every respect the allencompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with good will abundant expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill will
He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perception fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness notself
At the breakup of the body after death he reappears in conjunction with the devas of the Pure Abodes
This rebirth is not in common with runofthemill people
Then again a monk keeps pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with good will likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth
Thus above below  all around everywhere in its entirety he keeps pervading the allencompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with good will  abundant expansive immeasurable without hostility without ill will
He reflects on this and discerns 'This awarenessrelease through good will is fabricated  intended
Now whatever is fabricated  intended is inconstant  subject to cessation' Staying right there he reaches the ending of the mental fermentations
Or if not then  through this very Dhammapassion this Dhammadelight and from the total wasting away of the first five Fetters  he is due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that world
This too householder is a single quality declared by the Blessed One  the one who knows the one who sees worthy  rightly selfawakened  where the unreleased mind of a monk who dwells there heedful ardent  resolute becomes released or his unended fermentations go to their total ending or he attains the unexcelled security from the yoke that he had not attained before
Monks there are these four bonanzas of merit bonanzas of skillfulness nourishments of bliss
Which four
There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Awakened One 'Indeed the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessed' This is the first bonanza of merit bonanza of skillfulness nourishment of bliss
Furthermore the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Dhamma 'The Dhamma is wellexpounded by the Blessed One to be seen here  now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselves' This is the second bonanza of merit bonanza of skillfulness nourishment of bliss
Furthermore the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Sangha 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well who have practiced straightforwardly who have practiced methodically who have practiced masterfully  in other words the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs the eight when taken as individual types  they are the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect the incomparable field of merit for the world' This is the third bonanza of merit bonanza of skillfulness nourishment of bliss
Furthermore the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with virtues that are appealing to the noble ones untorn unbroken unspotted unsplattered liberating praised by the wise untarnished leading to concentration
This is the fourth bonanza of merit bonanza of skillfulness nourishment of bliss
These are four bonanzas of merit bonanzas of skillfulness nourishments of bliss
SN
defines the fourth bonanza of merit as follows Furthermore the disciple of the noble ones lives at home with an awareness cleansed of the stain of stinginess freely generous openhanded delighting in being magnanimous responsive to requests delighting in the distribution of alms
SN
defines it as follows Furthermore the disciple of the noble ones is discerning endowed with discernment of arising  passing away  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress
Just as it is not easy to take the measure of the water in the great ocean as 'just this many pails of water or hundreds of pails of water or thousands of pails of water or hundreds of thousands of pails of water' It is reckoned simply as a great mass of water that is unreckonable immeasurable
In the same way when a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with these four bonanzas of merit bonanzas of skillfulness it is not easy to take the measure of the merit as 'just this much bonanza of merit bonanza of skillfulness nourishment of bliss heavenly ripening in bliss leading to heaven leading to what is agreeable pleasing charming happy  beneficial' It is reckoned simply as a great mass of merit that is unreckonable immeasurable
A wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones when endowed with these four qualities has no terror no trepidation no fear at death with regard to the next life
Then there is the case of the person who has no doubt or perplexity who has arrived at certainty with regard to the True Dhamma
Then he comes down with a serious disease
As he comes down with a serious disease the thought occurs to him 'I have no doubt or perplexity
I have arrived at certainty with regard to the True Dhamma' He doesn't grieve isn't tormented doesn't weep beat his breast or grow delirious
This too is a person who subject to death is not afraid or in terror of death
A disciple of the noble ones endowed with these four qualities is a streamwinner steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for selfawakening
Furthermore a disciple of the noble ones endowed with these four qualities is linked with long life human or divine is linked with beauty human or divine is linked with happiness human or divine is linked with status human or divine is linked with influence human or divine
I tell you this Nandaka not having heard it from any other brahman or contemplative
Instead I tell you this having known seen and realized it for myself
When this was said a certain man said to Nandaka the chief minister of the Licchavis It is now time for your bath sir
Enough I say with this external bath
I am satisfied with this internal bath confidence in the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One picking up a little bit of dust with the tip of his fingernail said to the monks What do you think monks
Which is greater the little bit of dust I have picked up with the tip of my fingernail or the great earth
The great earth is far greater lord
The little bit of dust the Blessed One has picked up with the tip of his fingernail is next to nothing
It's not a hundredth a thousandth a one hundredthousandth  this little bit of dust the Blessed One has picked up with the tip of his fingernail  when compared with the great earth
In the same way monks for a disciple of the noble ones who is consummate in view an individual who has broken through the suffering  stress totally ended  extinguished is far greater
That which remains in the state of having at most seven remaining lifetimes is next to nothing it's not a hundredth a thousandth a one hundredthousandth when compared with the previous mass of suffering
That's how great the benefit is of breaking through to the Dhamma monks
That's how great the benefit is of obtaining the Dhamma eye
As he was standing to one side Uttara the deva's son recited this verse in the Blessed One's presence
Meditation is not simply a matter of bare attention
It is more a matter of appropriate attention seeing experience in terms of the four noble truths and responding in line with the tasks appropriate to those truths stress is to be comprehended its cause abandoned its cessation realized and the path to its cessation developed
These tasks involve processes of thought analysis and memory  which means that these processes instead of being enemies of meditation are actually the means by which Awakening is attained
The ten recollections are a set of meditation themes that highlight the positive role that memory and thought play in training the mind
They employ memory to sensitize the mind to the need for training to induce feelings of confidence and wellbeing conducive for concentration to keep the topics of concentration in mind to produce tranquility and insight and to incline the mind toward the deathless when tranquility and insight have grown sufficiently strong
Strictly speaking only seven of the ten are actually recollections recollection of the Buddha recollection of the Dhamma recollection of the Sangha recollection of virtue recollection of generosity recollection of the devas and recollection of stilling
The other three are called mindfulness practices mindfulness of inandout breathing mindfulness of death and mindfulness immersed in the body
However the Pali words for mindfulness and recollection  sati and anussati  are intimately related
In the Pali Canon sati does not simply mean awareness
It means the ability to keep something in mind it is a function of the active memory
This point is clear in the Buddha's definition of the faculty of mindfulness and it crops up again and again in the descriptions of these three mindfulness practices mindfulness involves keeping particular themes or intentions in mind so as to induce mental states necessary for concentration clear insight and release
Thus all ten of these practices  the recollections and mindfulness practices  employ memory as an essential factor
For convenience's sake it seems best to stick to the traditional label of recollection for all ten
Unlike other sets of meditation practices such as the four frames of reference or the four sublime abidings the ten recollections do not have a single canonical discourse devoted to the entire set
Thus the way they interact and support one another has to be pieced together from many different discourses scattered throughout the Canon
The only place where they are listed as a set is in a series of ten short discourses in the Anguttara Nikaya
These discourses suggest that all ten recollections function in the same way for all are described in the same terms This is one thing that  when developed  pursued  leads solely to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding From this formulaic statement it might be concluded that all ten are equivalent and interchangeable and that the choice of one theme over the others is simply a matter of personal preference
However other passages in the Canon indicate that this is not so
Each recollection plays a specific role in the practice and all are needed to provide a complete and effective training for the mind
In this way they are like the contents of a meditator's toolbox a range of approaches that every meditator should master so as to respond skillfully to whatever issue arises in the practice
Broadly speaking the roles of these practices are these
 Mindfulness of death is meant to evoke a sense of samvega  a sense of dismay over the dangers and futility of human life as it is normally lived with its ordinary defilements and a sense of urgency in trying to find a way beyond those limitations
This sense of urgency further induces the quality of heedfulness in approaching the practice which the Buddha said is basic to all skillful endeavors
 The first six recollections  of the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha virtue generosity and the devas  are meant to induce a sense of joy and confidence in the practice
The first two induce a sense of confidence in the practice itself the last three a sense of confidence in one's own worthiness to follow the practice while the third theme  recollection of the Sangha  can induce both
The texts say that the joy and confidence induced by these practices can bring the mind to concentration and cleanse it of defilement although they do not describe in any detail as to how far this cleansing goes or how it occurs
Passage  however suggests that these themes can perform this function as adjuncts to mindfulness practice
 Mindfulness of inandout breathing and mindfulness immersed in the body are the primary themes for developing tranquility and insight so as to lead to strong concentration in terms of the four jhanas or absorptions and they develop jhana in such a way that it gives added power to tranquility and insight in leading the mind to release
Of all the meditation themes taught in the Canon mindfulness of inandout breathing is treated in the most detail and so it seems to have pride of place among the ten recollections
The Buddha himself prior to his Awakening apparently practiced this theme more than any other
After his Awakening he frequently continued to practice it as well
However mindfulness of inandout breathing and mindfulness immersed in the body play complementary roles on the path
To begin with there is some overlap in the two in that the first four steps of breath meditation are also listed as techniques in mindfulness immersed in the body
In addition mindfulness immersed in the body  especially in its aspect as contemplation of the unattractiveness of the body  can handle strong defilements that in some cases do not respond to the tranquil concentration induced by mindfulness of inandout breathing
At the same time mindfulness immersed in the body can sometimes induce strong feelings of disgust and revulsion that cause the mind to respond in unskillful ways
When this happens mindfulness of inandout breathing can help dispel those feelings and replace them with a feeling of refreshment that helps the mind stay skillfully on the path
In this way these two mindfulness practices work together to keep the mind balanced and on course
 Once the mind has been brought to a developed state of tranquility and insight  able to see even the pleasures of jhana as inconstant stressful and notself  recollection of stilling is brought to bear so that the mind does not simply stay focused on the drawbacks of fabricated experiences
It does this by inclining the mind to the exquisite peace of the deathless experienced through dispassion cessation and Unbinding
When viewed in this way  starting with mindfulness of death and ending with a recollection aimed at Unbinding  the ten recollections illustrate the principle stated in  that mindfulness of death has as its final end not death but the deathless
The seven sections of this study guide are designed to flesh out this general outline
The material in each section is drawn from the Pali Canon and has been selected to provide more specifics as to the how the what and the why of each of these practices how they function what is supposed to be recollected in each of these themes and why each recollection is useful in training the mind
In reading these sections the following overview is useful to keep in mind
Section One
This section contains the only section of the Canon where the ten recollections are presented as a list
It also contains the Buddha's definition of the faculty of mindfulness to show that mindfulness in his vocabulary means something similar to recollection
Section Two
This section covers the first six recollections as a set
Passages  describe exactly what is to be recollected in these practices
 deals both with the qualities of mind that should be brought to these recollections  the five strengths of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment  and the rewards of these recollections in terms of joy and increased concentration
 emphasizes that this increased joy and concentration can also lead to cleansing the mind of defilements it also stresses that these recollections are a useful part of any uposatha practice the practice by which lay people rest from their daily work on the full moon new moon and quarter moon days devoting those days to listening to the Dhamma and training the mind in meditation
Passages  indicate two other uses for this joy and concentration cleansing the mind of fear and other unskillful thoughts while dwelling in seclusion and relieving the mind and body of any feverish or unsettling feelings that would prevent mindfulness practice from yielding higher states of jhana
Section Three
This section contains passages that aid in the recollection of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha adding more detail to the standard passages for each of these recollections
Because these recollections are meant to be inspiring it is helpful to know in more detail some of the inspiring attributes of their objects
Yet because different people will find different aspects of these objects more or less inspiring at any particular time this section cannot begin to cover the full range of passages that might be helpful in offering inspiration
Instead they focus more on the basics
In the case of the Buddha this means focusing on his Awakening and the way he found it
In the case of the Dhamma this means focusing on the qualities of mind the practice of the Dhamma is meant to induce and on the manner in which the Dhamma is taught
In the case of the Sangha this means focusing on how the Buddha's noble disciples were able to overcome inner and outer obstacles in the path
This last set of passages focuses on what honorable and admirable people they became thus inspiring confidence in them
But it also focuses on the fact that they began their practice with weaknesses similar to  or even worse than  ours and yet they were able to overcome those weaknesses using personal qualities that we all have in potential form
This latter consideration helps to inspire confidence in our own ability to follow the path as well
Section Four
This section covers the practice of mindfulness of inandout breathing
It includes passages that discuss the conditions that enable this practice to give quick results and passages that go into detail as to how rewarding those results can be
Central to this section are the repeated references to the sixteen steps that comprise the Buddha's approach to mindfulness of inandout breathing
 Breathing in long he discerns 'I am breathing in long' or breathing out long he discerns 'I am breathing out long' Or breathing in short he discerns 'I am breathing in short' or breathing out short he discerns 'I am breathing out short' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication'
 He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to rapture' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to rapture' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to pleasure' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to pleasure' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to mental fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe in calming mental fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out calming mental fabrication'
 He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe in gladdening the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out gladdening the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe in steadying the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out steadying the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe in releasing the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out releasing the mind'
 He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on inconstancy' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on inconstancy' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on dispassion' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on dispassion' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on cessation' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on cessation' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on relinquishment' These sixteen steps show that the Buddha did not regard this practice simply as a preliminary to other more advanced practices
These steps cover the entire path leading to full release
As  shows in its presentation of these steps mindfulness of breathing does not simply mean staying with the breath in the present it involves training the mind to develop a range of skills with each in and out breath
The irony of these sixteen steps is that even though they are the Buddha's most detailed meditation instructions the Canon leaves unanswered a number of important questions concerning them
The most prominent question concerns how the sixteen steps are related to one another
Are they meant to be sequential or can they be developed in a nonsequential way
Should the meditator try to cover all sixteen or is it enough to focus on just one of the four tetrads making up the sixteen
And in either case how is this done
Different passages suggest different answers to these questions
The suttas that present the sixteen steps without further explanation seem to indicate that all sixteen steps are to be followed and in a sequential way
Passage  however equates each of the tetrads with a frame of reference and then goes on to state that each frame of reference is sufficient to fulfill the seven factors for Awakening which in turn lead to full release
This suggests that it's enough to focus on any one of the tetrads
But in either case the suttas don't explain how one step leads to another
Perhaps this lack of explanation was an intentional part of the Buddha's teaching style forcing his students to make discoveries on their own
But it can be helpful to share a few thoughts on the matter based on what the suttas taken together seem to suggest
 indicates that the steps are meant among other things to lead to the jhanas
Thus the practice of the sixteen steps in one way or another should relate to the practice of jhana
And there are at least two possible ways in which this can happen one based on following the path of all sixteen steps and the other based on following the path of one of the tetrads
First taking the path of all sixteen steps
Steps and involve two of the factors of the first jhana directed thought and evaluation directing one's thoughts and attention to the breath in and of itself in the present at the same time evaluating it as one begins to discern variations in the length of the breath
Some modern teachers maintain that the factor of evaluation here also includes taking one's observations of short and long breathing as a basis for adjusting the rhythm of the breath to make it as comfortable as possible
Because the first level of jhana must be based on a sense of pleasure this advice is very practical
The remaining steps are willed or determined one trains oneself first by manipulating one's sense of conscious awareness making it sensitive to the body as a whole
Then one can begin manipulating the bodily sensations that become apparent within that fullbody awareness reducing them to a single sensation of calm by letting bodily fabrication  the in and out breathing  grow calm
As the breathing grows calm it allows for easeful sensations of rapture and pleasure to grow prominent
A comparison between the stages of breath meditation and the similes for the jhanas suggests that steps and  being sensitive to rapture and pleasure  involve making these feelings single as well by letting them suffuse the entire body just as the bathman kneads the moisture throughout his ball of bath powder
With bodily fabrications stilled mental fabrications  feelings and perceptions  become clearly apparent as they occur just as tuning a radio precisely to a certain frequency eliminates static and allows the message sent by the radio station broadcasting at that frequency to become clear
These mental fabrications too are calmed a step symbolized in the similes for the jhanas by the still waters in the simile for the third jhana in contrast to the spring waters welling up in the second
What remains is simply a sense of the mind itself corresponding to the level of fourth jhana in which the body is filled from head to toe with a single sense of bright radiant awareness
Once this stage is reached one can now turn one's attention to consolidating one's mastery of concentration
This is done by reviewing the various levels of jhana focusing not so much on the breath as on the mind as it relates to the breath
This develops a sensitivity to the different ways in which the mind can be brought to the desired state for gaining greater tranquility or insight
For instance if it needs to be gladdened one can gladden it with refreshing breathing or with any of the inspiring recollections
If it needs to be steadied one can develop fullbody awareness and calm any disturbances that can be detected in terms of bodily or mental fabrication
In the process of mastering these skills one also begins to grow sensitive to the different factors from which the mind can be released as it goes through the different levels of jhana  for example releasing it from sensuality by taking it to the first jhana releasing it from directed thought and evaluation by taking it from the first jhana to the second releasing it from rapture by taking it from the second level to the third and so forth
One comes to see that although the breath feels different on the different levels of jhana the cause is not so much the breath as it is the way the mind relates to the breath shedding the various mental activities surrounding its single preoccupation
The mastery of concentration developed in steps  provides an excellent chance to develop discernment into the pattern of cause and effect in the process of concentrating the mind in that one must master the causal factors before gaining the desired results in terms of gladness steadiness and release
This insight into cause and effect provides the basis for insight the ability to see events in the mind simply as events arising and passing away as part of a chain of causes and effects that also arise and pass away
Realizing the inconstancy and unreliability of the events in this pattern gives rise to the realization that they are also stressful and notself neither me nor mine but simply instances of the first noble truth of suffering and stress
When this discernment goes straight to the heart there occurs a sense of dispassion for any craving directed at them and an experience of their fading away and cessation
Finally one relinquishes attachment not only to these events but also to the discernment that sees through to their true nature
This brings the seven factors for Awakening to completion in a state dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting go where letting go would appear to be equivalent to the relinquishment in step
When one is able simply to experience the act of relinquishment without feeling that one is doing the relinquishing one stands at the threshold to total release
In this interpretation of the sixteen steps the first two tetrads constitute the stage of familiarizing oneself with the potentials of concentration that can be attained by focusing on the breath the third tetrad constitutes the stage of gaining insight to the patterns of cause and effect through mastering the concentration and the fourth tetrad constitutes the stage of bringing the mind to a point of relinquishing all activity even the activity of the path
These three stages correspond to the three stages of framesofreference practice described in detail in The Wings to Awakening
As for the interpretation in which each of the four tetrads is regarded as sufficient for full release this is best understood by first looking at the underlying pattern of the seven factors for Awakening which each tetrad is said to fulfill
The seven factors begin with mindfulness established on a particular frame of reference the body in and of itself feelings in and of themselves the mind in and of itself or mental qualities in and of themselves
This is followed by analysis of qualities which not only perceives the chosen frame of reference in terms of dhammas but also how these dhammas may be skillful or unskillful
Then follows persistence which  as right effort  abandons the unskillful qualities and develops the skillful ones leading to the factors of rapture calm concentration and equanimity
Thus the general pattern consists of focusing on a particular frame of reference seeing it as dhammas and dealing with those dhammas in a skillful way so as to bring about calming and peace
This is precisely the pattern followed in each of the four tetrads
As one stays focused on the breath as one's basic theme to the point of giving rise to jhana one has the choice of viewing the events of the developing concentration in terms of any one of the four frames of reference the body feelings the mind and mental qualities
As long as one's practice is skillful events will develop in line with the above pattern regardless of the chosen frame
Thus each tetrad provides a particular perspective on these events as they relate to the corresponding frame of reference
The first tetrad shows how the development of breath concentration registers in terms of the body
In steps and one becomes sensitized to the breath in terms of its length
In step one becomes sensitive to the breath as a wholebody process
In step this fullbody awareness enables one to see the breath as a process fabricating the experience of the body
This in turn inclines one to allow that fabrication to grow calm creating feelings of rapture pleasure and ultimately equanimity
According to  this can lead  in the fourth jhana  to the absolute stilling of the inandout breath as the oxygen needs of the body decrease when the mind reaches a firm stillness
The second tetrad shows how the development of breath concentration registers in terms of feelings
In steps and one becomes sensitive to feelings of rapture and pleasure as they begin to manifest in the course of developing concentration first in a gentle way then in stronger ways
In step this sensitivity allows one to see the impact that these feelings have in fabricating the mind together with the perceptions that allow for one to maximize this sensitivity and its impact in the first place
This in turn inclines one to allow these feelings and perceptions to grow calm
An example of calming feeling would be abandoning rapture for equanimity
An example of calming perception would be to perceive the body as a full energy field rather than as a solid mass thus making it easier for the inandout breathing to grow still
According to  this stepbystep process of calming can lead through the jhanas and into the formless states culminating in the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling
The third tetrad charts the development of breath concentration in terms of the mind
In step one simply becomes sensitive to the state of the mind's awareness as it focuses on the breath in the present moment
In response to that sensitivity one can use the breath to induce desired states in the mind
If the mind needs gladdening one can breathe in ways that induce rapture and pleasure
If the mind needs steadying one can bring it to strong states of jhana by developing a strong fullbody awareness and by allowing both bodily fabrication and mental fabrication to grow calm
As concentration develops one can release the mind from the affliction of sensuality by bringing it into jhana and from the afflictions of the lower jhanas by bringing it to the higher jhanas
This process of release if it involves only the jhanas is temporary but if it leads to the release of Unbinding it is total and permanent
The fourth tetrad describes the development of breath concentration in terms of mental qualities
To be sensitive to mental qualities one first has to be sensitive to their arising and passing away
Thus the first step is to look for their inconstancy to see when they arise how they arise when they pass away how they pass away
As one is developing concentration based on the breath one has to watch both for the inconstancy of the unskillful qualities that block concentration  the hindrances  and for the skillful qualities that nurture it the factors for Awakening
In seeing the hindrances simply as events one can pull away from them weigh their allure and drawbacks and develop dispassion for them
Because one feels dispassionate toward them one no longer participates in fabricating them
Thus they cease
On this preliminary level however the cessation is temporary and lasts only as long as concentration can be maintained
However the practice of dealing with the hindrances in this way strengthens the first three factors for Awakening mindfulness analysis of qualities and persistence
In watching these factors as events one focuses on their inconstancy with a different agenda in mind instead of trying to develop dispassion for them immediately one tries to understand the causal factors behind their arising and passing away so that the factors for Awakening can be brought into being more often and maintained for longer periods of time
This process combined with the continued absence of the hindrances allows one's concentration to grow stronger and more solid
As one attains the higher jhanas one is in a position to change tactics
One can now view the lower jhanas in terms of their inconstancy so as to induce dispassion for them too
This tactic can be applied to higher and higher levels of jhana as one's powers of concentration and insight advance
Here again the sense of dispassion at first leads only to temporary cessation
But as this process continues there come stages of realization in which various hindrances and fetters are totally relinquished once and for all yielding the ultimate in calm and release
Thus in this interpretation each of the four tetrads of mindfulness of inandout breathing charts the way in which meditation progresses as seen from a particular point of view
They all touch on the same process  with the same threestep dynamic of sensitizing viewing as dhammas and then calming  showing how this process appears simultaneously from different frames of reference
In the course of one's practice one is likely to shift among all four of these frames of reference for they are all interrelated
For example in gladdening the mind one focuses on the breath to calm bodily fabrication and on feelings of rapture and pleasure as means of inducing gladness
In becoming sensitive to the entire body one naturally notices mental qualities that interfere with wholebody awareness and mental qualities that nurture it
However as the practice develops individual meditators will tend to focus on one frame more than the others
The four tetrads show how regardless of the chosen frame all four frames can simultaneously be brought into line with the basic pattern of the seven factors for Awakening
Regardless of which of these two interpretations one follows  and it is possible in practice to follow both  mindfulness of inandout breathing is obviously a method in which tranquility and insight develop in tandem
As  shows tranquility is a matter of allowing the mind to settle and become unified insight a matter of regarding experience in terms of fabrications
In the Buddha's practice of mindfulness of inandout breathing the mind is brought to stillness and unity through watching the breath  and its attendant feelings and mindstates  in terms of fabrication and allowing those fabrications to grow calm
Calm is thus attained through insight insight through calm
Perhaps it was because this method progresses in such a balanced way that the Buddha used it as his preferred theme of meditation and taught it more frequently and in more detail than any other
Section Five
This section covers mindfulness of death
As the passages collected here show the Buddha taught this topic not to induce a feeling of depression or hopelessness or a sense of sentimental nostalgia for the beauties of the world
He taught it to encourage heedfulness a sense that a great deal needs to be done in training the mind and that not much time remains to do it
Thus mindfulness of death fosters an appreciation of what human life offers the opportunity to do
What is valuable about life is not the pleasures that can be experienced but the skillful mental qualities that can be developed
Death is not the end but a transition and the transition will be easy or difficult depending on the qualities one has built into one's mind
Because there is no way of knowing when death will come one should focus each day on which skillful qualities of mind most need developing and which unskillful ones most need abandoning
Mindfulness of death is thus an excellent practice for ordering one's priorities
As  point out today may be one's last day in this life
What remains to be done
Some ideas are offered by  which point out the mental traits that lead one to fear death and  which point out the traits by which death leads to rebirth
If one focuses on lessening and eradicating these traits one's mindfulness of death can actually lead to the deathless
Section Six
This section covers mindfulness immersed in the body
Passage  in discussing how the body is a theme for both mindfulness practice and jhana practice illustrates a consistent theme in the suttas that there is no sharp divide between mindfulness and concentration practices and that mindfulness is intended to lead to jhana
It also contains the most complete discussion of the methods of this practice along with its rewards
In addition to the benefits listed in this sutta however other passages list other benefits as well mindfulness immersed in the body helps in overcoming lust pride based one's appearance or race and fear of death
It also provides a solid basis for restraint of the senses
Passage  points out that one of the practices listed under this heading  contemplation of the unattractiveness of the body  can lead to unskillful mental states that are best cleared away by turning to mindfulness of inandout breathing
People who resist the theme of unattractiveness tend to focus on this passage citing it as proof that the perception of unattractiveness is a dangerous and unhealthy meditation theme
However  points out that some strong defilements will respond only to this theme
And there is nothing inherently unhealthy about focusing on the unattractiveness of the body
Instead of fostering an unhealthy negative image of the body  in which other people's bodies are attractive while one's own is not  it fosters an accurate perception of aspects of the body that are often ignored and yet which are unattractive in everybody
This sort of negative image is thus healthy in that it helps cure the mind of its blind infatuations
Thus the two themes of breathing and unattractiveness are best practiced together as complementary tools in one's meditative repertoire to be mastered and honed so that they will be ready for use whenever needed
Section Seven
As mentioned above the recollection of stilling  the topic of the final section  guarantees that mindfulness of death does not stop at the topic of death but leads to the deathless
It also ensures that tranquility and insight do not stay focused on fabricated experiences but incline to the unfabricated
Passage  shows the ideal stage in the practice for this recollection when one has mastered jhana and begun to see even its refined pleasures as inconstant stressful and notself this recollection helps to turn the mind in the direction of what lies beyond tranquility and insight total Unbinding
As this passage points out if  after utilizing this recollection  one still regards Unbinding as an object of passion one's Awakening will not be complete
This is why the Buddha taught that all dhammas  not just fabricated ones  are to be seen as notself so as to overcome this passion
But when Unbinding is fully experienced not as an object but as the end of objects insight and tranquility are no longer needed for the purpose of liberation and can be used instead simply as pleasant means of abiding until the end of one's life when all this  the experience of the senses  grows cold right here

And what is the faculty of mindfulness
There is the case where a monk a disciple of the noble ones is mindful highly meticulous remembering  able to call to mind even things that were done  said long ago
He remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelings in  of themselves the mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
This is called the faculty of mindfulness
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Park
Now at that time Mahanama went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One I have heard that many monks are at work making robes for the Blessed One 'When the robes are finished at the end of the three months the Blessed One will set out wandering' For those of us living by means of various dwelling places by means of which dwelling place should we live
Excellent Mahanama excellent
It is fitting for clansmen like you to approach the Tathagata and ask 'For those of us living by means of various dwelling places by means of which dwelling place should we live'
One who is aroused to practice is one of conviction not without conviction is one with persistence aroused not lazy is one of established mindfulness not muddled mindfulness is centered in concentration not uncentered
One aroused to practice is discerning not undiscerning
Established in these five qualities you should further develop six qualities
There is the case where you recollect the Tathagata 'Indeed the Blessed One is pure and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessed' At any time when a disciple of the noble ones is recollecting the Tathagata his mind is not overcome with passion not overcome with aversion not overcome with delusion
His mind heads straight based on the Tathagata

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at the Eastern Monastery the palace of Migara's mother
Now at that time  it being the uposatha day  Visakha Migara's mother went to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As she was sitting there the Blessed One said to her Well now Visakha why are you coming in the middle of the day
Today I'm observing the uposatha lord
Visakha there are these three uposathas
Which three
The uposatha of a cowherd the uposatha of the Jains and the uposatha of the Noble Ones
And what is the uposatha of a cowherd
Just as when a cowherd returns the cattle to their owners in the evening he reflects 'Today the cattle wandered to that spot and this they drank at this spot and that tomorrow they will wander to that spot and this they will drink at this spot and that' in the same way there is the case where a certain person observing the uposatha reflects 'Today I ate this sort of nonstaple food and that sort of staple food
Tomorrow I will eat that sort of nonstaple food and this sort of staple food' He spends the day with an awareness imbued with that covetousness with that greed
Such is the uposatha of a cowherd Visakha
When this uposatha of a cowherd is undertaken it is not of great fruit or great benefit not of great glory or radiance
And what is the uposatha of the Jains
There are the contemplatives called the Niganthas
They get their disciple to undertake the following practice 'Here my good man
Lay down the rod with regard to beings who live more than leagues to the east more than leagues to the west more than leagues to the north more than leagues to the south' Thus they get the disciple to undertake kindness  sympathy to some beings but not to others
On the uposatha day they get their disciple to undertake the following practice 'Here my good man
Having stripped off all your clothing say this I am nothing by anything or of anything
Thus there is nothing by anything or of anything that is mine' Yet in spite of that his parents know of him that 'This is our child' And he knows of them that 'These are my parents' His wives  children know of him that 'This is our husband  father' And he knows of them that 'These are my wives  children' His workers  slaves know of him that 'This is our master' And he knows of them that 'These are my workers  slaves' Thus at a time when he should be persuaded to undertake truthfulness he is persuaded to undertake falsehood
At the end of the night he resumes the consumption of his belongings even though they aren't given back to him
This counts as stealing I tell you
Such is the uposatha of the Jains Visakha
When this uposatha of the Jains is undertaken it is not of great fruit or great benefit not of great glory or radiance
And what is the uposatha of the Noble Ones
It is the cleansing of the defiled mind through the proper technique
And how is the defiled mind cleansed through the proper technique
There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones recollects the Tathagata thus 'Indeed the Blessed One is pure and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessed' As he is recollecting the Tathagata his mind is brightened and joy arises the defilements of his mind are abandoned just as when the head is cleansed through the proper technique
And how is the head cleansed through the proper technique

It is owing to Brahma that his mind is brightened that joy arises and that whatever defilements there are in his mind are abandoned
This is how the mind is cleansed through the proper technique
 is the cleansing of the mind through the proper technique
And how is the defiled mind cleansed through the proper technique
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones recollects the Dhamma thus 'The Dhamma is wellexpounded by the Blessed One to be seen here  now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselves' As he is recollecting the Dhamma his mind is brightened and joy arises the defilements of his mind are abandoned just as when the body is cleansed through the proper technique
And how is the body cleansed through the proper technique

And how is the defiled mind cleansed through the proper technique
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones recollects the Sangha thus 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well who have practiced straightforwardly who have practiced methodically who have practiced masterfully  in other words the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs the eight when taken as individual types  they are the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect the incomparable field of merit for the world' As he is recollecting the Sangha his mind is brightened and joy arises the defilements of his mind are abandoned just as when clothing is cleansed through the proper technique

He is thus called a disciple of the noble ones undertaking the virtueuposatha
He lives with virtue
It is owing to virtue that his mind is brightened that joy arises and that whatever defilements there are in his mind are abandoned
This is how the mind is cleansed through the proper technique
 is the cleansing of the mind through the proper technique
And how is the defiled mind cleansed through the proper technique
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones recollects the devas thus 'There are the devas of the Four Great Kings the devas of the Thirtythree the devas of the Hours the Contented Devas the devas who delight in creation the devas who have power over the creations of others the devas of Brahma's retinue the devas beyond them
Whatever conviction they were endowed with that  when falling away from this life  they rearose there the same sort of conviction is present in me as well
Whatever virtue they were endowed with that  when falling away from this life  they rearose there the same sort of virtue is present in me as well
Whatever learning they were endowed with that  when falling away from this life  they rearose there the same sort of learning is present in me as well
Whatever generosity they were endowed with that  when falling away from this life  they rearose there the same sort of generosity is present in me as well
Whatever discernment they were endowed with that  when falling away from this life  they rearose there the same sort of discernment is present in me as well' As he is recollecting the devas his mind is brightened and joy arises the defilements of his mind are abandoned just as when a gold is cleansed through the proper technique
And how is gold cleansed through the proper technique
Through the use of a furnace salt earth red chalk a blowpipe tongs  the appropriate human effort
This is how gold is cleansed through the proper technique
In the same way the defiled mind is cleansed through the proper technique
And how is the defiled mind cleansed through the proper technique
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones recollects the devas As he is recollecting the devas his mind is cleansed and joy arises the defilements of his mind are abandoned
He is thus called a disciple of the noble ones undertaking the devauposatha
He lives with the devas
It is owing to the devas that his mind is brightened that joy arises and that whatever defilements there are in his mind are abandoned
This is how the mind is cleansed through the proper technique
Furthermore the disciple of the noble ones reflects thus 'As long as they live the arahants  abandoning the taking of life  abstain from the taking of life
They dwell with their rod laid down their knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beings
Today I too for this day  night  abandoning the taking of life  abstain from the taking of life
I dwell with my rod laid down my knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beings
By means of this factor I emulate the arahants and my uposatha will be observed
'As long as they live the arahants  abandoning the taking of what is not given  abstains from taking what is not given
They take only what is given accept only what is given live not by stealth but by means of a self that has become pure
Today I too for this day  night  abandoning the taking of what is not given  abstain from taking what is not given
I take only what is given accept only what is given live not by stealth but by means of a self that has become pure
By means of this factor I emulate the arahants and my uposatha will be observed
'As long as they live the arahants  abandoning uncelibacy  live a celibate life aloof refraining from the sexual act that is the villager's way
Today I too for this day  night  abandoning uncelibacy  live a celibate life aloof refraining from the sexual act that is the villager's way
By means of this factor I emulate the arahants and my uposatha will be observed
'As long as they live the arahants  abandoning false speech  abstain from false speech
They speak the truth hold to the truth are firm reliable no deceivers of the world
Today I too for this day  night  abandoning false speech  abstain from false speech
I speak the truth hold to the truth am firm reliable no deceiver of the world
By means of this factor I emulate the arahants and my uposatha will be observed
'As long as they live the arahants  abandoning fermented  distilled liquors that cause heedlessness  abstain from fermented  distilled liquors that cause heedlessness
Today I too for this day  night  abandoning fermented  distilled liquors that cause heedlessness  abstain from fermented  distilled liquors that cause heedlessness
By means of this factor I emulate the arahants and my uposatha will be observed
'As long as they live the arahants live on one meal a day abstaining from food at night refraining from food at the wrong time of day
Today I too for this day  night live on one meal abstaining from food at night refraining from food at the wrong time of day
By means of this factor I emulate the arahants and my uposatha will be observed
'As long as they live the arahants abstain from dancing singing music watching shows wearing garlands beautifying themselves with perfumes  cosmetics
Today I too for this day  night abstain from dancing singing music watching shows wearing garlands beautifying myself with perfumes  cosmetics
By means of this factor I emulate the arahants and my uposatha will be observed
'As long as they live the arahants  abandoning high  imposing seats  beds  abstain from high  imposing seats  beds
They make low beds on a pallet or a spread of straw
Today I too for this day  night  abandoning high  imposing seats  beds  abstain from high  imposing seats  beds
I make a low bed on a pallet or a spread of straw'
Such is the uposatha of the Noble Ones Visakha
When this uposatha of the Noble Ones is undertaken it is of great fruit  great benefit of great glory  radiance
And how is it of great fruit  great benefit of great glory  radiance
Suppose that one were to exercise kingship rule and sovereignty over these sixteen great lands replete with the seven treasures ie over the Angas Maghadans Kasis Kosalans Vajjians Mallas Cetis Vamsas Kurus Pañcalas Macchas Surasenas Assakas Avantis Gandharans  Kambojans It would not be worth onesixteenth of this uposatha endowed with eight factors
Why is that
Kingship over human beings is a meager thing when compared with heavenly bliss
Fifty human years are equal to one day  night among the Devas of the Four Great Kings
Thirty such days  nights make a month
Twelve such months make a year
Five hundred such heavenly years is the lifespan among the Devas of the Four Great Kings
Now it is possible that a certain man or woman  from having observed this uposatha endowed with eight factors  on the breakup of the body after death might be reborn among the Devas of the Four Great Kings
It was in reference to this that it was said 'Kingship over human beings is a meager thing when compared with heavenly bliss'
A human century is equal to one day  night among the Devas of the ThirtyThree
Thirty such days  nights make a month One thousand such heavenly years is the lifespan among the Devas of the Thirtythree
Now it is possible that a certain man or woman  from having observed this uposatha endowed with eight factors  on the breakup of the body after death might be reborn among the Devas of the Thirtythree
It was in reference to this that it was said 'Kingship over human beings is a meager thing when compared with heavenly bliss'
Two human centuries is equal to one day  night among the Yama Devas Two thousand such heavenly years is the lifespan among the Yama Devas
Four human centuries is equal to one day  night among the Contented Devas Four thousand such heavenly years is the lifespan among the Contented Devas
Eight human centuries is equal to one day  night among the Devas that Delight in Creation Eight thousand such heavenly years is the lifespan among the Devas that Delight in Creation
Sixteen human centuries is equal to one day  night among the Devas that Rule over the Creations of Others
Thirty such days  nights make a month
Twelve such months make a year
Sixteen thousand such heavenly years is the lifespan among the Devas that Rule over the Creations of Others
Now it is possible that a certain man or woman  from having observed this uposatha endowed with eight factors  on the breakup of the body after death might be reborn among the Devas that Rule over the Creations of Others
It was in reference to this that it was said 'Kingship over human beings is a meager thing when compared with heavenly bliss'
The Blessed One said Monks once the devas  asuras were arrayed for battle
Then Sakka the chief of the devas addressed the devas of the Thirtythree 'If dear sirs when the devas have gone into battle there should arise fear terror or horripilation then on that occasion you should catch sight of the top of my standard
For when you have caught sight of the top of my standard whatever fear terror or horripilation there is will be abandoned
'If you can't catch sight of the top of my standard then you should catch sight of the top of the devaking Pajapati's standard
'If you can't catch sight of the top of the devaking Pajapati's standard then you should catch sight of the top of the devaking Varuna's standard
'If you can't catch sight of the top of the devaking Varuna's standard then you should catch sight of the top of the devaking Isana's standard
For when you have caught sight of the top of the devaking Isana's standard whatever fear terror or horripilation there is will be abandoned'
But monks when the top of the devachief Sakka's standard is caught sight of or when the top of the devaking Pajapati's standard the top of the devaking Varuna's standard or the top of the devaking Isana's standard is caught sight of whatever fear terror or horripilation there is may be abandoned or may not be abandoned
Why is that
Because Sakka the chief of the devas is not devoid of passion not devoid of aversion not devoid of delusion
He feels fear feels terror feels dread
He runs away
But I tell you this If  when you have gone into the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building  there should arise fear terror or horripilation then on that occasion you should recollect me 'Indeed the Blessed One is worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessed' For when you have recollected me whatever fear terror or horripilation there is will be abandoned
If you can't recollect me then you should recollect the Dhamma 'The Dhamma is wellexpounded by the Blessed One to be seen here  now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselves' For when you have recollected the Dhamma whatever fear terror or horripilation there is will be abandoned
If you can't recollect the Dhamma then you should recollect the Sangha 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well who have practiced straightforwardly who have practiced methodically who have practiced masterfully  in other words the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs the eight when taken as individual types  they are the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect the unexcelled field of merit for the world' For when you have recollected the Sangha whatever fear terror or horripilation where is will be abandoned
Why is that
Because the Tathagata  worthy  rightly selfawakened  is devoid of passion devoid of aversion devoid of delusion
He feels no fear feels no terror feels no dread
He doesn't run away
That is what the Blessed One said
Having said that the Onewellgone the Teacher further said this
I have heard that on one occasion a certain monk was dwelling among the Kosalans in a forest thicket
Now at that time he spent the day's abiding thinking evil unskillful thoughts ie thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will thoughts of doing harm
Then the devata inhabiting the forest thicket feeling sympathy for the monk desiring his benefit desiring to bring him to his senses approached him and addressed him with this verse
The monk chastened by the devata came to his senses
There is the case of a monk who remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
As he remains thus focused on the body in  of itself a fever based on the body arises within his body or there is sluggishness in his awareness or his mind becomes scattered externally
He should then direct his mind to any inspiring theme
As his mind is directed to any inspiring theme delight arises within him
In one who feels delight rapture arises
In one whose mind is enraptured the body grows serene
His body serene he feels pleasure
As he feels pleasure his mind grows concentrated
He reflects 'I have attained the aim to which my mind was directed
Let me withdraw' He withdraws  engages neither in directed thought nor in evaluation
He discerns 'I am not thinking or evaluating
I am inwardly mindful  at ease'
Furthermore he remains focused on feelings mind mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
As he remains thus focused on mental qualities in  of themselves a fever based on mental qualities arises within his body or there is sluggishness in his awareness or his mind becomes scattered externally
He should then direct his mind to any inspiring theme
As his mind is directed to any inspiring theme delight arises within him
In one who feels delight rapture arises
In one whose mind is enraptured the body grows serene
His body serene he is sensitive to pleasure
As he feels pleasure his mind grows concentrated
He reflects 'I have attained the aim to which my mind was directed
Let me withdraw' He withdraws  engages neither in directed thought nor in evaluation
He discerns 'I am not thinking or evaluating
I am inwardly mindful  at ease'
The Blessed One said And how is one undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mind
There is the case where a pleasant feeling arises in an uneducated runofthemill person
On being touched by the pleasant feeling he becomes impassioned with pleasure and is reduced to being impassioned with pleasure
His pleasant feeling ceases
With the cessation of the pleasant feeling there arises a painful feeling
On being touched with the painful feeling he sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraught
When that pleasant feeling had arisen in him it invaded his mind and remained because of his lack of development of the body
When that painful feeling had arisen in him it invaded his mind and remained because of his lack of development of the mind
This is how one is undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mind
And how is one developed in body and developed in mind
There is the case where a pleasant feeling arises in a welleducated disciple of the noble ones
On being touched by the pleasant feeling he doesn't become impassioned with pleasure and is not reduced to being impassioned with pleasure
His pleasant feeling ceases
With the cessation of the pleasant feeling there arises a painful feeling
On being touched with the painful feeling he doesn't sorrow grieve or lament beat his breast or becomes distraught
When that pleasant feeling had arisen in him it didn't invade his mind and remain because of his development of the body
When that painful feeling had arisen in him it didn't invade his mind and remain because of his development of the mind
This is how one is developed in body and developed in mind
I have confidence in Master Gotama that Master Gotama is developed in body and developed in mind
 Well Aggivessana you are certainly being rude and presumptuously speaking your words but nevertheless I will respond to you
Ever since I shaved my hair  beard put on the ochre robe and went forth from the home life into homelessness it has not been possible for a pleasant feeling that has arisen to invade my mind and remain or for a painful feeling that has arisen to invade my mind and remain
But perhaps there has never arisen in Master Gotama the sort of pleasant feeling that having arisen would invade the mind and remain
Perhaps there has never arisen in Master Gotama the sort of painful feeling that having arisen would invade the mind and remain
Why wouldn't it have Aggivessana
Before my Awakening when I was still an unawakened bodhisatta the thought occurred to me 'Household life is confining a dusty path
Life gone forth is the open air
It isn't easy living in a home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure a polished shell
What if I having shaved off my hair  beard and putting on the ochre robe were to go forth from the household life into homelessness'
So at a later time when I was still young blackhaired endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life having shaved off my hair  beard  though my parents wished otherwise and were grieving with tears on their faces  I put on the ochre robe and went forth from the home life into homelessness
Having gone forth in search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace I went to Alara Kalama and on arrival said to him 'Friend Kalama I want to practice in this doctrine  discipline'
When this was said he replied to me 'You may stay here my friend
This doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter  dwell in his own teacher's knowledge having realized it for himself through direct knowledge'
It was not long before I quickly learned the doctrine
As far as mere lipreciting  repetition I could speak the words of knowledge the words of the elders and I could affirm that I knew  saw  I along with others
I thought 'It isn't through mere conviction alone that Alara Kalama declares I have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge Certainly he dwells knowing  seeing this Dhamma' So I went to him and said 'To what extent do you declare that you have entered  dwell in this Dhamma' When this was said he declared the dimension of nothingness
I thought 'Not only does Alara Kalama have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernment
I too have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernment
What if I were to endeavor to realize for myself the Dhamma that Alara Kalama declares he has entered  dwells in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge' So it was not long before I quickly entered  dwelled in that Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge
I went to him and said 'Friend Kalama is this the extent to which you have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge'
'Yes my friend'
'This friend is the extent to which I too have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge'
'It is a gain for us my friend a great gain for us that we have such a companion in the holy life
So the Dhamma I declare I have entered  dwell in having realized it for myself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge
And the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma I declare I have entered  dwell in having realized it for myself through direct knowledge
The Dhamma I know is the Dhamma you know the Dhamma you know is the Dhamma I know
As I am so are you as you are so am Come friend let us now lead this community together'
In this way did Alara Kalama my teacher place me his pupil on the same level with himself and pay me great honor
But the thought occurred to me 'This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to Awakening nor to Unbinding but only to reappearance in the dimension of nothingness' So dissatisfied with that Dhamma I left
In search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace I went to Uddaka Ramaputta and on arrival said to him 'Friend Uddaka I want to practice in this doctrine  discipline'
When this was said he replied to me 'You may stay here my friend
This doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter  dwell in his own teacher's knowledge having realized it for himself through direct knowledge'
It was not long before I quickly learned the doctrine
As far as mere lipreciting  repetition I could speak the words of knowledge the words of the elders and I could affirm that I knew  saw  I along with others
I thought 'It wasn't through mere conviction alone that Rama declared I have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge Certainly he dwelled knowing  seeing this Dhamma' So I went to Uddaka and said 'To what extent did Rama declare that he had entered  dwelled in this Dhamma' When this was said Uddaka declared the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
I thought 'Not only did Rama have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernment
I too have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration  discernment
What if I were to endeavor to realize for myself the Dhamma that Rama declared he entered  dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge' So it was not long before I quickly entered  dwelled in that Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge
I went to Uddaka and said 'Friend Uddaka is this the extent to which Rama entered  dwelled in this Dhamma having realized it for himself through direct knowledge'
'Yes my friend'
'This friend is the extent to which I too have entered  dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge'
'It is a gain for us my friend a great gain for us that we have such a companion in the holy life
So the Dhamma Rama declared he entered  dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge
And the Dhamma you declare you have entered  dwell in having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge is the Dhamma Rama declared he entered  dwelled in having realized it for himself through direct knowledge
The Dhamma he knew is the Dhamma you know the Dhamma you know is the Dhamma he knew
As he was so are you as you are so was he
Come friend lead this community'
In this way did Uddaka Ramaputta my companion in the holy life place me in the position of teacher and pay me great honor
But the thought occurred to me 'This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to Awakening nor to Unbinding but only to reappearance in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception' So dissatisfied with that Dhamma I left
In search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace I wandered by stages in the Magadhan country and came to the military town of Uruvela
There I saw some delightful countryside with an inspiring forest grove a clearflowing river with fine delightful banks and villages for almsgoing on all sides
The thought occurred to me 'How delightful is this countryside with its inspiring forest grove clearflowing river with fine delightful banks and villages for almsgoing on all sides
This is just right for the striving of a clansman intent on striving' So I sat down right there thinking 'This is just right for striving'
Then these three similes  spontaneous never before heard  appeared to me
Suppose there were a wet sappy piece of timber lying in the water and a man were to come along with an upper firestick thinking 'I'll light a fire
I'll produce heat' Now what do you think
Would he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper firestick in the wet sappy timber lying in the water
No Master Gotama
Why is that
Because the timber is wet  sappy and besides it is lying in the water
Eventually the man would reap only his share of weariness  disappointment
So it is with any brahman or contemplative who does not live withdrawn from sensuality in body  mind and whose desire infatuation urge thirst  fever for sensuality is not relinquished  stilled within him Whether or not he feels painful racking piercing feelings due to his striving he is incapable of knowledge vision  unexcelled selfawakening
This was the first simile  spontaneous never before heard  that appeared to me
Then a second simile  spontaneous never before heard  appeared to me
Suppose there were a wet sappy piece of timber lying on land far from water and a man were to come along with an upper firestick thinking 'I'll light a fire
I'll produce heat' Now what do you think
Would he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper firestick in the wet sappy timber lying on land far from water
No Master Gotama
Why is that
Because the timber is wet  sappy even though it is lying on land far from water
Eventually the man would reap only his share of weariness  disappointment
So it is with any brahman or contemplative who lives withdrawn from sensuality in body only but whose desire infatuation urge thirst  fever for sensuality is not relinquished  stilled within him Whether or not he feels painful racking piercing feelings due to his striving he is incapable of knowledge vision  unexcelled selfawakening
This was the second simile  spontaneous never before heard  that appeared to me
Then a third simile  spontaneous never before heard  appeared to me
Suppose there were a dry sapless piece of timber lying on land far from water and a man were to come along with an upper firestick thinking 'I'll light a fire
I'll produce heat' Now what do you think
Would he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper firestick in the dry sapless timber lying on land
Yes Master Gotama
Why is that
Because the timber is dry  sapless and besides it is lying on land far from water
So it is with any brahman or contemplative who lives withdrawn from sensuality in body  mind and whose desire infatuation urge thirst  fever for sensuality is relinquished  stilled within him Whether or not he feels painful racking piercing feelings due to his striving he is capable of knowledge vision  unexcelled selfawakening
This was the third simile  spontaneous never before heard  that appeared to me
I thought 'Suppose that I clenching my teeth and pressing my tongue against the roof of my mouth were to beat down constrain  crush my mind with my awareness' So clenching my teeth and pressing my tongue against the roof of my mouth I beat down constrained  crushed my mind with my awareness
Just as a strong man seizing a weaker man by the head or the throat or the shoulders would beat him down constrain  crush him in the same way I beat down constrained  crushed my mind with my awareness
As I did so sweat poured from my armpits
And although tireless persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness established my body was aroused  uncalm because of the painful exertion
But the painful feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
I thought 'Suppose I were to become absorbed in the trance of nonbreathing' So I stopped the inbreaths  outbreaths in my nose  mouth
As I did so there was a loud roaring of winds coming out my ear holes just like the loud roar of winds coming out of a smith's bellows So I stopped the inbreaths  outbreaths in my nose  mouth  ears
As I did so extreme forces sliced through my head just as if a strong man were slicing my head open with a sharp sword Extreme pains arose in my head just as if a strong man were tightening a turban made of tough leather straps around my head Extreme forces carved up my stomach cavity just as if a butcher or his apprentice were to carve up the stomach cavity of an ox There was an extreme burning in my body just as if two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms were to roast  broil him over a pit of hot embers
And although tireless persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness established my body was aroused  uncalm because of the painful exertion
But the painful feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
Devas on seeing me said 'Gotama the contemplative is dead' Other devas said 'He isn't dead he's dying' Others said 'He's neither dead nor dying he's an arahant for this is the way arahants live'
I thought 'Suppose I were to practice going altogether without food' Then devas came to me and said 'Dear sir please don't practice going altogether without food
If you go altogether without food we'll infuse divine nourishment in through your pores and you will survive on that' I thought 'If I were to claim to be completely fasting while these devas are infusing divine nourishment in through my pores I would be lying' So I dismissed them saying 'Enough'
I thought 'Suppose I were to take only a little food at a time only a handful at a time of bean soup lentil soup vetch soup or pea soup' So I took only a little food at a time only a handful at a time of bean soup lentil soup vetch soup or pea soup
My body became extremely emaciated
Simply from my eating so little my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stems My backside became like a camel's hoof My spine stood out like a string of beads My ribs jutted out like the jutting rafters of an old rundown barn The gleam of my eyes appeared to be sunk deep in my eye sockets like the gleam of water deep in a well My scalp shriveled  withered like a green bitter gourd shriveled  withered in the heat  the wind The skin of my belly became so stuck to my spine that when I thought of touching my belly I grabbed hold of my spine as well and when I thought of touching my spine I grabbed hold of the skin of my belly as well If I urinated or defecated I fell over on my face right there Simply from my eating so little if I tried to ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands the hair  rotted at its roots  fell from my body as I rubbed simply from eating so little
People on seeing me would say 'Gotama the contemplative is black' Other people would say 'Gotama the contemplative isn't black he's brown' Others would say 'Gotama the contemplative is neither black nor brown he's goldenskinned' So much had the clear bright color of my skin deteriorated simply from eating so little
I thought 'Whatever brahmans or contemplatives in the past have felt painful racking piercing feelings due to their striving this is the utmost
None have been greater than this
Whatever brahmans or contemplatives in the future will feel painful racking piercing feelings due to their striving this is the utmost
None will be greater than this
Whatever brahmans or contemplatives in the present are feeling painful racking piercing feelings due to their striving this is the utmost
None is greater than this
But with this racking practice of austerities I haven't attained any superior human state any distinction in knowledge or vision worthy of the noble ones
Could there be another path to Awakening'
I thought 'I recall once when my father the Sakyan was working and I was sitting in the cool shade of a roseapple tree then  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful mental qualities  I entered  remained in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
Could that be the path to Awakening' Then following on that memory came the realization 'That is the path to Awakening' I thought 'So why am I afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensuality nothing to do with unskillful mental qualities' I thought 'I am no longer afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensuality nothing to do with unskillful mental qualities but that pleasure is not easy to achieve with a body so extremely emaciated
Suppose I were to take some solid food some rice  porridge' So I took some solid food some rice  porridge
Now five monks had been attending on me thinking 'If Gotama our contemplative achieves some higher state he will tell us' But when they saw me taking some solid food  some rice  porridge  they were disgusted and left me thinking 'Gotama the contemplative is living luxuriously
He has abandoned his exertion and is backsliding into abundance'
So when I had taken solid food and regained strength then  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful mental qualities I entered  remained in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations I entered  remained in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
With the fading of rapture I remained in equanimity mindful  alert and sensed pleasure with the body
I entered  remained in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of joys  distresses  I entered  remained in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past lives
I recollected my manifold past lives ie one birth two five ten fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many eons of cosmic contraction many eons of cosmic expansion many eons of cosmic contraction  expansion 'There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose there
There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose here' Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes  details
This was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resolute
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away  reappearance of beings
I saw  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma 'These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech  mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
But these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech  mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world' Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  I saw beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma
This was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resolute
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the fermentations
I discerned as it had come to be that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations' My heart thus knowing thus seeing was released from the fermentation of sensuality released from the fermentation of becoming released from the fermentation of ignorance
With release there was the knowledge 'Released' I discerned that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
This was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resolute
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
I recall having taught the Dhamma to an assembly of many hundreds and yet each one of them assumes of me 'Gotama the contemplative is teaching the Dhamma attacking just me' but it shouldn't be seen in that way
The Tathagata rightly teaches them the Dhamma simply for the purpose of giving knowledge
At the end of that very talk I steady the mind inwardly settle it concentrate it and unify it in the same theme of concentration as before in which I almost constantly dwell
That is credible for the Master Gotama as would be the case for one who is worthy  rightly selfawakened
But does the Master Gotama recall sleeping during the day
I recall Aggivessana in the last month of the hot season after the meal returning from my almsround setting out my outer robe folded in four lying down on my right side and falling asleep while mindful  alert
There are some brahmans  contemplatives Master Gotama who would call that dwelling in delusion
It's not to that extent that one is deluded or undeluded Aggivessana
As to how one is deluded or undeluded listen and pay close attention
I will speak
As you say Master Gotama Saccaka responded
The Blessed One said In whomever the fermentations that defile that lead to renewed becoming that give trouble that ripen in stress and lead to future birth aging  death are not abandoned Him I call deluded
For it is from not abandoning the fermentations that one is deluded
In whomever the fermentations that defile that lead to renewed becoming that give trouble that ripen in stress and lead to future birth aging  death are abandoned Him I call undeluded
For it is from abandoning the fermentations that one is undeluded
In the Tathagata Aggivessana the fermentations that defile that lead to renewed becoming that give trouble that ripen in stress and lead to future birth aging  death have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of existence not destined for future arising
Just as a palmyra cut off at the crown is incapable of further growth in the same way in the Tathagata the fermentations that defile that lead to renewed becoming that give trouble that ripen in stress and lead to future birth aging  death have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of existence not destined for future arising
Then Mahapajapati Gotami went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him stood to one side
As she was standing there she said to him It would be good venerable sir if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief such that having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One I might dwell alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute
Gotami the qualities of which you may know 'These qualities lead to passion not to dispassion to being fettered not to being unfettered to accumulating not to shedding to selfaggrandizement not to modesty to discontent not to contentment to entanglement not to seclusion to laziness not to aroused persistence to being burdensome not to being unburdensome' You may definitely hold 'This is not the Dhamma this is not the Vinaya this is not the Teacher's instruction'
As for the qualities of which you may know 'These qualities lead to dispassion not to passion to being unfettered not to being fettered to shedding not to accumulating to modesty not to selfaggrandizement to contentment not to discontent to seclusion not to entanglement to aroused persistence not to laziness to being unburdensome not to being burdensome' You may definitely hold 'This is the Dhamma this is the Vinaya this is the Teacher's instruction' That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Mahapajapati Gotami delighted in his words
The Blessed One said It's through direct knowledge that I teach the Dhamma not without direct knowledge
It's with a cause that I teach the Dhamma not without a cause
It's with marvels that I teach the Dhamma not without marvels
Because I teach the Dhamma through direct knowledge and not without direct knowledge because I teach the Dhamma with a cause and not without a cause because I teach the Dhamma with marvels and not without marvels there is good reason for my instruction good reason for my admonition
And it is enough for you to be content enough for you to be gratified enough for you to take joy that the Blessed One is rightly selfawakened the Dhamma is welltaught by the Blessed One and the community has practiced rightly
Now at that time a baby boy was lying faceup on Prince Abhaya's lap
So the Blessed One said to the prince What do you think prince If this young boy through your own negligence or that of the nurse were to take a stick or a piece of gravel into its mouth what would you do
I would take it out venerable sir
If I couldn't get it out right away then holding its head in my left hand and crooking a finger of my right I would take it out even if it meant drawing blood
Why is that
Because I have sympathy for the young boy
In the same way prince
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be unfactual untrue unbeneficial unendearing  disagreeable to others he does not say them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true unbeneficial unendearing  disagreeable to others he does not say them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true beneficial but unendearing  disagreeable to others he has a sense of the proper time for saying them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be unfactual untrue unbeneficial but endearing  agreeable to others he does not say them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true unbeneficial but endearing  agreeable to others he does not say them
In the case of words that the Tathagata knows to be factual true beneficial and endearing  agreeable to others he has a sense of the proper time for saying them
Why is that
Because the Tathagata has sympathy for living beings
Once the Blessed One was staying at Kosambi in the Simsapa forest
Then picking up a few simsapa leaves with his hand he asked the monks How do you construe this monks Which are more numerous the few simsapa leaves in my hand or those overhead in the simsapa forest
'The leaves in the hand of the Blessed One are few in number lord
Those overhead in the forest are far more numerous
In the same way monks those things that I have known with direct knowledge but have not taught are far more numerous
And why haven't I taught them
Because they are not connected with the goal do not relate to the rudiments of the holy life and do not lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
That is why I have not taught them
And what have I taught
'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress' This is what I have taught
And why have I taught these things
Because they are connected with the goal relate to the rudiments of the holy life and lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
This is why I have taught them
Then Kevatta the householder approached the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Venerable sir this Nalanda is powerful both prosperous and populous filled with people who have faith in the Blessed One
It would be good if the Blessed One were to direct a monk to display a marvel of psychic power from his superior human state so that Nalanda would to an even greater extent have faith in the Blessed One
When this was said the Blessed One said to Kevatta the householder Kevatta I don't teach the monks in this way 'Come monks display a marvel of psychic power to the lay people clad in white' A second time A third time Kevatta the householder said to the Blessed One I won't argue with the Blessed One but I tell you Venerable sir this Nalanda is powerful both prosperous and populous filled with people who have faith in the Blessed One
It would be good if the Blessed One were to direct a monk to display a marvel of psychic power from his superior human state so that Nalanda would to an even greater extent have faith in the Blessed One
A third time the Blessed One said to Kevatta the householder Kevatta I don't teach the monks in this way 'Come monks display a marvel of psychic power to the lay people clad in white'
Kevatta there are these three marvels that I have declared having directly known and realized them for myself
Which three
The marvel of psychic power the marvel of telepathy and the marvel of instruction
And what is the marvel of psychic power
There is the case where a monk wields manifold psychic powers
Having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one
He appears
He vanishes
He goes unimpeded through walls ramparts and mountains as if through space
He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water
He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land
Sitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged bird
With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon so mighty and powerful
He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds
Then someone who has faith and conviction in him sees him wielding manifold psychic powers exercising influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds
He reports this to someone who has no faith and no conviction telling him 'Isn't it awesome
Isn't it astounding how great the power how great the prowess of this contemplative
Just now I saw him wielding manifold psychic powers exercising influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds'
Then the person without faith without conviction would say to the person with faith and with conviction 'Sir there is a charm called the Gandhari charm by which the monk wielded manifold psychic powers exercising influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds' What do you think Kevatta  isn't that what the man without faith without conviction would say to the man with faith and with conviction
That's what he would say venerable sir
Seeing this drawback to the marvel of psychic power Kevatta I feel repelled ashamed  disgusted with the marvel of psychic power
And what is the marvel of telepathy
There is the case where a monk reads the minds the mental events the thoughts the ponderings of other beings other individuals 'Such is your thinking here is where your thinking is thus is your mind'
Then someone who has faith and conviction in him sees him reading the minds of other beings He reports this to someone who has no faith and no conviction telling him 'Isn't it awesome
Isn't it astounding how great the power how great the prowess of this contemplative
Just now I saw him reading the minds of other beings'
Then the person without faith without conviction would say to the person with faith and with conviction 'Sir there is a charm called the Manika charm by which the monk read the minds of other beings' What do you think Kevatta  isn't that what the man without faith without conviction would say to the man with faith and with conviction
That's what he would say venerable sir
Seeing this drawback to the marvel of telepathy Kevatta I feel repelled ashamed  disgusted with the marvel of telepathy
And what is the marvel of instruction
There is the case where a monk gives instruction in this way 'Direct your thought in this way don't direct it in that
Attend to things in this way don't attend to them in that
Let go of this enter and remain in that' This Kevatta is called the marvel of instruction
Then there is the case where a Tathagata appears in the world worthy and rightly selfawakened
He teaches the Dhamma admirable in its beginning admirable in its middle admirable in its end
He proclaims the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pure
A householder or householder's son hearing the Dhamma gains conviction in the Tathagata and reflects 'Household life is confining a dusty path
The life gone forth is like the open air
It is not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shell
What if I were to shave off my hair and beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness'
So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth large or small leaves his circle of relatives large or small shaves off his hair and beard puts on the ochre robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessness
When he has thus gone forth he With his mind thus concentrated purified  bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to knowledge  vision to creating a mindmade body to the modes of supranormal powers to the divine earelement to knowledge of the awareness of other beings to knowledge of the recollection of past lives to knowledge of the passing away  reappearance of beings to the knowledge of the ending of the fermentations
He discerns as it has come to be that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations' His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentation of sensuality the fermentation of becoming the fermentation of ignorance
With release there is the knowledge 'Released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world' Just as if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen  clear limpid and unsullied  where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells gravel and pebbles and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting and it would occur to him 'This pool of water is clear limpid and unsullied
Here are these shells gravel and pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting' In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability  the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the fermentations
He discerns as it has come to be that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations' His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentation of sensuality the fermentation of becoming the fermentation of ignorance
With release there is the knowledge 'Released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
This too is called the marvel of instruction
These are the three marvels that I declare Kevatta having directly known and realized them for myself
Matangaputta
Vakkali
Tekicchakani
Sappadasa
A bandit chief
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels' Sanctuary
Then Ven
Maha Kassapa went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him You are now old Kassapa
Your robes made of castoff hemp rags are heavy for you
So wear robes donated by householders eat invitational meals and live close by me
Lord for a long time I have lived in the wilderness and have extolled living in the wilderness
I have been an almsgoer and have extolled being an almsgoer
I have worn cast off rags and have extolled wearing cast off rags
I have worn only one set of the triple robe and have extolled wearing only one set of the triple robe
I have been modest and have extolled being modest
I have been content and have extolled being content
I have been reclusive and have extolled being reclusive
I have been unentangled and have extolled being unentangled
I have kept my persistence aroused and have extolled having persistence aroused
But Kassapa what compelling reason do you see that you for a long time have lived in the wilderness and have extolled living in the wilderness that you have kept your persistence aroused and have extolled having persistence aroused
Lord I see two compelling reasons that for a long time I have lived in the wilderness and have extolled living in the wilderness that I have kept my persistence aroused and have extolled having persistence aroused seeing a pleasant abiding for myself in the here  now and feeling sympathy for later generations 'Perhaps later generations will take it as an example It seems that the disciples of the Awakened One and those who awakened after him lived for a long time in the wilderness and extolled living in the wilderness were almsgoers and extolled being almsgoers wore cast off rags and extolled wearing cast off rags wore only one set of the triple robe and extolled wearing only one set of the triple robe were modest and extolled being modest were content and extolled being content were reclusive and extolled being reclusive were unentangled and extolled being unentangled kept their persistence aroused and extolled having persistence aroused' Good Kassapa
Very good
It seems that you are one who practices for the happiness of many out of compassion for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of beings human  divine
So continue wearing your robes of cast off hemp cloth go for alms and live in the wilderness
Endowed with five qualities a monk pursuing mindfulness of inout breathing will in no long time penetrate the Unprovoked
Which five
He is a person who imposes only a little one of few duties  projects easy to support easily contented with the requisites of life
He is a person who eats only a little food committed to not indulging his stomach
He is a person of only a little sloth committed to wakefulness
He is a person of much learning who has retained what he heard has stored what he has heard
Whatever teachings are admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end that  in their meaning  expression  proclaim the holy life that is entirely complete  pure those he has listened to often retained discussed accumulated examined with his mind and wellpenetrated in terms of his views He gets to hear at will easily  without difficulty talk that is truly sobering  conducive to the opening of awareness talk on modesty contentment seclusion nonentanglement arousing persistence virtue concentration discernment release and the knowledge  vision of release He lives in the wilderness in an isolated dwelling place
He reflects on the mind as it is released
Endowed with these five qualities a monk pursuing mindfulness of inout breathing will in no long time penetrate the Unprovoked
Mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued is of great fruit of great benefit
Mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued brings the four frames of reference to their culmination
The four frames of reference when developed  pursued bring the seven factors for Awakening to their culmination
The seven factors for Awakening when developed  pursued bring clear knowing  release to their culmination
Now how is mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefit
There is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore
Always mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
 Breathing in long he discerns 'I am breathing in long' or breathing out long he discerns 'I am breathing out long' Or breathing in short he discerns 'I am breathing in short' or breathing out short he discerns 'I am breathing out short' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication'
 He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to rapture' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to rapture' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to pleasure' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to pleasure' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to mental fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe in calming mental fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out calming mental fabrication'
 He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe in gladdening the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out gladdening the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe in steadying the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out steadying the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe in releasing the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out releasing the mind'
 He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on inconstancy' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on inconstancy' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on dispassion' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on dispassion' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on cessation' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on cessation' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on relinquishment'
This is how mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefit
And how is mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination
 On whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns 'I am breathing in long' or breathing out long discerns 'I am breathing out long' or breathing in short discerns 'I am breathing in short' or breathing out short discerns 'I am breathing out short' trains himself 'I will breathe in  out sensitive to the entire body' trains himself 'I will breathe in  out calming bodily fabrication' On that occasion the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
I tell you monks that this  the inout breath  is classed as a body among bodies which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
 On whatever occasion a monk trains himself 'I will breathe in  out sensitive to rapture' trains himself 'I will breathe in  out sensitive to pleasure' trains himself 'I will breathe in  out sensitive to mental fabrication' trains himself 'I will breathe in  out calming mental fabrication' On that occasion the monk remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
I tell you monks that this  careful attention to inout breaths  is classed as a feeling among feelings which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
 On whatever occasion a monk trains himself 'I will breathe in  out sensitive to the mind' trains himself 'I will breathe in  out gladdening the mind' trains himself 'I will breathe in  out steadying the mind' trains himself 'I will breathe in  out releasing the mind' On that occasion the monk remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
I don't say that there is mindfulness of inout breathing in one of lapsed mindfulness and no alertness which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
 On whatever occasion a monk trains himself 'I will breathe in  out focusing on inconstancy' trains himself 'I will breathe in  out focusing on dispassion' trains himself 'I will breathe in  out focusing on cessation' trains himself 'I will breathe in  out focusing on relinquishment' On that occasion the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
He who sees with discernment the abandoning of greed  distress is one who watches carefully with equanimity which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
This is how mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination
And how are the four frames of reference developed  pursued so as to bring the seven factors for Awakening to their culmination
On whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world on that occasion his mindfulness is steady  without lapse
When his mindfulness is steady  without lapse then mindfulness as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
Remaining mindful in this way he examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment
When he remains mindful in this way examining analyzing  coming to a comprehension of that quality with discernment then analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
In one who examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment unflagging persistence is aroused
When unflagging persistence is aroused in one who examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment then persistence as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
In one whose persistence is aroused a rapture notoftheflesh arises
When a rapture notoftheflesh arises in one whose persistence is aroused then rapture as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
For one who is enraptured the body grows calm and the mind grows calm
When the body  mind of an enraptured monk grow calm then calm as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
For one who is at ease  his body calmed  the mind becomes concentrated
When the mind of one who is at ease  his body calmed  becomes concentrated then concentration as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
He oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity
When he oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity equanimity as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
This is how the four frames of reference are developed  pursued so as to bring the seven factors for Awakening to their culmination
And how are the seven factors for Awakening developed  pursued so as to bring clear knowing  release to their culmination
There is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in relinquishment
He develops analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening persistence as a factor for Awakening rapture as a factor for Awakening calm as a factor for Awakening concentration as a factor for Awakening equanimity as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in relinquishment
This is how the seven factors for Awakening are developed  pursued so as to bring clear knowing  release to their culmination
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
At Savatthi
There the Blessed One said Monks do you develop mindfulness of inout breathing
When this was said Ven
Arittha replied to the Blessed One I develop mindfulness of inout breathing lord
But how do you develop mindfulness of inout breathing Arittha
Having abandoned sensual desire for past sensual pleasures lord having done away with sensual desire for future sensual pleasures and having thoroughly subdued perceptions of irritation with regard to internal  external events I breathe in mindfully and breathe out mindfully
There is that mindfulness of inout breathing Arittha
I don't say that there isn't
But as to how mindfulness of inout breathing is brought in detail to its culmination listen and pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord Ven
Arittha responded to the Blessed One
The Blessed One said And how Arittha is mindfulness of inout breathing brought in detail to its culmination
There is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore
Always mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
 Breathing in long he discerns 'I am breathing in long' or breathing out long he discerns 'I am breathing out long' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on relinquishment'
This Arittha is how mindfulness of inout breathing is brought in detail to its culmination
Monks concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued is of great fruit of great benefit
And how is concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefit
There is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore
Always mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
 Breathing in long he discerns 'I am breathing in long' or breathing out long he discerns 'I am breathing out long' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on relinquishment'
This is how concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefit
I too monks before my Awakening when I was an unawakened bodhisatta frequently remained with this abiding
When I frequently remained with this abiding neither my body was fatigued nor were my eyes and my mind through lack of clingingsustenance was released from fermentations
So if a monk should wish 'May neither my body be fatigued nor my eyes and may my mind through lack of clingingsustenance be released from fermentations' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May my memories  resolves related to the household life be abandoned' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I remain percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I remain percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome  what is percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I  in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not  cutting myself off from both  remain equanimous mindful  alert' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities  enter  remain in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations enter  remain in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I with the fading of rapture remain equnimous mindful  alert sense pleasure with the body and enter  remain in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I with the abandoning of pleasure  stress  as with the earlier disappearance of joys  distresses  enter  remain in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity 'Infinite space' enter  remain in the dimension of the infinitude of space' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space 'Infinite consciousness' enter  remain in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness 'There is nothing' enter  remain in the dimension of nothingness' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness enter  remain in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception enter  remain in the cessation of perception  feeling' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
When concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing is thus developed thus pursued then if he senses a feeling of pleasure he discerns that it is inconstant not grasped at not relished
If he senses a feeling of pain he discerns that it is inconstant not grasped at not relished
If he senses a feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain he discerns that it is inconstant not grasped at not relished
If he senses a feeling of pleasure he senses it disjoined from it
If he senses a feeling of pain he senses it disjoined from it
If he senses a feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain he senses it disjoined from it
When sensing a feeling limited to the body he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to the body' When sensing a feeling limited to life he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to life' He discerns that 'With the breakup of the body after the termination of life everything that is experienced not being relished will grow cold right here'
Just as an oil lamp burns in dependence on oil  wick and from the termination of the oil  wick  and from not being provided any other sustenance  it goes out unnourished in the same way when sensing a feeling limited to the body he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to the body' When sensing a feeling limited to life he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to life' He discerns that 'With the breakup of the body after the termination of life everything that is sensed not being relished will grow cold right here'
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vesali in the Great Wood at the Gabled Hall
Now on that occasion the Blessed One with many lines of reasoning was giving the monks a talk on the unattractiveness was speaking in praise of unattractiveness was speaking in praise of the development of unattractiveness
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks I wish to go into seclusion for half a month
I am not to be approached by anyone at all except for the one who brings almsfood
As you say lord the monks responded to him
And no one approached the Blessed One except for the one who brought almsfood
Then the monks  The Blessed One with many lines of reasoning has given a talk on the unattractiveness has spoken in praise of unattractiveness has spoken in praise of the development of unattractiveness  remained committed to the development of unattractiveness in many modes  manners
They  ashamed repelled  disgusted with this body  sought for an assassin
In one day ten monks took the knife
In one day twenty monks took the knife
In one day thirty monks took the knife
Then the Blessed One emerging from his seclusion after half a month's time said to Ven
Ananda Ananda why does the community of monks seem so depleted
Because lord the Blessed One with many lines of reasoning gave the monks a talk on the unattractiveness spoke in praise of unattractiveness spoke in praise of the development of unattractiveness
The monks remained committed to the development of unattractiveness in many modes  manners
They  ashamed repelled  disgusted with this body  sought for an assassin
In one day ten monks twenty monks thirty monks took the knife
It would be good lord if the Blessed One would explain another method so that this community of monks might be established in gnosis
In that case Ananda gather in the assembly hall all the monks who live in dependence on Vesali
As you say lord Ven
Ananda responded
When he had gathered in the assembly hall all the monks who lived in dependence on Vesali he went to the Blessed One and said The community of monks is gathered lord
Now is the time to do as the Blessed One sees fit
Then the Blessed One went to the assembly hall and sat down on a seat made ready
As he was sitting there he addressed the monks Monks this concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued is both peaceful  exquisite a refreshing  pleasant abiding that immediately disperses  allays any evil unskillful qualities that have arisen
Just as when in the last month of the hot season a great raincloud out of season immediately disperses  allays the dust  dirt that have stirred up in the same way this concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued is both peaceful  exquisite a refreshing  pleasant abiding that immediately disperses  allays any evil unskillful qualities that have arisen
And how is concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to be both peaceful  exquisite a refreshing  pleasant abiding that immediately disperses  allays any evil unskillful qualities that have arisen
There is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore
Always mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
 Breathing in long he discerns 'I am breathing in long' or breathing out long he discerns 'I am breathing out long' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on relinquishment'
This is how concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to be both peaceful  exquisite a refreshing  pleasant abiding that immediately disperses  allays any evil unskillful qualities that have arisen
There is the case where a monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five hindrances
And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five hindrances
There is the case where there being sensual desire present within a monk discerns that 'There is sensual desire present within me' Or there being no sensual desire present within he discerns that 'There is no sensual desire present within me' He discerns how there is the arising of unarisen sensual desire
And he discerns how there is the abandoning of sensual desire once it has arisen
And he discerns how there is no further appearance in the future of sensual desire that has been abandoned
Furthermore the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the seven factors for Awakening
And how does he remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the seven factors for Awakening
There is the case where there being mindfulness as a factor for Awakening present within he discerns that 'Mindfulness as a factor for Awakening is present within me' Or there being no mindfulness as a factor for Awakening present within he discerns that 'Mindfulness as a factor for Awakening is not present within me' He discerns how there is the arising of unarisen mindfulness as a factor for Awakening
And he discerns how there is the culmination of the development of mindfulness as a factor for Awakening once it has arisen 
And what is the food for the arising of unarisen analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening or for the growth  increase of analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening once it has arisen
There are mental qualities that are skillful  unskillful blameworthy  blameless gross  refined siding with darkness  with light
To foster appropriate attention to them This is the food for the arising of unarisen analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening or for the growth  increase of analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening once it has arisen
If a monk would wish 'May I attain  whenever I want without strain without difficulty  the four jhanas that are heightened mental states pleasant abidings in the herenow' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection who is committed to inner tranquility of awareness who does not neglect jhana who is endowed with insight and who frequents empty dwellings
If a monk would wish 'May I  with the ending of fermentations  remain in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known  realized them for myself right in the herenow' then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection who is committed to inner tranquility of awareness who does not neglect jhana who is endowed with insight and who frequents empty dwellings
The individual who has attained internal tranquility of awareness but not insight into phenomena through heightened discernment should approach an individual who has attained insight into phenomena through heightened discernment and ask him 'How should fabrications be regarded
How should they be investigated
How should they be seen with insight' The other will answer in line with what he has seen  experienced 'Fabrications should be regarded in this way
Fabrications should be investigated in this way
Fabrications should be seen in this way with insight' Then eventually he will become one who has attained both internal tranquility of awareness  insight into phenomena through heightened discernment
As for the individual who has attained insight into phenomena through heightened discernment but not internal tranquility of awareness he should approach an individual who has attained internal tranquility of awareness and ask him 'How should the mind be steadied
How should it be made to settle down
How should it be unified
How should it be concentrated' The other will answer in line with what he has seen  experienced 'The mind should be steadied in this way
The mind should be made to settle down in this way
The mind should be unified in this way
The mind should be concentrated in this way' Then eventually he will become one who has attained both internal tranquility of awareness  insight into phenomena through heightened discernment
I have also taught the stepbystep cessation of fabrications
When one has attained the first jhana speech has ceased
When one has attained the second jhana directed thoughts  evaluations have ceased
When one has attained the third jhana rapture has ceased
When one has attained the fourth jhana inandout breaths have ceased
When one has attained the dimension of the infinitude of space the perception of forms has ceased
When one has attained the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the perception of the dimension of the infinitude of space has ceased
When one has attained the dimension of nothingness the perception of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness has ceased
When one has attained the dimension of neitherperception nor nonperception the perception of the dimension of nothingness has ceased
When one has attained the cessation of perception  feeling perceptions  feelings have ceased
Then monk I have also taught the stepbystep stilling of fabrications
When one has attained the first jhana speech has been stilled
When one has attained the second jhana directed thought  evaluation have been stilled
When one has attained the third jhana rapture has been stilled
When one has attained the fourth jhana inandout breathing has been stilled
When one has attained the dimension of the infinitude of space the perception of forms has been stilled
When one has attained the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the perception of the dimension of the infinitude of space has been stilled
When one has attained the dimension of nothingness the perception of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness has been stilled
When one has attained the dimension of neitherperception nor nonperception the perception of the dimension of nothingness has been stilled
When one has attained the cessation of perception  feeling perception  feeling have been stilled
When a monk's fermentations have ended passion has been stilled aversion has been stilled delusion has been stilled
There are these six calmings
When one has attained the first jhana speech has been calmed
When one has attained the second jhana directed thought  evaluation have been calmed
When one has attained the third jhana rapture has been calmed
When one has attained the fourth jhana inandout breathing has been calmed
When one has attained the cessation of perception  feeling perception  feeling have been calmed
When a monk's fermentations have ended passion has been calmed aversion has been calmed delusion has been calmed
I have heard that on one occasion Ven
Sariputta was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels' Feeding Sanctuary
There he said to the monks This Unbinding is pleasant friends
This Unbinding is pleasant
When this was said Ven
Udayin said to Ven
Sariputta But what is the pleasure here my friend where there is nothing felt
Just that is the pleasure here my friend where there is nothing felt
There are these five strands of sensuality
Which five
Forms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing sounds cognizable via the ear aromas cognizable via the nose flavors cognizable via the tongue tactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
Whatever pleasure or joy arises in dependence on these five strands of sensuality that is sensual pleasure
Now there is the case where a monk  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
If as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with sensuality that is an affliction for him
Just as pain arises as an affliction in a healthy person for his affliction even so the attention to perceptions dealing with sensuality that beset the monk is an affliction for him
Now the Blessed One has said that whatever is an affliction is stress
So by this line of reasoning it may be known how Unbinding is pleasant
Then there is the case where a monk with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
If as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with directed thought that is an affliction for him
Then there is the case where a monk with the fading of rapture remains in equanimity mindful  alert senses pleasure with the body and enters  remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' If as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with rapture that is an affliction for him
Then there is the case where a monk with the abandoning of pleasure  stress  as with the earlier disappearance of joys  distresses  enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain
If as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with equanimity that is an affliction for him
Then there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity 'Infinite space' enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space
If as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with form that is an affliction for him
Then there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space 'Infinite consciousness' enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
If as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with the dimension of the infinitude of space that is an affliction for him
Then there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness 'There is nothing' enters  remains in the dimension of nothingness
If as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness that is an affliction for him
Then there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness enters  remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
If as he remains there he is beset with attention to perceptions dealing with the dimension of nothingness that is an affliction for him
Now the Blessed One has said that whatever is an affliction is stress
So by this line of reasoning it may be known how Unbinding is pleasant
Then there is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception enters  remains in the cessation of perception  feeling
And having seen with discernment his fermentations are completely ended
So by this line of reasoning it may be known how Unbinding is pleasant
Then the Blessed One emerging from his seclusion after three months' time addressed the monks Monks if wanderers of other sects should ask you 'With what abiding did Master Gotama often remain during the Rains retreat'  thus asked you should answer them 'The Blessed One often remained with concentration through inout breathing during the Rains retreat'
Monks if anyone speaking rightly were to described something as 'a noble dwelling' 'a brahmadwelling' 'the Tathagata's dwelling' he would speaking rightly describe concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing as 'a noble dwelling' 'a brahmadwelling' 'the Tathagata's dwelling'
Those monks who are trainees yearning for the unexcelled relief from bondage their aspirations as yet unfulfilled for them concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued leads to the ending of the fermentations
As for those monks who are worthy ones devoid of fermentations  who have attained completion finished the task laid down the burden attained the true goal destroyed the fetters of becoming and are released through right knowledge for them concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued leads to a pleasant dwelling here  now and to mindfulness  alertness
If anyone speaking rightly were to described something as 'a noble dwelling' 'a brahmadwelling' 'the Tathagata's dwelling' he would speaking rightly describe concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing as 'a noble dwelling' 'a brahmadwelling' 'the Tathagata's dwelling'
Now based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect that 'I am subject to death have not gone beyond death'
There are beings who are intoxicated with a living person's intoxication with life
Because of that intoxication with life they conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mind
But when they often reflect on that fact that living person's intoxication with life will either be entirely abandoned or grow weaker
Now a disciple of the noble ones considers this 'I am not the only one subject to death who has not gone beyond death
To the extent that there are beings  past and future passing away and rearising  all beings are subject to death have not gone beyond death' When heshe often reflects on this the path take birth
Heshe sticks with that path develops it cultivates it
As heshe sticks with that path develops it and cultivates it the fetters are abandoned the latent tendencies destroyed
I have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying at Nadika in the Brick Hall
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks replied
The Blessed One said 'Mindfulness of death when developed  pursued is of great fruit  great benefit
It gains a footing in the Deathless has the Deathless as its final end
Therefore you should develop mindfulness of death'
When this was said a certain monk addressed the Blessed One I already develop mindfulness of death
And how do you develop mindfulness of death
I think 'O that I might live for a day  night that I might attend to the Blessed One's instructions
I would have accomplished a great deal' This is how I develop mindfulness of death
Then another monk addressed the Blessed One I too already develop mindfulness of death
And how do you develop mindfulness of death
I think 'O that I might live for a day that I might attend to the Blessed One's instructions
I would have accomplished a great deal' This is how I develop mindfulness of death
Then another monk addressed the Blessed One 'I too develop mindfulness of death I think 'O that I might live for the interval that it takes to eat a meal that I might attend to the Blessed One's instructions
I would have accomplished a great deal'
Then another monk addressed the Blessed One 'I too develop mindfulness of death I think 'O that I might live for the interval that it takes to swallow having chewed up four morsels of food that I might attend to the Blessed One's instructions
I would have accomplished a great deal'
Then another monk addressed the Blessed One 'I too develop mindfulness of death I think 'O that I might live for the interval that it takes to swallow having chewed up one morsel of food that I might attend to the Blessed One's instructions
I would have accomplished a great deal'
Then another monk addressed the Blessed One 'I too develop mindfulness of death I think 'O that I might live for the interval that it takes to breathe out after breathing in or to breathe in after breathing out that I might attend to the Blessed One's instructions
I would have accomplished a great deal' This is how I develop mindfulness of death
When this was said the Blessed One addressed the monks
Whoever develops mindfulness of death thinking 'O that I might live for a day  night for a day for the interval that it takes to eat a meal for the interval that it takes to swallow having chewed up four morsels of food that I might attend to the Blessed One's instructions
I would have accomplished a great deal'  they are said to dwell heedlessly
They develop mindfulness of death slowly for the sake of ending the fermentations
But whoever develops mindfulness of death thinking 'O that I might live for the interval that it takes to swallow having chewed up one morsel of food for the interval that it takes to breathe out after breathing in or to breathe in after breathing out that I might attend to the Blessed One's instructions
I would have accomplished a great deal'  they are said to dwell heedfully
They develop mindfulness of death acutely for the sake of ending the fermentations
Therefore you should train yourselves 'We will dwell heedfully
We will develop mindfulness of death acutely for the sake of ending the fermentations' That is how you should train yourselves
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
I have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying at Nadika in the Brick Hall
There he addressed the monks Monks mindfulness of death  when developed  pursued  is of great fruit  great benefit
It gains a footing in the Deathless has the Deathless as its final end
And how is mindfulness of death developed  pursued so that it is of great fruit  great benefit gains a footing in the Deathless and has the Deathless as its final end
There is the case where a monk as day departs and night returns reflects 'Many are the causes of my death
A snake might bite me a scorpion might sting me a centipede might bite me
That would be how my death would come about
That would be an obstruction for me
Stumbling I might fall my food digested might trouble me my bile might be provoked my phlegm piercing wind forces might be provoked
That would be how my death would come about
That would be an obstruction for me' Then the monk should investigate 'Are there any evil unskillful mental qualities unabandoned by me that would be an obstruction for me were I to die in the night' If on reflecting he realizes that there are evil unskillful mental qualities unabandoned by him that would be an obstruction for him were he to die in the night then he should put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor undivided mindfulness  alertness for the abandoning of those very same evil unskillful qualities
Just as when a person whose turban or head was on fire would put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor undivided mindfulness  alertness to put out the fire on his turban or head in the same way the monk should put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor undivided mindfulness  alertness for the abandoning of those very same evil unskillful qualities
But if on reflecting he realizes that there are no evil unskillful mental qualities unabandoned by him that would be an obstruction for him were he to die in the night then for that very reason he should dwell in joy  rapture training himself day  night in skillful qualities
Further there is the case where a monk as night departs and day returns reflects 'Many are the causes of my death
A snake might bite me a scorpion might sting me a centipede might bite me
That would be how my death would come about
That would be an obstruction for me
Stumbling I might fall my food digested might trouble me my bile might be provoked my phlegm piercing wind forces might be provoked
That would be how my death would come about
That would be an obstruction for me' Then the monk should investigate 'Are there any evil unskillful mental qualities unabandoned by me that would be an obstruction for me were I to die during the day' If on reflecting he realizes that there are evil unskillful mental qualities unabandoned by him that would be an obstruction for him were he to die during the day then he should put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor undivided mindfulness  alertness for the abandoning of those very same evil unskillful qualities
Just as when a person whose turban or head was on fire would put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor undivided mindfulness  alertness to put out the fire on his turban or head in the same way the monk should put forth extra desire effort diligence endeavor undivided mindfulness  alertness for the abandoning of those very same evil unskillful qualities
But if on reflecting he realizes that there are no evil unskillful mental qualities unabandoned by him that would be an obstruction for him were he to die during the day then for that very reason he should dwell in joy  rapture training himself day  night in skillful qualities
This monks is how mindfulness of death is developed  pursued so that it is of great fruit  great benefit gains a footing in the deathless and has the deathless as its final end
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One in the middle of the day and on arrival having bowed down sat down to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Well now your majesty where are you coming from in the middle of the day
Just now lord I was engaged in the sort of royal affairs typical of headanointed noblewarrior kings intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures who have attained stable control in their country and who rule having conquered a great sphere of territory on earth
What do you think your majesty
Suppose a man trustworthy and reliable were to come to you from the east and on arrival would say 'If it please your majesty you should know that I come from the east
There I saw a great mountain as high as the clouds coming this way crushing all living beings
Do whatever you think should be done' Then a second man were to come to you from the west Then a third man were to come to you from the north Then a fourth man were to come to you from the south and on arrival would say 'If it please your majesty you should know that I come from the south
There I saw a great mountain as high as the clouds coming this way crushing all living beings
Do whatever you think should be done' If your majesty such a great peril should arise such a terrible destruction of human life  the human state being so hard to obtain  what should be done
If lord such a great peril should arise such a terrible destruction of human life  the human state being so hard to obtain  what else should be done but Dhammaconduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deeds
I inform you your majesty I announce to you your majesty aging and death are rolling in on you
When aging and death are rolling in on you great king what should be done
As aging and death are rolling in on me lord what else should be done but Dhammaconduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deeds
There are lord elephant battles headanointed noblewarrior kings intoxicated with the intoxication of sovereignty obsessed by greed for sensual pleasures who have attained stable control in their country and who rule having conquered a great sphere of territory on earth but there is no use for those elephant battles no scope for them when aging and death are rolling in
There are cavalry battles chariot battles infantry battles but there is no use for those infantry battles no scope for them when aging and death are rolling in
In this royal court there are counselors who when the enemies arrive are capable of dividing them by their wits but there is no use for those battles of wits no scope for them when aging and death are rolling in
In this royal court there is abundant bullion and gold stored in vaults and depositories and with such wealth we are capable of buying off enemies when they come but there is no use for those battles of wealth no scope for them when aging and death are rolling in
As aging and death are rolling in on me venerable sir what else should be done but Dhammaconduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deeds
So it is your majesty
So it is your majesty
As aging and death are rolling in on you what else should be done but Dhammaconduct right conduct skillful deeds meritorious deeds
That is what the Blessed One said
Having said that the One WellGone the Teacher further said this

And who is the person who subject to death is not afraid or in terror of death
There is the case of the person who has abandoned passion desire fondness thirst fever and craving for sensuality who has abandoned passion desire fondness thirst fever and craving for the body who has done what is good what is skillful has given protection to those in fear and has not done what is evil savage or cruel who has no doubt or perplexity who has arrived at certainty with regard to the True Dhamma
When he comes down with a serious disease he does not grieve is not tormented does not weep or beat his breast or grow delirious
This is another person who subject to death is not afraid or in terror of death
Just as a fire Vaccha burns with sustenance and not without sustenance even so I declare the rebirth of one who has sustenance and not of one without sustenance
But Venerable Gotama at the moment a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance what do you say is its sustenance then'
Vaccha when a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance I say that it is windsustained
The wind Vaccha is its sustenance at that time
And at the moment when a being sets this body aside and has not yet attained another body what do you say is its sustenance then
Actually Vaccha when a being sets this body aside and has not yet attained another body I say that it is cravingsustained
Craving Vaccha is its sustenance at that time
Mogharaja
Now how is mindfulness immersed in the body developed how is it pursued so as to be of great fruit  great benefit
There is the case where a monk  having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building  sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore
Always mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
Breathing in long he discerns 'I am breathing in long' or breathing out long he discerns 'I am breathing out long' Or breathing in short he discerns 'I am breathing in short' or breathing out short he discerns 'I am breathing out short' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication' And as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centered
This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body
Furthermore when walking the monk discerns 'I am walking' When standing he discerns 'I am standing' When sitting he discerns 'I am sitting' When lying down he discerns 'I am lying down' Or however his body is disposed that is how he discerns it This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body
Furthermore when going forward  returning he makes himself fully alert when looking toward  looking away when bending  extending his limbs when carrying his outer cloak his upper robe  his bowl when eating drinking chewing  savoring when urinating  defecating when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking  remaining silent he makes himself fully alert This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body
Furthermore just as if a sack with openings at both ends were full of various kinds of grain  wheat rice mung beans kidney beans sesame seeds husked rice  and a man with good eyesight pouring it out were to reflect 'This is wheat
This is rice
These are mung beans
These are kidney beans
These are sesame seeds
This is husked rice' in the same way the monk reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet on up from the crown of the head on down surrounded by skin and full of various kinds of unclean things 'In this body there are head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs large intestines small intestines gorge feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears skinoil saliva mucus fluid in the joints urine' This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body
Furthermore just as a skilled butcher or his apprentice having killed a cow would sit at a crossroads cutting it up into pieces the monk contemplates this very body  however it stands however it is disposed  in terms of properties 'In this body there is the earth property the liquid property the fire property  the wind property' This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body
Furthermore as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground  one day two days three days dead  bloated livid  festering he applies it to this very body 'This body too Such is its nature such is its future such its unavoidable fate'
Or again as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground picked at by crows vultures  hawks by dogs hyenas  various other creatures a skeleton smeared with flesh  blood connected with tendons a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood connected with tendons a skeleton without flesh or blood connected with tendons bones detached from their tendons scattered in all directions  here a hand bone there a foot bone here a shin bone there a thigh bone here a hip bone there a back bone here a rib there a chest bone here a shoulder bone there a neck bone here a jaw bone there a tooth here a skull the bones whitened somewhat like the color of shells piled up more than a year old decomposed into a powder He applies it to this very body 'This body too Such is its nature such is its future such its unavoidable fate'
And as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centered
This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body
Furthermore quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful mental qualities he enters and remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the rapture  pleasure born from seclusion
Just as if a skilled bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together sprinkling it again  again with water so that his ball of bath powder  saturated moistureladen permeated within  without  would nevertheless not drip even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born from seclusion
And as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centered
This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body
And furthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of concentration
Just like a lake with springwater welling up from within having no inflow from the east west north or south and with the skies supplying abundant showers time  again so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate  pervade suffuse  fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of concentration
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born of concentration
And as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centered
This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body
And furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture
Just as in a lotus pond some of the lotuses born  growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated  pervaded suffused  filled with cool water from their roots to their tips and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water even so the monk permeates this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture
And as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centered
This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body
And furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of joys  distresses  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain
He sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness
Just as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awareness
And as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centered
This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body
Monks whoever develops  pursues mindfulness immersed in the body encompasses whatever skillful qualities are on the side of clear knowing
Just as whoever pervades the great ocean with his awareness encompasses whatever rivulets flow down into the ocean in the same way whoever develops  pursues mindfulness immersed in the body encompasses whatever skillful qualities are on the side of clear knowing
In whomever mindfulness immersed in the body is not developed not pursued Mara gains entry Mara gains a foothold
Suppose that a man were to throw a heavy stone ball into a pile of wet clay
What do you think monks  would that heavy stone ball gain entry into the pile of wet clay
Yes venerable sir
In the same way in whomever mindfulness immersed in the body is not developed not pursued Mara gains entry Mara gains a foothold
Now suppose that there were a dry sapless piece of timber and a man were to come along with an upper firestick thinking 'I'll light a fire
I'll produce heat' What do you think  would he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper firestick in the dry sapless piece of timber
Yes venerable sir
In the same way in whomever mindfulness immersed in the body is not developed not pursued Mara gains entry Mara gains a foothold
Now suppose that there were an empty hollow waterpot set on a stand and a man were to come along carrying a load of water
What do you think  would he get a place to pour out his water
Yes venerable sir
In the same way in whomever mindfulness immersed in the body is not developed not pursued Mara gains entry Mara gains a foothold
Now in whomever mindfulness immersed in the body is developed is pursued Mara gains no entry Mara gains no foothold
Suppose that a man were to throw a ball of string against a door panel made entirely of heartwood
What do you think  would that light ball of string gain entry into the door panel made entirely of heartwood
No venerable sir

Now suppose that there were a wet sappy piece of timber and a man were to come along with an upper firestick thinking 'I'll light a fire
I'll produce heat' What do you think  would he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper firestick in the wet sappy piece of timber
No venerable sir

That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words

I will teach you a Dhamma discourse on bondage  lack of bondage
Listen  pay close attention
I will speak
Yes lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said A woman attends inwardly to her feminine faculties her feminine gestures her feminine manners feminine poise feminine desires feminine voice feminine charms
She is excited by that delighted by that
Being excited  delighted by that she attends outwardly to masculine faculties masculine gestures masculine manners masculine poise masculine desires masculine voices masculine charms
She is excited by that delighted by that
Being excited  delighted by that she wants to be bonded to what is outside her wants whatever pleasure  happiness that arise based on that bond

Being excited  delighted by that he wants to be bonded to what is outside him wants whatever pleasure  happiness that arise based on that bond
Delighting caught up in his masculinity a man goes into bondage with reference to women
This is how a man does not transcend his masculinity
And how is there lack of bondage
A woman does not attend inwardly to her feminine faculties feminine charms
She is not excited by that not delighted by that does not attend outwardly to masculine faculties masculine charms
She is not excited by that not delighted by that does not want to be bonded to what is outside her does not want whatever pleasure  happiness that arise based on that bond

And this is the Dhamma discourse on bondage  lack of bondage
The Blessed One said Suppose monks that a large crowd of people comes thronging together saying 'The beauty queen
The beauty queen' And suppose that the beauty queen is highly accomplished at singing  dancing so that an even greater crowd comes thronging saying 'The beauty queen is singing
The beauty queen is dancing' Then a man comes along desiring life  shrinking from death desiring pleasure  abhorring pain
They say to him 'Now look here mister
You must take this bowl filled to the brim with oil and carry it on your head in between the great crowd  the beauty queen
A man with a raised sword will follow right behind you and wherever you spill even a drop of oil right there will he cut off your head' Now what do you think monks Will that man not paying attention to the bowl of oil let himself get distracted outside
No lord
I have given you this parable to convey a meaning
The meaning is this The bowl filled to the brim with oil stands for mindfulness immersed in the body
Thus you should train yourselves 'We will develop mindfulness immersed in the body
We will pursue it give it a means of transport give it a grounding steady it consolidate it and undertake it well' That is how you should train yourselves
And what is lack of restraint
There is the case where a monk seeing a form with the eye is set on pleasing forms is repelled by unpleasing forms and remains with bodymindfulness unestablished with limited awareness
He does not discern as it has come to be the awarenessrelease the discernmentrelease where any evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainder
Hearing a sound with the ear
Smelling an aroma with the nose
Tasting a flavor with the tongue
Touching a tactile sensation with the body
Cognizing an idea with the intellect he is set on pleasing ideas is repelled by unpleasing ideas and remains with bodymindfulness unestablished with limited awareness
He does not discern as it has come to be the awarenessrelease the discernmentrelease where any evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainder
Just as if a person catching six animals of different ranges of different habitats were to bind them with a strong rope
Catching a snake he would bind it with a strong rope
Catching a crocodile a bird a dog a hyena a monkey he would bind it with a strong rope
Binding them all with a strong rope and tying a knot in the middle he would set chase to them
Then those six animals of different ranges of different habitats would each pull toward its own range  habitat
The snake would pull thinking 'I'll go into the anthill' The crocodile would pull thinking 'I'll go into the water' The bird would pull thinking 'I'll fly up into the air' The dog would pull thinking 'I'll go into the village' The hyena would pull thinking 'I'll go into the charnel ground' The monkey would pull thinking 'I'll go into the forest' And when these six animals became internally exhausted they would submit they would surrender they would come under the sway of whichever among them was the strongest
In the same way when a monk whose mindfulness immersed in the body is undeveloped  unpursued the eye pulls toward pleasing forms while unpleasing forms are repellent
The ear pulls toward pleasing sounds The nose pulls toward pleasing aromas The tongue pulls toward pleasing flavors The body pulls toward pleasing tactile sensations The intellect pulls toward pleasing ideas while unpleasing ideas are repellent
This monks is lack of restraint
And what is restraint
There is the case where a monk seeing a form with the eye is not set on pleasing forms is not repelled by unpleasing forms and remains with bodymindfulness established with immeasurable awareness
He discerns as it has come to be the awarenessrelease the discernmentrelease where all evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainder
Hearing a sound with the ear
Smelling an aroma with the nose
Tasting a flavor with the tongue
Touching a tactile sensation with the body
Cognizing an idea with the intellect he is not set on pleasing ideas is not repelled by unpleasing ideas and remains with bodymindfulness established with immeasurable awareness
He discerns as it has come to be the awarenessrelease the discernmentrelease where all evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainder
Just as if a person catching six animals of different ranges of different habitats were to bind them with a strong rope
Catching a snake he would bind it with a strong rope
Catching a crocodile a bird a dog a hyena a monkey he would bind it with a strong rope
Binding them all with a strong rope he would tether them to a strong post or stake
Then those six animals of different ranges of different habitats would each pull toward its own range  habitat
The snake would pull thinking 'I'll go into the anthill' The crocodile would pull thinking 'I'll go into the water' The bird would pull thinking 'I'll fly up into the air' The dog would pull thinking 'I'll go into the village' The hyena would pull thinking 'I'll go into the charnel ground' The monkey would pull thinking 'I'll go into the forest' And when these six animals became internally exhausted they would stand sit or lie down right there next to the post or stake
In the same way when a monk whose mindfulness immersed in the body is developed  pursued the eye does not pull toward pleasing forms and unpleasing forms are not repellent
The ear does not pull toward pleasing sounds The nose does not pull toward pleasing aromas The tongue does not pull toward pleasing flavors The body does not pull toward pleasing tactile sensations The intellect does not pull toward pleasing ideas and unpleasing ideas are not repellent
This monks is restraint
The 'strong post or stake' is a term for mindfulness immersed in the body
Thus you should train yourselves 'We will develop mindfulness immersed in the body
We will pursue it give it a means of transport give it a grounding
We will steady it consolidate it and set about it properly' That is how you should train yourselves
These are the four modes of practice
Which four
Painful practice with slow intuition painful practice with quick intuition pleasant practice with slow intuition  pleasant practice with quick intuition
And which is painful practice with slow intuition
There is the case where a monk remains focused on unattractiveness with regard to the body
Percipient of loathsomeness with regard to food  nondelight with regard to the entire world he remains focused on impermanence with regard to all fabrications
The perception of death is well established within him
He dwells in dependence on the five strengths of a learner  strength of conviction strength of conscience strength of concern strength of persistence  strength of discernment  but his five faculties are present in a weak form
Because of their weakness he attains only slowly the immediacy that leads to the ending of the fermentations
This is called painful practice with slow intuition
And which is painful practice with quick intuition
There is the case where a monk remains focused on unattractiveness with regard to the bodyfocused on impermanence with regard to all fabrications
The perception of death is well established within him
He dwells in dependence on the five strengths of a learner and his five faculties are present in an acute form
Because of their acuity he attains quickly the immediacy that leads to the ending of the fermentations
This is called painful practice with quick intuition
And which is pleasant practice with slow intuition
There is the case where a monk enters  remains in the first jhana second jhana third jhana fourth jhana
He dwells in dependence on the five strengths of a learner but his five faculties are present in a weak form
Because of their weakness he attains only slowly the immediacy that leads to the ending of the fermentations
This is called pleasant practice with slow intuition
And which is pleasant practice with quick intuition
There is the case where a monk enters  remains in the first jhana second jhana third jhana fourth jhana
He dwells in dependence on the five strengths of a learner and his five faculties are present in an acute form
Because of their acuity he attains quickly the immediacy that leads to the ending of the fermentations
This is called pleasant practice with quick intuition
These are the four modes of practice
Whoever pervades the great ocean with his awareness encompasses whatever rivulets flow down into the ocean
In the same way whoever develops  pursues mindfulness immersed in the body encompasses whatever skillful qualities are on the side of clear knowing
When one thing is practiced  pursued the body is calmed the mind is calmed thinking  evaluating are stilled and all qualities on the side of clear knowing go to the culmination of their development
Which one thing
Mindfulness immersed in the body
When one thing is practiced  pursued ignorance is abandoned clear knowing arises the conceit 'I am' is abandoned latent tendencies are uprooted fetters are abandoned
Which one thing
Mindfulness immersed in the body
Those who do not taste mindfulness of the body do not taste the deathless
Those who taste mindfulness of the body taste the deathless
Those who are heedless of mindfulness of the body are heedless of the deathless
Those who comprehend mindfulness of the body comprehend the deathless
 AN 
Whereas formerly he foolishly had greed  as well as desire  infatuation  he has now abandoned them their root destroyed like an uprooted palm tree deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Whereas formerly he foolishly had malice  as well as illwill  hatred  he has now abandoned them Whereas formerly he foolishly had ignorance  as well as delusion  confusion  he has now abandoned them their root destroyed like an uprooted palm tree deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Thus a monk so endowed is endowed with the highest determination for stilling for this  the stilling of passions aversions  delusions  is the highest noble stilling
I tell you the ending of the fermentations depends on the first jhana the second jhana the third the fourth the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness
I tell you the ending of the fermentations depends on the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
'I tell you the ending of the fermentations depends on the first jhana' Thus it has been said
In reference to what was it said
There is the case where a monk secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perception fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness notself
He turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness 'This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding'
Suppose that an archer or archer's apprentice were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay so that after a while he would become able to shoot long distances to fire accurate shots in rapid succession and to pierce great masses
In the same way there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perception fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness notself
He turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness 'This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding'
Staying right there he reaches the ending of the fermentations
Or if not then  through this very Dhammapassion this Dhammadelight and from the total wasting away of the first five Fetters  he is due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that world
'I tell you the ending of the fermentations depends on the first jhana' Thus it was said and in reference to this was it said
'I tell you the ending of the fermentations depends on the dimension of the infinitude of space' Thus it has been said
In reference to what was it said
There is the case where a monk  with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity 'Infinite space'  enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space
He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with feeling perception fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness notself
He turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness 'This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding'

'I tell you the ending of the fermentations depends on the dimension of the infinitude of space' Thus it was said and in reference to this was it said

Thus as far as the perceptionattainments go that is as far as gnosispenetration goes
As for these two dimensions  the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception  the attainment of the cessation of feeling  perception  I tell you that they are to be rightly explained by those monks who are meditators skilled in attaining skilled in attaining  emerging who have attained  emerged in dependence on them
Among whatever qualities there may be fabricated or unfabricated the quality of dispassion  the subduing of intoxication the elimination of thirst the uprooting of attachment the breaking of the round the destruction of craving dispassion cessation the realization of Unbinding  is considered supreme
Those who have confidence in the quality of dispassion have confidence in what is supreme and for those with confidence in the supreme supreme is the result


In recent years more and more Westerners have come into contact with Theravada Buddhist monks and many have become curious about the rules governing the monks' life
This introduction is meant to help satisfy that curiosity by giving a brief explanation of the rationale behind the rules and their enforcement and by providing summaries of the rules classed according to topic
Anyone interested in more information on the rules and their interpretation may look into the book The Buddhist Monastic Code The Patimokkha Training Rules Translated and Explained
Readers may also wish to refer to the complete list of Patimokkha rules
One of the first questions that many people ask is why the monks have rules in the first place
Since the Dhamma aims at freedom and depends on selfreliance wouldn't it be better to let the monks develop their own innate sense of right and wrong unfettered by legalisms
The answer to this question lies in the fact that the monks form a Community reliant on the support of lay Buddhists and anyone who has lived for any time in a communal situation knows that communities need rules in order to function peacefully
The Buddha in laying down each rule gave ten reasons for doing so for the excellence of the Community the peace of the Community the curbing of the shameless the comfort of wellbehaved bhikkhus the restraint of pollutants related to the present life the prevention of pollutants related to the next life the arousing of faith in the faithless the increase of the faithful the establishment of the true Dhamma and the fostering of discipline
These reasons fall into three main types
The first two are external to ensure peace and wellbeing within the Community itself and to foster and protect faith among the laity on whom the monks depend for their support
The third type of reason is internal to help restrain and prevent mental pollutants within the individual monks
This last point quickly becomes apparent to anyone who seriously tries to keep to the rules for they encourage mindfulness and circumspection in one's actions qualities that carry over into the training of the mind
Rules however are not the only way to express ethical norms and the Buddha also made use of principles and models in teaching the virtues he wanted his following to develop
The rules thus function in a wider context than simple legality and work together with the principles and models formulated by the Buddha to provide a complete training in behavior with each side making up for the weaknesses of the other
Principles and models serve as personal subjective standards and tend to be loosely defined
Their interpretation and application are left to the judgment of the individual
Thus they are difficult to enforce when an individual has blatantly overstepped the bounds of proper behavior
Rules serve as more objective standards and thus are more enforceable
To work they must be precisely defined in a way acceptable to the Community at large
This precision though accounts for their weakness in general as universal guides to behavior
To begin with a clear practical line must be drawn between black and white ie between what is and is not an infraction of the rule
In some cases it is difficult to find a practical break off point that corresponds exactly to one's intuitive sense of what is right and wrong so it is sometimes necessary to include the areas of gray either with the black or the white
Secondly the more precisely a rule is defined to suit a particular time and place the less well it may fit other times and places
This is where principles and models come in They indicate the spirit of the rules and aid in applying them to differing contexts
Thus as you look at the rules and contemplate them you should keep in mind that they function in a larger context the teachings and practice of the Dhamma as a whole
The Buddha's own name for the religion he founded was DhammaVinaya so remember that neither half was meant to function without the other
The Buddha did not set out a code of rules all at once
Instead he formulated rules one by one in response to particular incidents
The Canon reports these incidents in each case and often a knowledge of these origin stories can help in understanding the reasons behind the rules
For instance the origin story to the rule forbidding lustful conduct between monks and women shows that the Buddha did not view women as somehow inferior or unclean
Rather the rule comes from an incident where a monk was fondling the wife of a Brahman who had come to visit his hut and the Buddha wanted women to feel safe in the knowledge that when visiting monasteries they would not be in danger of being molested
Some of the stories are classics of Buddhist literature and show a dry understated sense of humor together with a perceptive insight into human foibles
The element of humor here is very important for without it there can be no intelligent set of rules to govern human behavior
As time passed and the number of rules grew some of the Buddha's followers headed by Ven
Upali gathered the major rules into a set code  the Patimokkha  that eventually contained rules
The minor rules which came to number several hundred they gathered into chapters loosely organized according to topic called Khandhakas
The Patimokkha as we now have it is embedded in a text called the Sutta Vibhanga
This presents each rule preceded by its origin story and followed by what permutations if any it went through before reaching its final form
The rule is then analyzed into its component elements to show how the factors of effort object perception intention and result do or do not mitigate the penalty assigned by the rule
The discussion then concludes with a list of extenuating circumstances for which there is no offense in breaking the rule
The system of penalties the Buddha worked out for the rules is based on two principles
The first is that the training aims primarily at the development of the mind
Thus the factors of intention and perception often determine whether or not a particular action is an infringement of a rule
For instance killing an animal accidentally is in terms of the mind of the agent very different from killing it purposefully and does not count as an infringement of the rule against killing
There are a few rules where the factors of intention and perception make no difference at all  such as in the rule forbidding a monk to drink alcohol  but they almost always deal with situations where one would be expected to be mindful and perceptive enough to know what's going on and so these rules too help in the training of the mind
In any event the system of analyzing each offense into the factors of effort object perception intention and result shows how adherence to the rules leads directly to the development of concentration and discernment
If a monk is careful to view his actions in terms of these factors he is developing mindfulness an analytical approach to events in the present and persistence
These are the first three factors for Awakening and form the basis for the remaining four rapture serenity concentration and equanimity
The second principle used in determining penalties is based on the Buddha's observation to Ananda one of his chief disciples that friendship and companionship with the good is the whole of the religious life
Anyone who approaches the Dhamma seriously should be wise enough to realize that without the opportunity of associating and learning from people who are experienced on the path it is well nigh impossible to make any progress on one's own
The monks are thus expected to value their good standing vis a vis the wellbehaved members of their group and so the system of punishments worked out by the Buddha revolves entirely around affecting the offender's status within the Community
The Patimokkha classifies its rules into seven levels
The next three levels of rules  nissaggiya pācittiya pācittiya and pāṭidesanīya  entail simple confession to a fellow monk although the NP rules involved an article that has to be forfeited  in most cases temporarily although in a few cases the object has to be forfeited for good in which case the offender has to confess his offense to the entire Community
If a monk commits an offense and refuses to undergo the penalty the Community may decide how seriously they take the matter
Since there is no monks' police beyond the individual's conscience it may often happen that no one else knows of the offense to begin with and nothing is done
If however it becomes common knowledge and the Community regards it as a serious matter they should talk privately with the monk to help him see the error of his ways
If he is recalcitrant they may strip him temporarily of his status either by censuring him stripping him of his seniority driving him from the Community or suspending him from the Order of monks as a whole
If the offender sees the error of his ways and reforms his behavior accordingly the Community may return him to his former status
Now of course there may be some hardened souls among the monks who are unfazed by punishments of this sort but we should note that the Buddha saw no use for physical coercion in enforcing his rules
If a monk had to be physically forced into abiding by the training his heart wouldn't be in it and there is no way that he could benefit from it
Such monks the Buddha considered beyond the pale although he allowed them to stay on in the Community in hopes that eventually their conscience would get the better of them
In the meantime the law of karma would guarantee that in the long run they would not be getting away with anything at all
The final two levels of rules in the Patimokkha do not give a particular penalty
The sekhiya rules  dealing primarily with etiquette  simply state that one should work at following them
The Sutta Vibhanga explains that if one oversteps them out of disrespect one should confess the fact
The adhikaraṇa samatha rules are not so much rules as they are principles to follow in dealing with issues that arise in the Community
If monks try to settle an issue without following these principles their decision is invalid and they must confess their wrongdoing to other monks who took no part in the decision
With this background we may now look at the content of the rules
What follows is a list summarizing the basic meanings of the rules organized into five major categories dealing with Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Communal harmony and the etiquette of a contemplative
The first three categories  the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path that make up the training in heightened virtue  are especially useful for showing how the rules relate to the Buddhist path as a whole
These five categories are not sharply distinct types
Instead they are more like the colors in the band of light thrown off by a prism  discernably different but shading into one another with no sharp dividing lines
Right Speech for instance often shades into Communal harmony just as Right Livelihood shades into personal etiquette
Thus the placement of a particular rule in one category rather than another has been a somewhat arbitrary process
There are a few cases  such as Pācittiyas   where the reason for placing the rule in a particular category will become clear only after reading the detailed discussions in BMC
Each rule is followed by a code giving the rule's number in its section of the Patimokkha
If you count the number of rules in the list you will see that they do not quite equal
This is because there are a couple of cases where I have condensed two or three Sekhiya rules into one summary
MN defines wrong speech as lying divisive speech abusive speech and idle chatter
Making an unfounded charge to a bhikkhu that he has committed a pārājika offense in hopes of having him disrobed is a saṇghādisesa offense

Distorting the evidence while accusing a bhikkhu of having committed a pārājika offense in hopes of having him disrobed is a saṇghādisesa offense

Shortly after her ordination the Buddha's stepmother Mahapajapati Gotami asked him for a short Dhammainstruction that would guide her in her solitary practice
He responded with eight principles for recognizing what qualifies as Dhamma and Vinaya and what does not
The commentary tells us that after her instruction Mahapajapati Gotami in no long time became an arahant
The eight principles have been widely cited ever since
One Thai writer has called them the constitution of Buddhism as they form the standards against which the validity of any interpretation of the Dhamma or Vinaya must be judged
Perhaps the most important point that these principles make is that any teaching has to be judged by the results that come when putting it into practice
They are an excellent illustration of the teachings given in the wellknown Kalama Sutta as well as in the teachings that the Buddha gave to his son Rahula
The Canon illustrates these principles not only with abstract discussions but also with stories and the stories are often more memorable than the discussions
Thus this study guide differs from its companions in that it is predominantly composed of stories
Bear in mind as you read the stories that they are often framed in somewhat extreme terms to drive their points home
Sister Subha Kali Prince Dighavu and the monk whose limbs are being removed by a saw would not be as memorable if their stories were framed in more realistic terms
Also bear in mind that there is some overlap among the principles and that a passage may illustrate more than one at a time
Thus for instance the story of Ven
Isidatta analyzes the fetter of selfidentity views at the same time illustrating the principles of modesty and nonentanglement
The most extensive overlap is between the principle of dispassion and that of not being fettered as passion in its various forms covers three of the ten fetters that bind a person to the round of rebirth
Thus the section on dispassion contains passages dealing with how to overcome the three passion fetters  sensual passion passion for the sense of form experienced in the jhanas of form and passion for the sense of formlessness experienced in the formless jhanas  whereas the section on being unfettered treats the remaining seven fetters
I have heard that at on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Vesali in the Peaked Roof Hall in the Great Forest
Then Mahapajapati Gotami went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him stood to one side
As she was standing there she said to him It would be good lord if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief such that having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One I might dwell alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute
Gotami the qualities of which you may know 'These qualities lead
You may categorically hold 'This is not the Dhamma this is not the Vinaya this is not the Teacher's instruction'
As for the qualities of which you may know 'These qualities lead
You may categorically hold 'This is the Dhamma this is the Vinaya this is the Teacher's instruction' That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Mahapajapati Gotami delighted at his words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Gaya at Gaya Head with monks
There he addressed the monks
Monks the All is aflame
What All is aflame
The eye is aflame
Forms are aflame
Consciousness at the eye is aflame
Contact at the eye is aflame
And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye  experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain  that too is aflame
Aflame with what
Aflame with the fire of passion the fire of aversion the fire of delusion
Aflame I tell you with birth aging  death with sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs
The ear is aflame
Sounds are aflame
The nose is aflame
Aromas are aflame
The tongue is aflame
Flavors are aflame
The body is aflame
Tactile sensations are aflame
The intellect is aflame
Ideas are aflame
Consciousness at the intellect is aflame
Contact at the intellect is aflame
And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the intellect  experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain  that too is aflame
Aflame with what
Aflame with the fire of passion the fire of aversion the fire of delusion
Aflame I say with birth aging  death with sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs
Seeing thus the instructed noble disciple grows disenchanted with the eye disenchanted with forms disenchanted with consciousness at the eye disenchanted with contact at the eye
And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain With that too he grows disenchanted
He grows disenchanted with the ear
He grows disenchanted with the nose
He grows disenchanted with the tongue
He grows disenchanted with the body
He grows disenchanted with the intellect disenchanted with ideas disenchanted with consciousness at the intellect disenchanted with contact at the intellect
And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the intellect experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain He grows disenchanted with that too
Disenchanted he becomes dispassionate
Through dispassion he is fully released
With full release there is the knowledge 'Fully released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world' That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted at his words
And while this explanation was being given the hearts of the monks through no clinging were fully released from fermentationeffluents
And how does a monk guard the doors of his senses
On seeing a form with the eye he does not grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him
On hearing a sound with the ear On smelling an odor with the nose On tasting a flavor with the tongue On touching a tactile sensation with the body On cognizing an idea with the intellect he does not grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him
Endowed with this noble restraint over the sense faculties he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless
This is how a monk guards the doors of his senses

As Subha the nun was going through Jivaka's delightful mango grove a libertine blocked her path so she said to him
Now at that time Ven
Anuruddha going through the Kosalan countryside on his way to Savatthi arrived in the evening at a certain village
And at that time a rest house had been set up by a woman in that village
So Ven
Anuruddha went to the woman and on arrival said to her If it is no inconvenience for you sister I will stay for one night in the rest house
You are welcome to stay venerable sir
Then other travelers went to that woman and on arrival said If it is no inconvenience for you lady we will stay for one night in the rest house
This master has arrived first
If he gives his permission you may stay
So the travelers went to Ven
Anuruddha and on arrival said to him If it is no inconvenience for you venerable sir we will stay for one night in the rest house
You are welcome to stay friends
Now it so happened that the woman had fallen in love with Ven
Anuruddha at first sight so she went to him and said The master will not be comfortable crowded with these people
It would be good if I were to prepare a bed inside for the master
Ven
Anuruddha consented by remaining silence
Then the woman having herself prepared a bed inside for Ven
Anuruddha having put on her jewelry and scented herself with perfumes went to him and said Master you are beautiful goodlooking and appealing
I too am beautiful goodlooking  appealing
It would be good if I were to be your wife
When this was said Ven
Anuruddha remained silent
So a second time A third time she said to him Master you are beautiful goodlooking  appealing
I too am beautiful goodlooking  appealing
Please take me together with all my wealth
A third time Ven
Anuruddha remained silent
So the woman having slipped off her upper cloak paraded up  down in front of him stood sat down  then lay down right in front of him
But Ven
Anuruddha keeping control of his faculties didn't as much as glance at her or say even a word
Then the thought occurred to her Isn't it amazing
Isn't it astounding
Many men send for me at a price of or even but this contemplative even when I myself beg him doesn't want to take me together with all of my wealth So putting her upper cloak back on and bowing her head at his feet she said to him Venerable sir a transgression has overcome me in that I was so foolish so muddleheaded  so unskillful as to act in such a way
Please accept this confession of my transgression as such so that I may restrain myself in the future
Yes sister a transgression overcame you in that you were so foolish so muddleheaded  so unskillful as to act in such a way
But because you see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with the Dhamma we accept your confession
For it is a cause of growth in the Dhamma  Discipline of the noble ones when seeing a transgression as such one makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma and exercises restraint in the future
Then when the night had passed the woman with her own hand served  satisfied Ven
Anuruddha with excellent staple and nonstaple food
When Ven
Anuruddha had eaten  removed his hand from his bowl she sat to one side
As she was sitting there Ven
Anuruddha instructed urged roused  encouraged her with a talk on Dhamma
Then the woman having been instructed urged roused  encouraged by Ven
Anuruddha with a talk on Dhamma said to him Magnificent venerable sir
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Ven
Anuruddha  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Community of monks
May the master remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for life

Quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters and remains in the first jhana rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought and evaluation
He permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal

There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born of composure
This too is a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime
And furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' He permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture
Just as in a lotus pond some of the lotuses born and growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated and pervaded suffused and filled with cool water from their roots to their tips and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water even so the monk permeates this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture
This too is a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime
And furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure and pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress  he enters and remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain
He sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness
Just as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awareness
This too great king is a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime
'I tell you the ending of the effluents depends on the first jhana' Thus it has been said
In reference to what was it said Suppose that an archer or archer's apprentice were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay so that after a while he would become able to shoot long distances to fire accurate shots in rapid succession and to pierce great masses
In the same way there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born of withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perception fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness notself
He turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness 'This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding'
Staying right there he reaches the ending of the mental effluents
Or if not then  through this very dhammapassion this very dhammadelight and from the total wasting away of the first five of the Fetters  he is due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that world
'I tell you the ending of the effluents depends on the first jhana' Thus was it said and in reference to this was it said
Thus as far as the perceptionattainments go that is as far as gnosispenetration goes
As for these two dimensions  the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception  the attainment of the cessation of feeling  perception  I tell you that they are to be rightly explained by those monks who are meditators skilled in attaining skilled in attaining  emerging who have attained  emerged in dependence on them
 there remains only equanimity pure  bright pliant malleable  luminous
Just as if a skilled goldsmith or goldsmith's apprentice were to prepare a furnace heat up a crucible and taking gold with a pair of tongs place it in the crucible
He would blow on it periodically sprinkle water on it periodically examine it periodically so that the gold would become refined wellrefined thoroughly refined flawless free from dross pliant malleable  luminous
Then whatever sort of ornament he had in mind  whether a belt an earring a necklace or a gold chain  it would serve his purpose
In the same way there remains only equanimity pure  bright pliant malleable  luminous
He discerns that 'If I were to direct equanimity as pure  bright as this toward the dimension of the infinitude of space I would develop the mind along those lines and thus this equanimity of mine  thus supported thus sustained  would last for a long time
'
He discerns that 'If I were to direct equanimity as pure  bright as this toward the dimension of the infinitude of space and to develop the mind along those lines that would be fabricated
' He neither fabricates nor wills for the sake of becoming or unbecoming
This being the case he is not sustained by anything in the world
Unsustained he is not agitated
Unagitated he is totally unbound right within
He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
There are these ten fetters
Which ten
Five lower fetters  five higher fetters
And which are the five lower fetters
Selfidentity views uncertainty grasping at precepts  practices sensual desire and ill will
These are the five lower fetters
And which are the five higher fetters
Passion for form passion for what is formless conceit restlessness and ignorance
These are the five higher fetters
And these are the ten fetters
There are in this community of monks monks who with the total ending of three Fetters are streamwinners steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for selfawakening
There are monks who with the total ending of three fetters and the thinning out of passion aversion  delusion are oncereturners
After returning only once to this world they will put an end to stress
There are monks who with the total ending of the first five of the Fetters are due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that world
There are monks who are arahants whose mental effluents are ended who have reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and who are released through right gnosis
And what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by seeing
There is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person does not discern what ideas are fit for attention or what ideas are unfit for attention
This being so he does not attend to ideas fit for attention and attends to ideas unfit for attention
And what are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends to
Whatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen effluent of sensuality arises and the arisen effluent of sensuality increases the unarisen effluent of becoming the unarisen effluent of ignorance arises and the arisen effluent of ignorance increases This is how he attends inappropriately 'Was I in the past
Was I not in the past
What was I in the past
How was I in the past
Having been what what was I in the past
Shall I be in the future
Shall I not be in the future
What shall I be in the future
How shall I be in the future
Having been what what shall I be in the future' Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present 'Am I
Am I not
What am I
How am I
Where has this being come from
Where is it bound'
As he attends inappropriately in this way one of six kinds of view arises in him The view I have a self arises in him as true  established or the view I have no self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive notself or the view It is precisely by means of notself that I perceive self arises in him as true  established or else he has a view like this This very self of mine  the knower that is sensitive here  there to the ripening of good  bad actions  is the self of mine that is constant everlasting eternal not subject to change and will endure as long as eternity
This is called a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of views
Bound by a fetter of views the uninstructed runofthemill person is not freed from birth aging  death from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair
He is not freed I tell you from stress
The wellinstructed noble disciple discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attention
This being so he does not attend to ideas unfit for attention and attends to ideas fit for attention And what are the ideas fit for attention that he attends to
Whatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen effluent of sensuality does not arise and the arisen effluent of sensuality is abandoned the unarisen effluent of becoming the unarisen effluent of ignorance does not arise and the arisen effluent of ignorance is abandoned He attends appropriately This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress
As he attends appropriately in this way three fetters are abandoned in him identityview doubt and grasping at precepts  practices
These are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by seeing
There is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person assumes form to be the self
That assumption is a fabrication
Now what is the cause what is the origination what is the birth what is the comingintoexistence of that fabrication
To an uninstructed runofthemill person touched by that which is felt born of contact with ignorance craving arises
That fabrication is born of that
And that fabrication is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen
That craving That feeling That contact That ignorance is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen
It is by knowing  seeing in this way that one without delay puts an end to the fermentations
Or he doesn't assume form to be the self but he assumes the self as possessing form form as in the self self as in form
Now that assumption is a fabrication
What is the cause of that fabrication
To an uninstructed runofthemill person touched by the feeling born of contact with ignorance craving arises
That fabrication is born of that
And that fabrication is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen
That craving That feeling That contact That ignorance is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen
It is by knowing  seeing in this way that one without delay puts an end to the fermentations
Or he may have a view such as this This self is the same as the cosmos
This I will be after death constant lasting eternal not subject to change This eternalist view is a fabrication Or he may have a view such as this I would not be neither would there be what is mine
I will not be neither will there be what is mine This annihilationist view is a fabrication Or he may be doubtful  uncertain having come to no conclusion with regard to the true Dhamma
That doubt uncertainty  comingtonoconclusion is a fabrication
What is the cause of that fabrication
To an uninstructed runofthemill person touched by what is felt born of contact with ignorance craving arises
That fabrication is born of that
And that fabrication is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen
That craving That feeling That contact That ignorance is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen
It is by knowing  seeing in this way that one without delay puts an end to the fermentations
Imagine a bowl of water mixed with lac yellow orpiment indigo or crimson such that a man with good eyesight examining the reflection of his face in it would not be able to know or see his face as it actually is
In the same way when one remains with awareness possessed by sensual passion overcome with sensual passion and neither knows nor sees the escape as it has come to be from sensual passion once it has arisen then one neither knows nor sees what is for one's own benefit or for the benefit of others or for the benefit of both
Now imagine a bowl of water heated on a fire boiling  bubbling over such that a man with good eyesight examining the reflection of his face in it would not be able to know or see his face as it actually is
In the same way when one remains with awareness possessed by ill will overcome with ill will and neither knows nor sees the escape as it has come to be from ill will once it has arisen then one neither knows nor sees what is for one's own benefit or for the benefit of others or for the benefit of both
Now imagine a bowl of water covered with algae  slime such that a man with good eyesight examining the reflection of his face in it would not be able to know or see his face as it actually is
In the same way when one remains with awareness possessed by sloth  drowsiness overcome with sloth  drowsiness and neither knows nor sees the escape as it has come to be from sloth  drowsiness once it has arisen then one neither knows nor sees what is for one's own benefit or for the benefit of others or for the benefit of both
Now imagine a bowl of water ruffled by the wind disturbed  covered with waves such that a man with good eyesight examining the reflection of his face in it would not be able to know or see his face as it actually is
In the same way when one remains with awareness possessed by restlessness  anxiety overcome with restlessness  anxiety and neither knows nor sees the escape as it has come to be from restlessness  anxiety once it has arisen then one neither knows nor sees what is for one's own benefit or for the benefit of others or for the benefit of both
Now imagine a bowl of water stirred up turbid muddied  left in the dark such that a man with good eyesight examining the reflection of his face in it would not be able to know or see his face as it actually is
In the same way when one remains with awareness possessed by uncertainty overcome with uncertainty and neither knows nor sees the escape as it has come to be from uncertainty once it has arisen then one neither knows nor sees what is for one's own benefit or for the benefit of others or for the benefit of both
Suppose that a man taking a loan invests it in his business affairs
His business affairs succeed
He repays his old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining his wife
The thought would occur to him 'Before taking a loan I invested it in my business affairs
Now my business affairs have succeeded
I have repaid my old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining my wife' Because of that he would experience joy  happiness
Now suppose that a man falls sick  in pain  seriously ill
He does not enjoy his meals and there is no strength in his body
As time passes he eventually recovers from that sickness
He enjoys his meals and there is strength in his body
The thought would occur to him 'Before I was sick Now I am recovered from that sickness
I enjoy my meals and there is strength in my body' Because of that he would experience joy  happiness
Now suppose that a man is bound in prison
As time passes he eventually is released from that bondage safe  sound with no loss of property
The thought would occur to him 'Before I was bound in prison
Now I am released from that bondage safe  sound with no loss of my property' Because of that he would experience joy  happiness
Now suppose that a man is a slave subject to others not subject to himself unable to go where he likes
As time passes he eventually is released from that slavery subject to himself not subject to others freed able to go where he likes
The thought would occur to him 'Before I was a slave Now I am released from that slavery subject to myself not subject to others freed able to go where I like' Because of that he would experience joy  happiness
Now suppose that a man carrying money  goods is traveling by a road through desolate country
As time passes he eventually emerges from that desolate country safe  sound with no loss of property
The thought would occur to him 'Before carrying money  goods I was traveling by a road through desolate country
Now I have emerged from that desolate country safe  sound with no loss of my property' Because of that he would experience joy  happiness
In the same way when these five hindrances are not abandoned in himself the monk regards it as a debt a sickness a prison slavery a road through desolate country
But when these five hindrances are abandoned in himself he regards it as unindebtedness good health release from prison freedom a place of security

These seven things  pleasing to an enemy bringing about an enemy's aim  come to a man or woman who is angry

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels' Sanctuary
Then the brahman Akkosaka Bharadvaja heard that a brahman of the Bharadvaja clan had gone forth from the home life into homelessness in the presence of the Blessed One
Angered  displeased he went to the Blessed One and on arrival insulted  cursed him with rude harsh words
When this was said the Blessed One said to him What do you think brahman Do friends  colleagues relatives  kinsmen come to you as guests
Yes Master Gotama sometimes friends  colleagues relatives  kinsmen come to me as guests
And what do you think Do you serve them with staple  nonstaple foods  delicacies
Yes sometimes I serve them with staple  nonstaple foods  delicacies
And if they don't accept them to whom do those foods belong
If they don't accept them Master Gotama those foods are all mine
In the same way brahman that with which you have insulted me who is not insulting that with which you have taunted me who is not taunting that with which you have berated me who is not berating that I don't accept from you
It's all yours brahman
It's all yours
Whoever returns insult to one who is insulting returns taunts to one who is taunting returns a berating to one who is berating is said to be eating together sharing company with that person
But I am neither eating together nor sharing your company brahman
It's all yours
It's all yours
The king together with his court know this of Master Gotama  'Gotama the contemplative is an arahant'  and yet still Master Gotama gets angry
When this was said the brahman Akkosaka Bharadvaja said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monks
Let me obtain the going forth in Master Gotama's presence let me obtain admission
Then the brahman Akkosaka Bharadvaja received the going forth  the admission in the Blessed One's presence
And not long after his admission  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute  he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now
He knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for the sake of this world And so Ven
Bharadvaja became another one of the arahants
Once monks in this same Savatthi there was a lady of a household named Vedehika
This good report about Lady Vedehika had circulated 'Lady Vedehika is gentle
Lady Vedehika is eventempered
Lady Vedehika is calm' Now Lady Vedehika had a slave named Kali who was diligent deft  neat in her work
The thought occurred to Kali the slave 'This good report about my Lady Vedehika has circulated Lady Vedehika is eventempered
Lady Vedehika is gentle
Lady Vedehika is calm Now is anger present in my lady without showing or is it absent
Or is it just because I'm diligent deft  neat in my work that the anger present in my lady doesn't show
Why don't I test her'
So Kali the slave got up after daybreak
Then Lady Vedehika said to her 'Hey Kali'
'Yes madam'
'Why did you get up after daybreak'
'No reason madam'
'No reason you wicked slave and yet you get up after daybreak' Angered  displeased she scowled
Then the thought occurred to Kali the slave 'Anger is present in my lady without showing and not absent
And it's just because I'm diligent deft  neat in my work that the anger present in my lady doesn't show
Why don't I test her some more'
So Kali the slave got up later in the day
Then Lady Vedehika said to her 'Hey Kali'
'Yes madam'
'Why did you get up later in the day'
'No reason madam'
'No reason you wicked slave and yet you get up later in the day' Angered  displeased she grumbled
Then the thought occurred to Kali the slave 'Anger is present in my lady without showing and not absent
And it's just because I'm diligent deft  neat in my work that the anger present in my lady doesn't show
Why don't I test her some more'
So Kali the slave got up even later in the day
Then Lady Vedehika said to her 'Hey Kali'
'Yes madam'
'Why did you get up even later in the day'
'No reason madam'
'No reason you wicked slave and yet you get up even later in the day' Angered  displeased she grabbed hold of a rolling pin and gave her a whack over the head cutting it open
Then Kali the slave with blood streaming from her cutopen head went and denounced her mistress to the neighbors 'See ladies the gentle one's handiwork
See the eventempered one's handiwork
See the calm one's handiwork
How could she angered  displeased with her only slave for getting up after daybreak grab hold of a rolling pin and give her a whack over the head cutting it open'
After that this evil report about Lady Vedehika circulated 'Lady Vedehika is vicious
Lady Vedehika is foultempered
Lady Vedehika is violent'
In the same way monks a monk may be ever so gentle ever so eventempered ever so calm as long as he is not touched by disagreeable aspects of speech
But it is only when disagreeable aspects of speech touch him that he can truly be known as gentle eventempered  calm
I don't call a monk easy to admonish if he is easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish only by reason of robes almsfood lodging  medicinal requisites for curing the sick
Why is that
Because if he doesn't get robes almsfood lodging  medicinal requisites for curing the sick then he isn't easy to admonish and doesn't make himself easy to admonish
But if a monk is easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish purely out of esteem for the Dhamma respect for the Dhamma reverence for the Dhamma then I call him easy to admonish
Thus monks you should train yourselves 'We will be easy to admonish and make ourselves easy to admonish purely out of esteem for the Dhamma respect for the Dhamma reverence for the Dhamma' That's how you should train yourselves
Monks there are these five aspects of speech by which others may address you timely or untimely true or false affectionate or harsh beneficial or unbeneficial with a mind of goodwill or with inner hate
Others may address you in a timely way or an untimely way
They may address you with what is true or what is false
They may address you in an affectionate way or a harsh way
They may address you in a beneficial way or an unbeneficial way
They may address you with a mind of goodwill or with inner hate
In any event you should train yourselves 'Our minds will be unaffected and we will say no evil words
We will remain sympathetic to that person's welfare with a mind of good will and with no inner hate
We will keep pervading him with an awareness imbued with good will and beginning with him we will keep pervading the allencompassing world with an awareness imbued with good will  abundant expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill will' That's how you should train yourselves
Suppose that a man were to come along carrying a hoe  a basket saying 'I will make this great earth be without earth' He would dig here  there scatter soil here  there spit here  there urinate here  there saying 'Be without earth
Be without earth' Now what do you think  would he make this great earth be without earth
No lord
Why is that
Because this great earth is deep  enormous
It can't easily be made to be without earth
The man would reap only a share of weariness  disappointment
In the same way monks there are these five aspects of speech by which others may address you timely or untimely true or false affectionate or harsh beneficial or unbeneficial with a mind of goodwill or with inner hate

Suppose that a man were to come along carrying lac yellow orpiment indigo or crimson saying 'I will draw pictures in space I will make pictures appear' Now what do you think  would he draw pictures in space  make pictures appear
No lord
Why is that
Because space is formless  featureless
It's not easy to draw pictures there and to make them appear
The man would reap only a share of weariness  disappointment
In the same way monks there are these five aspects of speech by which others may address you timely or untimely true or false affectionate or harsh beneficial or unbeneficial with a mind of goodwill or with inner hate

Suppose that a man were to come along carrying a burning grass torch and saying 'With this burning grass torch I will heat up the river Ganges and make it boil' Now what do you think  would he with that burning grass torch heat up the river Ganges and make it boil
No lord
Why is that
Because the river Ganges is deep  enormous
It's not easy to heat it up and make it boil with a burning grass torch
The man would reap only a share of weariness  disappointment

Suppose there were a catskin bag  beaten wellbeaten beaten through  through soft silky free of rustling  crackling  and a man were to come along carrying a stick or shard and saying 'With this stick or shard I will take this catskin bag  beaten wellbeaten beaten through  through soft silky free of rustling  crackling  and I will make it rustle  crackle' Now what do you think  would he with that stick or shard take that catskin bag  beaten wellbeaten beaten through  through soft silky free of rustling  crackling  and make it rustle  crackle
No lord
Why is that
Because the catskin bag is beaten wellbeaten beaten through  through soft silky free of rustling  crackling
It's not easy to make it rustle  crackle with a stick or shard
The man would reap only a share of weariness  disappointment

Even then you should train yourselves 'Our minds will be unaffected and we will say no evil words
We will remain sympathetic with a mind of good will and with no inner hate

Monks if you attend constantly to this admonition on the simile of the saw do you see any aspects of speech slight or gross that you could not endure
No lord
Then attend constantly to this admonition on the simile of the saw
That will be for your longterm welfare  happiness
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
On one occasion a large number of senior monks were living near Macchikasanda in the Wild Mango Grove
Then Citta the householder went to them and on arrival having bowed down to them sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to them Venerable sirs may the senior monks acquiesce to tomorrow's meal from me
The senior monks acquiesced by silence
Then Citta the householder sensing the senior monks' acquiescence got up from his seat and having bowed down to them circumambulated them  keeping them to his right  and left
When the night had passed the senior monks put on their robes in the early morning and  taking their bowls  outer robes  went to Citta's residence
There they sat down on the appointed seats
Citta the householder went to them and having bowed down to them sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the most senior monk
Venerable sir concerning the various views that arise in the world  'The cosmos is eternal' or 'The cosmos isn't eternal' 'The cosmos is finite' or 'The cosmos is infinite' 'The soul and the body are the same' or 'The soul is one thing the body another' 'A Tathagata exists after death' or 'A Tathagata doesn't exist after death' or 'A Tathagata both exists  doesn't exist after death' or 'A Tathagata neither exists nor doesn't exist after death' these along with the sixtytwo views mentioned in the Brahmajala  when what is present do these views come into being and when what is absent do they not come into being
When this was said the senior monk was silent
A second time A third time Citta the householder asked Concerning the various views that arise in the world when what is present do they come into being and what is absent do they not come into being A third time the senior monk was silent
Now on that occasion Ven
Isidatta was the most junior of all the monks in that Community
Then he said to the senior monk Allow me venerable sir to answer Citta the householder's question
Go ahead  answer it friend Isidatta
Now householder are you asking this 'Concerning the various views that arise in the world when what is present do they come into being and what is absent do they not come into being'
Yes venerable sir
Concerning the various views that arise in the world householder when selfidentity view is present these views come into being when selfidentity view is absent they don't come into being
But venerable sir how does selfidentity view come into being
There is the case householder where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He assumes feeling to be the self or the self as possessing feeling or feeling as in the self or the self as in feeling
He assumes apperception to be the self or the self as possessing apperception or apperception as in the self or the self as in apperception
He assumes fabrications to be the self or the self as possessing fabrications or fabrications as in the self or the self as in fabrications
He assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
This is how selfidentity view comes into being
And venerable sir how does selfidentity view not come into being
There is the case householder where a wellinstructed noble disciple  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma  does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He does not assume feeling to be the self He does not assume apperception to be the self He does not assume fabrications to be the self He does not assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
This is how selfidentity view does not come into being
Venerable sir where does Master Isidatta come from
I come from Avanti householder
There is venerable sir a clansman from Avanti named Isidatta an unseen friend of mine who has gone forth
Have you ever seen him
Yes householder
Where is he living now venerable sir
When this was said the Venerable Isidatta was silent
Are you my Isidatta
Yes householder
Then may Master Isidatta delight in the charming Wild Mango Grove at Macchikasanda
I will be responsible for your robes almsfood lodgings  medicinal requisites
That is admirably said householder
Then Citta the householder  having delighted  rejoiced in the Venerable Isidatta's words  with his own hand served  satisfied the senior monks with choice staple  nonstaple foods
When the senior monks had finished eating and had removed their hands from their bowls they got up from their seats and left
Then the most senior monk said to the Venerable Isidatta It was excellent friend Isidatta the way that question inspired you to answer
It didn't inspire an answer in me at all
Whenever a similar question comes up again may it inspire you to answer as you did just now
Then Ven
Isidatta  having set his lodging in order and taking his bowl  robes  left Macchikasanda
And in leaving Macchikasanda he was gone for good and never returned
Ven
Sariputta said Friends just now as I was withdrawn in seclusion this train of thought arose to my awareness 'Is there anything in the world with whose change or alteration there would arise within me sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair' Then the thought occurred to me 'There is nothing in the world with whose change or alteration there would arise within me sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair' When this was said Ven
Ananda said to Ven
Sariputta Sariputta my friend even if there were change  alteration in the Teacher would there arise within you no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair
Even if there were change  alteration in the Teacher my friend there would arise within me no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair
Still I would have this thought 'What a great being of great might of great prowess has disappeared
For if the Blessed One were to remain for a long time that would be for the benefit of many people for the happiness of many people out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of human  divine beings' Surely it's because Ven
Sariputta's Imaking  minemaking and obsessions with conceit have long been well uprooted that even if there were change  alteration in the Teacher there would arise within him no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair
Then Ven
Anuruddha went to where Ven
Sariputta was staying and on arrival greeted him courteously
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Sariputta By means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human I see the thousandfold cosmos
My persistence is aroused  unsluggish
My mindfulness is established  unshaken
My body is calm  unaroused
My mind is concentrated into singleness
And yet my mind is not released from the effluents through lack of clingingsustenance
Sariputta My friend when the thought occurs to you 'By means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human I see the thousandfold cosmos' that is related to your conceit
When the thought occurs to you 'My persistence is aroused  unsluggish
My mindfulness is established  unshaken
My body is calm  unperturbed
My mind is concentrated into singleness' that is related to your restlessness
When the thought occurs to you 'And yet my mind is not released from the effluents through lack of clingingsustenance' that is related to your anxiety
It would be well if  abandoning these three qualities not attending to these three qualities  you directed your mind to the Deathless property'
So after that Ven
Anuruddha  abandoning those three qualities not attending to those three qualities  directed his mind to the Deathless property
Dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now
He knew 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for the sake of this world' And thus Ven
Anuruddha became another one of the arahants
And what is ignorance
Not knowing stress not knowing the origination of stress not knowing the cessation of stress not knowing the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is called ignorance
Just as if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen  clear limpid and unsullied  where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells gravel and pebbles and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting and it would occur to him 'This pool of water is clear limpid and unsullied
Here are these shells gravel and pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting' In the same way  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability  the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations
He discerns as it has come to be that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are mental fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations' His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentation of sensuality the fermentation of becoming the fermentation of ignorance
With release there is the knowledge 'Released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world' This too great king is a fruit of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime
And as for another visible fruit of the contemplative life higher and more sublime than this there is none


Once monks in Varanasi Brahmadatta was the king of Kasi  rich prosperous with many possessions many troops many vehicles many territories with fullystocked armories  granaries
Dighiti was the king of Kosala  poor not very prosperous with few possessions few troops few vehicles few territories with poorlystocked armories  granaries
So Brahmadatta the king of Kasi raising a fourfold army marched against Dighiti the king of Kosala
Dighiti the king of Kosala heard Brahmadatta the king of Kasi they say has raised a fourfold army and is marching against me Then the thought occurred to him King Brahmadatta is rich prosperous with fullystocked armories  granaries whereas I am poor with poorlystocked armories  granaries
I am not competent to stand against even one attack by him
Why don't I slip out of the city beforehand So taking his chief consort he slipped out of the city beforehand
Then King Brahmadatta conquering the troops vehicles lands armories  granaries of King Dighiti lived in lordship over them
Meanwhile King Dighiti had set out for Varanasi together with his consort and traveling by stages arrived there
There he lived with her on the outskirts of Varanasi in a potter's house disguised as a wanderer
Not long afterwards she became pregnant
She had a pregnancy wish of this sort she wanted to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swords
She said to King Dighiti Your majesty I am pregnant and I have a pregnancy wish of this sort I want to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swords He said My queen where is there for us  fallen on hard times  a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground and water used for washing the swords
If I don't get this your majesty I will die
Now at that time the brahman adviser to King Brahmadatta was a friend of King Dighiti
So King Dighiti went to him and on arrival said A lady friend of yours old friend is pregnant and she has a pregnancy wish of this sort she wants to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swords
In that case let me see her
So King Dighiti's consort went to King Brahmadatta's brahman adviser
When he saw her coming from afar he rose from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder and with his hands raised in salutation to her exclaimed three times Surely the king of Kosala has come to your womb
Surely the king of Kosala has come to your womb
Don't be worried my queen
You will get to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swords
Then he went to King Brahmadatta and on arrival said to him Your majesty signs have appeared such that tomorrow at dawn a fourfold army armed  arrayed should stand on a parade ground and that the swords should be washed
So King Brahmadatta ordered his people I say then Do as the brahman adviser says Thus King Dighiti's chief consort got to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and got to drink the water used for washing the swords
Then with the maturing of the fetus she gave birth to a son whom they named Dighavu
Not long afterwards Prince Dighavu reached the age of discretion
The thought occurred to King Dighiti This King Brahmadatta of Kasi has done us great harm
He has seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granaries
If he finds out about us he will have all three of us killed
Why don't I send Prince Dighavu to live outside of the city So Prince Dighavu having gone to live outside of the city learned all the crafts
Now at that time King Dighiti's barber had gone over to King Brahmadatta
He saw King Dighiti together with his consort living on the outskirts of Varanasi in a potter's house disguised as a wanderer
On seeing them he went to King Brahmadatta and on arrival said to him Your majesty King Dighiti of Kosala together with his consort is living on the outskirts of Varanasi in a potter's house disguised as a wanderer
So King Brahmadatta ordered his people I say then go fetch King Dighiti together with his consort
Responding As you say your majesty they went and fetched King Dighiti together with his consort
Then King Brahmadatta ordered his people I say then having bound King Dighiti  his consort with a stout rope with their arms pinned tightly against their backs and having shaved them bald march them to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads evict them out the south gate of the city and there to the south of the city cut them into four pieces and bury them in holes placed in the four directions
Responding As you say your majesty the king's people bound King Dighiti  his consort with a stout rope pinning their arms tightly against their backs shaved them bald and marched them to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads
Then the thought occurred to Prince Dighavu It's been a long time since I saw my mother  father
What if I were to go see them So he entered Varanasi and saw his mother  father bound with a stout rope their arms pinned tightly against their backs their heads shaven bald being marched to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads
So he went to them
King Dighiti saw Prince Dighavu coming from afar and on seeing him said Don't my dear Dighavu be farsighted
Don't be nearsighted
For vengeance is not settled through vengeance
Vengeance is settled through nonvengeance
When this was said the people said to him This King Dighiti has gone crazy
He's talking nonsense
Who is Dighavu
Why is he saying 'Don't my dear Dighavu be farsighted
Don't be nearsighted
For vengeance is not settled through vengeance
Vengeance is settled through nonvengeance'
I'm not crazy or talking nonsense
He who knows will understand Then a second time a third time he said Don't my dear Dighavu be farsighted
Don't be nearsighted
For vengeance is not settled through vengeance
Vengeance is settled through nonvengeance
A third time the people said to him This King Dighiti has gone crazy
He's talking nonsense
Who is Dighavu
Why is he saying 'Don't my dear Dighavu be farsighted
Don't be nearsighted
For vengeance is not settled through vengeance
Vengeance is settled through nonvengeance'
I'm not crazy or talking nonsense
He who knows will understand
Then the king's people having marched King Dighiti together with his chief consort to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads evicted them out the south gate of the city and there to the south of the city cut them into four pieces buried them in holes placed in the four directions stationed guards and left
Then Prince Dighavu having entered Varanasi brought out some liquor and got the guards to drink it
When they had fallen down drunk he collected sticks made a pyre raised the bodies of his mother  father onto the pyre set fire to it and then circumambulated it three times with his hands raised in salutation
Now at that time King Brahmadatta had gone up to the terrace on top of his palace
He saw Prince Dighavu circumambulating the pyre three times with his hands raised in salutation and on seeing him the thought occurred to him Doubtlessly this person is a relative or bloodkinsman of King Dighiti
Ah how unfortunate for me for there is no one who will tell me what this means
Then Prince Dighavu having gone into the wilderness and having cried  wept as much as he needed to dried his tears and entered Varanasi
Going to an elephant stable next to the king's palace he said to the chief elephant trainer Teacher I want to learn this craft
In that case young man you may learn it
Then rising in the last watch of the night Prince Dighavu sang in a sweet voice and played the lute in the elephant stable
King Brahmadatta also rising in the last watch of the night heard the sweetvoiced singing  luteplaying in the elephant stable
On hearing it he asked his people I say Who was that rising in the last watch of the night singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant stable
Your majesty a young man  the student of suchandsuch an elephant trainer rising in the last watch of the night was singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant stable
I say then go fetch that young man
Responding As you say your majesty they went and fetched Prince Dighavu
Then King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu I say Was that you rising in the last watch of the night singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant stable
Yes your majesty
I say then my young man sing and play the lute
Responding As you say your majesty and seeking to win favor Prince Dighavu sang with a sweet voice and played the lute
Then King Brahmadatta said to him I say You my young man are to stay and attend to me
As you say your majesty Prince Dighavu replied
Then he rose in the morning before King Brahmadatta went to bed in the evening after him did whatever the king ordered always acting to please him speaking politely to him
And it was not long before King Brahmadatta placed the prince close to him in a position of trust
Then one day King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu I say then my young man harness the chariot
I'm going hunting
Responding As you say your majesty Prince Dighavu harnessed the chariot and then said to King Brahmadatta Your chariot is harnessed your majesty
Now is the time for you to do as you see fit
Then King Brahmadatta mounted the chariot and Prince Dighavu drove it
He drove it in such a way that the king's entourage went one way and the chariot another
Then after they had gone far King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu I say then my young man unharness the chariot
I'm tired
I'm going to lie down
Responding As you say your majesty Prince Dighavu unharnessed the chariot and sat down crosslegged on the ground
Then King Brahmadatta lay down placing his head on Prince Dighavu's lap
As he was tired he went to sleep right away
Then the thought occurred to Prince Dighavu This King Brahmadatta of Kasi has done us great harm
He has seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granaries
And it was because of him that my mother  father were killed
Now is my chance to wreak vengeance He drew his sword from his scabbard
But then he thought My father told me as he was about to die 'Don't my dear Dighavu be farsighted
Don't be nearsighted
For vengeance is not settled through vengeance
Vengeance is settled through nonvengeance' It would not be proper for me to transgress my father's words So he put his sword back in its scabbard
A second time A third time the thought occurred to Prince Dighavu This King Brahmadatta of Kasi has done us great harm
He has seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granaries
And it was because of him that my mother  father were killed
Now is my chance to wreak vengeance He drew his sword from his scabbard
But then he thought My father told me as he was about to die 'Don't my dear Dighavu be farsighted
Don't be nearsighted
For vengeance is not settled through vengeance
Vengeance is settled through nonvengeance' It would not be proper for me to transgress my father's words So once again he put his sword back in its scabbard
Then King Brahmadatta suddenly got up  frightened agitated unnerved alarmed
Prince Dighavu said to him Your majesty why have you gotten up suddenly  frightened agitated unnerved  alarmed
I say my young man Just now as I was dreaming Prince Dighavu  son of Dighiti king of Kasi  struck me down with a sword Then Prince Dighavu grabbing King Brahmadatta by the head with his left hand and drawing his sword from its scabbard with his right said I your majesty am that very Prince Dighavu son of Dighiti king of Kasi
You have done us great harm
You have seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granaries
And it was because of you that my mother  father were killed
Now is my chance to wreak vengeance
So King Brahmadatta dropping his head down to Prince Dighavu's feet said Grant me my life my dear Dighavu
Grant me my life my dear Dighavu
Who am I that I would dare grant life to your majesty
It is your majesty who should grant life to me
In that case my dear Dighavu you grant me my life and I grant you your life
Then King Brahmadatta and Prince Dighavu granted one another their lives and taking one another by the hands swore an oath to do one another no harm
Then King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu In that case my dear Dighavu harness the chariot
We will go on
Responding As you say your majesty Prince Dighavu harnessed the chariot and then said to King Brahmadatta Your chariot is harnessed your majesty
Now is the time for you to do as you see fit
Then King Brahmadatta mounted the chariot and Prince Dighavu drove it
He drove it in such a way that it was not long before they met up with the king's entourage
Then King Brahmadatta having entered Varanasi had his ministers  councilors convened and said to them I say then
If you were to see Prince Dighavu the son of Dighiti the king of Kasi what would you do to him
Different ministers said We would cut of his hands your majesty  We would cut off his feet your majesty  We would cut off his hands  feet your majesty  We would cut off his ears your majesty  We would cut off his nose your majesty  We would cut off his ears  nose your majesty  We would cut off his head your majesty
Then the king said This I say is Prince Dighavu the son of Dighiti the king of Kasi
You are not allowed to do anything to him
It was by him that my life was granted to me and it was by me that his life was granted to him
Then King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu What your father said to you as he was about to die  'Don't my dear Dighavu be farsighted
Don't be nearsighted
For vengeance is not settled through vengeance
Vengeance is settled through nonvengeance'  in reference to what did he say that
What my father said to me as he was about to die  'Don't be farsighted'  'Don't bear vengeance for a long time' is what he was saying to me as he was about to die
And what he said to me as he was about to die  'Don't be nearsighted'  'Don't be quick to break with a friend' is what he was saying to me as he was about to die
And what he said to me as he was about to die  'For vengeance is not settled through vengeance
Vengeance is settled through nonvengeance'  My mother  father were killed by your majesty
If I were to deprive your majesty of life those who hope for your majesty's wellbeing would deprive me of life
And those who hope for my wellbeing would deprive them of life
And in that way vengeance would not be settled by vengeance
But now I have been granted my life by your majesty and your majesty has been granted your life by me
And in this way vengeance has been settled by nonvengeance
That is what my father was saying to me as he was about to die
Then King Brahmadatta said Isn't it amazing
Isn't it astounding
How wise this Prince Dighavu is in that he can understand in full the meaning of what his father said in brief So he returned his father's troops vehicles lands armories  granaries and gave him his daughter in marriage
Such monks is the forbearance  gentleness of kings who wield the scepter who wield the sword
So now let your light shine forth so that you  who have gone forth in such a welltaught Dhamma  Discipline  will be their equal in forbearance  gentleness
'This Dhamma is for one who is modest not for one who is selfaggrandizing' Thus was it said
With reference to what was it said
There is the case where a monk being modest does not want it to be known that 'He is modest' Being content he does not want it to be known that 'He is content' Being reclusive he does not want it to be known that 'He is reclusive' His persistence being aroused he does not want it to be known that 'His persistence is aroused' His mindfulness being established he does not want it to be known that 'His mindfulness is established' His mind being centered he does not want it to be known that 'His mind is centered' Being endowed with discernment he does not want it to be known that 'He is endowed with discernment' Enjoying nonobjectification he does not want it to be known that 'He is enjoying nonobjectification' 'This Dhamma is for one who is modest not for one who is selfaggrandizing' Thus was it said
And with reference to this was it said

'This Dhamma is for one who is content not for one who is discontent' Thus was it said
With reference to what was it said
There is the case where a monk is content with any old robe cloth at all any old almsfood any old lodging any old medicinal requisites for curing sickness at all
'This Dhamma is for one who is content not for one who is discontent' Thus was it said
And with reference to this was it said
And how is a monk content
Just as a bird wherever it goes flies with its wings as its only burden so too is he content with a set of robes to provide for his body and alms food to provide for his hunger
Wherever he goes he takes only his barest necessities along
This is how a monk is content
There is the case where a monk is content with any old robe cloth at all
He speaks in praise of being content with any old robe cloth at all
He does not for the sake of robe cloth do anything unseemly or inappropriate
Not getting cloth he is not agitated
Getting cloth he uses it unattached to it uninfatuated guiltless seeing the drawbacks and discerning the escape from them
He does not on account of his contentment with any old robe cloth at all exalt himself or disparage others
In this he is diligent deft alert  mindful
This is said to be a monk standing firm in the ancient original traditions of the noble ones
Furthermore the monk is content with any old almsfood at all
He speaks in praise of being content with any old almsfood at all
He does not for the sake of almsfood do anything unseemly or inappropriate
Not getting almsfood he is not agitated
Getting almsfood he uses it unattached to it uninfatuated guiltless seeing the drawbacks and discerning the escape from them
He does not on account of his contentment with any old almsfood at all exalt himself or disparage others

On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Alavi on a spread of leaves by a cattle track in a simsapa forest
Then Hatthaka of Alavi out roaming  rambling for exercise saw the Blessed One sitting on a spread of leaves by the cattle track in the simsapa forest
On seeing him he went to him and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord I hope the Blessed One has slept in ease
Yes young man
I have slept in ease
Of those in the world who sleep in ease I am one
But cold lord is the winter night
The 'BetweentheEights' is a time of snowfall
Hard is the ground trampled by cattle hooves
Thin is the spread of leaves
Sparse are the leaves in the trees
Thin are your ochre robes
And cold blows the Verambha wind
Yet still the Blessed One says 'Yes young man
I have slept in ease
Of those in the world who sleep in ease I am one' In that case young man I will question you in return
Answer as you see fit
Now what do you think Suppose a householder or householder's son has a house with a gabled roof plastered inside  out draftfree with closefitting door  windows shut against the wind
Inside he has a horsehair couch spread with a longfleeced coverlet a white wool coverlet an embroidered coverlet a rug of kadalideer hide with a canopy above  red cushions on either side
And there a lamp would be burning and his four wives with their many charms would be attending to him
Would he sleep in ease or not
Or how does this strike you
Yes lord he would sleep in ease
Of those in the world who sleep in ease he would be one
But what do you think young man
Might there arise in that householder or householder's son any bodily fevers or fevers of mind born of passion so that  burned with those passionborn fevers  he would sleep miserably
Yes lord
As for those passionborn fevers  burned with which the householder or householder's son would sleep miserably  that passion has been abandoned by the Tathagata its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Therefore he sleeps in ease
Now what do you think young man
Might there arise in that householder or householder's son any bodily fevers or fevers of mind born of aversion so that  burned with those aversionborn fevers  he would sleep miserably
Yes lord
As for those aversionborn fevers  burned with which the householder or householder's son would sleep miserably  that aversion has been abandoned by the Tathagata its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Therefore he sleeps in ease
Now what do you think young man
Might there arise in that householder or householder's son any bodily fevers or fevers of mind born of delusion so that  burned with those delusionborn fevers  he would sleep miserably
Yes lord
As for those delusionborn fevers  burned with which the householder or householder's son would sleep miserably  that delusion has been abandoned by the Tathagata its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Therefore he sleeps in ease
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Anupiya in the Mango Orchard
Now at that time Ven
Bhaddiya Kaligodha on going to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling would repeatedly exclaim What bliss
What bliss A large number of monks heard Ven
Bhaddiya Kaligodha on going to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling repeatedly exclaim What bliss
What bliss and on hearing him the thought occurred to them There's no doubt but that Ven
Bhaddiya Kaligodha doesn't enjoy leading the holy life for when he was a householder he knew the bliss of kingship so that now on recollecting that he is repeatedly exclaiming 'What bliss
What bliss' They went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they told him Ven
Bhaddiya Kaligodha lord on going to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling repeatedly exclaims 'What bliss
What bliss' There's no doubt but that Ven
Bhaddiya Kaligodha doesn't enjoy leading the holy life for when he was a householder he knew the bliss of kingship so that now on recollecting that he is repeatedly exclaiming 'What bliss
What bliss' Then the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monk
In my name call Bhaddiya saying 'The Teacher calls you my friend' As you say lord the monk answered and having gone to Ven
Bhaddiya on arrival he said The Teacher calls you my friend
As you say my friend Ven
Bhaddiya replied
Then he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Bhaddiya that on going to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling you repeatedly exclaim 'What bliss
What bliss'
Yes lord
What meaning do you have in mind that you repeatedly exclaim 'What bliss
What bliss'
Before when I was a householder maintaining the bliss of kingship I had guards posted within and without the royal apartments within and without the city within and without the countryside
But even though I was thus guarded thus protected I dwelled in fear  agitated distrustful and afraid
But now on going alone to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling I dwell without fear unagitated confident and unafraid  unconcerned unruffled my wants satisfied with my mind like a wild deer
This is the meaning I have in mind that I repeatedly exclaim 'What bliss
What bliss' Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Now at that time a certain lay follower from Icchanangalaka had arrived in Savatthi on some business affairs
Having settled his affairs in Savatthi he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him At long last you have managed to come here
For a long time I have wanted to come see the Blessed One lord but being involved in one business affair after another I have not been able to do so
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
'This Dhamma is for one who is reclusive not for one who is entangled' Thus was it said
With reference to what was it said
There is the case where a monk when living in seclusion is visited by monks nuns lay men lay women kings royal ministers sectarians  their disciples
With his mind bent on seclusion tending toward seclusion inclined toward seclusion aiming at seclusion relishing renunciation he converses with them only as much as is necessary for them to take their leave
'This Dhamma is for one who is reclusive not for one in entanglement' Thus was it said
And with reference to this was it said
Now at that time a large number of monks after the meal on returning from their alms round had gathered at the meeting hall and were engaged in many kinds of bestial topics of conversation conversation about kings robbers  ministers of state armies alarms  battles food  drink clothing furniture garlands  scents relatives vehicles villages towns cities the countryside women  heroes the gossip of the street  the well tales of the dead tales of diversity the creation of the world  of the sea talk of whether things exist or not
Then the Blessed One emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the meeting hall and on arrival sat down on a seat made ready
As he was sitting there he addressed the monks For what topic of conversation are you gathered together here
In the midst of what topic of conversation have you been interrupted
Just now lord after the meal on returning from our alms round we gathered at the meeting hall and got engaged in many kinds of bestial topics of conversation conversation about kings robbers  ministers of state tales of diversity the creation of the world  of the sea talk of whether things exist or not
It isn't right monks that sons of good families on having gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life should get engaged in such topics of conversation ie conversation about kings robbers  ministers of state talk of whether things exist or not
There are these ten topics of conversation
Which ten
Talk on modesty on contentment on seclusion on nonentanglement on arousing persistence on virtue on concentration on discernment on release and on the knowledge  vision of release
These are the ten topics of conversation
If you were to engage repeatedly in these ten topics of conversation you would outshine even the sun  moon so mighty so powerful  to say nothing of the wanderers of other sects

Then a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they informed him Lord there is a certain monk by the name of Elder who lives alone and extols the virtues of living alone
Then the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monk
In my name call the monk named Elder saying 'The Teacher calls you my friend' As you say lord the monk answered and having gone to Ven
Elder on arrival he said The Teacher calls you my friend
As you say my friend Ven
Elder replied
Then he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Elder that you live alone and extol the virtues of living alone
Yes lord
But how do you live alone and extol the virtues of living alone
Lord alone I enter the village for alms alone I return alone I sit withdrawn alone I do walking meditation
That is how I live alone and extol the virtues of living alone
There is that way of living alone Elder
I don't say that there isn't
Still listen well to you how your living alone is perfected in its details and pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord Ven
Elder responded
The Blessed One said And how is living alone perfected in its details
There is the case where whatever is past is abandoned whatever is future is relinquished and any passion  desire with regard to states of being attained in the present is well subdued
That is how living alone is perfected in its details
That is what the Blessed One said
Having said it the One Wellgone further said this
'This Dhamma is for one whose persistence is aroused not for one who is lazy' Thus was it said
With reference to what was it said
There is the case where a monk keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualities
He is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities
'This Dhamma is for one whose persistence is aroused not for one who is lazy' Thus was it said
And with reference to this was it said
Furthermore the monk finds pleasure  delight in developing finds pleasure  delight in abandoning
He does not on account of his pleasure  delight in developing  abandoning exalt himself or disparage others
In this he is diligent deft alert  mindful
This is said to be a monk standing firm in the ancient original traditions of the noble ones
And how is a monk devoted to wakefulness
There is the case where a monk during the day sitting  pacing back  forth cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in check
During the first watch of the night sitting  pacing back  forth he cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in check
During the second watch of the night reclining on his right side he takes up the lion's posture one foot placed on top of the other mindful alert with his mind set on getting up
During the last watch of the night sitting  pacing back  forth he cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in check
This is how a monk is devoted to wakefulness

At that time the monks of Alavi were having huts built from their own begging  having no sponsors destined for themselves not to any standard measurement  that did not come to completion
They were continually begging continually hinting 'Give a man give labor give an ox give a wagon give a machete give an ax give an adz give a spade give a chisel give rushes give reeds give grass give clay' People harassed with the begging harassed with the hinting on seeing monks would feel apprehensive alarmed would run away would take another route face another direction close the door
Even on seeing cows they would run away imagining them to be monks
Then Ven
MahaKassapa having come out of his Rains retreat at Rajagaha set out for Alavi
After wandering by stages he arrived at Alavi where he stayed at the Chief Shrine
Then in the early morning having put on his robes and carrying his bowl  outer robe he went into Alavi for alms
The people on seeing Ven
MahaKassapa were apprehensive alarmed ran away took another route faced another direction closed the door
Then Ven
MahaKassapa having gone for alms after his meal returning from his alms round addressed the monks Before friends Alavi was a good place for alms
Alms food was easy to come by it was easy to maintain oneself by gleanings  patronage
But now Alavi is a bad place for alms
Alms food is hard to come by it isn't easy to maintain oneself by gleanings or patronage
What is the cause what is the reason why Alavi is now a bad place for alms Then the monks told Ven
MahaKassapa about that matter
Then the Blessed One having stayed at Rajagaha as long as he like left for Alavi
After wandering by stages he arrived at Alavi where he stayed at the Chief Shrine
Then Ven
MahaKassapa went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he told the Blessed One about that matter
Then the Blessed One because of that issue because of that affair had the community of monks convened and asked the Alavi monks They say that you are having huts built from your own begging  having no sponsors destined for yourselves not to any standard measurement  that do not come to completion that you are continually begging continually hinting 'Give a man give labor give an ox give a wagon give a machete give an ax give an adz give a spade give a chisel give rushes give reeds give grass give clay' that people harassed with the begging harassed with the hinting on seeing monks feel apprehensive alarmed run away take another route face another direction close the door that even on seeing cows they run away imagining them to be monks is this true
Yes lord
It is true
So the Blessed One rebuked them Misguided men it's unseemly unbecoming unsuitable and unworthy of a contemplative improper and not to be done Haven't I taught the Dhamma in many ways for the sake of dispassion and not for passion for unfettering and not for fettering for letting go and not for clinging
Yet here while I have taught the Dhamma for dispassion you set your heart on passion while I have taught the Dhamma for unfettering you set your heart on being fettered while I have taught the Dhamma for letting go you set your heart on clinging
Haven't I taught the Dhamma in various ways for the fading of passion the sobering of pride the subduing of thirst the destruction of attachment the severing of the round the depletion of craving dispassion cessation unbinding
Haven't I advocated abandoning sensual pleasures understanding sensual perceptions subduing sensual thirst destroying sensual preoccupations calming sensual fevers Misguided men this neither inspires faith in the faithless nor increases the faithful
Rather it inspires lack of faith in the faithless and wavering in some of the faithful
Then having given a Dhamma talk on what is seemly  becoming for monks he addressed the monks
Once monks there were two brothers who were hermits living on the banks of the Ganges
Then Manikantha the nagaking coming up out of the river Ganges went to the younger hermit and on arrival having encircled him seven times with his coils stood spreading his great hood above his head
Then the younger hermit through fear of the naga became thin wretched unattractive  jaundiced his body covered with veins
The elder brother seeing his younger brother thin his body covered with veins asked him 'Why are you thin your body covered with veins'
'Manikantha the nagaking coming up out of the river Ganges comes to me and on arrival having encircled me seven times with his coils stands spreading his great hood above my head
Through fear of the naga I have become thin my body covered with veins'
'But do you want that naga not to return'
'I want the naga not to return'
'Do you see that this naga has anything'
'I see that he is ornamented with a jewel on his throat'
'Then beg the naga for the jewel saying Good sir give me your jewel
I want your jewel'
Then Manikantha the nagaking coming up out of the river Ganges went to the younger hermit and on arrival stood to one side
As he was standing there the younger hermit said to him 'Good sir give me your jewel
I want your jewel' Then Manikantha the nagaking thinking 'The monk is begging for my jewel
The monk wants my jewel' hurried off
Then a second time the nagaking coming up out of the river Ganges went toward the younger hermit
Seeing him from afar the younger hermit said to him 'Good sir give me your jewel
I want your jewel' Then Manikantha the nagaking thinking 'The monk is begging for my jewel
The monk wants my jewel' hurried off
Then a third time the nagaking came up out of the river Ganges
Seeing him come up out of the river Ganges the younger hermit said to him 'Good sir give me your jewel
I want your jewel'
Then Manikantha the nagaking addressed the younger hermit with this verse
Then Manikantha the nagaking thinking 'The monk is begging for my jewel
The monk wants my jewel' went away
And having gone away he never again returned
Then the younger hermit from not seeing that lovely naga became even thinner more wretched unattractive  jaundiced his body cover with veins
His older brother saw that he was even thinner his body covered with veins and on seeing him he asked him 'Why are you even thinner your body covered with veins'
'It's from not seeing that lovely naga that I am even thinner my body covered with veins'
Then the elder hermit addressed the younger hermit with this verse
Monks begging is unpleasant hinting is unpleasant even to those who are common animals  how much more so to human beings
Once monks a monk lived on the slopes of the Himalayas in a forest grove
Not far from the grove was a broad lowlying marsh
A great flock of birds after feeding all day in the marsh went to roost in the grove at nightfall
The monk was annoyed by the noise of that flock of birds
So he came to me and on arrival having bowed down sat to one side
As he was sitting there I said to him 'I hope monk that you are well that you are getting along that you have completed your journey with little fatigue
Where have you come from
I am well lord am getting along and have completed my journey with little fatigue
Lord there is a large forest grove on the slopes of the Himalayas and not far from it is a broad lowlying marsh
A great flock of birds after feeding all day in the marsh goes to roost in the grove at nightfall
That is why I have come to see the Blessed One  because I am annoyed by the noise of that flock of birds'
'Monk you want those birds to go away for good'
'Yes lord I want them to go away for good'
'Then go back there enter the forest and in the first watch of the night make this announcement three times Listen to me good birds
I want a feather from everyone roosting in this forest
Each of you give me one feather In the second watch In the third watch of the night make this announcement three times Listen to me good birds
I want a feather from everyone roosting in this forest
Each of you give me one feather Then the flock of birds thinking 'The monk begs for a feather the monk wants a feather' left the forest
And after they were gone they never again returned
Monks begging is unpleasant hinting is unpleasant even to these common animals  how much more so to human beings
Once monks the father of Ratthapala the clansman addressed Ratthapala with this verse
Monks if Ratthapala the clansman can speak this way to his father why not a stranger to a stranger
 Sanghadisesa 
The Buddha's Awakening gave him among other things a new perspective on the uses and limitations of words
He had discovered a reality  the Deathless  that no words could describe
At the same time he discovered that the path to Awakening could be described although it involved a new way of seeing and conceptualizing the problem of suffering and stress
Because ordinary concepts were often poor tools for teaching the path he had to invent new concepts and to stretch preexisting words to encompass those concepts so that others could taste Awakening themselves
One of the new concepts most central to his teaching was that of the khandhas usually translated into English as aggregates Prior to the Buddha the Pali word khandha had very ordinary meanings A khandha could be a pile a bundle a heap a mass
It could also be the trunk of a tree
In his first sermon though the Buddha gave it a new psychological meaning introducing the term clingingkhandhas to summarize his analysis of the truth of stress and suffering
Throughout the remainder of his teaching career he referred to these psychological khandhas time and again
Their importance in his teachings has thus been obvious to every generation of Buddhists ever since
Less obvious though has been the issue of how they are important How should a meditator make use of the concept of the psychological khandhas
What questions are they meant to answer
The most common response to these questions is best exemplified by two recent scholarly books devoted to the subject
Both treat the khandhas as the Buddha's answer to the question What is a person To quote from the jacket of the first
If Buddhism denies a permanent self how does it perceive identity What we conventionally call a 'person' can be understood in terms of five aggregates the sum of which must not be taken for a permanent entity since beings are nothing but an amalgam of everchanging phenomena ithout a thorough understanding of the five aggregates we cannot grasp the liberation process at work within the individual who is after all simply an amalgam of the five aggregates
From the introduction of the other
The third key teaching is given by the Buddha in contexts when he is asked about individual identity when people want to know 'what am I' 'what is my real self'
The Buddha says that individuality should be understood in terms of a combination of phenomena which appear to form the physical and mental continuum of an individual life
In such contexts the human being is analysed into five constituents  the pañcakkhandhā
This understanding of the khandhas isn't confined to scholars
Almost any modern Buddhist meditation teacher would explain the khandhas in a similar way
And it isn't a modern innovation
It was first proposed at the beginning of the common era in the commentaries to the early Buddhist canons  both the Theravādin and the Sarvāstivādin which formed the basis for Mahāyāna scholasticism
However once the commentaries used the khandhas to define what a person is they spawned many of the controversies that have plagued Buddhist thinking ever since If a person is just khandhas then what gets reborn If a person is just khandhas and the khandhas are annihilated on reaching total nibbāna then isn't total nibbāna the annihilation of the person If a person is khandhas and khandhas are interrelated with other khandhas how can one person enter nibbāna without dragging everyone else along
A large part of the history of Buddhist thought has been the story of ingenious but unsuccessful attempts to settle these questions
It's instructive to note though that the Pali canon never quotes the Buddha as trying to answer them
In fact it never quotes him as trying to define what a person is at all
Instead it quotes him as saying that to define yourself in any way is to limit yourself and that the question What am I is best ignored
This suggests that he formulated the concept of the khandhas to answer other different questions
If as meditators we want to make the best use of this concept we should look at what those original questions were and determine how they apply to our practice
The canon depicts the Buddha as saying that he taught only two topics suffering and the end of suffering
A survey of the Pali discourses shows him using the concept of the khandhas to answer the primary questions related to those topics What is suffering
How is it caused
What can be done to bring those causes to an end
The Buddha introduced the concept of the khandhas in his first sermon in response to the first of these questions
His short definition of suffering was the five clingingkhandhas This fairly cryptic phrase can be fleshed out by drawing on other passages in the canon
The five khandhas are bundles or piles of form feeling perception fabrications and consciousness
None of the texts explain why the Buddha used the word khandha to describe these things
The meaning of tree trunk may be relevant to the pervasive fire imagery in the canon  nibbāna being extinguishing of the fires of passion aversion and delusion  but none of the texts explicitly make this connection
The common and explicit image is of the khandhas as burdensome
We can think of them as piles of bricks we carry on our shoulders
However these piles are best understood not as objects but as activities for an important passage defines them in terms of their functions
Form  which covers physical phenomena of all sorts both within and without the body  wears down or deforms Feeling feels pleasure pain and neither pleasure nor pain
Perception labels or identifies objects
Consciousness cognizes the six senses along with their objects
Of the five khandhas fabrication is the most complex
Passages in the canon define it as intention but it includes a wide variety of activities such as attention evaluation and all the active processes of the mind
It is also the most fundamental khandha for its intentional activity underlies the experience of form feeling etc in the present moment
Thus intention is an integral part of our experience of all the khandhas  an important point for this means that there is an element of intention in all suffering
This opens the possibility that suffering can be ended by changing our intentions  or abandoning them entirely  which is precisely the point of the Buddha's teachings
To understand how this happens we have to look more closely at how suffering arises  or in other words how khandhas become clingingkhandhas
When khandhas are experienced the process of fabrication normally doesn't simply stop there
If attention focuses on the khandhas' attractive features  beautiful forms pleasant feelings etc
 it can give rise to passion and delight
This passion and delight can take many forms but the most tenacious is the habitual act of fabricating a sense of me or mine identifying with a particular khandha or claiming possession of it
This sense of me and mine is rarely static
It roams like an amoeba changing its contours as it changes location
Sometimes expansive sometimes contracted it can view itself as identical with a khandha as possessing a khandha as existing within a khandha or as having a khandha existing within itself
At times feeling finite at other times infinite whatever shape it takes it's always unstable and insecure for the khandhas providing its food are simply activities and functions inconstant and insubstantial
In the words of the canon the khandhas are like foam like a mirage like the bubbles formed when rain falls on water
They're heavy only because the iron grip of trying to cling to them is burdensome
As long as we're addicted to passion and delight for these activities  as long as we cling to them  we're bound to suffer
The Buddhist approach to ending this clinging however is not simply to drop it
As with any addiction the mind has to be gradually weaned away
Before we can reach the point of no intention where we're totally freed from the fabrication of khandhas we have to change our intentions toward the khandhas so as to change their functions
Instead of using them for the purpose of constructing a self we use them for the purpose of creating a path to the end of suffering
Instead of carrying piles of bricks on our shoulders we take them off and lay them along the ground as pavement
The first step in this process is to use the khandhas to construct the factors of the noble eightfold path
For example Right Concentration Each of the four jhānas and the first three formless attainments are called perceptionattainments for they are based on maintaining a steady perception of the object of meditation
In the first jhāna for instance we maintain a steady perception focused on an aspect of form such as the breath and used directed thought and evaluation  which count as fabrications  to create feelings of pleasure and refreshment which we spread through the body
In the beginning it's normal that we experience passion and delight for these feelings and that consciousness follows along in line with them
This helps get us absorbed in mastering the skills of concentration
Once we've gained the sense of strength and wellbeing that comes from mastering these skills we can proceed to the second step attending to the drawbacks of even the refined khandhas we experience in concentration so as to undercut the passion and delight we might feel for them
Suppose that an archer or archer's apprentice were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay so that after a while he would become able to shoot long distances to fire accurate shots in rapid succession and to pierce great masses
In the same way there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perceptions fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration a void notself

The various ways of fostering dispassion are also khandhas khandhas of perception
A standard list includes the following the perception of inconstancy the perception of notself the perception of unattractiveness the perception of drawbacks the perception of abandoning the perception of distaste for every world the perception of the undesirability of all fabrications
One of the most important of these perceptions is that of notself
When the Buddha first introduced the concept of notself in his second sermon he also introduced a way of strengthening its impact with a series of questions based around the khandhas
Taking each khandha in turn he asked Is it constant or inconstant Inconstant
And is what is inconstant stressful or pleasurable Stressful
And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am' No
These questions show the complex role the khandhas play in this second step of the path
The questions themselves are khandhas  of fabrication  and they use the concept of the khandhas to deconstruct any passion and delight that might center on the khandhas and create suffering
Thus in this step we use khandhas that point out the drawbacks of the khandhas
If used unskillfully though these perceptions and fabrications can simply replace passion with its mirror image aversion
This is why they have to be based on the first step  the wellbeing constructed in jhāna  and coupled with the third step the perceptions of dispassion and cessation that incline the mind to the deathless This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding
In effect these are perceptionkhandhas that point the mind beyond all khandhas
The texts say that this threestep process can lead to one of two results
If after undercutting passion and delight for the khandhas the mind contains any residual passion for the perception of the deathless it will attain the third level of Awakening called nonreturn
If passion and delight are entirely eradicated though all clinging is entirely abandoned the intentions that fabricate khandhas are dropped and the mind totally released
The bricks of the pavement have turned into a runway and the mind has taken off
Into what
The authors of the discourses seem unwilling to say even to the extent of describing it as a state of existence nonexistence neither or both
As one of the discourses states the freedom lying beyond the khandhas also lies beyond the realm to which language properly applies
There is also the very real practical problem that any preconceived notions of that freedom if clung to as a perceptionkhandha could easily act as an obstacle to its attainment
Still there is also the possibility that if properly used such a perceptionkhandha might act as an aid on the path
So the discourses provide hints in the form of similes referring to total freedom as
Other passages mention a consciousness in this freedom  without feature or surface without end luminous all around  lying outside of time and space experienced when the six sense spheres stop functioning
In this it differs from the consciousnesskhandha which depends on the six sense spheres and can be described in such terms as near or far past present or future
Consciousness without feature is thus the awareness of Awakening
And the freedom of this awareness carries over even when the awakened person returns to ordinary consciousness
As the Buddha said of himself
Freed dissociated  released from form the Tathāgata dwells with unrestricted awareness
Freed dissociated  released from feeling perception fabrications consciousness birth aging death suffering  stress defilement the Tathāgata dwells with unrestricted awareness
This shows again the importance of bringing the right questions to the teachings on the khandhas
If you use them to define what you are as a person you tie yourself down to no purpose
The questions keep piling on
But if you use them to put an end to suffering your questions fall away and you're free
You never again cling to the khandhas and no longer need to use them to end your selfcreated suffering
As long as you're still alive you can employ the khandhas as needed for whatever skillful uses you see fit
After that you're liberated from all uses and needs including the need to find words to describe that freedom to yourself or to anyone else
There are some cases in which a person overcome with pain his mind exhausted grieves mourns laments beats his breast  becomes bewildered
Or one overcome with pain his mind exhausted comes to search outside 'Who knows a way or two to stop this pain' I tell you monks that stress results either in bewilderment or in search
Both formerly  now it is only stress that I describe and the cessation of stress
Ven
Sāriputta said Friends in foreign lands there are wise nobles  brahmans householders  contemplatives  for the people there are wise  discriminating  who will question a monk 'What is your teacher's doctrine
What does he teach'
Thus asked you should answer 'Our teacher teaches the subduing of passion  desire'
Having thus been answered there may be wise nobles  brahmans householders  contemplatives who will question you further 'And your teacher teaches the subduing of passion  desire for what'
Thus asked you should answer 'Our teacher teaches the subduing of passion  desire for form for feeling for perception for fabrications
Our teacher teaches the subduing of passion  desire for consciousness'
Having thus been answered there may be wise nobles  brahmans householders  contemplatives who will question you further 'And seeing what danger does your teacher teach the subduing of passion  desire for form for feeling for perception for fabrications
Seeing what danger does your teacher teach the subduing of passion  desire for consciousness'
Thus asked you should answer 'When one is not free from passion desire love thirst fever  craving for form then from any change  alteration in that form there arises sorrow lamentation pain grief  despair
When one is not free from passion for feeling for perception for fabrications When one is not free from passion desire love thirst fever  craving for consciousness then from any change  alteration in that consciousness there arise sorrow lamentation pain grief  despair
Seeing this danger our teacher teaches the subduing of passion  desire for form for feeling for perception for fabrications
Seeing this danger our teacher teaches the subduing of passion  desire for consciousness'
Having thus been answered there may be wise nobles  brahmans householders  contemplatives who will question you further 'And seeing what benefit does your teacher teach the subduing of passion  desire for form for feeling for perception for fabrications
Seeing what benefit does your teacher teach the subduing of passion  desire for consciousness'
Thus asked you should answer 'When one is free from passion desire love thirst fever  craving for form then with any change  alteration in that form there does not arise any sorrow lamentation pain grief or despair
When one is free from passion for feeling for perception for fabrications When one is free from passion desire love thirst fever  craving for consciousness then with any change  alteration in that consciousness there does not arise any sorrow lamentation pain grief or despair
Seeing this benefit our teacher teaches the subduing of passion  desire for form for feeling for perception for fabrications
Seeing this benefit our teacher teaches the subduing of passion  desire for consciousness'
And what is the middle way realized by the Tathāgata that  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
Precisely this Noble Eightfold Path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
Monks from an inconceivable beginning comes transmigration
A beginning point is not evident although beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating  wandering on
It's just as when a dog is tied by a leash to a post or stake If it walks it walks right around that post or stake
If it stands it stands right next to that post or stake
If it sits it sits right next to that post or stake
If it lies down it lies down right next to that post or stake
In the same way an uninstructed runofthemill person regards form as 'This is mine this is my self this is what I am' He regards feeling perception fabrications consciousness as 'This is mine this is my self this is what I am' If he walks he walks right around these five clingingaggregates
If he stands he stands right next to these five clingingaggregates
If he sits he sits right next to these five clingingaggregates
If he lies down he lies down right next to these five clingingaggregates
Thus one should reflect on one's mind with every moment 'For a long time has this mind been defiled by passion aversion  delusion' From the defilement of the mind are beings defiled
From the purification of the mind are beings purified
Monks have you ever seen a movingpicture show
Yes lord
That movingpicture show was created by the mind
And this mind is even more variegated than a movingpicture show
Thus one should reflect on one's mind with every moment 'For a long time has this mind been defiled by passion aversion  delusion' From the defilement of the mind are beings defiled
From the purification of the mind are beings purified
Monks I can imagine no one group of beings more variegated than that of common animals
Common animals are created by mind
And the mind is even more variegated than common animals
Thus one should reflect on one's mind with every moment 'For a long time has this mind been defiled by passion aversion  delusion' From the defilement of the mind are beings defiled
From the purification of the mind are beings purified
It's just as when  there being dye lac yellow orpiment indigo or crimson  a dyer or painter would paint the picture of a woman or a man complete in all its parts on a wellpolished panel or wall or on a piece of cloth in the same way an uninstructed runofthemill person when creating creates nothing but form feeling perception fabrications consciousness
At Sāvatthī
There the Blessed One said Monks I will teach you the five aggregates  the five clingingaggregates
Listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said Now what monks are the five aggregates
Whatever form is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the aggregate of form
Whatever feeling is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the aggregate of feeling
Whatever perception is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the aggregate of perception
Whatever fabrications are past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near those are called the aggregate of fabrication
Whatever consciousness is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the aggregate of consciousness
These are called the five aggregates
And what are the five clingingaggregates
Whatever form  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  is clingable offers sustenance and is accompanied with fermentation that is called form as a clingingaggregate
Whatever feeling  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  is clingable offers sustenance and is accompanied with fermentation that is called feeling as a clingingaggregate
Whatever perception  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  is clingable offers sustenance and is accompanied with fermentation that is called perception as a clingingaggregate
Whatever fabrications  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  are clingable offer sustenance and are accompanied with fermentation those are called fabrication as a clingingaggregate
Whatever consciousness  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  is clingable offers sustenance and is accompanied with fermentation that is called consciousness as a clingingaggregate
These are called the five clingingaggregates
And why do you call it 'form'
Because it is afflicted thus it is called 'form' Afflicted with what
With cold  heat  hunger  thirst with the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles
Because it is afflicted it is called form
And why do you call it 'feeling'
Because it feels thus it is called 'feeling' What does it feel
It feels pleasure it feels pain it feels neitherpleasurenorpain
Because it feels it is called feeling
And why do you call it 'perception'
Because it perceives thus it is called 'perception' What does it perceive
It perceives blue it perceives yellow it perceives red it perceives white
Because it perceives it is called perception
And why do you call them 'fabrications'
Because they fabricate fabricated things thus they are called 'fabrications' What do they fabricate into a fabricated thing
For the sake of formness they fabricate form as a fabricated thing
For the sake of feelingness they fabricate feeling as a fabricated thing
For the sake of perceptionhood For the sake of fabricationhood For the sake of consciousnesshood they fabricate consciousness as a fabricated thing
Because they fabricate fabricated things they are called fabrications

And why do you call it 'consciousness'
Because it cognizes thus it is called consciousness
What does it cognize
It cognizes what is sour bitter pungent sweet alkaline nonalkaline salty  unsalty
Because it cognizes it is called consciousness
Form
And what friends is form as a clingingaggregate
The four great existents and the form derived from them
And what are the four great existents
They are the earth property the liquid property the fire property  the wind property
And what is the earth property
The earth property can be either internal or external
What is the internal earth property
Whatever internal within oneself is hard solid  sustained head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs large intestines small intestines contents of the stomach feces or whatever else internal within oneself is hard solid  sustained This is called the internal earth property
And what is the liquid property
The liquid property may be either internal or external
What is the internal liquid property
Whatever internal belonging to oneself is liquid watery  sustained bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears skinoil saliva mucus fluid in the joints urine or whatever else internal within oneself is liquid watery  sustained This is called the internal liquid property
And what is the fire property
The fire property may be either internal or external
What is the internal fire property
Whatever internal belonging to oneself is fire fiery  sustained that by which is warmed aged  consumed with fever and that by which what is eaten drunk chewed  savored gets properly digested or whatever else internal within oneself is fire fiery  sustained This is called the internal fire property
And what is the wind property
The wind property may be either internal or external
What is the internal wind property
Whatever internal belonging to oneself is wind windy  sustained upgoing winds downgoing winds winds in the stomach winds in the intestines winds that course through the body inout breathing or whatever else internal within oneself is wind windy  sustained This is called the internal wind property
Feeling
And what is feeling
These six bodies of feeling  feeling born of eyecontact feeling born of earcontact feeling born of nosecontact feeling born of tonguecontact feeling born of bodycontact feeling born of intellectcontact this is called feeling
There are three kinds of feeling pleasant feeling painful feeling  neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling Whatever is experienced physically or mentally as pleasant  gratifying is pleasant feeling
Whatever is experienced physically or mentally as painful  hurting is painful feeling
Whatever is experienced physically or mentally as neither gratifying nor hurting is neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling Pleasant feeling is pleasant in remaining and painful in changing
Painful feeling is painful in remaining and pleasant in changing
Neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling is pleasant when conjoined with knowledge and painful when devoid of knowledge
Perception
And what is perception
These six bodies of perception  perception of form perception of sound perception of smell perception of taste perception of tactile sensation perception of ideas this is called perception
Fabrications
And what are fabrications
There are these six classes of intention intention aimed at sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations  ideas
These are called fabrications
Three kinds of fabrications meritorious fabrications demeritorious fabrications  imperturbable fabrications
And what lady are bodily fabrications what are verbal fabrications what are mental fabrications
Inout breathing is bodily bound up with the body therefore is it called a bodily fabrication
Having directed one's thought and evaluated one breaks into speech
Therefore directed thought  evaluation are called verbal fabrications
Perception  feeling are mental bound up with the mind
Therefore perception  feeling are called mental fabrications
Consciousness
And what is consciousness
These six bodies of consciousness eyeconsciousness earconsciousness noseconsciousness tongueconsciousness bodyconsciousness intellectconsciousness
This is called consciousness
Conditional Relations
From the origination of nutriment comes the origination of form
From the cessation of nutriment comes the cessation of form From the origination of contact comes the origination of feeling
From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling From the origination of contact comes the origination of perception
From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of perceptionFrom the origination of contact comes the origination of fabrications
From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of fabrications From the origination of nameform comes the origination of consciousness
From the cessation of nameform comes the cessation of consciousness
Lord what is the cause what the condition for the delineation of the aggregate of form
What is the cause what the condition for the delineation of the aggregate of feeling perception fabrications consciousness
Monk the four great existents are the cause the four great existents the condition for the delineation of the aggregate of form
Contact is the cause contact the condition for the delineation of the aggregate of feeling
Contact is the cause contact the condition for the delineation of the aggregate of perception
Contact is the cause contact the condition for the delineation of the aggregate of fabrications
Nameform is the cause nameform the condition for the delineation of the aggregate of consciousness
From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications
From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness
From consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameform
From nameform as a requisite condition come the six sense media
From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact
From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling
From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving
From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging sustenance
From clingingsustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming
From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth
From birth as a requisite condition then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair come into play
Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress  suffering
And what is feeling
These six are classes of feeling feeling born from eyecontact feeling born from earcontact feeling born from nosecontact feeling born from tonguecontact feeling born from bodycontact feeling born from intellectcontact
This is called feeling
And what is contact
These six are classes of contact eyecontact earcontact nosecontact tonguecontact bodycontact intellectcontact
This is called contact
And what are the six sense media
These six are sense media the eyemedium the earmedium the nosemedium the tonguemedium the bodymedium the intellectmedium
These are called the six sense media
And what is nameform
Feeling perception intention contact  attention This is called name
The four great elements and the form dependent on the four great elements This is called form
This name  this form are called nameform
And what is consciousness
These six are classes of consciousness eyeconsciousness earconsciousness noseconsciousness tongueconsciousness bodyconsciousness intellectconsciousness
This is called consciousness
And what are fabrications
These three are fabrications bodily fabrications verbal fabrications mental fabrications
These are called fabrications

And what is ignorance
Not knowing stress not knowing the origination of stress not knowing the cessation of stress not knowing the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is called ignorance
'From consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameform' Thus it has been said
And this is the way to understand how from consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameform
If consciousness were not to descend into the mother's womb would nameform take shape in the womb
No lord
If after descending into the womb consciousness were to depart would nameform be produced for this world
No lord
If the consciousness of the young boy or girl were to be cut off would nameform ripen grow and reach maturity
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for nameform ie consciousness
From nameform as a requisite condition comes consciousness' Thus it has been said
And this is the way to understand how from nameform as a requisite condition comes consciousness
If consciousness were not to gain a foothold in nameform would a comingintoplay of the origination of birth aging death and stress in the future be discerned
No lord
Thus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for consciousness ie nameform
This is the extent to which there is birth aging death passing away and rearising
This is the extent to which there are means of designation expression and delineation
This is the extent to which the dimension of discernment extends the extent to which the cycle revolves for the manifesting of this world  ie nameform together with consciousness
There are these four nutriments for the establishing of beings who have taken birth or for the support of those in search of a place to be born
Which four
Physical food gross or refined contact as the second consciousness the third and intellectual intention the fourth
These are the four nutriments for the establishing of beings or for the support of those in search of a place to be born
Where there is passion delight  craving for the nutriment of physical food consciousness lands there and grows
Where consciousness lands and grows nameform alights
Where nameform alights there is the growth of fabrications
Where there is the growth of fabrications there is the production of renewed becoming in the future
Where there is the production of renewed becoming in the future there is future birth aging  death together I tell you with sorrow affliction  despair
Just as  when there is dye lac yellow orpiment indigo or crimson  a dyer or painter would paint the picture of a woman or a man complete in all its parts on a wellpolished panel or wall or on a piece of cloth in the same way where there is passion delight  craving for the nutriment of physical food consciousness lands there  grows together I tell you with sorrow affliction  despair
Where there is no passion for the nutriment of physical food where there is no delight no craving then consciousness does not land there or grow Nameform does not alight There is no growth of fabrications There is no production of renewed becoming in the future
Where there is no production of renewed becoming in the future there is no future birth aging  death
That I tell you has no sorrow affliction or despair
Just as if there were a roofed house or a roofed hall having windows on the north the south or the east
When the sun rises and a ray has entered by way of the window where does it land
On the western wall lord
And if there is no western wall
On the ground lord
And if there is no ground
On the water lord
And if there is no water
It does not land lord
In the same way where there is no passion for the nutriment of physical food consciousness does not land or grow That I tell you has no sorrow affliction or despair
Monks there are these five means of propagation
Which five
Rootpropagation stempropagation jointpropagation cuttingpropagation  seedpropagation as the fifth
And if these five means of propagation are not broken not rotten not damaged by wind  sun mature and wellburied but there is no earth and no water would they exhibit growth increase  proliferation 
No lord
And if these five means of propagation are broken rotten damaged by wind  sun immature and poorlyburied but there is earth  water would they exhibit growth increase  proliferation
No lord
And if these five means of propagation are not broken not rotten not damaged by wind  sun mature and wellburied and there is earth  water would they exhibit growth increase  proliferation
Yes lord
Like the earth property monks is how the four standingspots for consciousness should be seen
Like the liquid property is how delight  passion should be seen
Like the five means of propagation is how consciousness together with its nutriment should be seen
Should consciousness when taking a stance stand attached to form supported by form established on form watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase  proliferation
Should consciousness when taking a stance stand attached to feeling supported by feeling established on feeling watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase  proliferation
Should consciousness when taking a stance stand attached to perception supported by perception established on perception watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase  proliferation
Should consciousness when taking a stance stand attached to fabrications supported by fabrications established on fabrications watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase  proliferation
Were someone to say 'I will describe a coming a going a passing away an arising a growth an increase or a proliferation of consciousness apart from form from feeling from perception from fabrications' that would be impossible
Monks I will teach you the burden the carrier of the burden the taking up of the burden and the casting off of the burden
Listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said And which is the burden
'The five clingingaggregates' it should be said
Which five
Form as a clingingaggregate feeling as a clingingaggregate perception as a clingingaggregate fabrications as a clingingaggregate consciousness as a clingingaggregate This monks is called the burden
And which is the carrier of the burden
'The person' it should be said
This venerable one with such a name such a clanname This is called the carrier of the burden
And which is the taking up of the burden
The craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion  delight relishing now here  now there  ie craving for sensual pleasure craving for becoming craving for nonbecoming This is called the taking up of the burden
And which is the casting off of the burden
The remainderless dispassioncessation renunciation relinquishment release  letting go of that very craving This is called the casting off of the burden
Monks there are four clinging
Which four
Sensualityclinging viewclinging habitpracticeclinging and doctrinesoftheselfclinging
An uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for people of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He assumes feeling to be the self
He assumes perception to be the self
He assumes fabrications to be the self
He assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
To what extent nanda does one delineate when delineating a self
Either delineating a self possessed of form  finite one delineates that 'My self is possessed of form  finite' Or delineating a self possessed of form  infinite one delineates that 'My self is possessed of form  infinite' Or delineating a self formless  finite one delineates that 'My self is formless  finite' Or delineating a self formless  infinite one delineates that 'My self is formless  infinite'
Now the one who when delineating a self delineates it as possessed of form  finite either delineates it as possessed of form  finite in the present or of such a nature that it will become possessed of form  finite or he believes that 'Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that way' This being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self possessed of form  finite obsesses him
If one stays obsessed with form monk that's what one is measured bylimited by
Whatever one is measured bylimited by that's how one is classified
If one stays obsessed with feeling perception fabrications
If one stays obsessed with consciousness that's what one is measured bylimited by
Whatever one is measured by limited by that's how one is classified
But if one doesn't stay obsessed with form monk that's not what one is measured bylimited by
Whatever one isn't measured bylimited by that's not how one is classified
If one doesn't stay obsessed with feeling perception fabrications
If one doesn't stay obsessed with consciousness that's not what one is measured bylimited by
Whatever one isn't measured bylimited by that's not how one is classified
'A being' lord
'A being' it's said
To what extent is one said to be 'a being'
Any desire passion delight or craving for form Rādha when one is caught up there tied up there one is said to be 'a being'
Any desire passion delight or craving for feeling perception fabrications
Any desire passion delight or craving for consciousness Rādha when one is caught up there tied up there one is said to be 'a being'

Māra
Sister Vajirā
Then Māra the Evil One  sad  dejected at realizing Vajirā the nun knows me  vanished right there
Then quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful mental qualities he enters  remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of seclusion
Just as if a skilled bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together sprinkling it again  again with water so that his ball of bath powder  saturated moistureladen permeated within  without  would nevertheless not drip even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of seclusion
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born of seclusion
Then with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhāna rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of concentration
Just like a lake with springwater welling up from within having no inflow from the east west north or south and with the skies supplying abundant showers time  again so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate  pervade suffuse  fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of concentration
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born of concentration
Then with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture
Just as in a lotus pond some of the lotuses born  growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated  pervaded suffused  filled with cool water from their roots to their tips and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water even so the monk permeates this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture
Then with the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of joys  distresses  he enters  remains in the fourth jhāna purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain
He sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness
Just as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awareness
Quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful mental qualities the monk enters  remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
His earlier perception of sensuality ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of seclusion And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases
Then with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations the monk enters  remains in the second jhāna rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
His earlier perception of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of seclusion ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of concentration And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases
And then with the fading of rapture the monk remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare 'Equanimous and mindful he has a pleasant abiding' His earlier perception of a refined truth of rapture  pleasure born of concentration ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of equanimity And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases
And then with the abandoning of pleasure and pain  as with the earlier disappearance of joys  distresses  the monk enters  remains in the fourth jhāna purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain
His earlier perception of a refined truth of equanimity ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of neither pleasure nor pain And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases
And then with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity 'Infinite space' the monk enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space
His earlier perception of a refined truth of neither pleasure nor pain ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases
And then with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space 'Infinite consciousness' the monk enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
His earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases
And then with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness thinking 'There is nothing' the monk enters  remains in the dimension of nothingness
His earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness ceases and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of nothingness And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases
I tell you the ending of the fermentations depends on the first jhāna the second jhāna the third the fourth the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness
I tell you the ending of the fermentations depends on the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
'I tell you the ending of the fermentations depends on the first jhāna' Thus it has been said
In reference to what was it said
There is the case where a monk secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities enters  remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perception fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness notself
He turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness 'This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding'
Suppose that an archer or archer's apprentice were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay so that after a while he would become able to shoot long distances to fire accurate shots in rapid succession and to pierce great masses
In the same way there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perception fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness notself
He turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness 'This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding'
Staying right there he reaches the ending of the fermentations
Or if not then through this very Dhammapassion this Dhammadelight and through the total wasting away of the five lower fetters  he is due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that world

'I tell you the ending of the fermentations depends on the first jhāna' Thus it was said and in reference to this was it said
'I tell you the ending of the fermentations depends on the dimension of the infinitude of space' Thus it has been said
In reference to what was it said
There is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity 'Infinite space' enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space
He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with feeling perception fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness notself
He turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness 'This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding'

Or if not then  through this very Dhammapassion this very Dhammadelight and from the total wasting away of the first five of the fetters  he is due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that world
'I tell you the ending of the fermentations depends on the dimension of the infinitude of space' Thus it was said and in reference to this was it said
Thus as far as the perceptionattainments go that is as far as gnosispenetration goes
As for these two dimensions  the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception  the attainment of the cessation of feeling  perception  I tell you that they are to be rightly explained by those monks who are meditators skilled in attaining skilled in attaining  emerging who have attained  emerged in dependence on them
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery
And on that occasion Ven
Girimānanda was diseased in pain severely ill
Then Ven
nanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord Ven
Girimānanda is diseased in pain severely ill
It would be good if the Blessed One would visit Ven
Girimānanda out of sympathy for him
nanda if you go to the monk Girimānanda and tell him ten perceptions it's possible that when he hears the ten perceptions his disease may be allayed
Which ten
The perception of inconstancy the perception of notself the perception of unattractiveness the perception of drawbacks the perception of abandoning the perception of dispassion the perception of cessation the perception of distaste for every world the perception of the undesirability of all fabrications mindfulness of inout breathing
And what is the perception of inconstancy
There is the case where a monk  having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building  reflects thus 'Form is inconstant feeling is inconstant perception is inconstant fabrications are inconstant consciousness is inconstant' Thus he remains focused on inconstancy with regard to the five aggregates
This nanda is called the perception of inconstancy
And what is the perception of notself
There is the case where a monk  having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building  reflects thus 'The eye is notself forms are notself the ear is notself sounds are notself the nose is notself aromas are notself the tongue is notself flavors are notself the body is notself flavors are notself the intellect is notself ideas are notself' Thus he remains focused on notselfness with regard to the six inner  outer sense media
This is called the perception of notself
And what is the perception of unattractiveness
There is the case where a monk ponders this very body  from the soles of the feet on up from the crown of the head on down surrounded by skin filled with all sorts of unclean things 'There is in this body hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin muscle tendons bones bone marrow spleen heart liver membranes kidneys lungs large intestines small intestines gorge feces gall phlegm lymph blood sweat fat tears oil saliva mucus oil in the joints urine' Thus he remains focused on unattractiveness with regard to this very body
This is called the perception of unattractiveness
And what is the perception of drawbacks
There is the case where a monk  having gone to the wilderness to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling  reflects thus 'This body has many pains many drawbacks
In this body many kinds of disease arise such as seeingdiseases hearingdiseases nosediseases tonguediseases bodydiseases headdiseases eardiseases mouthdiseases teethdiseases cough asthma catarrh fever aging stomachache fainting dysentery grippe cholera leprosy boils ringworm tuberculosis epilepsy skindiseases itch scab psoriasis scabies jaundice diabetes hemorrhoids fistulas ulcers diseases arising from bile from phlegm from the windproperty from combinations of bodily humors from changes in the weather from uneven care of the body from attacks from the result of kamma cold heat hunger thirst defecation urination' Thus he remains focused on drawbacks with regard to this body
This is called the perception of drawbacks
And what is the perception of abandoning
There is the case where a monk does not tolerate an arisen thought of sensuality
He abandons it destroys it dispels it  wipes it out of existence
He does not tolerate an arisen thought of illwill
He abandons it destroys it dispels it  wipes it out of existence
He does not tolerate an arisen thought of harmfulness
He abandons it destroys it dispels it  wipes it out of existence
He does not tolerate arisen evil unskillful mental qualities
He abandons them destroys them dispels them  wipes them out of existence
This is called the perception of abandoning
And what is the perception of dispassion
There is the case where a monk  having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building  reflects thus 'This is peace this is exquisite  the stilling of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion Unbinding' This is called the perception of dispassion
And what is the perception of cessation
There is the case where a monk  having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building  reflects thus 'This is peace this is exquisite  the stilling of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving cessation Unbinding' This is called the perception of cessation
And what is the perception of distaste for every world
There is the case where a monk abandoning any attachments clingings fixations of awareness biases or obsessions with regard to any world refrains from them and does not get involved
This is called the perception of distaste for every world
And what is the perception of the undesirability of all fabrications
There is the case where a monk feels horrified humiliated  disgusted with all fabrications
This is called the perception of the undesirability of all fabrications
And what is mindfulness of inout breathing
There is the case where a monk  having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building  sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore
Always mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
 Breathing in long he discerns 'I am breathing in long' or breathing out long he discerns 'I am breathing out long' Or breathing in short he discerns 'I am breathing in short' or breathing out short he discerns 'I am breathing out short' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication'
 He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to rapture' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to rapture' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to pleasure' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to pleasure' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to mental fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe in calming mental fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out calming mental fabrication'
 He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe in gladdening the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out gladdening the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe in steadying the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out steadying the mind
He trains himself 'I will breathe in releasing the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out releasing the mind'
 He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on inconstancy' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on inconstancy' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on dispassion' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on dispassion' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on cessation' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on cessation' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on relinquishment' This nanda is called mindfulness of inout breathing
Now nanda if you go to the monk Girimānanda and tell him these ten perceptions it's possible that when he hears these ten perceptions his disease may be allayed
Then Ven
nanda having learned these ten perceptions in the Blessed One's presence went to Ven
Girimānanda and told them to him
As Ven
Girimānanda heard these ten perceptions his disease was allayed
And Ven
Girimānanda recovered from his disease
That was how Ven
Girimānanda's disease was abandoned
What do you think monks If a person were to gather or burn or do as he likes with the grass twigs branches  leaves here in Jeta's Grove would the thought occur to you 'It's us that this person is gathering burning or doing with as he likes'
No lord
Why is that
Because those things are not our self nor do they belong to our self
Even so monks whatever isn't yours Let go of it
Your letting go of it will be for your longterm welfare  happiness
And what isn't yours
Form isn't yours Feeling isn't yours Perception Fabrications Consciousness isn't yours Let go of it
Your letting go of it will be for your longterm welfare  happiness
And just this noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of form ie right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
The fact that pleasure  happiness arise in dependence on form that is the allure of form
The fact that form is inconstant stressful subject to change that is the drawback of form
The subduing of desire  passion for form the abandoning of desire  passion for form that is the escape from form
Suppose there were a householder or householder's son  rich wealthy with many possessions  who was thoroughly wellguarded
Then suppose there came along a certain man desiring what was not his benefit desiring what was not his welfare desiring his loss of security desiring to kill him
The thought would occur to this man 'It would not be easy to kill this person by force
What if I were to sneak in and then kill him'
So he would go to the householder or householder's son and say 'May you take me on as a servant lord' With that the householder or householder's son would take the man on as a servant
Having been taken on as a servant the man would rise in the morning before his master go to bed in the evening only after his master doing whatever his master ordered always acting to please him speaking politely to him
Then the householder or householder's son would come to regard him as a friend  companion and would fall into his trust
When the man realizes 'This householder or householder's son trusts me' then encountering him in a solitary place he would kill him with a sharp knife
Now what do you think my friend Yamaka
When that man went to the householder or householder's son and said 'May you take me on as a servant lord' wasn't he even then a murderer
And yet although he was a murderer the householder or householder's son did not know him as 'my murderer' And when taken on as a servant he would rise in the morning before his master go to bed in the evening only after his master doing whatever his master ordered always acting to please him speaking politely to him wasn't he even then a murderer
And yet although he was a murderer the householder or householder's son did not know him as 'my murderer' And when he encountered him in a solitary place and killed him with a sharp knife wasn't he even then a murderer
And yet although he was a murderer the householder or householder's son did not know him as 'my murderer' Yes my friend
In the same way an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for people of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He assumes feeling to be the self
He assumes perception to be the self
He assumes fabrications to be the self
He assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
He doesn't discern fabricated form as it actually is present as 'fabricated form' He does not discern fabricated feeling He does not discern fabricated perception He does not discern fabricated fabrications He does not discern fabricated consciousness as it actually is present as 'fabricated consciousness'
He doesn't discern murderous form as it actually is present as 'murderous form' He does not discern murderous feeling He does not discern murderous perception He does not discern murderous fabrications He does not discern murderous consciousness as it actually is present as 'murderous consciousness'
He gets attached to form clings to form  determines it to be 'my self' He gets attached to feeling to perception to fabrications He gets attached to consciousness clings to consciousness  determines it to be 'my self' These five clingingaggregates  attached to clung to  lead to his longterm harm  suffering
And what lord is the cause what the requisite condition for the defilement of beings
How are beings defiled with cause with requisite condition
Mahāli if form were exclusively stressful  followed by stress infused with stress and not infused with pleasure  beings would not be infatuated with form
But because form is also pleasurable  followed by pleasure infused with pleasure and not infused with stress  beings are infatuated with form
Through infatuation they are captivated
Through captivation they are defiled
This is the cause this the requisite condition for the defilement of beings
And this is how beings are defiled with cause with requisite condition
If feeling were exclusively stressful
If perception were exclusively stressful
If fabrications were exclusively stressful
If consciousness were exclusively stressful  followed by stress infused with stress and not infused with pleasure  beings would not be infatuated with consciousness
But because consciousness is also pleasurable  followed by pleasure infused with pleasure and not infused with stress  beings are infatuated with consciousness
Through infatuation they are captivated
Through captivation they are defiled
This is the cause this the requisite condition for the defilement of beings
And this is how beings are defiled with cause with requisite condition
And what lord is the cause what the requisite condition for the purification of beings
How are beings purified with cause with requisite condition
Mahāli if form were exclusively pleasurable  followed by pleasure infused with pleasure and not infused with stress  beings would not be disenchanted with form
But because form is also stressful  followed by stress infused with stress and not infused with pleasure  beings are disenchanted with form
Through disenchantment they grow dispassionate
Through dispassion they are purified
This is the cause this the requisite condition for the purification of beings
And this is how beings are purified with cause with requisite condition
If feeling were exclusively pleasurable
If perception were exclusively pleasurable
If fabrications were exclusively pleasurable
If consciousness were exclusively pleasurable  followed by pleasure infused with pleasure and not infused with stress  beings would not be disenchanted with consciousness
But because consciousness is also stressful  followed by stress infused with stress and not infused with pleasure  beings are disenchanted with consciousness
Through disenchantment they grow dispassionate
Through dispassion they are purified
This is the cause this the requisite condition for the purification of beings
And this is how beings are purified with cause with requisite condition
Monks suppose there were a river flowing down from the mountains going far its current swift carrying everything with it and  holding on to both banks  kāsa grasses kusa grasses reeds bīraṇa grasses  trees were growing
Then a man swept away by the current would grab hold of the kāsa grasses but they would tear away and so from that cause he would come to disaster
He would grab hold of the kusa grasses the reeds the bīraṇa grasses the trees but they would tear away and so from that cause he would come to disaster
In the same way there is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for people of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
That form tears away from him and so from that cause he would come to disaster
He assumes feeling perception fabrications to be the self
He assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
That consciousness tears away from him and so from that cause he would come to disaster
There is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for people of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He is obsessed with the idea that 'I am form' or 'Form is mine' As he is obsessed with these ideas his form changes  alters and he falls into sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair over its change  alteration
He assumes feeling perception fabrications He assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
He is obsessed with the idea that 'I am consciousness' or 'Consciousness is mine' As he is obsessed with these ideas his consciousness changes  alters and he falls into sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair over its change  alteration
This householder is how one is afflicted in body and afflicted in mind
And how is one afflicted in body but unafflicted in mind
There is the case where a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for people of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma  doesn't assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He is not obsessed with the idea that 'I am form' or 'Form is mine' As he is not obsessed with these ideas his form changes  alters but he does not fall into sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair over its change  alteration
He doesn't assume feeling perception fabrications
He doesn't assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
He is not obsessed with the idea that 'I am consciousness' or 'Consciousness is mine' As he is not obsessed with these ideas his consciousness changes  alters but he does not fall into sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair over its change  alteration
This householder is how one is afflicted in body but unafflicted in mind  SN
Thus an instructed disciple of the noble ones reflects in this way 'I am now being chewed up by form
But in the past I was also chewed up by form in the same way I am now being chewed up by present form
And if I delight in future form then in the future I will be chewed up by form in the same way I am now being chewed up by present form' Having reflected in this way he becomes indifferent to past form does not delight in future form and is practicing for the sake of disenchantment dispassion and cessation with regard to present form
 ''I am now being chewed up by feeling perception fabrications consciousness
But in the past I was also chewed up by consciousness in the same way I am now being chewed up by present consciousness
And if I delight in future consciousness then in the future I will be chewed up by consciousness in the same way I am now being chewed up by present consciousness' Having reflected in this way he becomes indifferent to past consciousness does not delight in future consciousness and is practicing for the sake of disenchantment dispassion and cessation with regard to present consciousness
For a monk practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma what accords with the Dhamma is this that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to form that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to feeling that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to perception that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to fabrications that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to consciousness
As he keeps cultivating disenchantment with regard to form feeling perception fabrications consciousness he comprehends form feeling perception fabrications consciousness
As he comprehends form feeling perception fabrications consciousness he is totally released from form feeling perception fabrications consciousness
He is totally released from sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs
He is totally released I tell you from suffering  stress  SN
Monks I will teach you the phenomena to be comprehended as well as comprehension
Listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said And which are the phenomena to be comprehended
Form is a phenomenon to be comprehended
Feeling Perception Fabrications Consciousness is a phenomenon to be comprehended
These are called phenomena to be comprehended
And which is comprehension
Any ending of passion ending of aversion ending of delusion
This is called comprehension
I teach the Dhamma for the abandoning of the gross acquisition of a self the mindmade acquisition of a self the formless acquisition of a self such that when you practice it defiling mental qualities will be abandoned bright mental qualities will grow and you will enter  remain in the culmination  abundance of discernment having known  realized it for yourself in the here  now
If the thought should occur to you that when defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown and one enters  remains in the culmination  abundance of discernment having known  realized it for oneself in the here  now one's abiding is stressfulpainful you should not see it in that way
When defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown and one enters  remains in the culmination  abundance of discernment having known  realized it for oneself in the here  now there is joy rapture serenity mindfulness alertness and a pleasanthappy abiding
It's just as when boys or girls are playing with little sand castles
As long as they are not free from passion desire love thirst fever  craving for those little sand castles that's how long they have fun with those sand castles enjoy them treasure them feel possessive of them
But when they become free from passion desire love thirst fever  craving for those little sand castles then they smash them scatter them demolish them with their hands or feet and make them unfit for play
In the same way Rādha you too should smash scatter  demolish form and make it unfit for play
Practice for the ending of craving for form
You should smash scatter  demolish feeling and make it unfit for play
Practice for the ending of craving for feeling
You should smash scatter  demolish perception and make it unfit for play
Practice for the ending of craving for perception
You should smash scatter  demolish fabrications and make them unfit for play
Practice for the ending of craving for fabrications
You should smash scatter  demolish consciousness and make it unfit for play
Practice for the ending of craving for consciousness  because the ending of craving Rādha is Unbinding
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Ayojjhans on the banks of the Ganges River
There he addressed the monks Monks suppose that a large glob of foam were floating down this Ganges River and a man with good eyesight were to see it observe it  appropriately examine it
To him  seeing it observing it  appropriately examining it  it would appear empty void without substance for what substance would there be in a glob of foam
In the same way a monk sees observes  appropriately examines any form that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near
To him  seeing it observing it  appropriately examining it  it would appear empty void without substance for what substance would there be in form
Now suppose that in the autumn  when it's raining in fat heavy drops  a water bubble were to appear  disappear on the water and a man with good eyesight were to see it observe it  appropriately examine it
To him  seeing it observing it  appropriately examining it  it would appear empty void without substance for what substance would there be in a water bubble
In the same way a monk sees observes  appropriately examines any feeling that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near
To him  seeing it observing it  appropriately examining it  it would appear empty void without substance for what substance would there be in feeling
Now suppose that in the last month of the hot season a mirage were shimmering and a man with good eyesight were to see it observe it  appropriately examine it
To him  seeing it observing it  appropriately examining it  it would appear empty void without substance for what substance would there be in a mirage
In the same way a monk sees observes  appropriately examines any perception that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near
To him  seeing it observing it  appropriately examining it  it would appear empty void without substance for what substance would there be in perception
Now suppose that a man desiring heartwood in quest of heartwood seeking heartwood were to go into a forest carrying a sharp ax
There he would see a large banana tree straight young of enormous height
He would cut it at the root and having cut it at the root would chop off the top
Having chopped off the top he would peel away the outer skin
Peeling away the outer skin he wouldn't even find sapwood to say nothing of heartwood
Then a man with good eyesight would see it observe it  appropriately examine it
To him  seeing it observing it  appropriately examining it  it would appear empty void without substance for what substance would there be in a banana tree
In the same way a monk sees observes  appropriately examines any fabrications that are past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near
To him  seeing them observing them  appropriately examining them  they would appear empty void without substance for what substance would there be in fabrications
Now suppose that a magician or magician's apprentice were to display a magic trick at a major intersection and a man with good eyesight were to see it observe it  appropriately examine it
To him  seeing it observing it  appropriately examining it  it would appear empty void without substance for what substance would there be in a magic trick
In the same way a monk sees observes  appropriately examines any consciousness that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near
To him  seeing it observing it  appropriately examining it  it would appear empty void without substance for what substance would there be in consciousness
And what is the development of concentration that leads to the ending of the fermentations
There is the case where a monk remains focused on arising  falling away with reference to the five clingingaggregates 'Such is form such its origination such its disappearance
Such is feeling Such is perception Such are fabrications Such is consciousness such its origination such its disappearance' This is the development of concentration that leads to the ending of the fermentations
Furthermore the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five clingingaggregates
And how does he remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five clingingaggregates
There is the case where a monk 'Such is form such its origination such its disappearance
Such is feeling Such is perception Such are fabrications Such is consciousness such its origination such its disappearance'
In this way he remains focused internally on mental qualities in  of themselves or externally on mental qualities in  of themselves or both internally  externally on mental qualities in  of themselves
Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to mental qualities on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to mental qualities or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to mental qualities
Or his mindfulness that 'There are mental qualities' is maintained to the extent of knowledge  remembrance
And he remains independent unsustained by anything in the world
This is how a monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five clingingaggregates
Then Ven
Khemaka leaning on his staff went to the elder monks and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with them
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there the elder monks said to him Friend Khemaka this 'I am' of which you speak what do you say 'I am'
Do you say 'I am form' or do you say 'I am something other than form'
Do you say 'I am feeling perception fabrications consciousness' or do you say 'I am something other than consciousness''
This 'I am' of which you speak what do you say 'I am'
Friends it's not that I say 'I am form' nor do I say 'I am something other than form' It's not that I say 'I am feeling perception fabrications consciousness' nor do I say 'I am something other than consciousness' With regard to these five clingingaggregates 'I am' has not been overcome although I don't assume that 'I am this'
It's just like the scent of a blue red or white lotus If someone were to call it the scent of a petal or the scent of the color or the scent of a filament would he be speaking correctly
No friend
Then how would he describe it if he were describing it correctly
As the scent of the flower That's how he would describe it if he were describing it correctly
In the same way friends it's not that I say 'I am form' nor do I say 'I am other than form' It's not that I say 'I am feeling perception fabrications consciousness' nor do I say 'I am something other than consciousness' With regard to these five clingingaggregates 'I am' has not been overcome although I don't assume that 'I am this'
Friends even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters he still has with regard to the five clingingaggregates a lingering residual 'I am' conceit an 'I am' desire an 'I am' obsession
But at a later time he keeps focusing on the phenomena of arising  passing away with regard to the five clingingaggregates 'Such is form such its origin such its disappearance
Such is feeling Such is perception Such are fabrications Such is consciousness such its origin such its disappearance' As he keeps focusing on the arising  passing away of these five clingingaggregates the lingering residual 'I am' conceit 'I am' desire 'I am' obsession is fully obliterated
Just like a cloth dirty  stained Its owners give it over to a washerman who scrubs it with salt earth or lye or cowdung and then rinses it in clear water
Now even though the cloth is clean  spotless it still has a lingering residual scent of salt earth or lye or cowdung
The washerman gives it to the owners the owners put it away in a scentinfused wicker hamper and its lingering residual scent of salt earth lye or cowdung is fully obliterated
In the same way friends even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters he still has with regard to the five clingingaggregates a lingering residual 'I am' conceit an 'I am' desire an 'I am' obsession
But at a later time he keeps focusing on the phenomena of arising  passing away with regard to the five clingingaggregates 'Such is form such its origin such its disappearance
Such is feeling Such is perception Such are fabrications Such is consciousness such its origin such its disappearance' As he keeps focusing on the arising  passing away of these five clingingaggregates the lingering residual 'I am' conceit 'I am' desire 'I am' obsession is fully obliterated
When this was said the elder monks said to Ven
Khemaka We didn't crossexamine Ven
Khemaka with the purpose of troubling him just that Ven
Khemaka is capable of declaring the Blessed One's message teaching it describing it setting it forth revealing it explaining it making it plain  just as he has in fact declared it taught it described it set it forth revealed it explained it made it plain
That is what Ven
Khemaka said
Gratified the elder monks delighted in his words
And while this explanation was being given the minds of sixtysome monks through no clinging were fully released from fermentations  as was Ven
Khemaka's
Suppose there were a king or king's minister who had never heard the sound of a lute before
He might hear the sound of a lute and say 'What my good men is that sound  so delightful so tantalizing so intoxicating so ravishing so enthralling' They would say 'That sire is called a lute whose sound is so delightful so tantalizing so intoxicating so ravishing so enthralling' Then he would say 'Go  fetch me that lute' They would fetch the lute and say 'Here sire is the lute whose sound is so delightful so tantalizing so intoxicating so ravishing so enthralling' He would say 'Enough of your lute
Fetch me just the sound' Then they would say 'This lute sire is made of numerous components a great many components
It's through the activity of numerous components that it sounds that is in dependence on the body the skin the neck the frame the strings the bridge and the appropriate human effort
Thus it is that this lute  made of numerous components a great many components  sounds through the activity of numerous components'
Then the king would split the lute into ten pieces a hundred pieces
Having split the lute into ten pieces a hundred pieces he would shave it to splinters
Having shaved it to splinters he would burn it in a fire
Having burned it in a fire he would reduce it to ashes
Having reduced it to ashes he would winnow it before a high wind or let it be washed away by a swiftflowing stream
He would then say 'A sorry thing this lute  whatever a lute may be  by which people have been so thoroughly tricked  deceived'
In the same way a monk investigates form however far form may go
He investigates feeling perception fabrications consciousness however far consciousness may go
As he is investigating form feeling perception fabrications consciousness however far consciousness may go any thoughts of 'me' or 'mine' or 'I am' do not occur to him
To what extent nanda does one assume when assuming a self
Assuming feeling to be the self one assumes that 'Feeling is my self' 'Feeling is not my self My self is oblivious ' 'Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious to feeling but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feeling'
Now one who says 'Feeling is my self' should be addressed as follows 'There are these three feelings my friend  feelings of pleasure feelings of pain and feelings of neither pleasure nor pain
Which of these three feelings do you assume to be the self
At a moment when a feeling of pleasure is sensed no feeling of pain or of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed
Only a feeling of pleasure is sensed at that moment
At a moment when a feeling of pain is sensed no feeling of pleasure or of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed
Only a feeling of pain is sensed at that moment
At a moment when a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed no feeling of pleasure or of pain is sensed
Only a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed at that moment
Now a feeling of pleasure is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessation
A feeling of pain is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessation
A feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessation
Having sensed a feeling of pleasure as 'my self' then with the cessation of one's very own feeling of pleasure 'my self' has perished
Having sensed a feeling of pain as 'my self' then with the cessation of one's very own feeling of pain 'my self' has perished
Having sensed a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain as 'my self' then with the cessation of one's very own feeling of neither pleasure nor pain 'my self' has perished
Thus he assumes assuming in the immediate present a self inconstant entangled in pleasure and pain subject to arising and passing away he who says 'Feeling is my self' Thus in this manner nanda one does not see fit to assume feeling to be the self
As for the person who says 'Feeling is not the self My self is oblivious' he should be addressed as follows 'My friend where nothing whatsoever is sensed at all would there be the thought I am' No lord
Thus in this manner nanda one does not see fit to assume that 'Feeling is not my self My self is oblivious'
As for the person who says 'Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feeling' he should be addressed as follows 'My friend should feelings altogether and every way stop without remainder then with feeling completely not existing owing to the cessation of feeling would there be the thought I am' No lord
Thus in this manner nanda one does not see fit to assume that 'Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feeling'
Now nanda in as far as a monk does not assume feeling to be the self nor the self as oblivious nor that 'My self feels in that my self is subject to feeling' then not assuming in this way he does not cling to anything in the world
Not clinging he is not agitated
Unagitated he is totally unbound right within
He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
If anyone were to say with regard to a monk whose mind is thus released that 'The Tathāgata exists after death' is his view that would be mistaken that 'The Tathāgata does not exist after death' that 'The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death' that 'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death' is his view that would be mistaken
Why
Having directly known the extent of designation and the extent of the objects of designation the extent of expression and the extent of the objects of expression the extent of description and the extent of the objects of description the extent of discernment and the extent of the objects of discernment the extent to which the cycle revolves Having directly known that the monk is released
The view that 'Having directly known that the monk released does not see does not know' would be mistaken
Then Ven
Anurādha went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now I was staying not far from the Blessed One in a wilderness hut
Then a large number of wandering sectarians came and said to me 'Friend Anurādha the Tathāgata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described with these four positions The Tathāgata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death'
When this was said I said to them 'Friends the Tathāgata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described otherwise than with these four positions The Tathāgata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death'
When this was said the wandering sectarians said to me 'This monk is either a newcomer not long gone forth or else an elder who is foolish  inexperienced' So addressing me as they would a newcomer or a fool they got up from their seats and left
Then not long after they had left this thought occurred to me 'If I am questioned again by those wandering sectarians how will I answer in such a way that will I speak in line with what the Blessed One has said will not misrepresent the Blessed One with what is unfactual will answer in line with the Dhamma and no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing me' What do you think Anurādha Is form constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful
Stressful lord
And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
 Is feeling constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
 Is perception constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
 Are fabrications constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
What do you think Anurādha Is consciousness constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful
Stressful lord
And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
What do you think Anurādha Do you regard form as the Tathāgata
No lord
Do you regard feeling as the Tathāgata
No lord
Do you regard perception as the Tathāgata
No lord
Do you regard fabrications as the Tathāgata
No lord
Do you regard consciousness as the Tathāgata
No lord
What do you think Anurādha Do you regard the Tathāgata as being in form Elsewhere than form In feeling Elsewhere than feeling In perception Elsewhere than perception In fabrications Elsewhere than fabrications In consciousness Elsewhere than consciousness
No lord
What do you think Do you regard the Tathāgata as formfeelingperceptionfabricationsconsciousness
No lord
Do you regard the Tathāgata as that which is without form without feeling without perception without fabrications without consciousness
No lord
And so Anurādha  when you can't pin down the Tathāgata as a truth or reality even in the present life  is it proper for you to declare 'Friends the Tathāgata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described otherwise than with these four positions The Tathāgata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death'
No lord
Very good Anurādha
Very good
Both formerly  now it's only stress that I describe and the cessation of stress

And so my friend Yamaka  when you can't pin down the Tathāgata as a truth or reality even in the present life  is it proper for you to declare 'As I understand the Teaching explained by the Blessed One a monk with no more fermentations on the breakup of the body is annihilated perishes  does not exist after death'
Previously my friend Sāriputta I did foolishly hold that evil supposition
But now having heard your explanation of the Dhamma I have abandoned that evil supposition and have broken through to the Dhamma
Then friend Yamaka how would you answer if you are thus asked A monk a worthy one with no more fermentations what is he on the breakup of the body after death
Thus asked I would answer 'Form is inconstant Feeling Perception Fabrications Consciousness is inconstant
That which is inconstant is stressful
That which is stressful has ceased and gone to its end  SN
Now at that moment this line of thinking appeared in the awareness of a certain monk So  form is notself feeling is notself perception is notself fabrications are notself consciousness is notself
Then what self will be touched by the actions done by what is notself
Then the Blessed One realizing with his awareness the line of thinking in that monk's awareness addressed the monks It's possible that a senseless person  immersed in ignorance overcome with craving  might think that he could outsmart the Teacher's message in this way 'So  form is notself feeling is notself perception is notself fabrications are notself consciousness is notself
Then what self will be touched by the actions done by what is notself' Now monks haven't I trained you in counterquestioning with regard to this  that topic here  there
What do you think Is form constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful
Stressful lord
And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
 Is feeling constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
 Is perception constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
 Are fabrications constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
What do you think monks Is consciousness constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful
Stressful lord
And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
Thus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Any feeling whatsoever
Any perception whatsoever
Any fabrications whatsoever
Any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness
Disenchanted he becomes dispassionate
Through dispassion he is fully released
With full release there is the knowledge 'Fully released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world' That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
And while this explanation was being given the minds of sixty monks through no clinging were fully released from fermentations

Consciousness without feature without end luminous all around is not experienced through the solidity of earth the liquidity of water the radiance of fire the windiness of wind the divinity of devas the allness of the All

Freed dissociated  released from ten things Bāhuna the Tathāgata dwells with unrestricted awareness
Which ten
Freed dissociated  released from form the Tathāgata dwells with unrestricted awareness
Freed dissociated  released from feeling from perception from fabrications from consciousness from birth from aging from death from suffering  stress Freed dissociated  released from defilement the Tathāgata dwells with unrestricted awareness
Just as a red blue or white lotus born in the water and growing in the water rises up above the water and stands with no water adhering to it in the same way the Tathāgata  freed dissociated  released from these ten things  dwells with unrestricted awareness
Meditation teaches you the power of your perceptions
You come to see how the labels you apply to things the images with which you visualize things have a huge influence over what you see how they can weigh you down with suffering and stress
As the meditation develops though it gives you the tools you need to gain freedom from that influence
In the beginning when you first notice the power of perception you can easily feel overwhelmed by how pervasive it is
Suppose you're focusing on the breath
There comes a point when you begin to wonder whether you're focusing on the breath itself or on your idea of the breath
Once this question arises the normal reaction is to try to get around the idea to the raw sensation behind it
But if you're really sensitive as you do this you'll notice that you're simply replacing one caricature of the breath with another more subtle one
Even the raw sensation of breathing is shaped by how you conceptualize raw sensation
No matter how hard you try to pin down an unfiltered experience of breathing you still find it shaped by your idea of what breathing actually is
The more you pursue the reality of the breath the more it recedes like a mirage
The trick here is to turn this fact to your advantage
After all you're not meditating to get to the breath
You're meditating to understand the processes leading to suffering so that you can put an end to them
The way you relate to your perceptions is part of these processes so that's what you want to see
You have to treat your experience of the breath not as an end in itself but as a tool for understanding the role of perception in creating suffering and stress
You do this by deperception questioning your assumptions about breathing deliberately changing those assumptions and observing what happens as a result
Now without the proper context deperception could easily wander off into random abstractions
So you take the practice of concentration as your context providing deperception both with a general direction and with particular tasks that force it to bump up against the operative assumptions that actually shape your experience of the present
The general direction lies in trying to bring the mind to deeper and more longlasting levels of stillness so as to eliminate more and more subtle levels of stress
You're not trying to prove which perceptions of the breath depict it most truly but simply which ones work best in which situations for eliminating stress
The objectivity you're looking for is not the objectivity of the breath but the objectivity of cause and effect
The particular tasks that teach you these lessons begin with the task of trying to get the mind to stay comfortably focused for long periods of time on the breath  and right there you run into two operative assumptions What does it mean to breathe
What does it mean to be focused
It's common to think of the breath as the air passing in and out through the nose and this can be a useful perception to start with
Use whatever blatant sensations you associate with that perception as a means of establishing mindfulness developing alertness and getting the mind to grow still
But as your attention gets more refined you may find that level of breath becoming too faint to detect
So try thinking of the breath instead as the energy flow in the body as a full body process
Then make that experience as comfortable as possible
If you feel any blockage or obstruction in the breathing see what you can do to dissolve those feelings
Are you doing anything to create them
If you can catch yourself creating them then it's easy to let them dissolve
And what would make you create them aside from your preconceived notions of how the mechanics of breathing have to work
So question those notions Where does the breath come into the body
Does it come in only through the nose and mouth
Does the body have to pull the breath in
If so which sensations do the pulling
Which sensations get pulled
Where does the pulling begin
And where is the breath pulled from
Which parts have the breath and which ones don't
When you feel a sensation of blockage which side of the sensation are you on
These questions may sound strange but many times your preverbal assumptions about the body are strange as well
Only when you confront them headon with strange questions can you bring them to light
And only when you see them clearly can you replace them with alternative concepts
So once you catch yourself breathing uncomfortably in line with a particular assumption turn it around to see what sensations the new assumption highlights
Try staying with those sensations as long as you can to test them
If compared to your earlier sensations associated with the breath they're easier to stay with if they provide a more solid and spacious grounding for concentration the assumption that drew them to your attention is a useful new tool in your meditation
If the new sensations aren't helpful in that way you can throw the new tool aside
For example if you have a sense of being on one side of a blockage try thinking of being on the other side
Try being on both
Think of the breath as coming into the body not through the nose or mouth but through the middle of the chest the back of the neck every pore of your skin any spot that helps reduce the felt need to push and pull
Or start questioning the need to push and pull at all
Do you feel that your immediate experience of the body is of the solid parts and that they have to manage the mechanics of breathing which is secondary
What happens if you conceive your immediate experience of the body in a different way as a field of primary breath energy with the solidity simply a label attached to certain aspects of the breath
Whatever you experience as a primary body sensation think of it as already breath without your having to do anything more to it
How does that affect the level of stress and strain in the breathing
And what about the act of staying focused
How do you conceive that
Is it behind the breath
Surrounded by breath
To what extent does your mental picture of focusing help or hinder the ease and solidity of your concentration
For instance you may find that you think of the mind as being in one part of the body and not in others
What do you do when you focus attention on another part
Does the mind leave its home base  say in the head  to go there or does the other part have to be brought into the head
What kind of tension does this create
What happens if you think of awareness already being in that other part
What happens when you turn things around entirely instead of the mind's being in the body see what stress is eliminated when you think of the body as surrounded by a preexisting field of awareness
When you ask questions like this and gain favorable results the mind can settle down into deeper and deeper levels of solidity
You eliminate unnecessary tension and stress in your focus finding ways of feeling more and more at home at ease in the experience of the present
Once the mind is settled down give it time to stay there
Don't be in too great a hurry to move on
Here the questions are Which parts of the process were necessary to focus in
Which can now be let go
Which do you have to hold onto in order to maintain this focus Tuning into the right level of awareness is one process staying there is another
When you learn how to maintain your sense of stillness try to keep it going in all situations
What do you discover gets in the way
Is it your own resistance to disturbances
Can you make your stillness so porous that disturbances can go through without running into anything without knocking your center off balance
As you get more and more absorbed in exploring these issues concentration becomes less a battle against disturbance and more an opportunity for inner exploration
And without even thinking about them you're developing the four bases of success the desire to understand things the persistence that keeps after your exploration the close attention you're paying to cause and effect and the ingenuity you're putting into framing the questions you ask
All these qualities contribute to concentration help it get settled get solid get clear
At the same time they foster discernment
The Buddha once said that the test for a person's discernment is how he or she frames a question and tries to answer it
Thus to foster discernment you can't simply stick to preset directions in your meditation
You have to give yourself practice in framing questions and testing the karma of those questions by looking for their results
Ultimately when you reach a perception of the breath that allows the sensations of inandout breathing to grow still you can start questioning more subtle perceptions of the body
It's like tuning into a radio station
If your receiver isn't precisely tuned to the frequency of the signal the static interferes with the subtleties of whatever is being transmitted
But when you're precisely tuned every nuance comes through
The same with your sensation of the body when the movements of the breath grow still the more subtle nuances of how perception interacts with physical sensation come to the fore
The body seems like a mist of atomic sensations and you can begin to see how your perceptions interact with that mist
To what extent is the shape of the body inherent in the mist
To what extent is it intentional  something added
What happens when you drop the intention to create that shape
Can you focus on the space between the droplets in the mist
What happens then
Can you stay there
What happens when you drop the perception of space and focus on the knowing
Can you stay there
What happens when you drop the oneness of the knowing
Can you stay there
What happens when you try to stop labeling anything at all
As you settle into these more formless states it's important that you not lose sight of your purpose in tuning into them
You're here to understand suffering not to overinterpret what you experience
Say for instance that you settle into an enveloping sense of space or consciousness
From there it's easy to assume that you've reached the primordial awareness the ground of being from which all things emerge to which they all return and which is essentially untouched by the whole process of emerging and returning
You might take descriptions of the Unconditioned and apply them to what you're experiencing
If you're abiding in a state of neither perception nor nonperception it's easy to see it as a nonabiding devoid of distinctions between perceiver and perceived for mental activity is so attenuated as to be virtually imperceptible
Struck with the apparent effortlessness of the state you may feel that you've gone beyond passion aversion and delusion simply by regarding them as unreal
If you latch onto an assumption like this you can easily think that you've reached the end of the path before your work is really done
Your only protection here is to regard these assumptions as forms of perception and to dismantle them as well
And here is where the four noble truths prove their worth as tools for dismantling any assumption by detecting the stress that accompanies it
Ask if there's still some subtle stress in the concentration that has become your dwelling place
What goes along with that stress
What vagrant movements in the mind are creating it
What persistent movements in the mind are creating it
You have to watch for both
In this way you come face to face with the perceptions that keep even the most subtle states of concentration going
And you see that even they are stressful
If you replace them with other perceptions though you'll simply exchange one type of stress for another
It's as if your ascending levels of concentration have brought you to the top of a flag pole
You look down and see aging illness and death coming up the pole in pursuit
You've exhausted all the options that perception can offer so what are you going to do
You can't just stay where you are
Your only option is to release your grip
And if you're letting go fully you let go of gravity too
Although early Buddhism is widely believed to take a negative attitude toward the body the texts of the Pali canon do not support this belief
They approach the body both in its positive role as an object of meditation to develop mindfulness concentration and the mental powers based on concentration and in its negative role as an object for unskillful states of mind
Even in its negative role the body is not the culprit the problem is the mind's attachment to the body
Once the body can be used in its positive role to develop mindfulness and concentration those mental qualities can be used to free the mind of its attachments to the body
Then as many a modern meditation master has noted the mind and body can live in peace
This study guide focuses on the primary sutta in the Pali canon dealing with the contemplation of the body The Discourse on Mindfulness Immersed in the Body
The first section The Context establishes the general principles underlying the practice of mindfulness immersed in the body showing why attachment to the body is considered problematic in the first place
The second section presents the sutta itself
The remaining sections expand on points raised in the sutta Section Three dealing with the advantages of practicing mindfulness immersed in the body and Section Four expanding on the drawbacks of attachment to the body
Because the sutta treats the body both as an object of mindfulness and as an object of jhana or mental absorption it raises questions concerning the relationship between these two mental qualities in the practice of meditation
There is a widespread belief that they represent two sides of a great divide in Buddhist meditation practice with mindfulness on one side joined with vipassana and discernment and jhana on the other side joined with samatha
The Pali canon however presents a much more complex picture of the interrelated roles these mental qualities in the pursuit of Awakening
And in fact the Great Divide picture of Buddhist meditation practice conflates what the Pali canon treats as three separate albeit related issues the relationship between samatha and vipassana the relationship between mindfulness and jhana and the relationship between jhana and discernment
To convey the original parameters of these issues this study guide ends with three sections focused on precisely these relationships
For supplemental reading on the issues of jhana mindfulness and insight see the articles The Path of Mindfulness and Concentration and One Tool Among Many

Monks I lived in refinement utmost refinement total refinement
My father even had lotus ponds made in our palace one where redlotuses bloomed one where white lotuses bloomed one where blue lotuses bloomed all for my sake
I used no sandalwood that was not from Varanasi
My turban was from Varanasi as were my tunic my lower garments  my outer cloak
A white sunshade was held over me day  night to protect me from cold heat dust dirt  dew
I had three palaces one for the cold season one for the hot season one for the rainy season
During the four months of the rainy season I was entertained in the rainyseason palace by minstrels without a single man among them and I did not once come down from the palace
Whereas the servants workers  retainers in other people's homes are fed meals of lentil soup  broken rice in my father's home the servants workers  retainers were fed wheat rice and meat
Even though I was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me 'When an untaught runofthemill person himself subject to aging not beyond aging sees another who is aged he is horrified humiliated  disgusted oblivious to himself that he too is subject to aging not beyond aging
If I  who am subject to aging not beyond aging  were to be horrified humiliated  disgusted on seeing another person who is aged that would not be fitting for me' As I noticed this the young person's intoxication with youth entirely dropped away
Even though I was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me 'When an untaught runofthemill person himself subject to illness not beyond illness sees another who is ill he is horrified humiliated  disgusted oblivious to himself that he too is subject to illness not beyond illness
And if I  who am subject to illness not beyond illness  were to be horrified humiliated  disgusted on seeing another person who is ill that would not be fitting for me' As I noticed this the healthy person's intoxication with health entirely dropped away
Even though I was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me 'When an untaught runofthemill person himself subject to death not beyond death sees another who is dead he is horrified humiliated  disgusted oblivious to himself that he too is subject to death not beyond death
And if I  who am subject to death not beyond death  were to be horrified humiliated  disgusted on seeing another person who is dead that would not be fitting for me' As I noticed this the living person's intoxication with life entirely dropped away
Monks there are these three forms of intoxication
Which three
Intoxication with youth intoxication with health intoxication with life
Drunk with the intoxication of youth an uninstructed runofthemill person engages in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct
Having engaged in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct he  on the breakup of the body after death  reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
Drunk with the intoxication of health an uninstructed runofthemill person engages in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct
Having engaged in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct he  on the breakup of the body after death  reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
Drunk with the intoxication of life an uninstructed runofthemill person engages in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct
Having engaged in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct he  on the breakup of the body after death  reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell 
Before my Awakening when I was still an unawakened Bodhisatta being subject myself to birth aging illness death sorrow and defilement I sought what was subject to birth aging illness death sorrow and defilement
The thought occurred to me 'Why am I being subject myself to birthdefilement seeking what is subject to birthdefilement
What if Iwere to seek the unborn unaging unailing undying sorrowless undefiled unsurpassed security from bondage Unbinding'
I tell you friend that it isn't possible by traveling to know or see or reach a far end of the cosmos where one doesn't take birth age die pass away or reappear
But at the same time I tell you that there is no making an end of suffering  stress without reaching the end of the cosmos
Yet it is just within this fathomlong body with its perception  intellect that I declare that there is the cosmos the origination of the cosmos the cessation of the cosmos and the path of practice leading to the cessation of the cosmos
Now this is the noble truth of stress Birth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are stressful association with the unbeloved is stressful separation from the loved is stressful not getting what is wanted is stressful
In short the five clingingaggregates are stressful
And this is the noble truth of the origination of stress the craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion  delight relishing now here  now there  ie craving for sensuality craving for becoming craving for nonbecoming
And this is the noble truth of the cessation of stress the remainderless fading  cessation renunciation relinquishment release  letting go of that very craving
And this is the noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress precisely this Noble Eightfold Path  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
'This noble truth of stress is to be comprehended' 'This noble truth of the origination of stress is to be abandoned' 'This noble truth of the cessation of stress is to be directly experienced' 'This noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress is to be developed' 
And what monks is right view
Knowledge with regard to stress knowledge with regard to the origination of stress knowledge with regard to the stopping of stress knowledge with regard to the way of practice leading to the stopping of stress This monks is called right view
And what monks is right resolve
Being resolved on renunciation on freedom from ill will on harmlessness This monks is called right resolve
And what monks is right speech
Abstaining from lying abstaining from divisive speech abstaining from abusive speech abstaining from idle chatter This monks is called right speech
And what monks is right action
Abstaining from taking life abstaining from stealing abstaining from sexual intercourse This monks is called right action
And what monks is right livelihood
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones having abandoned dishonest livelihood keeps his life going with right livelihood This monks is called right livelihood
And what monks is right effort
There is the case where a monk generates desire endeavors activates persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the nonarising of evil unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen
He generates desire endeavors activates persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the abandonment of evil unskillful qualities that have arisen
He generates desire endeavors activates persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen
He generates desire endeavors activates persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the maintenance nonconfusion increase plenitude development  culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen This monks is called right effort
And what monks is right mindfulness
There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent aware  mindful  putting away greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent aware  mindful  putting away greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent aware  mindful  putting away greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent aware  mindful  putting away greed  distress with reference to the world
This monks is called right mindfulness
And what monks is right concentration
There is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
This monks is called right concentration
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Now at that time a large number of monks after the meal on returning from their alms round had gathered at the meeting hall when this discussion arose Isn't it amazing friends
Isn't it astounding
 the extent to which mindfulness immersed in the body when developed  pursued is said by the Blessed One who knows who sees  the worthy one rightly selfawakened  to be of great fruit  great benefit And this discussion came to no conclusion
Then the Blessed One emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the meeting hall and on arrival sat down on a seat made ready
As he was sitting there he addressed the monks For what topic are you gathered together here
And what was the discussion that came to no conclusion
Just now lord after the meal on returning from our alms round we gathered at the meeting hall when this discussion arose 'Isn't it amazing friends
Isn't it astounding
 the extent to which mindfulness immersed in the body when developed  pursued is said by the Blessed One who knows who sees  the worthy one rightly selfawakened  to be of great fruit  great benefit' This was the discussion that had come to no conclusion when the Blessed One arrived
And how is mindfulness immersed in the body developed how is it pursued so as to be of great fruit  great benefit
There is the case where a monk  having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building  sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore
Always mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
Breathing in long he discerns that he is breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns that he is breathing out long
Or breathing in short he discerns that he is breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns that he is breathing out short
He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the entire body and to breathe out sensitive to the entire body
He trains himself to breathe in calming bodily fabrication and to breathe out calming bodily fabrication
And as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centered
This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body
Furthermore when walking the monk discerns 'I am walking' When standing he discerns 'I am standing' When sitting he discerns 'I am sitting' When lying down he discerns 'I am lying down' Or however his body is disposed that is how he discerns it
And as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centered
This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body
Furthermore when going forward  returning he makes himself fully alert when looking toward  looking awaywhen bending  extending his limbswhen carrying his outer cloak his upper robe  his bowlwhen eating drinking chewing  savoringwhen urinating  defecatingwhen walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking  remaining silent he makes himself fully alert
And as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centered
This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body
Furthermore the monk reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet on up from the crown of the head on down surrounded by skin and full of various kinds of unclean things 'In this body there are head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs large intestines small intestines gorge feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears skinoil saliva mucus fluid in the joints urine' Just as if a sack with openings at both ends were full of various kinds of grain  wheat rice mung beans kidney beans sesame seeds husked rice  and a man with good eyesight pouring it out were to reflect 'This is wheat
This is rice
These are mung beans
These are kidney beans
These are sesame seeds
This is husked rice' in the same way the monk reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet on up from the crown of the head on down surrounded by skin and full of various kinds of unclean things 'In this body there are head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs large intestines small intestines gorge feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears skinoil saliva mucus fluid in the joints urine' And as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centered
This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body
Furthermore the monk contemplates this very body  however it stands however it is disposed  in terms of properties 'In this body there is the earth property the liquid property the fire property  the wind property' Just as a skilled butcher or his apprentice having killed a cow would sit at a crossroads cutting it up into pieces the monk contemplates this very body  however it stands however it is disposed  in terms of properties 'In this body there is the earth property the liquid property the fire property  the wind property' And as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centered
This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body
Furthermore as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground  one day two days three days dead  bloated livid  festering he applies it to this very body 'This body too Such is its nature such is its future such its unavoidable fate'
Or again as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground picked at by crows vultures  hawks by dogs hyenas  various other creaturesa skeleton smeared with flesh  blood connected with tendonsa fleshless skeleton smeared with blood connected with tendonsa skeleton without flesh or blood connected with tendonsbones detached from their tendons scattered in all directions  here a hand bone there a foot bone here a shin bone there a thigh bone here a hip bone there a back bone here a rib there a breast bone here a shoulder bone there a neck bone here a jaw bone there a tooth here a skullthe bones whitened somewhat like the color of shellspiled up more than a year olddecomposed into a powder He applies it to this very body 'This body too Such is its nature such is its future such its unavoidable fate'
And as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centered
This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body
Furthermore quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal
Just as if a skilled bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together sprinkling it again  again with water so that his ball of bath powder  saturated moistureladen permeated within  without  would nevertheless not drip even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of withdrawal
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal
And as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centered
This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body
Then with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of composure
Just like a lake with springwater welling up from within having no inflow from the east west north or south and with the skies supplying abundant showers time  again so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate  pervade suffuse  fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of composure
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born of composure
And as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centered
This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body
Then with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture
Just as in a lotus pond some of the lotuses born  growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated  pervaded suffused  filled with cool water from their roots to their tips and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water even so the monk permeates this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture
And as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centered
This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body
Then with the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain
He sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness
Just as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awareness
And as he remains thus heedful ardent  resolute any memories  resolves related to the household life are abandoned and with their abandoning his mind gathers  settles inwardly grows unified  centered
This is how a monk develops mindfulness immersed in the body
Monks whoever develops  pursues mindfulness immersed in the body encompasses whatever skillful qualities are on the side of clear knowing
Just as whoever pervades the great ocean with his awareness encompasses whatever rivulets flow down into the ocean in the same way whoever develops  pursues mindfulness immersed in the body encompasses whatever skillful qualities are on the side of clear knowing

 Through the ending of the mental effluents he remains in the effluentfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having known and made them manifest for himself right in the here  now
Monks for one in whom mindfulness immersed in the body is cultivated developed pursued given a means of transport given a grounding steadied consolidated  wellundertaken these ten benefits can be expected
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
Now how is mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination
There is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore
Always mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
 Breathing in long he discerns 'I am breathing in long' or breathing out long he discerns 'I am breathing out long' Or breathing in short he discerns 'I am breathing in short' or breathing out short he discerns 'I am breathing out short' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication'
 He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to rapture and to breathe out sensitive to rapture
He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to pleasure and to breathe out sensitive to pleasure
He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication and to breathe out sensitive to mental fabrication
He trains himself to breathe in calming mental fabrication and to breathe out calming mental fabrication
 He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the mind and to breathe out sensitive to the mind
He trains himself to breathe in satisfying the mind and to breathe out satisfying the mind
He trains himself to breathe in steadying the mind and to breathe out steadying the mind
He trains himself to breathe in releasing the mind and to breathe out releasing the mind
 He trains himself to breathe in focusing on inconstancy and to breathe out focusing on inconstancy
He trains himself to breathe in focusing on dispassion and to breathe out focusing on dispassion
He trains himself to breathe in focusing on cessation and to breathe out focusing on cessation
He trains himself to breathe in focusing on relinquishment and to breathe out focusing on relinquishment
 Now on whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns that he is breathing in long or breathing out long discerns that he is breathing out long or breathing in short discerns that he is breathing in short or breathing out short discerns that he is breathing out short trains himself to breathe in out sensitive to the entire body trains himself to breathe inout calming bodily fabrication On that occasion the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
I tell you monks that this  the inout breath  is classed as a body among bodies which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
 On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe inout sensitive to rapture trains himself to breathe inout sensitive to pleasure trains himself to breathe inout sensitive to mental fabrication trains himself to breathe inout calming mental fabrication On that occasion the monk remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
I tell you monks that this  close attention to inout breaths  is classed as a feeling among feelings which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
 On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe inout sensitive to the mind trains himself to breathe inout satisfying the mind trains himself to breathe inout steadying the mind trains himself to breathe inout releasing the mind On that occasion the monk remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
I don't say that there is mindfulness of inout breathing in one of confused mindfulness and no alertness which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
 On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe inout focusing on inconstancy trains himself to breathe inout focusing on dispassion trains himself to breathe inout focusing on cessation trains himself to breathe inout focusing on relinquishment On that occasion the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
He who sees clearly with discernment the abandoning of greed  distress is one who oversees with equanimity which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
This is how mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination
Ananda Lord does the Blessed One have direct experience of going to the Brahma world by means of supranormal power with a mindmade body
The Buddha Yes Ananda'
Ananda But does the Blessed One also have direct experience of going to the Brahma world by means of supranormal power with this very physical body composed of the four great elements
The Buddha Yes Ananda It's awesome lord and amazing that the Blessed One should have direct experience of going to the Brahma world by means of supranormal power with a mindmade body and of going to the Brahma world by means of supranormal power with this very physical body composed of the four great elements
The Buddha Tathagatas are both awesome Ananda and endowed with awesome qualities
They are both amazing and endowed with amazing qualities
Whenever the Tathagata merges his body with his mind and his mind with his body and remains having alighted on the perception of ease and buoyancy with regard to the body then his body becomes lighter more pliant more malleable  more radiant
Just as when an iron ball heated all day becomes lighter more pliant more malleable  more radiant in the same way whenever the Tathagata merges his body with his mind and his mind with his body and remains having alighted on the perception of ease and buoyancy with regard to the body then his body becomes lighter more pliant more malleable  more radiant
Now whenever the Tathagata merges his body with his mind and his mind with his body and remains having alighted on the perception of ease and buoyancy with regard to the body then his body rises effortlessly from the earth up into the sky
He then experiences manifold supranormal powers
Having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one
He appears
He vanishes
He goes unimpeded through walls ramparts  mountains as if through space
He dives in  out of the earth as if it were water
He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land
Sitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged bird
With his hand he touches  strokes even the sun  moon so mighty  powerful
He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds
Just as a tuft of cotton seed or a ball of thistle down lightly wafted by the wind rises effortlessly from the earth up into the sky in the same way whenever the Tathagata concentrates his body in his mind  his mind in his body and remains having alighted on the perception of ease and buoyancy then his body rises effortlessly from the earth up into the sky
He then experiences manifold supranormal powerseven as far as the Brahma worlds
Once a hawk suddenly swooped down on a quail and seized it
Then the quail as it was being carried off by the hawk lamented 'O just my bad luck and lack of merit that I was wandering out of my proper range and into the territory of others
If only I had kept to my proper range today to my own ancestral territory this hawk would have been no match for me in battle'
'But what is your proper range' the hawk asked
'What is your own ancestral territory'
'A newly plowed field with clumps of earth all turned up'
So the hawk without bragging about its own strength without mentioning its own strength let go of the quail
'Go quail but even when you have gone there you won't escape me'
Then the quail having gone to a newly plowed field with clumps of earth all turned up and climbing up on top of a large clump of earth stood taunting the hawk 'Now come and get me you hawk
Now come and get me you hawk'
So the hawk without bragging about its own strength without mentioning its own strength folded its two wings and suddenly swooped down toward the quail
When the quail knew 'The hawk is coming at me full speed' it slipped behind the clump of earth and right there the hawk shattered its breast
This is what happens to anyone who wanders into what is not his proper range and is the territory of others
For this reason you should not wander into what is not your proper range and is the territory of others
In one who wanders into what is not his proper range and is the territory of others Mara gains an opening Mara gains a foothold
And what for a monk is not his proper range and is the territory of others
The five strands of sensuality
Which five
Forms cognizable by the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
Sounds cognizable by the earSmells cognizable by the noseTastes cognizable by the tongueTactile sensations cognizable by the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
These for a monk are not his proper range and are the territory of others
Wander monks in what is your proper range your own ancestral territory
In one who wanders in what is his proper range his own ancestral territory Mara gains no opening Mara gains no foothold
And what for a monk is his proper range his own ancestral territory
The four frames of reference
Which four
There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelings in  of themselves mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
This for a monk is his proper range his own ancestral territory
There are in the Himalayas the king of mountains difficult uneven areas where neither monkeys nor human beings wander
There are difficult uneven areas where monkeys wander but not human beings
There are level stretches of land delightful where both monkeys and human beings wander
In such spots hunters set a tar trap in the monkeys' tracks in order to catch some monkeys
Those monkeys who are not foolish or careless by nature when they see the tar trap will keep their distance
But any monkey who is foolish  careless by nature comes up to the tar trap and grabs it with its paw which then gets stuck there
Thinking 'I'll free my paw' he grabs it with his other paw
That too gets stuck
Thinking 'I'll free both of my paws' he grabs it with his foot
That too gets stuck
Thinking 'I'll free both of my paws and my foot' he grabs it with his other foot
That too gets stuck
Thinking 'I'll free both of my paws and my feet as well' he grabs it with his mouth
That too gets stuck
So the monkey snared in five ways lies there whimpering having fallen on misfortune fallen on ruin a prey to whatever the hunter wants to do with him
Then the hunter without releasing the monkey skewers him right there picks him up and goes off as he likes
This is what happens to anyone who wanders into what is not his proper range and is the territory of others
For this reason you should not wander into what is not your proper range and is the territory of others
There is the case where a monk seeing a form with the eye is obsessed with pleasing forms is repelled by unpleasing forms and remains with bodymindfulness unestablished with limited awareness
He does not discern as it actually is present the awarenessrelease the discernmentrelease where any evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainder

Just as if a person catching six animals of different ranges of different habitats were to bind them with a strong rope
Catching a snake he would bind it with a strong rope
Catching a crocodilea birda doga hyenaa monkey he would bind it with a strong rope
Binding them all with a strong rope and tying a knot in the middle he would set chase to them
Then those six animals of different ranges of different habitats would each pull toward its own range  habitat
The snake would pull thinking 'I'll go into the anthill' The crocodile would pull thinking 'I'll go into the water' The bird would pull thinking 'I'll fly up into the air' The dog would pull thinking 'I'll go into the village' The hyena would pull thinking 'I'll go into the charnel ground' The monkey would pull thinking 'I'll go into the forest' And when these six animals became internally exhausted they would submit they would surrender they would come under the sway of whichever among them was the strongest
In the same way when a monk whose mindfulness immersed in the body is undeveloped  unpursued the eye pulls toward pleasing forms while unpleasing forms are repellent
The ear pulls toward pleasing soundsthe nose pulls toward pleasing smellsthe tongue pulls toward pleasing tastesthe body pulls toward pleasing tactile sensationsthe intellect pulls toward pleasing ideas while unpleasing ideas are repellent
This monks is lack of restraint
And what is restraint
There is the case where a monk seeing a form with the eye is not obsessed with pleasing forms is not repelled by unpleasing forms and remains with bodymindfulness established with immeasurable awareness
He discerns as it actually is present the awarenessrelease the discernmentrelease where all evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainder

Just as if a person catching six animals of different ranges of different habitats were to bind them with a strong ropeand tether them to a strong post or stake
Then those six animals of different ranges of different habitats would each pull toward its own range  habitat And when these six animals became internally exhausted they would stand sit or lie down right there next to the post or stake
In the same way when a monk whose mindfulness immersed in the body is developed  pursued the eye does not pull toward pleasing forms and unpleasing forms are not repellent
The ear does not pull toward pleasing soundsthe nose does not pull toward pleasing smellsthe tongue does not pull toward pleasing tastesthe body does not pull toward pleasing tactile sensationsthe intellect does not pull toward pleasing ideas and unpleasing ideas are not repellent
This monks is restraint
The 'strong post or stake' is a term for mindfulness immersed in the body
Thus you should train yourselves 'We will develop mindfulness immersed in the body
We will pursue it give it a means of transport give it a grounding
We will steady it consolidate it and set about it properly' That's how you should train yourselves
Suppose monks that a large crowd of people comes thronging together saying 'The beauty queen
The beauty queen' And suppose that the beauty queen is highly accomplished at singing  dancing so that an even greater crowd comes thronging saying 'The beauty queen is singing
The beauty queen is dancing' Then a man comes along desiring life  shrinking from death desiring pleasure  abhorring pain
They say to him 'Now look here mister
You must take this bowl filled to the brim with oil and carry it on your head in between the great crowd  the beauty queen
A man with a raised sword will follow right behind you and wherever you spill even a drop of oil right there will he cut off your head' Now what do you think monks Will that man not paying attention to the bowl of oil let himself get distracted outside
No lord
I have given you this parable to convey a meaning
The meaning is this The bowl filled to the brim with oil stands for mindfulness immersed in the body
Thus you should train yourselves 'We will develop mindfulness immersed in the body
We will pursue it give it a means of transport give it a grounding
We will steady it consolidate it and set about it properly' That's how you should train yourselves
Whoever pervades the great ocean with his awareness encompasses whatever rivulets flow down into the ocean
In the same way whoever develops  pursues mindfulness immersed in the body encompasses whatever skillful qualities are on the side of clear knowing
When one thing is practiced  pursued the body is calmed the mind is calmed thinking  evaluating are stilled and all qualities on the side of clear knowing go to the culmination of their development
Which one thing
Mindfulness immersed in the body
When one thing is practiced  pursued ignorance is abandoned clear knowing arises the conceit 'I am' is abandoned latent tendencies are uprooted fetters are abandoned
Which one thing
Mindfulness immersed in the body
Those who do not taste mindfulness of the body do not taste the Deathless
Those who taste mindfulness of the body taste the Deathless
Those who are heedless of mindfulness of the body are heedless of the Deathless
Those who comprehend mindfulness of the body comprehend the Deathless
 AN 
The body is aflame
Tactile sensations are aflame
Bodily consciousness is aflame
Bodily contact is aflame
And whatever there is that arises in dependence on bodily contact  experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain  that too is aflame
Aflame with what
Aflame with the fire of passion the fire of aversion the fire of delusion
Aflame I tell you with birth aging  death with sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs
Seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with the body disenchanted with tactile sensations disenchanted with bodily consciousness disenchanted with bodily contact
And whatever there is that arises in dependence on bodily contact experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain With that too he grows disenchanted
Disenchanted he becomes dispassionate
Through dispassion he is fully released
With full release there is the knowledge 'Fully released' He discerns that 'Birth is depleted the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
Then Janussonin the brahman went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One I am of the view  opinion that there is no one who subject to death is not afraid or in terror of death

This too is a person who subject to death is afraid  in terror of death
These brahman are four people who subject to death are afraid  in terror of death
And who is the person who subject to death is not afraid or in terror of death

Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotama  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monks
May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life
And what is the perception of drawbacks
There is the case where a monk  having gone to the wilderness to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling  reflects thus 'This body has many pains many drawbacks
In this body many kinds of disease arise such as seeingdiseases hearingdiseases nosediseases tonguediseases bodydiseases headdiseases eardiseases mouthdiseases teethdiseases cough asthma catarrh fever aging stomachache fainting dysentery grippe cholera leprosy boils ringworm tuberculosis epilepsy skindiseases itch scab psoriasis scabies jaundice diabetes hemorrhoids fistulas ulcers diseases arising from bile from phlegm from the windproperty from combinations of bodily humors from changes in the weather from uneven care of the body from attacks from the result of kamma cold heat hunger thirst defecation urination' Thus he remains focused on drawbacks with regard to this body
