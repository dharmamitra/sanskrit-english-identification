So it is that the purity of desire hatred and delusion
I will cross the ocean of existence Infested with the monsters of harmful views and the demons of affliction
One should extend ones own arms To the middle of her waist
If someone wishing to go forth approaches any of you
he is undeterred and has perfected all the conduct of a bodhisattva
likewise Mañjuśrī this Dharma discourse burns away all afflictions
When he saw the perfection of the bhikṣus body he became extremely enraged
An exclusive nirvāṇa Would mean deceiving sentient beings How shall I liberate them From the endless ocean of existence
The infinite wisdom of the three times And the excellent six perfections
Mañjuśrī when the Blessed One prophesied that the god Ratnavara will fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood and become the ThusGone worthy perfect Buddha Ratnavyūha
The air element follows in the wake of consciousness
it is because it transcends the world and is exalted over the world systems
One should apply an ointment of umbrella tree with honey to the eyes
You will awaken inconceivable trillions of creatures Who are asleep due to their afflictions
For all those afflicted with disturbing emotions
Rather bodhisattvas minds are insatiable for the roots of virtue
For we who have no support be a support
Making this gift giving constantly to the buddhas And creating this accumulation of generosity for the sake of enlightenment 
and the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna performed this miracle with their tongues
If someone is under the power of an executioner And is approaching the place of execution
for many reasons they then dissuade and turn sentient beings away from those meditative concentrations immeasurable aspirations formless absorptions and extrasensory powers
The birth and death of beings is like watching a play
They think Im healthy Im not suffering
Likewise when touched by the perfected mantra The practitioner of mantra will become the bodies of the Buddha
From the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment until they are seated at the Focal Point of Enlightenment
all sentient beings should not in any way lack the four meditative concentrations
the going forth of tīrthikas who do not have a sense of reverence should not be allowed nor should they be ordained
it would not amount to even one hundredth it would not amount to one thousandth of it or one hundred thousandth of it
The thusgone ones feel great compassion for sentient beings since all phenomena are devoid of self and yet sentient beings are not interested
One should place her buttocks on the ground
Wondrous Incantation great incantation That destroys the great trichiliocosm
As a buddha wearing the armor of concentration miraculous power and intelligence I myself
They will cross over the wastelands of saṃsāra and remove the thorns of misery
This caused all their attendants to ask the victorious ones
Beloved in the world of gods and humans you overturn the thoughts of others
You should not have conviction in the sense field of sights and you should not have conviction in the other sense objects up to and including mental phenomena
Wherever the Bodhisattva took a step a lotus sprouted forth
and even exhibit a diversity of flower garlands and a diversity of foods delicacies savories cooked food and drinks
Thoroughly understanding that the ear is empty one does not run toward sounds
Then in seeking for his son He arrives at another great city
enior āradvatīputra asked the Blessed One
but he is not sensation
If you ask why it is because it is their very nature That is called the emptiness of conditioned phenomena
Then the great king of the gandharvas Dhṛtarāṣṭra fell at the feet of the Blessed One and said
By giving up all negative mental acts
The Blessed One then continued to recount the events of the previous evening up to the point where the gods disappeared
Nārāyaṇa a bodhisattva who has these four traits will neglect the mind of awakening
When our time comes and we die may he make the appropriate offerings neither too few nor too many
Noble son replied the Blessed One it is not And why
and was at the side of the capital city of Ratnāvatī
None of this however happens to bodhisattvas for they naturally abide on the path of the ten virtuous acts
settled in awakened body speech and mind
In the third assembly of śrāvakas there were six hundred million arhats
The shadow does not possess anything taken up by the elements
She had a lovely complexion and was magnificent Her name was Jñānāvatī The bhikṣu Bhūtamati was her ācārya
When they remember the name the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras The Sūtra of the Baskets Display food with supreme divine flavors appears
They saw that not a single being had followed after them and wondered
Or make an offering with just one flower Or make an offering with a distracted mind
and to fully engage in understanding the inexhaustible doctrine of the bodhisattva mahāsattvas that nirvāṇa is peace
Sensory contact is pure owing to the purity of the six sense fields
On each of these jewel podiums were also five thousand divine maidens singing celestial songs
Friend you did not offer alms to the Tathāgata
We will remember the kindness of the thusgone ones we will not be ungrateful
Holding the lamp of knowledge in your hand You have a power of strength and diligence unique upon the earth
why did he not quickly realize supreme perfect enlightenment and become a buddha
Life karma materials and devotion And the strengths of aspiration miracles and birth Dharma mind and likewise great wisdom ii
Ratnadhvaja
Seeing there the bodhisattvas seated on the high wide and beautiful lionthrones
Based on the particularities of the bodily supports
The bodhisattva great being Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin was aware of the thoughts of those gods and so he addressed the Blessed One
The youth Candraprabha for the sake of the Jina Arranged vast incalculable ornaments of divine materials
They will touch the heart and be beloved They will make those beings happy and they will rejoice
What are their origins What types of things are compatible with them
Venerable Lord is it not the case that great bodhisattva beings would not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to all phenomena
On the relative level emptiness is a gateway to the absence of pride
There is no other sūtra that is its equal
and circumambulated him He then took the Bodhisattva on his lap and remained pensive
Who are animals or under the command of Yama And the agonies of birth aging sickness and death
whenever they do not engage with the notions that physical forms arise or that they are nonarising
When a precious jewel is placed in the right vessel It makes the jewel even more glorious Likewise let your pristine mind like a precious jewel
and extremely beautiful wishgranting trees appeared there They were hung with hundreds of thousands of adornments
When not having different views with respect to the mind of omniscience they are free from evil
What does it mean to engage in authentic conduct
They who desiring liberation possess this stainless samādhi Are always wise and are constantly motivated to generosity
Sleeping rough unwashed and smelly And never squatting do not make men pure
And they have vast compassion for beings Those are the benefits of being devoted to wisdom 
We should arouse them
so too when the body is appropriated and then discarded by the element of consciousness it transforms into something else and is no more
There is no substance to the bodyit is like a machine of suffering
It is similar and comparable to grass logs of wood walls or clay
The gods joyfully wave banners in midair
but without consciousness the body will not develop
Therefore in the eyes of the tathāgata arhat perfectly complete buddhas of the three times bodhisattva mahāsattvas and noble beings they have become stained by faults
You have pulled out the tree of rebirth by its root
thinking This is suffering a truth of noble beings vision arose
When practicing generosity by giving away parks forests for ascetic practice and temples
what can I possibly say about innumerable beings who all have a wheelbearing monarchs quantity of merit
Bhagavān today I have attained complete nirvāṇa
Noble son from being unstained up to being protected this is how the bodhisattvas are
and say O child of enlightened heritage
Subhūti if one were to ask in what way great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of tolerance establish sentient beings one hundred billion trillions in number in tolerance
In brief all unwholesome mental engagements are a cause of affliction
complexes daily fevers chronic fevers dissipation abscesses
He should apply himself appropriately
and presents the infinite teachings taught by the thusgone ones of times past
If they are thinking of Avalokiteśvara Their bonds will quickly break apart
Similarly one should know the fruit of entering the stream to be emptiness and the other fruits up to and including the fruit of arhatship to be emptiness and individual enlightenment to be emptiness the maturity of the bodhisattvas to be emptiness genuinely perfect enlightenment to be emptiness the buddhafields to be emptiness and the maturation of sentient beings to be emptiness
the samādhi of the accumulation of all merit
if bodhisattva mahāsattvas possess those eight qualities
Noble son bodhisattvas possessing ten qualities are like the moon What are those ten They are to gratify the bodies of all beings to be delightful to behold to make positive qualities grow to make negative qualities wane to be the object of praise to possess a pure body to ride a supreme mount to be constantly adorned to be interested in and pursue the joy of Dharma and to have great magical power
Before that individual the bodhisattva will then project emanations of the bodhisattvas parents and say
Through this the effects of negative conduct will not come about
Then afterward together with those emanations from their own bodies in the forms of tathāgatas may they open the stūpa that contains my body and reveal it to the fourfold assembly
Blessed One ThusGone One FoeDestroyer Completely Perfect Buddha please remain for an eon or longer so that you can continue to bring aid and happiness to so many beings bring love to the world and bring benefit aid and happiness to gods humans and the vast multitudes of beings
 At all times I had lovingkindness When I was abused I did not become angry
Subhūti it is because these great bodhisattva beings do not consider any physical forms in which they should have confidence
Mañjuśrī just as that king keeps the crest jewel fixed upon his topknot for a long time in the same way
They will all flee
At that very moment a lotus flower appeared in front of the Bhagavān Made of precious substances it had a stem of silver leaves of gold
In the same vein they teach sentient beings the sacred doctrine that future attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are all emptiness that they will arise from nowhere and that they will proceed to nowhere
The Blessed One the thusgone worthy completely perfect Buddha Amitābha is asking if the Blessed One is in good health
can accomplish all the tasks that were previously mentioned
Venerable Lord To what extent is it said of great bodhisattva beings that they abide in the Great Vehicle
Such is the bodhisattvas limitless aspiration
will experience the sufferings of the denizens of the hells over a long period of time and
And delightful gardens And beautiful walking areas
When they die and fall from that abode they will again reach excellent places
If any noble man or noble woman possesses reads teaches or asks questions about this Dharma teaching
Father he is not wealthier than I
They gather from all directions with their cupped hands held out and approach the boiling cauldrons
This king is brave courageous and handsome He has conquered opposing armies
Their sight is free of impediment And they see many forms in the ten directions
These are uncontaminated These are mundane These are supramundane
Im hungry and thirsty
were seated on lion thrones at the foot of precious trees
and from any other words that are harmful words
Liberating beings through such methods
Sixtyfour thousand Finewinged nāga guhyakas Dwell in the west And perpetrate harm against those who appear there
bodhisattvas will then inspire them to leave those communities and establish them in the DharmaVinaya of the thusgone ones
Peacocks cranes and swans sounded their delightful calls
Yellow Acala vajra yogin
Any place where a Dharma teacher resides should likewise be understood to be a shrine
Excellent noble son Excellent replied the Blessed One You have asked your question properly
They have emerged beyond all spheres of meditative absorption and attainments
Mañjuśrī replied
In these dreadful latter times there is the great presentation Of the Sugatas teaching of enlightenment 
to confess his evil deeds but not just to escape them
The kingdom is prosperous large and peaceful with excellent harvests
There is only one Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa Abiding in five forms
Kṣemadatta through devas and nāgas Made offerings to the king
He has the power to know what liberates various inclinations many inclinations and all inclinations Therefore
and similarly no sights sounds odors tastes tangibles or mental phenomena
For example Mañjuśrī when the only son of a merchant is sick both his parents become sick on account of the sickness of their son
What is penetrating into beings It is knowing the higher and the lower faculties What is knowledge of phenomena
and I seek to serve at the feet of the master
For that reason they are called ordinary people
One should not think of anything whatsoever
Yaśodharā I declare to you I make it known to you
they do not preoccupy themselves with agitation or anger
that will be her last life as a woman
They will not be harmed by eye ear nose or tongue diseases nor by fevers poisons weapons or fire
He did not remember that it was in the hem of his clothing
The cultivation of the transcendent perfection of wisdom is the noncultivation of the applications of mindfulness
Throughout many hundreds of eons he has perfected The accumulations by means of his compassionate mind
Reverence to all the buddhas bodhisattvas noble disciples and pratyekabuddhas in the past the present and the future
They are the inconceivably numerous kinds of meditation on the path concerning the composite the inconceivably numerous kinds of meditation on the path concerning teaching the composite
Senior Subhūti then replied to Senior āradvatīputra as follows
Are like the foes of beings
Just as when a man has a son born to him And gives him a name saying This is his name
When they open the door to their home they form the motivation I shall open the doors to the joyful destinations with the wisdom that transcends the world
the samādhi named Purification of Hells and Animals
Friends today the venerable perfectly and completely awakened ThusGone One has acquiesced to turn the wheel of Dharma
Knowing the aspiration of that king The Lord of humans taught this samādhi
Likewise with the liberations and so forth
O strike strike Kill kill all the enemies O sword of knowledge Hū phaṭ
Similarly you should abide in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
countless beings both devas and humans developed the aspiration to the highest complete enlightenment and countless beings were benefitted
I ought to run away But leaving ones own land behind is hard
To Sujātā and the gods he offers a teaching that benefits them greatly
This bhikṣus is discipline
In a future time you ārisuta Will become a jina a tathāgata
and nor does it not cause one to know supramundane conditioned unconditioned contaminated and uncontaminated phenomena
If the senses could be relied upon What need would there be for the path of the noble ones 
according to the order of the emanation chakra and the rest
Furthermore Maitreya if bodhisattvas possess five qualities
Who created this display of light
and the nature of omniscience itself is total dedication
The Guide emitted a single very beautiful Ray of light from between his eyebrows 
Then the divine princes said to the Blessed One
Just like the invariability of the dharmadhātu the Tathāgatas awareness is neither occurring nor ceasing
and now has arrived at the Bodhi tree You must make great effort
This is virtue and that is evil
a wheel of cessation and a wheel that engages with the enlightened mind of the thusgone ones
Monks a person who has violated a nun is one who will not flourish in the Dharma and the Vinaya
Monks at that point the eight goddesses dwelling in the tree of awakeningrī Vṛddhi Tapā reyasī Vidu Ojobalā Satyavādinī and Samaṅginī
Great Kings It would be improper to think that your assembly could harm my assembly
he developed this kind of detachment
Endowed with the qualities of the five sensual desires
Having abandoned negative forms of livelihood it does not take over others property
May all sentient beings moving or still be well here And may they pay homage to the Buddha The supreme teacher venerated by gods and men May there be wellbeing here today
The yakṣa lords Surūpa Indraketu Vikaṭa Bakula Pāñcika ākyavardhana and many quintillions of yakṣa lords holding pestles with both hands
akra lord of the gods with the gods of the Heaven of the ThirtyThree
Here the forest of obscurations Has been burned away by the fire of my roots of virtue
crafts
Suppose two poor men were to wander in the wilderness and one of them finds cool water
Similarly the correct exertions the supports for miraculous ability the faculties the powers the branches of enlightenment and the noble eightfold path are all indeed like a dream like a magical display
A person will become omniscient
Similarly this sacred doctrine is compatible with the fruit of entering the stream
Formations have ignorance for their cause
Freed from their former negative views
Moreover āradvatīputra entities are empty of entities
meditate on it with unadulterated meditation promulgate it
Do not fall back into the three lower realms
He has crossed over the great river He is complete in his wisdom
There was no longer any gravel or rocks and instead the world was filled with jewels pearls catseye gems conch shells crystals corals gold and silver
Understood only by the clever and the wise
Young man King Mahābala heard what the Bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened Buddha Ghoṣadatta said
They will despise their fathers their mothers their cousins and their siblings their partners their relatives noble beings abbots spiritual teachers themselves and others
Thus instructed by the Sugata We teach the highest path With quintillions of causes and parables To many bodhisattvas with great strength
Doing this will delight the nāgas
one will be eloquent and have a sweet voice
He is not a conception not a mental construction
but O gods that is not the case in ultimate reality
hen you shall also get to play enjoy and amuse yourself in such Palaces of Victory
Then if you ask what constitute the fruits of the sublime attributes of great bodhisattva beings
Accept these flowers flagrances And burnt offerings
In front of kings and princes And likewise the kings ministers
They are ready to listen to the stainless Buddhadharma
Noble son it is certain that such noble children have also in their previous lifetimes heard this teaching on the greatness of the thusgone ones
Of agarwood sandalwood cherry wood And whatever is splendid aromatic and beautiful
Son is it good for you to go forth
If he does teach the Dharma to a woman he does not even teach the Dharma with desire for the Dharma let alone with desire for the woman
May my intention be fulfilled
All phenomena are naturally luminous So one should cultivate the clear understanding of nonapprehension
Leaving the Heaven of Joy
They will cut off all possibility of unhappy lives
As they so endeavor to uphold the sacred Dharma their physical verbal and mental discipline will be pure
They have an inconceivable aroma That they continuously emit
It shows that you Gopā shall quickly cross the four rivers And see me as the single parasol bearer in the triple universe
Similarly they do not consider whether the noble truths are permanent or impermanent and so on as described above
one should offer white mustard seeds in the fire
is the physical restraint through which bodhisattva mahāsattvas desist from killing
like a wise person
a modality that is with signs and a modality that is signless a modality that has aspirations
that broke the great ship into pieces We fell into the water and
and how may irreversible bodhisattvas be called reversible
If it is fully outfitted it is a monastery
Venerable Lord if the notion of the eyes as calm is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of the eyes as not calm become a bodhisattva
I must not neglect any teachings whether or not I have heard them before
they cannot be separated they cannot be differentiated and they cannot be severed
When they are reborn in the hell realms they will feel regret
Imagine then that the combined merit of all those akraspresent across world realms as innumerable as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā throughout each of the ten directions
At that place the bodhisattvas dwelling on the tenth ground who had achieved the meditative concentration of brave progression
for those playing in parks like a pool
that noble man or noble woman
They made sure he knew the foundations what things brought about offenses
Venerable Lord how should great bodhisattva beings train in the transcendent perfection of wisdom
youthful Mañjuśrī caused Māra Pāpīyān and the elder āradvatīputra to appear with the body and physical marks of a buddha
Others had no ears at all
and brilliant as a miraculous show of rain and thunder began
The corpse is taught first For the destruction of the self or conceptuality
Son of noble family eschew the discourses of the śrāvaka vehicle
if some sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage were to honor venerate respect and grant offerings to them
Then these divine princes thought
The seed phrase supreme da teaches the calming and pacification of all phenomena
as well as separation between the monastics and the kṣatriyas
They who know that phenomena are always empty Have no anger in their mind even in a dream Even though their limbs are cut from their body
But the gods blocked my words And so not even one lady awoke
free from characteristics
or among the merchant class standing out like a tall sāl tree
They who hold this samādhi of peace in the degenerate time Are heroes established in the brahmavihāras
Bhagavān when the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa
a mind without point of reference
Noble son you may wonder what a blessed buddhas marks of enormous merit are like
Their bodies will shine brightly Adorned by the thirtytwo excellent signs 
Venerable ones the emanation continued now consider youthful Mañjuśrīs teaching
whereas great bodhisattva beings who also cultivate the nature of things that is emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness
not mixing with worldly things in order to delight all the people
Illuminating all the pure realms the light attracted Maheśvara and innumerable other gods
You are a fresh and tender boy with black hair and a body like a lotus You have not yet given yourself to the pleasures of the senses
Moreover Subhūti great bodhisattva beings make offerings of food with a hundred flavors to the tathāgatas bodhisattvas and pratyekabuddhas as well as to the reliquary stūpas of the tathāgatas and the śrāvakas of the tathāgatas
This wheel is hard to discern because it is related to the sameness of wisdom and consciousness
There will be many in chains and suffering punishments Who are abused threatened and have unwishedfor suffering
Blessed One why is this asked the bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin
Therefore to speak of voidness on the one hand and of matter or of sensation or of intellect or of motivation or of consciousness on the other is entirely dualistic
The emanated monk then asked the group Venerable ones the mind that has no form and cannot be shown
And after you the Bhagavān and the venerable nanda have passed into parinirvāṇa I shall cause this Dharma discourse to be practiced in Jambudvīpa
Blessed One in the future there will be beings who indulge in nonvirtue
have nothing whatsoever
Bodhisattvas with skill in means act within cyclic existence but are not stained by any of the flaws of cyclic existence because their means are correctly embraced by insight
The young god spoke again Because of you the path to miserable realms Of terrible and diverse punishments is blocked
you will become the tathāgata the arhat the truly complete buddha called rīmaṇiratnasambhava in the world system called rīmahāratnapratimaṇḍitā
similarly do you think that the real nature of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness constitutes a bodhisattva
Those who are not hardhearted or wicked Will attain exactly what has been described
Join their palms and bow down
One transgresses the pledges of secret mantra
pay homage to the bodhisattva kāśagarbha and call out his name then
Oh I will dispel the sorrow I feel toward my preceptor or instructor
The beings born as animals
Craving disturbs them
the welfare of sentient beings is the cause and the welfare of sentient beings is the condition
Blessed One Brahmās quantity of merit is much greater Forget about the merit from the gift
One will master language by licking
for with it one relies upon the Dharma
Adorned by blossomed flowers of all seasons Which were beautiful adornments for that vast road
when they train accordingly they also train in the fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas
All these conceptual imaginations are absent and do not arise
the Licchavi Vimalakīrti came there and said to me
how do great bodhisattva beings on training accordingly attain emancipation in omniscience
then because of this Dharma teaching there is no need for them to build a stūpa for my relics after I have passed into nirvāṇa and no need to make an offering to the saṅgha
then you should know that they will be restricted to two levelsthe level of the śrāvakas and the level of the pratyekabuddhas
The transcendent perfection of perseverance is pure owing to the purity of the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration
the precious stewards divine sight will enable him to perceive treasuresboth those that are owned and those that are notin the surrounding area for up to an entire league
It will be very difficult to find beings such as these Who listen to the supreme Dharma and believe in it 
In spite of this once they are liberated from the womb they nevertheless continue to act carelessly
They never despise anyone else or have contempt through which they would come to dislike others
With a welltrained mind it is noble
Likewise neither do they observe any arising origin or cessation of feeling perception formation or consciousness
Young man for bodhisattva mahāsattvas who are intent on giving the Dharma those are the ten benefits that come from giving the Dharma
Noble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities have expertise regarding emanations
Youth however ends with the aging of the body
At a shrine containing relics or at a hermitage
Armed with lances hard as vajra and mounted on elephants horses and chariots The ākya youths who kept guard also fell asleep As did the king the princes and the royal pages
Parasols banners flags flags of victory precious arches and canopies were set up along the road
then those bodhisattvas will abide in genuine reality the definitive aggregates which comprise unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
That house is illomened Do not let him go in Beware through indiscretion he will come to suffering
To some here in this world you demonstrated birth And taking seven steps over the ground
Right speech is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
purifies the five eyes
wearing diadems earrings and necklaces
But feeling is formless
Thereupon the Buddha ākyamuni asked all the multitudes
Needless to mention then the case of someone who hears it and memorizes it holds it reads it masters it and extensively teaches it to others
He should completely avoid The enjoyments that they provide
turning away from objects freedom from craving objects being unharmed by the flaws of objects
One should fill up a dish with either milk or yogurt mixed with rice together with ghee and sugar
Their nature is to break like an unbaked earthen vase
By contemplating all the latent tendencies of the primary and secondary afflictions they had conquered pride and its attendant habitual tendencies and predispositions
I shall give them a dhāraṇī so that no one will be able to harm those dharmabhāṇakas
You should proclaim this ultimate truth To those who have seen many millions of buddhas Who have developed immeasurable merit And have a stable higher motivation
beyond comparison
Prostrations to the tathāgata Padmottaraśrī buddha of the southeast
They will not fall under the power of the kleśa demons Those who know emptiness will never become agitated 
At that time there were no impoverished or suffering beings
His faculties became ineffectual
With the voice of Brahmā and the call of the cuckoo bird
They will gain an ocean of learning and always have infinite understanding Virtuous speech excellent understanding and knowledge of the instructions 
Reverend Rāhula renunciation is not material but is free of matter
Mañjuśrī the balacakravartin king is amazed by the great strength of the men when the warriors are fighting
Moreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings perceive sentient beings
āradvatīputra the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas are merely conceptualized
How much worse are things now He is not to be emulated as he walks around eating proper food and doing easy practices That lazy glutton None of us should approach him to greet him or rise when he comes
Having heard it he learned it and understood it
training in the transcendent perfection of perseverance
With kham visualize food and drink Filling all of space and recite this mantra Oṃ āḥkāro mukhaṃ sarvadharmāṇām ādyantapanna tathā oṃ āḥ hūṃ phaṭ svāhā
Young man the bodhisattva mahāsattvas who abide in all aspirations will fulfill all the aspirations of all beings
Would bodhisattvas forsake even a few sentient beings whether of the Hearers Vehicle the Solitary Realizers Vehicle or the Mahāyāna
Later one should make offerings according to ones ability
Bhagavān teach the Dharma
neither knowledge
you have benefited many beings
When those who have not understood are contradicted by others They will be overpowered by anger and speak harsh words 
Then they said Even we are able to follow in the footsteps of this Sage with all his glorious diligence and power
Cover the body of the one to be accomplished in color And cut it with the radiation and absorption of the garland of the great hūṃ
for the hungry like grain
All the jinas that have passed into nirvāṇa Those who will live in the future and those now present
should plant roots of merit and apply themselves to practicing generosity through the Dharma or generosity through material things
then how do great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom
At the three levels draw the three points of a vajra Encircled by a chain In the intermediate spaces draw iron hooks
How can they exert themselves unrelentingly in attracting beings using the four means of drawing them in and thus become exceedingly magnetizing
who illuminates the world who brings relief
Candrabhūti then asked the Blessed One
and we have obtained the Buddhas Dharma and we have attained nirvāṇa
Similarly it has not been revealed so that the transcendent perfection of generosity might be grasped or not grasped
At the gates there are men fond of combat holding their swords aloft
Vast stable and strong it causes the destruction and emergence of the world
How could the pure Bodhisattva who is free from badsmelling odors
They have soft arms and legs That they gain without difficulty
Having retained it they do not squander it until they have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
Incorrectness is a stain and a flaw in relation to diligence
Therefore as they become weary in these ways they shave off their hair and beard donning the saffroncolored robes
When Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra was in the samādhi named Moons Sublime Illumination Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara was in the samādhi named Suns Sublime Illumination
ointments powders clothes parasols victory banners and flags
nor does it have a body
The preceptor himself then sanctions the novices three Dharma robes
Death is taught to be the means tantra
Who praised a million buddhas And respectfully developed great faith Who speaks with a beautiful voice like the melody of Brahmā
It is like a water bubble not remaining very long
Subhūti if the luminosity of the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas were an entity and not a nonentity
āriputra the lifespan of Tathāgata Amitāyus is immeasurable
Noble son it is like this As a comparison if stūpas for tathāgatas arhats and samyaksaṃbuddhas as numerous as atoms were made in divine gold and precious stones and in one day the relics were placed in them all
Homage to Tathāgata Mahāmeghaśrī
Senior āradvatīputra on what do you think the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas dwell
Bhikṣus when they went into the west those Mahābrahmās saw in the west the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū who had come to the sublime highest Bodhimaṇḍa and was seated on a lion throne at the foot of the Bodhi tree Before him were assembled devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kinnaras mahoragas humans and nonhumans who were gazing upon him and the sixteen young princes who were requesting him to turn the wheel of the Dharma
Since even bodhisattvas dwelling on the grounds up to the eighth ground may become defiled
kaṭapūtanas and pāṃśukūla piśācas also hear my voice
Maitreya it must be known that the bodhisattvas who believe in all sorts of words and phrases and apply themselves accordingly are beginners and not experienced in religious practice
His head was the color of a reddish insect and the tusks were blazing gold
This was a root of virtue that manifested from causes in the past
Are all revealed here by bodhisattvas With great miraculous powers 
and similarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are like an illusion
Moreover Subhūti this transcendent perfection of wisdom reveals to the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas that the world is inconceivable
Venerable Lord How can those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage know that among all the world systems of the ten directions the gods of the Caturmahārājakāyika realm will come here
their wisdom well liberated
like a pristine dawn once the night has passed
The girl thought He has killed his father without regard for his importance to him
Subhūti such is the refined eye of manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment possessed by great bodhisattva beings
The complete buddha realm shook in six ways
The perfect Buddha is supreme in all realms of existence O great selfarisen guide to you I pay homage
whenever they do not engage with the notions that physical forms have aspirations or that they are without aspirations
They will cultivate the meditative stabilities of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness
Why do you not give me over
all that is preeminent from the Buddha
They will know the smells of cakravartin kings Balacakravartin kings and rulers of regions
He teaches the Dharma in the form of a cakravartin to those beings who are to be guided by a cakravartin
Thus addressed the Licchavi Vimalakīrti spoke the following verses to the bodhisattva Sarvarūpasaṃdarśana
Father this master of gods and humans has no fear or anger
 Supreme king be a protector of the Dharma Guard the teaching of the one with ten strengths
and the bodhisattva great being Mahākaruṇācandrin
Subhūti all things have a modality of disassociation
They encourage the One Who Gods and Humans Venerate saying This is the time for you to renounce your palace
Why do you say that the designation of fundamental ignorance does not constitute a bodhisattva
And all that is meaningless is always avoided That is what the Jina the Lord of the Dharma teaches 
nanda Vajrapāṇis older brother called Swift Hand resides in the city known as Cakravālapur
How sad that scholars are attached to pleasure
The Bhagavat replied
then were to describe genuinely demonstrate and so forth these noble meanings and noble words of the transcendent perfection of wisdom to them

Will by so doing have made Such infinite and diverse offerings to me

In sixty thousand ways they roar with the thunder of the Dharma of true reality
tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas who had the same name Candrasūryapradīpa

Jackals yelp without fear

Replying to the bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin the Blessed One said
In which I experienced suffering Tormented for a long time by saṃsāras suffering

Ah Come here arise you who are a tree of pure wisdom xxiv
āradvatīputra do you think that the designations of sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomena as with signs or signless constitute a bodhisattva
Now enjoy and revel in them with delight and bliss
Those who beat the dharmagaṇḍī are good beings
āriputra this buddha realm is beautifully adorned by such displays of the excellences of buddha realms Furthermore āriputra when the wind blows in that buddha realm it sways the rows of palm trees

You do not possess the attributes the indications and the signs endowed with which it is foreordained that unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment will be attained
Those gods with their flowing hair quickly stood and prostrated
I am an accomplished one without any doubt
In this way they are free of desire and liberated within the realm of phenomena the limit of reality

the bodhisattva great being Praśāntacāritramati
That person too under the control of the spirit would desire feculent food from foulsmelling dirty things and take delight in it
we ourselves Bhagavān have not given rise to a single wish for such a thing
Subhūti in the same manner great bodhisattva beings establish sentient beings many hundreds of billion trillions in number in the transcendent perfection of perseverance but they have not actually established any sentient beings at all
Buddha qualities will not be hard to attain For the learned one who trains in it

Were one person to cut off the head of another person even that would not influence the world
they share a single defining characteristic in that they are all immaterial unrevealed unimpeded and without defining characteristics
Bodhisattvas are then known as purifiers of beings
They abide in compassion when they are not intimidated by phenomena being void
On the way Mahāmaudgalyāyana conjured up an apparition of the gods

Similarly Subhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom
The lifespan of that sugata will be A full twenty thousand intermediate eons
