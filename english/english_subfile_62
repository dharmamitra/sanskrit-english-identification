middle of her waistIf someone wishing to go forth approaches any of youhe is undeterred and has perfected all the conduct of a bodhisattvalikewise Mañjuśrī this Dharma discourse burns away all afflictionsWhen he saw the perfection of the bhikṣus body he became extremely enragedAn exclusive nirvāṇa Would mean deceiving sentient beings How shall I liberate them From the endless ocean of existenceThe infinite wisdom of the three times And the excellent six perfectionsMañjuśrī when the Blessed One prophesied that the god Ratnavara will fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood and become the ThusGone worthy perfect Buddha RatnavyūhaThe air element follows in the wake of consciousnessit is because it transcends the world and is exalted over the world systemsOne should apply an ointment of umbrella tree with honey to the eyesYou will awaken inconceivable trillions of creatures Who are asleep due to their afflictionsFor all those afflicted with disturbing emotionsRather bodhisattvas minds are insatiable for the roots of virtueFor we who have no support be a supportMaking this gift giving constantly to the buddhas And creating this accumulation of generosity for the sake of enlightenment and the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna performed this miracle with their tonguesIf someone is under the power of an executioner And is approaching the place of executionfor many reasons they then dissuade and turn sentient beings away from those meditative concentrations immeasurable aspirations formless absorptions and extrasensory powersThe birth and death of beings is like watching a playThey think Im healthy Im not sufferingLikewise when touched by the perfected mantra The practitioner of mantra will become the bodies of the BuddhaFrom the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment until they are seated at the Focal Point of Enlightenmentall sentient beings should not in any way lack the four meditative concentrationsthe going forth of tīrthikas who do not have a sense of reverence should not be allowed nor should they be ordainedit would not amount to even one hundredth it would not amount to one thousandth of it or one hundred thousandth of itThe thusgone ones feel great compassion for sentient beings since all phenomena are devoid of self and yet sentient beings are not interestedOne should

thoughts of othersYou should not have conviction in the sense field of sights and you should not have conviction in the other sense objects up to and including mental phenomenaWherever the Bodhisattva took a step a lotus sprouted forthand even exhibit a diversity of flower garlands and a diversity of foods delicacies savories cooked food and drinksThoroughly understanding that the ear is empty one does not run toward soundsThen in seeking for his son He arrives at another great cityenior āradvatīputra asked the Blessed Onebut he is not sensationIf you ask why it is because it is their very nature That is called the emptiness of conditioned phenomenaThen the great king of the gandharvas Dhṛtarāṣṭra fell at the feet of the Blessed One and saidBy giving up all negative mental actsThe Blessed One then continued to recount the events of the previous evening up to the point where the gods disappearedNārāyaṇa a bodhisattva who has these four traits will neglect the mind of awakeningWhen our time comes and we die may he make the appropriate offerings neither too few nor too manyNoble son replied the Blessed One it is not And whyand was at the side of the capital city of RatnāvatīNone of this however happens to bodhisattvas for they naturally abide on the path of the ten virtuous actssettled in awakened body speech and mindIn the third assembly of śrāvakas there were six hundred million arhatsThe shadow does not possess anything taken up by the elementsShe had a lovely complexion and was magnificent Her name was Jñānāvatī The bhikṣu Bhūtamati was her ācāryaWhen they remember the name the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras The Sūtra of the Baskets Display food with supreme divine flavors appearsThey saw that not a single being had followed after them and wonderedOr make an offering with just one flower Or make an offering with a distracted mindand to fully engage in understanding the inexhaustible doctrine of the bodhisattva mahāsattvas that nirvāṇa is peaceSensory contact is pure owing to the purity of the six sense fieldsOn each of these jewel podiums were also five thousand divine maidens singing celestial songsFriend you did not offer alms to the TathāgataWe will remember the kindness of the thusgone ones we will not be ungratefulHolding the lamp of knowledge in your hand You have a power of strength and diligence unique upon the earthwhy did he not quickly realize supreme perfect enlightenment and become a buddhaLife karma materials and devotion And the strengths of aspiration miracles and birth Dharma mind and likewise great wisdom iiRatnadhvajaSeeing there the bodhisattvas seated on the high wide and beautiful lionthronesBased on the particularities of the bodily supportsThe bodhisattva great being Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin was aware of the thoughts of those gods and so he addressed the Blessed OneThe youth Candraprabha for the sake of the Jina Arranged vast incalculable ornaments of divine materialsThey will touch the heart and be beloved They will make those beings happy and they will rejoiceWhat are their origins What types of things are compatible with themVenerable Lord is it not the case that great bodhisattva beings would not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to all phenomenaOn the relative level emptiness is a gateway to the absence of prideThere is no other sūtra that is its equaland circumambulated him He then took the Bodhisattva on his lap and remained pensiveWho are animals or under the command of Yama And the agonies of birth aging sickness and deathwhenever they do not engage with the notions that physical forms arise or that they are nonarisingWhen a precious jewel is placed in the right vessel It makes the jewel even more glorious Likewise let your pristine mind like a precious jeweland extremely beautiful wishgranting trees appeared there They were hung with hundreds of thousands of adornmentsWhen not having different views with respect to the mind of omniscience they are free from evilWhat does it mean to engage in authentic conductThey who desiring liberation possess this stainless samādhi Are always wise and are constantly motivated to generositySleeping rough unwashed and smelly And never squatting do not make men pureAnd they have vast compassion for beings Those are the benefits of being devoted to wisdom We should arouse themso too when the body is appropriated and then discarded by the element of consciousness it transforms into something else and is no moreThere is no substance to the bodyit is like a machine of sufferingIt is similar and comparable to grass logs of wood walls or clayThe gods joyfully wave banners in midairbut without consciousness the body will not developTherefore in the eyes of the tathāgata arhat perfectly complete buddhas of the three times bodhisattva mahāsattvas and noble beings they have become stained by faultsYou have pulled out the tree of rebirth by its rootthinking This is suffering a truth of noble beings vision aroseWhen practicing generosity by giving away parks forests for ascetic practice and templeswhat can I possibly say about innumerable beings who all have a wheelbearing monarchs quantity of meritBhagavān today I have attained complete nirvāṇaNoble son from being unstained up to being protected this is how the bodhisattvas areand say O child of enlightened heritageSubhūti if one were to ask in what way great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of tolerance establish sentient beings one hundred billion trillions in number in toleranceIn brief all unwholesome mental engagements are a cause of afflictioncomplexes daily fevers chronic fevers dissipation abscessesHe should apply himself appropriatelyand presents the infinite teachings taught by the thusgone ones of times pastIf they are thinking of Avalokiteśvara Their bonds will quickly break apartSimilarly one should know the fruit of entering the stream to be emptiness and the other fruits up to and including the fruit of arhatship to be emptiness and individual enlightenment to be emptiness the maturity of the bodhisattvas to be emptiness genuinely perfect enlightenment to be emptiness the buddhafields to be emptiness and the maturation of sentient beings to be emptinessthe samādhi of the accumulation of all meritif bodhisattva mahāsattvas possess those eight qualitiesNoble son bodhisattvas possessing ten qualities are like the moon What are those ten They are to gratify the bodies of all beings to be delightful to behold to make positive qualities grow to make negative qualities wane to be the object of praise to possess a pure body to ride a supreme mount to be constantly adorned to be interested in and pursue the joy of Dharma and to have great magical powerBefore that individual the bodhisattva will then project emanations of the bodhisattvas parents and sayThrough this the effects of negative conduct will not come aboutThen afterward together with those emanations from their own bodies in the forms of tathāgatas may they open the stūpa that contains my body and reveal it to the fourfold assemblyBlessed One ThusGone One FoeDestroyer Completely Perfect Buddha please remain for an eon or longer so that you can continue to bring aid and happiness to so many beings bring love to the world and bring benefit aid and happiness to gods humans and the vast multitudes of beings At all times I had lovingkindness When I was abused I did not become angrySubhūti it is because these great bodhisattva beings do not consider any physical forms in which they should have confidenceMañjuśrī just as that king keeps the crest jewel fixed upon his topknot for a long time in the same wayThey will all fleeAt that very moment a lotus flower appeared in front of the Bhagavān Made of precious substances it had a stem of silver leaves of goldIn the same vein they teach sentient beings the sacred doctrine that future attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are all emptiness that they will arise from nowhere and that they will proceed to nowhereThe Blessed One the thusgone worthy completely perfect Buddha Amitābha is asking if the Blessed One is in good healthcan accomplish all the tasks that were previously mentionedVenerable Lord To what extent is it said of great bodhisattva beings that they abide in the Great VehicleSuch is the bodhisattvas limitless aspirationwill experience the sufferings of the denizens of the hells over a long period of time andAnd delightful gardens And beautiful walking areasWhen they die and fall from that abode they will again reach excellent placesIf any noble man or noble woman possesses reads teaches or asks questions about this Dharma

delightful callsYellow Acala vajra yoginAny place where a Dharma teacher resides should likewise be understood to be a shrineExcellent noble son Excellent replied the Blessed One You have asked your question properlyThey have emerged beyond all spheres of meditative absorption and attainmentsMañjuśrī repliedIn these dreadful latter times there is the great presentation Of the Sugatas teaching of enlightenment to confess his evil deeds but not just to escape themThe kingdom is prosperous large and peaceful with excellent harvestsThere is only one Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa Abiding in five formsKṣemadatta through devas and nāgas Made offerings to the kingHe has the power to know what liberates various inclinations many inclinations and all inclinations Thereforeand similarly no sights sounds odors tastes tangibles or mental phenomenaFor example Mañjuśrī when the only son of a merchant is sick both his parents become sick on account of the sickness of their sonWhat is penetrating into beings It is knowing the higher and the lower faculties What is knowledge of phenomenaand I seek to serve at the feet of the masterFor that reason they are called ordinary peopleOne should not think of anything whatsoeverYaśodharā I declare to you I make it known to youthey do not preoccupy themselves with agitation or angerthat will be her last life as a womanThey will not be harmed by eye ear nose or tongue diseases nor by fevers poisons weapons or fireHe did not remember that it was in the hem of his clothingThe cultivation of the transcendent perfection of wisdom is the noncultivation of the applications of mindfulnessThroughout many hundreds of eons he has perfected The accumulations by means of his compassionate mindReverence to all the buddhas bodhisattvas noble disciples and pratyekabuddhas in the past the present and the futureThey are the inconceivably numerous kinds of meditation on the path concerning the composite the inconceivably numerous kinds of meditation on the

make offerings of food with a hundred flavors to the tathāgatas bodhisattvas and pratyekabuddhas as well as to the reliquary stūpas of the tathāgatas and the śrāvakas of the tathāgatasThis wheel is hard to discern because it is related to the sameness of wisdom and consciousnessThere will be many in chains and suffering punishments Who are abused threatened and have unwishedfor sufferingBlessed One why is this asked the bodhisattva SarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhinTherefore to speak of voidness on the one hand and of matter or of sensation or of intellect or of motivation or of consciousness on the

absorption of the garland of the great hūṃfor the hungry like grainAll the jinas that have passed into nirvāṇa Those who will live in the future and those now presentshould plant roots of merit and apply themselves to practicing generosity through the Dharma or generosity through material thingsthen how do great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomAt the three

nature should make love to a white girlWhen pus develops in the body of a sick personTherefore omniscience and the rest are without limitsSubhūti it is because the natural expression of their past limits though without entity is still omniscience and the restWhere there is no wish there is no process of thought mind or consciousnessIn this body that concludes in nirvāṇa We have meditated a long

including the tenth levelThen comes the practice of play Which should be understood to mean the right and leftBy devoting themselves as monks To all the strange sects of the world They develop all those beings Who have attached themselves to dogmatic viewsA woman whose child has died can bring that child back to life by bathing it from a jar incanted with the mantra one hundred and eight timesnanda I cherished revered and respected this woman greatlyIt was abandoning desires that he honored it was renouncing them rejecting them forsaking themWhile the group of delighted women Are

populace in the big city of Vaiśālī and there perform buddha activities on their behalfDo not compare venerable ones your own wisdom and merits with the wisdom and merits of the TathāgataIt teaches the minds purity with respect to phenomena and is a gateway to intelligence concerning all phenomenaonce the activity has been completed one becomes free of desire full of regret and feels that it was inappropriateYou must all make sure that the young prince does not catch sight of anything disagreeable so take care that everything that is not beautiful has been removedOr is it not possibleSenior Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra then addressed Senior Subhūti as followsAfter these explanations Youthful Mañjuśrī told the monk Stainless LightO Lord Like the mountain in the realm of the demigodssprinkle him

the nature of the tathāgatanaturally allpervading being fixated upon and lacking perseverance with respect to the five psychophysical aggregates andThen one should draw a circle with sixteen divisions in the form of a lotus with petalswho have fallen who have committed a fundamental transgression who have destroyed all their virtuous qualities who are bound for the lower realmsIf anyone opposes that kind of dharmabhāṇakaPlease recall the Buddha Dharma and Saṅgha And do not slip into heedlessnessHere I understood what was realized By innumerable victorious ones in the pastTo train those beings bodhisattvas show the way of passing into the great transcendence of sufferingSome bodhi trees were made of jewels and were one million leagues highSubhūti this transcendent perfection of wisdom does not transcend the world system of desire nor is it established in the world system of desireBy gazing at an angry person with an eye incanted seven times one will appease himBhadrapāla now bowed at the feet of the Blessed One and asked himWhen that jina had passed into nirvāṇa In the final stage of the disarray of the DharmaThe āriputra section is told over five chaptersThey do not have confidence in anyoneThe yakṣas rākṣasas humans and nonhumans ventured out from their respective domainsCharioteer the body of this poor man is covered in sores and discoloredThe god still in the shape of a hunter then gave his saffroncolored clothes to the BodhisattvaMay poison sink into the earth May poison return to the full vessel Svāhathe concept of perceptionsand nor does it have any support

well upon drums As an offering to the perfectly enlightened ones The conduct of beings is infinitely different How do they engage in practicing their conductThey know clearly what the causes of downfalls are and they know well how to stay clear of themSo it is that great bodhisattva beings for the sake of those sentient beings then actualize emptiness as a gateway to liberationThe Buddha then said to the venerable MahākāśyapaYou should also remember it as The True Arising of the Tathāgatathe six superknowledgesWhen I first heard the words of the Guidesome go to the bathing poolsThey are born there into special jewellike families And they benefit a multitude of their kin The strength of ten oxen is the same as the strength of one blue oxTherefore the bodhisattva should participate in liberation and should not participate in bondageand sent out a beam of light from the ūrṇa hair on his browMañjuśrī in what way are all dharmas are a single dharmaOnce it comes in contact with the bodys fire element it all becomes filthy and rotten reviled by the whole worldYou are endowed with fearlessness and powerJust as the guide conjured up a miraculous city for beings to rest in andthe thusgone ones could comprehend them all in one instant being perfectly aware of what every single being thinks conceives of and does and what the result of it all would beWhen I sought this supreme samādhi of peace In the past I gave to the guides Various kinds of precious jewels strings of pearls Beautiful clothes and necklaces of conch and gold the samādhi named Extinguishing AvīciNow if one does not succeed the first timeIt teaches how all phenomena are free from duality and is a gateway to the nonduality of all phenomenaIt is void not existing as self or as selfpossessedThe merit of this would be surpassed If one would joyfully make offerings of garlands and the like To a single solitary buddha Even for just a single day and nightthe love that is morality because it improves

unadulterated meditation and in other ways make it widely knownReach awakening through your austeritiesAs the fruition of that act those monks have come to resemble bowls What GodsThe yakṣa of Rājagṛha who caught While he was in the skynanda after I have passed beyond suffering these bodhisattvas will uphold the sacred Dharma by spreading this Dharma teaching in Jambudvīpaand who does not distinguish between the phenomena of misconstrued wisdom and the phenomena of wisdom will attain purification from karmic obscurationsWith body speech or mind They never produce the threefold evil deeds And even when they suddenly do they do not conceal them And in that way their view is not tainted with grasping Thus they are called the most precious gem of the SaṅghaSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who train accordingly obtain the powers and assurances of the buddhas with respect to all things and they will not regress to the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhas They will transcend the mental activities conceptual elaborations and distractions of all sentient beingsto be attached to views to be attached to country to be attached to a retinueWill be the owners and leaders Of households residences and countriesāradvatīputra when great bodhisattva beings who have cultivated the mind endowed with omniscienceThis emptiness of inherent existence is the emptiness of inherent existence with respect to the limits of past time the limits of future time and the limits of the present time in betweenThe sum total of the merit of all those beings with as much merit as a wheelbearing monarch would then match the merit of akra lord of the godsLater on when the Dharma has disappeared we will bear criticism intimidation and abuse The lord buddhas are endowed with

a villageFor one year this will prevent infectious diseaseThose who were my five hundred sons Are these guardians of the Dharma Similarly the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent perfection of generosity are neither heard nor seen owing to the nature of phenomena being inanimate they have reached the doorway to deathlessness  they are close to enlightenmentThe leftdownward glance signifies protecting the seven underground paradisesNoble son because they are endowed with ten qualities bodhisattvas possess a coherent eloquenceNot knowing the truth they preached the existence of a soul Variously claiming that this soul is allpervasive confined to locations eternal With form

and bring trillions Of beings to the city of peace xviWhen the youth Candraprabha had recited these appropriate verses of praise to the BhagavānNow he began to think to himselfSentient beings within the prison of existence Have for long been asleep in their ignoranceThose who have attained the strength of the powers will practice conduct that is in accord with the world yet those who are still to accomplish the strength of the powers will notThat is why O Lord seated here today at the foot of the Bodhi tree you shineand so on in the same vein down to I possess the eighteen distinct qualities

the aspects of their meditative concentrations are facets of impermanence modes of suffering and aspects of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness yet they enter neither into the maturity of the śrāvakas nor into the maturity of the pratyekabuddhas because these insights are retained by great compassion All abuse and disgrace is endured There is no association with any householderThis is the power of the transcendent perfection of wisdomāradvatīputra do you think that the designation of the eyes as having aspirations or lacking aspirations constitutes a bodhisattvaThe gods headed by Indra those headed by Brahmā and the gods headed by Prajāpati always pay homage to great bodhisattva beings who practice accordinglySeated upon that Dharma throne They will give a variety of teachingsnot so in the case of those explained by the nāgas andWithout pride or arrogance he looked at Queen Māyā And askedMonks my limbs and joints began to resemble the knots of the āsītakī plant or

the world bows to He Who Is like Mount Meru the Ocean the Sun and the Moon The selfarisen sublime one of this worldthen they would attain heaven and nirvāṇahow do they ensure that the mind of awakening is not lostdo not be carelessThey made his great fame knownSimilarly may you gather the fortytwo basic syllables in a single syllableThe pratyekabuddha began to poke holes with the needle and as the needle made finer and finer holesIt is inanimate being like grass trees walls clods of earth and illusionsMonks at that time from all directionseast south west and north above and belowmany millions of bodhisattvas who had made previous aspirations for this occasion came forthThis king of mantras brings peace to all those afflicted by the scourge of quarrels and disputes even when recited just onceYoung man that Tathāgata ālendrarāja had a saṅgha of a thousand trillion śrāvakas and bodhisattvasFrom this time until the essence of enlightenment is reached I take refuge in the Three Jewels I offer them my body may each of the greatly compassionate ones forever accept itas well as the roots of virtue possessed by the Lord Buddha along with his monastic community of śrāvakasThus without any doubts or reservations about these matters bodhisattvas have trust in the profound tune of the thusgone ones voiceIn all the parks the leaves flowers and fruits are goneLike an illusion or like a theater play Or like a dreamthus perceive the noble onesBlessed One it is amazing how these two holy beings devoting themselves so much to the profound and without apprehending their own names have both been developing the mind of awakening for so longYou shall teach the Dharma to many millions of living beingsThey are mendicants who have attained all the perfect highest complete powers of the mindAs he delivered this teaching without teachingand of the transcendence of wisdom consummated in the omniscient gnosisthis implies that the Elder Subhūti is the emulator of the Tathāgata because he is an emulator of somethingFor those who have passed five years are reliableone should recite it  times in a secluded place Then one will attain successWill by so doing have made Such infinite and diverse offerings to metWhen the roots of virtue of beings have fully matured and they long to look upon the Tathāgata are worthy of veneration long to listen to the Dharma and their longing is like the full moon at that time the Tathāgata appears in the world for the benefit and happiness of many beings such as gods and humans and for the sake of manifesting and propagating the Three Jewels to themNoble ones the world with its devas humans and asuras thinks and believesFearlessly they enter an assembly Their renown spreads in all directionsI set in place and protected sentient beingsWhat is entering into samāpatti It is being free of desire for the three existencesThe instant that ray of light shone forth all those buddha bhagavāns that resided in the eastern direction in hundreds of thousands of quintillions of world realms as numerous as the grains of sand in fifty Ganges Rivers were revealedNo one shall mention anything unpleasant or unfittingNoble son from their having maintained pure conduct for a long time through to their staying clear of displeasure this is how bodhisattvas areHaving no pride in that preeminence They examine and teach that preeminenceSimilarly the essential nature of omniscience is neither profound nor subtlethose who are intent on the voidness hollowness vacuity and essencelessness of all things but have not accepted that phenomena are nonarisingThey also sprinkle scented Powders upon the guidesYou bestow insight into the threefold liberationHow great must that bodhisattva be himself if his magical incarnation is thus endowed with supernatural power strength and fearlessnessplease shower the rain of Dharmaakra king of the gods then spoke to the BodhisattvaHow will one experience sufferingHis loving gaze was revered by billions upon billions of bodhisattvasdo not owing to the conditioning of their physical verbal and mental merits maintain the supremacy of the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the

smoke of black agarwoodThe Blessed One replied to BhadrapālaNow we wish to hear more about discipline patience power Wisdom skillful means concentration miracles and aspirationThus it is taught king of gods and thus you must understand itand others were built with gems that shone in all colorsMy friend I have sewn that precious jewel in the hem of your clothingTheir lifespans were seven million six hundred thousand yearsAnd the lower existences are closed to them Those are the benefits of patience do you think āradvatīputra that this wingless bird would be able to resettle among the gods of the Trāyastriṃśa realmThey use burning chaff and coals and tandoor ovens They walk on glowing rocks scorching fire or scalding water Some go to a sacred riverbank and die there They follow the course of such practicesThe realms of the higher existences are the goal of these beingsOthers because of age or learningThose who know the sixsyllable mahāvidyā will not be polluted by desire anger or stupidityWhenever a bodhisattva takes birth into his final existence and as he awakens to perfect and complete buddhahood various miracles unfoldsuch an emanation would not be connected with any phenomenon yet neither would it be separate from anythingThey will not do anything that is untimely or involves an improper objectI am overjoyed to have heard this kind of speech from the BhagavānProstrations to the tathāgata Buddha ViśvabhūAnd burned it up with the fire of my disciplineSimilarly one should know the meditative concentrations the immeasurable aspirations and the formless absorptions to be emptiness and also the applications of mindfulness the correct exertions the supports for miraculous ability the faculties the powers the branches of enlightenment and the noble eightfold path to be emptinessHe did not recite scripture or a daily recitation but would come before a bhikṣu or bhikṣunī an upāsaka or upasikā and saynanda it is because all those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage and the male and female gods whose ears have heard this transcendent perfection of wisdom will on the basis of this very root of virtue attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentBodhisattvas should never give up their training even at the cost of their lives they should be intelligent in their conductWhen the time and the conditions Are right they alight upon embodied beingsThey always practice the bases of miraculous powers And they go to various infinite realmsIt is neither blameworthyBut in fact the Tathāgata neither comes nor goesThat divine vision accompanied by the apprehension of merit sees a divine abode among the gods of the realm of desireThere was the ThusGone One the foedestroyer the completely perfect Buddha surrounded and revered by his hundredthousandfold retinueSince they have few desires they do not go searching and because they do not search they do not accumulateWhen practicing generosity by offering their feetWill follow a downward coursenot to dedicate ones merit toward other vehiclesWhen they wished to goand similarly why would they have a view concerning the applications of mindfulness and why would they have a view concerning the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold pathThe acceptance of great bodhisattva beings includes the cognition and correct exertion of those who are pratyekabuddhastAt the same time all the evil demons and deities of the demonic legions throughout the great trichiliocosm experience pain and despondency thinkingProstrations to the tathāgata Chattrottamaśrī buddha of the northwestCultivating the feeling of pleasureSimilarly how should they train in the meditative absorption of the

realitytathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas who had the same name CandrasūryapradīpaI pronounced you nanda the foremost of the learned with the disciples in mind not considering the bodhisattvasOut of compassion for sentient beingsAnd why is that Because the thusgone ones teach the Dharma to sentient beings in accord with their different levels of faith and for the sake of training themWhen all the worldly guardians in the ten directions such as Indra and Brahmā saw how beautiful the world had becomeJackals yelp without fearDear sir the Blessed Ones teachings are characterized by compassion I shall allow your going forthInasmuch as formative predispositions neither arise from anywhere nor do they go anywhere butIn the past you saw the best of beings as

eyebrows are long And who has eyes as beautiful as blooming lotuses A lion among men with a face like the autumn moonBhagavān we will teach we will expound this Dharma teaching to beings after the nirvāṇa of the TathāgataThe same transcendent perfection of wisdom has primacy for those great bodhisattva beings who inspect phenomenaMonks at that point the five ascetic companions thought to themselvesthat they are void that they are purified that they are nonarising that they are unceasing and that they are nonentitiesthe incarnated bodhisattva said Very good to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti and obeyed his instructionsHowever Subhūti if those individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who are endowed with faith tolerance serene joy confidence higher aspiration volition and renunciationReplying to the bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin the Blessed One saidIn which I experienced suffering Tormented for a long time by saṃsāras sufferingwho even depart from this assembly and in additionSimilarly the applications of mindfulness being empty of inherent existencethe blood that I have given to sentient beings as I sought supreme completely perfect enlightenment cannotThey should also praise and rejoice in others who cultivate the four applications of mindfulnessIf you ask what constitute the four supports for miraculous abilitiesMy dear sir shall we seek alms together or on our ownAh Come here arise you who are a tree of pure wisdom xxivāradvatīputra do you think that the designations of sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomena as with signs or signless constitute a bodhisattvaNow enjoy and revel in them with delight and blissThose who beat the dharmagaṇḍī are good beingsāriputra this buddha realm is beautifully adorned by such displays of the excellences of buddha realms Furthermore āriputra when the wind blows in that buddha realm it sways the rows of palm treesIt is in this way Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings set out sentient beings for the happiness of the worldsbows and says the following Venerable saṅgha please listenThey practice the transcendent perfection of generosity but they do not apprehend this transcendent perfection of generosityThe ten powers of the tathāgatas are empty of the ten powers of the tathāgatas and so with the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas which are empty of the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasClosing it with clay Temples and the like can be suppressedone should do it for the second timeSomeone utterly unborn

observe and dwell on feelings their minds are not moved by any movement of their feelings about phenomena and as their minds therefore do not dwell upon any phenomenon they do not abandon discard or relinquish the mind of awakeningDivine son understanding this utterly unarisen state is awakeningYou are doing so for the goodness benefit and happiness of a great group of beings both gods and menAll of them will have attained the higher knowledges have the realization of the discernments and be skilled in instructing beingsFriends the time has now come To offer a vessel to ākyamuniThey will proceed from one buddhafield to another buddhafield in order to venerate respect and make offerings to the lord buddhasThey turned their backs on worldly gain desiresThus he is called the TathāgataSimilarly the transcendence of the ten powers of the tathāgatas is always without fearthis lifespan stayed for this duration and experienced these kinds of pleasure and painYou do not possess the attributes the indications and the signs endowed with which it is foreordained that unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment will be attainedThose gods with their flowing hair quickly stood and

excellentlyBy enclosing the mustard fruit in the three metals one will become invisibleRemaining in the patience of selflessness And not having unyielding anger or pride Did it seem to you that the dances were well danced the songs well sung and the music well playedIt does not apprehend the giver nor does it apprehend the recipient This absence of giving and the absence of rejoicing in the ripening impact of giving āradvatīputraWhen the supreme king had heard the Dharma He was joyful very happy and enrapturedThis alone is the perfection of patiencethe ultimate absence of obscurations the revealing of all tathāgatas the consecration of all emptiness and so onIt was abundantly prosperous and happy had good crops and was delightful It was filled with many people and was as even as

Buddha about this That is excellentTheir fingers and toes are compactVimalatejā the ThusGone One declared Rely on the true meaning Dont rely on the wordsThey show them how to genuinely enter all gateways to the Dharmabeguiling to the heart and beautiful to the eyewhy did Avalokiteśvara receive the name Avalokiteśvara The Lord Who SeesSimilarly in the emptiness of internal phenomena the five eyes are nonapprehensible due to their utter purity andI was always completely satisfied by alms I offered everything and left no remainder Please O BlissGone One teach the DharmaNoble ones it is because these beings of mine have trained during the time of previous perfectly enlightened buddhasThe skillful method of the guidesAnd the dharmatā is the meaningThe moon and the sunBoys I have allowed the going forth of an invalid son of noble family so I will have to place him in the infirmaryLike thieves with their stolen goods I have destroyed them hereGiving up a kingdom is not comparableShould this benefactor of humans and gods who acts like a proud elephantBhagavān teach the Dharma to the world including its devas māras and brahmakas to beings including mendicants and brahmins and to the devas asuras and humansRoared thus this lions roar when they do not make assumptions associated with physical forms and do not make assumptions about physical formsestablishes virtue and nonvirtue establishes feelings perceptions and mental processes and then passes on to the next lifeYou are inconceivable without comparePrince your struggle shall be our struggle they respondedAdorned in the middle with a stamenNārāyaṇa even if all beings contained in the great billionfold universe had the same amount of merit as Layman Kṛṣṇa their collected insight wisdom and merit would still not match one hundredth of the amount possessed by āriputra it would not even bear comparisonthe bodhisattva great being PraśāntacāritramatiThat person too under the control of the spirit would desire feculent food from foulsmelling dirty things and take delight in itwe ourselves Bhagavān have not given rise to a single wish for such a thingSubhūti in the same manner great bodhisattva beings establish sentient beings many hundreds of billion trillions in number in the transcendent perfection of perseverance but they have not actually established any sentient beings at allBuddha qualities will not be hard to attain For the learned one who trains in it Once they have entered it they think of themselves as happy for a momentand their patience is like the earthwho are of positive disposition are the supporters of the sacred doctrines of the buddhasthe one without disturbing emotionsSubhūti because the emptiness of internal phenomena and the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities are not entitiesHe has learned scripts Even the names of which I have not heard Yet he has come to schoolSo Bhadrapāla you should view those spirits because they are formless as resembling the element of consciousnesswith regard to the inner body continue to observe the physical bodyOne should cook the resin from the bark of a pomegranate tree Together with mustard oilThat is like wanting to disturb the leader of men from his easesome mansions were made of blue lotuses pink lotuses water lily and white lotusesA monk should mindfully and attentively monitor those items of which both the receipt and its allocation are evidentBearing aloft flowers as well as ointments We bowed with folded handsSimilarly how do they purify the negativity of speech and mindIn this way the Bodhisattva remained mindful of the body as something that must be left behindCountless hundreds of thousands of light rays Came from the soles of the King of Dharmas feetMind is of an empty natureYou need to seek the yāna of buddhahoodThe sensory element of visual consciousness does not consider the expanse of realityFreed from the bondage of the kleśasWhat distinguishes themAnd having a stable aspiration for the ripening of karma The supreme human teaches that Dharma Knowing beings to have the strength and wisdom He teaches this sūtra that is like a crest jewelSimilarly they should not dwell on the fruit of entering the stream and they should not dwell on the other fruits of spiritual attainment up to and including arhatshipdeveloped widespread black erysipelas on both his thighs which did not respond to treatment and had no known cureThe crown prince Mañjuśrī applauded the Licchavi VimalakīrtiAt locations and on roads They manifest various formsOne should explain this king of tantrasImagine them on mounts of lions and horses All with one face and two handsSome tossed their feet aroundWere one person to cut off the head of another person even that would not influence the worldthey share a single defining characteristic in that they are all immaterial unrevealed unimpeded and without defining characteristicsBodhisattvas are then known as purifiers of beingsThey abide in compassion when they are not intimidated by phenomena being voidOn the way Mahāmaudgalyāyana conjured up an apparition of the godsImagine that all sentient beings had attained acceptance that phenomena are nonarising Even so not one of them would understand the field of experience of a single bodhisattva who has realized discriminating awareness and attained the meditative concentration of brave progression nor would they fathom his aspirations or the transformative power of his investigating ultimate realityNoble ones get up and brush your teethWhen Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra was in the samādhi named Indras Way Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara was in the samādhi named Ocean Deephe magically transformed the king of mountains to become level and vast without any tree stumps thorns stones pebbles or gravel and with a surrounding wall made of the seven jewelsAt that time life in this world was longHe manifested melodies sung by the glorious gandharvasIt severs Māras noose It frightens Māras entourage It scatters Māras spit It overcomes the army of afflictions It inducts one into the city of nirvāṇaand will not quickly attain the tolerance of the ultimate birthlessness of all thingsIn the same vein you should have conviction in the transcendent perfection of wisdom because all other attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are nonapprehensible There will never be birth For those who have immaculate restraintMoreover Subhūti the irreversible great bodhisattva beings who have practiced the transcendent perfection of wisdom andWithout moving from one given buddha realm they appear to pass beyond suffering in numerous buddha realmsDivine princes Physical forms are neither profound nor subtleWhen the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Candrasūryapradīpa had taught for sixty intermediate eonsToday there has been in the ten directions A vast meaning the superior words of the guides Bringing contentment to billions of beings Possessing virtue for the sake of enlightenmentA heavy transgression has occurredSubhūti all things have the modality of nonconditioningYou Who Are Renowned as Being beyond Reproach please come herehaving become a god saw the truth in the Blessed Onesthat great bodhisattva beings abiding in the emptiness of inherent existenceNoble son bodhisattvas are content with Dharma robes of the most inferior quality and have few desiresNoble son this is what is understood by a blessed buddhas marks of enormous meritThere is nothing at all comparable to the Dharma Of uncompounded quiescent ambrosia The uncompounded ambrosia of extinction and dispassion Discerned by the Sage of the ākyas through his knowledgeMay there be glory at your right handBanish all doubt and uncertainty concerning thisReject delighting in the pleasures of desires Reject the stains of rigid angerThis place exalted by gods and nāgas is ever inspiring for Dharmathis individual person is a follower on account of faith this one is a follower of the doctrine this one abides in emptiness this one abides in signlessness and this one abides in aspirationlessnessIn his unsurpassed perfect awakening he has become a perfect buddhaThey should also praise and rejoice in others who act in order to refine the buddhafieldsSon of noble family you should understand through this description the way in which bodhisattvas are free of faults and yet do not enter faultlessnessIn accordance with the aspirations made by the buddhas through this offering of clothing may I perfect the modesty humility and appearance of all beingsThey are the inconceivably numerous doorways concerning the composite

great gathering of bodhisattva mahāsattvas this great aggregation of bodhisattvas even in a hundred thousand quintillion eonsIt is immeasurable The beings and devas of this world cannot easily grasp its extent even through the perfect rūpakāyaSimilarly emptiness is not something other than sights nor are sights something other than emptinessthose who are disinclinedThey do not abandon the aspiration to enlightenmentand similarly Senior āradvatīputra the things associated with the transcendent perfection of toleranceDivine son in a manner free from reference points that is the supreme patience of a bodhisattva great beingThrough your meditation on love milk flowed from you Marvelous Sugata I pay homage to you Thus they experience their own share of karma they remain in the world of karma and they are upheld by karmaConscientiousness generositySubhūti when certain great bodhisattva beings lacking the transcendent perfection of wisdom over eons equal in number to the sands of the River Ganges rejoice in all the roots of virtuous actions of the lord buddhas of the past future and present along with their monastic community of śrāvakas and dedicate their merits toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment making common cause with all sentient beingsthose who have planted the roots of virtuous action and those who have been accepted by spiritual mentorsWhat kind of beings are these who will become tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas in the futureNext the Bodhisattva saidsee those sentient beings who have been born in the hells or as animals and those in the worlds under the sway of YamaThe religious life has been ledA short time later a small task came up prompting King Bimbisāra to say to Prince AjātaśatruThe king ordered the ministersIf you ask what is this nonapprehensionThen they induce some sentient beings to enter and become established in the ten powers of the tathāgatas the four assurances the four unhindered discernments great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasSimilarly Subhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomThe lifespan of that sugata will be A full twenty thousand intermediate eonsVenerable Lord How can bodhisattvas those who are on the vehicle of the bodhisattvas those who are on the vehicle of the śrāvakas or those who are on the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas abide in the transcendent perfection of wisdomWe will bring them good fortune prevent punishments and counter poisonsBeings out of an unparalleled wish to reach awakening said May we vanquish Māra and his horde and thus reach the deathless stateI obtained it asked questions about it preserved it recited it to others promoted itI

away from the enlightenment of buddhahood These are distinctive qualities of the first patience They do not consider whether sights are entities or nonentities and the same goes for the other sense objects up to and including mental phenomenaIn order to ripen these beings I will now practice fierce hardship and disciplineEven the name of the noble eightfold path does not exist internally nor does it exist externally and nor does it abide between these twoWhen the Bhagavān had said those words the countless innumerable tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas who had come from other world realms andSimilarly the eyes too are like a dream like a magical displayThey entered homelessness in the teaching of a sugata And dwelt like rhinoceroses in a grove of trees their progress to awakening remains irreversibleHe knows the cureand similarly I am maintaining ethical disciplineNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities fulfill the command of the thusgone onesNoble ones I

characteristicsDivine son in the same way on the ultimate level without basing myself on any phenomena I teach without teachingwild leg movements and unrestrained movements of the legs and armsWithout moving from one given buddha realm they send forth emanations into numerous buddha realms training as many sentient beings as there are to trainJust as the wind has no impediment They will know the Dharma meanings and definitionsNever seen before you have somehow appearedDo not become saddened by being criticized And like a mountain are unmoved by the eight worldly concerns Grabbing hold of the

thirtyseven aids to enlightenmentThey will go to the realm of Sukhāvatī and listen to the Dharma from Tathāgata AmitābhaReverend Saṅgharakṣita once you have returned to Jambudvīpa say to the brethren VenerablesIn accord with tradition the precious wife has been born into the warrior class She is not too tall or short too fat or thin too dark or fairthey give off smoke and flames just like a great

mentioning by name bhikṣus of the rāvakayānasay to him You can work with the two of us clearing away the rubbish heapThen young Candraprabha descended from Vulture PeakThe monk Stainless Light protested to the prostituteThey are the best artisans in the world Who benefit beings with their craftAnd within one month one becomes an intelligent personThey bowed their heads to the feet of the ThusGone Oneand utterly unrealThe light of the sun the moon every jewel and fire in the world That of any human or gods like akra and BrahmāNext they will acquire garments Just as they will meet with noble womenThe gods and humans of this trichiliocosm Are like mustard seeds puddles and fireflies and yet filled with prideAnyone who does rely upon such a person is definitely unwiseSuch is the bodhisattvas skill in protecting sentient beingsNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities live as mendicantsHe was someone who taught the Dharma with complete certainty He was someone who taught the Dharma free of doubt He was someone who taught the Dharma in its purityIn this way with the names of the five yoginīs according to the division of colors starting with the black one should anoint womenThere is a pleasant wilderness With forest thickets full of herbs To the east of Urubilvā Where the Nairañjanā River flowsAs a wishfulfilling tree they grant beings whatever they wish forAfter the nirvāṇa of the great Hero How much merit will there be For someone who listens to this kind of sūtra And having heard it rejoicesIt is having no attachment to renown It is accepting the lack of renownThat which is the sameness of nonself is the sameness of all phenomenaIf there were a man who picked up one atom from among the atoms of the element of earth in countless fifty hundred thousand quintillion world realmsand similarly they would travel through anything from a single world system to one hundred billion trillion world systems so as toTheir ethical conduct was without artificiality and they had no thoughts of ulterior profit acquisition or fameI salute the inconceivable Buddha of great power Who is the same as space and without abodebut they have not actually established any sentient beings at allThis completes the thirtythird chapter from The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten Thousand Lines entitled The ConclusionHowever āradvatīputra great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom do not at all apprehend the physical body and so forthWithout regressing to the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhas they will indeed attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentHer body is emptied by giving birth and a filthy excrementlike placenta unbearable to look at emerges from her bodyhe said Noble one I seek to go forthThe Bhagavān asked Monk what do you thinkThe training of all the buddhas Is in the nature of all phenomena The perfect buddhasWith his hand he strikes with the vajra Like a bolt shot from a crossbow it strikes downIn that way he taught dependent origination extensivelyThere he sees the Perfect Being the Bodhisattva Who shines with beauty like wellrefined goldshall provide the words of a dhāraṇīmantra for this kind of dharmabhāṇakaand because what is true of consciousness is also true of the six sense organs and what is true of the six sense organs is also true of the five acquisitive psychophysical aggregatesIn this way bodhisattvas are moist with the qualities of joy faith and delightYoung man how do the bodhisattva mahāsattvas obtain the treasure of wisdomNoble son this is the power that ensures that bodhisattvas cannot be subdued by the attacks of opponentsThose worn out by women worn out by burdensYou are one who speaks words that are never incorrect I pay homage to you who bring freedom from suffering The bodhisattvas became śrāvakas And manifested the attaining of pratyekabuddha enlightenmentI will be endowed with love for them And will uphold this supreme peace this samādhi It is the quintessence because it transcends desire It is indivisible because it transcends angerAre always free of the eight disadvantageous states And will see numerous millions of buddhas He is the one with the voice of a cuckoo birdShe was escorted by  ākya maidenshave attained and will attain individual enlightenment through having trained in this same transcendent perfection of wisdomand of the great equanimity consummated in concentration through knowledgeunderstood and realized all discriminating knowledges of the bodhisattvas andBhagavān he must have undergone many hundred thousands of quintillions of hardshipsTherefore the bodhisattvas do not cause them to doubt the discipline of the sacred doctrine which has been excellently taughtand wish to attain quickly the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood should not know the Tathāgata to be the rūpakāyaFor example Subhūti just as sixtytwo views are subsumed within the false view about perishable composites in the same way Subhūti all the transcendent perfections are subsumed in this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomWhen they have become gentle kind and honest And they forsake even their own bodiesHe has full knowledge of even the least of the possessions that I haveThey must have many male servants female servants officials and workersFor then will your body be swathed in the Buddhas mindThey discern that this body comprises the hairs of the head the hairs of the body nails epidermal skinthey bowed to him and sat to one sideIf they wish they can place as many universes as there are grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā within a single particleWhen he arrived he bowed his head to the feet of the ThusGone OneOne should meditate incisively Engaging in the union of two loversthen based on this understanding that they do not make assumptions about their dreams nor do they make assumptions on account of their dreamsnanda it is because all the attributes of the aspects of enlightenment are gathered in the transcendent perfection of wisdomNoble son each day he completely ripens a million trillion beingsor in front of those beginner bodhisattvas in various forms from that of a brahmin to that of a girlendowed with a supremely good complexion and excellent figure He was going to a pleasure groveand of omniscience and it is after imagining these that they become fixated on omniscienceMultiple aspects external and internal Are explained as its stagesThus committing themselves to striving and endeavoring for this very purpose they decide to give up stinginess and envyOf what they said to you in the forest groveto engage in passionate dispute to be inclined to quarrel to be abusive to be vicious to be haughty to be impudent to be ferocious to be malicious to be disparaging to be audacious to be improper to denigrate to lie to be fond of mental constructs and to pursue mental constructsAs they witness these terrible forms All of them ugly and misshapenAt that point hundreds of thousands of gods from the pure realms descended into the atmosphere They knew the Bodhisattvas thoughts and saidBut if I use a skillful method I will be able to bring the children out of the houseIt is skill in the vinayaThen that man would create vast bad karmathe understanding of the aspects of the path andwho were seated on a lion throne inside the stūpa smiledNow comes the maṇḍala tutelage mantraThey will hear the dreadful cries Of beings who are suffering in the hells And the sounds that are made by pretas Tormented by the suffering of no foodReverend āriputra if one were to ask a man or woman created by a magician where he or she had died to reincarnate there what do you think he or she would answerthe discernment of phenomena the discernment of definitions and the discernment of eloquenceNoble son because they possess ten qualities bodhisattvas are beings of noble birth What are those ten They areThere were those who developed an excellent aspiration Thinking I will tomorrow invite the compassionate oneIf someone had to grasp in their hand The entire element of space And having grasped it go awayBy such truth and true words as follows one who is unforgettable to beings appearing in the world is a thusgone oneplaced in a new jar filled with cool water it will stop all daily activitiesDo not be proud and do not be harsh Always have a mind that is sereneHaving paid homage and respect both to me and to that good man they disappearedThis concludes The Question of Maitreya on the Eight Qualities the fortysecond section of The Noble Dharma Discourse the Great Heap of Jewels in one hundred thousand sectionsWhen these four goddesses knew that the Bodhisattva had entered the womb of his mother they kept a constant guard over him It is condemned by all foolish beings And the tīrthikas always reject itVenerable Lord This nonapprehending conduct is the conduct of the bodhisattvasThe thusgone ones feel great compassion for sentient beings since all phenomena are free of going and yet sentient beings experience goingThen Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara made the following prophecy to Bali the lord of the asurasAfter twentyone days one will succeed even in killing BrahmāHence I will display a sign to show that there is to be a great teaching of the DharmaThe young god then had this thoughtMahauṣadhi address your questions to the Blessed One he is the gateway to wisdom and the source of pure intelligenceand in the same vein all other attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas are also neither fettered nor liberatedDātrī She Who Giveswhen the northern side was ascendant the southern side was lowWhen that sage the supreme sublime being Who had great realization was leavingBecause venerable nanda emptiness and the view of the transitory collection are not two different thingsI obtained many benefits from having belief I became attractive with faultless faculties nanda great bodhisattva beings practice all six transcendent perfectionsThen in the first of the fifth The syllable ah should be placedSamantabhadraThey will not see the appearance of a world protectorThe guides state that they have not attained nirvāṇaThough this turning of the wheel the world systems of the great trichiliocosm will shake shake more intensely and shake with utmost intensity in six waysIt is because correct exertion involves no effort to abandon or be rid of anythingFree from appropriation throughout all births and lifetimes such bodhisattvas are beyond death and birthand the land teemed with animals and peopleOn wondering Where are my parents he saw that they were among the nāgasAnd who maintain the conception of a self Will have no faith in this sūtra āriputra why do you think that eon will be called Adorned by Great JewelsMonks if you allow the going forth of those who are too youngand has the path of the bodhisattvas also not been taught commencing from the initial setting of the mind on enlightenment and continuing as far as the cultivation of the mind of the ten bodhisattva levelsThen five hundred ākya boys emerged from the city and arrived at the place where they were to demonstrate their abilities in the artsDivine being moreover when bodhisattvas see all phenomena through their pure wisdom by means of the eye of insightIt is stainless unsullied pure sublime supreme sacred outstanding everlasting enduring solid and indestructibleThey attain unequaled highest enlightenment And turn the unequaled Dharma wheel in buddha realmshe proceeded to the seat of awakening where the Bodhisattva was sittingwe shall teach this Dharma teachingThe ground will be made of the seven precious materials It will be as level as the palm of a hand There will be no mountains It will be filled with kūṭāgāras made of the seven precious materialsand imperceptible like emptinessFor many countless billion eons Just as he had prayed he purified himself Under many thousands of millions of buddhasBy that time Bhagavān the householder has become weakerAfter the monk Vīradatta had made his rounds begging for alms he went to the main templeand they are not always in a state of concentration like the Tathāgata the arhat the perfectly accomplished BuddhaAnd in the teaching of those jinas They entered homelessness and meditated on this samādhi gilded with celestial glittering goldThose beings will not hear this teaching It will not come into their handsyouthful Mañjuśrī the bodhisattva Ratnavara the bodhisattvas who had arrived from all the various buddha realms as well as the world with its gods humans demigods and gandharvas rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed OneWhy is it the knowledge of pleasant beings Because they know all forms of reverenceAnd one should endeavor always to seek and pursue what is wholesomeHe is known as the one who attained the light because he possesses the branches of awakening such as the foundations of mindfulness the authentic eliminations the bases of miraculous powers the faculties and the powers as well as tranquility and insight The way in which my son has practiced conduct Has trained well in skillful methods And how he has practiced bodhisattva conductbrought forth with the sūtra nooseWith palms pressed together he saysEven if one were to give meals food drink and clothes Bedding and seats and stainless upper robesis also its creatorSubhūti when great bodhisattva beings possess skill in means it is revealed in this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom that they may become equipoised in the meditative concentrations the immeasurable aspirations the meditative stabilities and all the formless absorptions but on arising from these states their skill in means ensures that they will not be reborn in the higher realms through the influence of those meditations nor will they be will born among the longlived godsOr just as a bucket in a well depends on a winch One unable to function without the otherThe index fingers are joined to the middle ones And the thumbs are bent belowPeople know me thusBrahmā came from his shouldersSimilarly the nature of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness is nonentityHow can they strive for the dominion of the Dharma rather than the dominion of humans and godssat fanning the Blessed OneBodhisattvas are not just patient as long as they do not find themselves in a situation where anger otherwise takes overSvastika without practicing disciplined conduct and austerities for many eonsjust as a reflection is produced because of the bodyHe arranges there for some people Inferior beings in ragged clothes Crooked oneeyed and maimed Saying Seek that working manThose who make offerings of flowers and incense To the relics of the tathāgatas To stūpas and images made of clay And to murals and stūpas made of earth Guide we will have no concern For our bodies or even our lives It is maintaining perfect behavior  It is the absence of maliceThe yakṣas and rākṣasas resting cheeks on hands brooded and said to each otherthey will again be incinerated by an inferno and after being incineratedBy defaming the enlightenment of the buddhasDuring this time King uddhodana sent a messenger every day to see the BodhisattvaFor the remainder of the meal they bludgeoned each other over the head with their iron clubsThis is what is known as greater angerThen the Blessed One comprehended that all four assemblies were gathered and presentthat is to sayThey encourage those sentient beings and cause them to rejoiceI am engaged in the practice of perfect enlightenmentasked Mahauṣadhiand similarly if they abide in cognize and are intent on feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessWhen it was hot she was given what she needed for the heatAnywhere this Dharma teaching becomes corrupted there will be strife among children spouses and parentsWhat is that single qualityYou have been Candraprabha Viśeṣagāmin and Reṇu lord of the ten directionsThe entire city of Kapilavastu awoke from its sleepFrom the element of wind up until the central mountain Imagine it to consist of enlightened bodies as numerous as there are particlesWhat Your foster father or the man who fathered youWhat is

time when there is someone present Who is astonishing because of his supreme heroismI am not ignoring youthey dedicate this practice so that sentient beings may be free of the foul smell of their base character and achieve the fragrance of the thusgone ones disciplinetwo to breastfeed himThere is NārāyaṇaThe diligence mustered by bodhisattvas is neither overly assiduous nor too weaknot concealing that one is a Dharma teacherSubhūti there are indeed no apprehensible phenomena apart from the expanse of realityLike the rain falling equally from a cloudThis was the third omenāradvatīputra just as the utter purity of self is without foundation on account of selflessnessAnd has the attainment of the discernmentsand in the same vein they practice the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdomhas transcended the five rebirths teaches the five aggregates to be selflessOnce Great TopKnotted Brahmā understood that the ThusGone One had acquiesced he rejoiced with satisfaction and gleeThe symptoms of being afflicted by a gandharva graha from my entourage Blessed One are as followsThe girl grabbed hold of the priests feet and askednor this shoreThe strength of ten bodhisattvas who have been definitively emerged for ten billion eons is the same as the strength of one bodhisattva who has been definitively emerged for one hundred billion eonsThey follow the Dharma but not based on the formless realmThus joyfully leaving home to become homeless they take ordinationOne should visualize arising from the syllable vṛm A wishfulfilling treea farmer who has reaped his crops a warrior who has won a battleWe will now speakTheir teeth bite into each other And they scatter their blood as they are being burnedWe would live the holy life in the Blessed Ones presenceOther than that they teach the Dharma freely to them at those times when they approach themNoble one if this world realm of a thousand million worlds were to be filled with rogues bandits and foes who were holding weapons in their handsthe one who has discovered the path the teacher of the pathalthough the eye consciousness arises based upon the eye and formSimilarly they understand that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are neither with attachment nor are they without attachmentIt teaches the absence of activity with respect to phenomena and is a gateway to the nonappropriation of all phenomenaNo kṣatriya brahmin vaiśya or śūdra will rely upon such a personIt radiated the sweet fragrance of the accumulation of merit and wisdomIn the same way Mañjuśrī the Tathāgata the Arhat the Perfect and Complete Buddha does not form mental constructs or conceptsIn space physical forms are not discerned nor are feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness discernedthey may focus on the vehicle of the śrāvakas instead of focusing on all sentient beingsIn one eon these buddhas appeared Among two hundred guides of the worldYou are the entrance into the signlessAt the time of death the wise proceed to the summit of mount MeruFor the sake of pleasure And those who sell flesh to eatJust as Lord ākyamuni The great Muni the ākya Lion Sat upon the Bodhimaṇḍa And roared his lions roarBut as far as the wealth of Dharma is concerned ours is betterthe concept of formative predispositionstIn this way those sons or daughters of noble family and the others will attain the eight great qualitieswho thought If they have attained such a store of qualities due to my influence it looks as if I am but a raft to themHe attained knowledge clairvoyance and discerning wisdomhe would exhort his parents brother sister wife son daughter and daughterinlaw as they went in Do not fear I will get you out safely and securely and swiftly release you from this fearful and most terrifying placeThey should not abide in the earth element They should not abide in the water element the fire element and the wind elementReverend āriputra what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female stateThere is no egotism or possessiveness They acquire the definitive tolerance of all formative predispositions which are dreamlike and the definitive tolerance of all other exemplars of the formative predispositions up to and including formative predispositions that are like a phantomThey also praise the abstention from killing living creatures and encourage others to keep abstaining from killing living creaturesLoving and compassionate and empowered by merit and wisdomThis unequaled equality is the level of peace It is śamatha and vipaśyanā devoid of attributesThe appearance of the Buddha is extremely rareWhat is the causal condition of clingingThe mediumsized herbs that grow Are the arhats whose defilements have ceased Andpay homage to and worship the ThusGone One and listen to the DharmaThis path does not lead to awakeningMañjuśrī who are those who ultimately do not realize any phenomenonfor it perfects the ten powersHe taught the Dharma to his disciples saying Monks make your beds in forests and at the foot of treesWhat are these thirtytwo qualitiesI answered It is true indeed it is true By the Buddha Dharma and SaṅghaNoble one will we too die among gods and humans only to be reborn among hell realm beings animals and spiritsWhen the flame of a lamp is extinguished it can be relit after adding sulphur powdercovered the ThusGone One with ribbons of silk studded with various gemstones and in his presence praised him with these versesso long will the tathāgatas reside in the worldThese are gods who experience formthe samādhi named Stable ConductOne will have a sweet voice Like a cuckooSurrounded by her female attendants like a goddessAnd they will listen to the Dharma with great reverence They will have all those qualitiesWhen the rishis teach that there are three yānas That is the skillful method of the guidesHe was loving toward all beings of pure faith and his attitude was virtuous steadfast and profoundMy wisdom vision had been developed my births had been exhaustedThen the goddess Prajñāpāramitā embraced the lord tightlyWho has little desire anger and delusionThe Bhagavān has praised perfect purity perfect celibacy and perfect nirvāṇaThose who have inconceivable unequaled wisdom They are never known to have any graspingIf it is permitted reverend I would obtain the going forth ordination and monkhood in the wellproclaimed Dharma and VinayaThey do not maintain discipline for the sake of gaining political authoritySimilarly Subhūti this supreme vehicle the Great Vehicle too makes no reference to any setting of the mind on enlightenment from the first to the tenthkumbhāṇḍas pretasEven if as many millions of māras as there are Ganges sands Came before them in the forms of buddhasThen the great mathematician Arjuna uttered the following versesMerely by his touch they fell to the groundWhen beings take delight In the lower inferior yānaWhoever thinks I have attained I have realized is overly proud in the discipline of the well taught DharmaYou are skilled in the supreme actions of knowledgelong for solitudeO Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa come come Hū phaṭthis dharmatā is invariable it is the invariability of the dharmas the dharmadhātuProstrations to the category of extensive scripturesHow could the māras and evil ones Create an obstacle for them It is because no dharmas are perceivedTheir minds were at peace they always had the conduct of protectors And they were blessed by the guides of the worldThey do not engage with the notion that physical forms are void or that they are not voidThus noble son no one can see or hear Bodhisattva Mahāsattva AvalokiteśvaraThus bodhisattvas differentiate and arrange the infinite displays of great palaces of distinct Dharma teachingsThis way of the Dharma is always constant The nature of the Dharma is always illuminatingTherefore they do not consider anyone who may seek to censure the transcendent perfection of wisdomMany times have you demonstrated such diligenceWith victory banners blazing with gems And the vase of precious jewels they are happy day and night and  their physical sensations of comfort and pleasure are never lostIf that bodhisattva mahāsattva bhikṣu who possesses this samādhi were to become ill afflicted by a powerful illnessIntoxicated childish ones are confusedThis concludes the noble Mahāyāna sūtra The Rice SeedlingHe also established countless innumerable townspeople in irreversible progress toward the highest enlightenmentthat have been born from eggs born from wombs born from warm moisture or born miraculouslymasteredI see the body as impure filled with masses of wormsCut out his tongue With a jagged knifeThey will then sit completely upright and slowly loosen their postureIn short desire occurs whenever there is craving for any of the requisites of lifeconduct that is unstained conduct that has not declined conduct that is unattachedIndeed they dedicate those gifts toward omniscience andIt should similarly be applied to other phenomena up to and including the mental faculty and feelings conditioned by sensory contact that is mentally compoundedNoble son bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities access emptinessAt that time a fortuneteller versed in ritual and the art of reading signs came to the village and prophesied that someone would attain immortality thereBhikṣus in a single moment you are born you age you die you transmigrate and you are rebornHaving completed their approach to monkhood they stood with the deportment of monks who had been ordained for one hundred yearsthey become absorbed at will in the formless absorptions up to and including the absorption in the cessation of perceptions and feelingsThen they circled around the Bodhisattva and his mother three times before departingthe aforementioned sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who do notSunetra uddhānana Netraśuddha Viśuddhanetra and Anantanetrabanners flags music musical instruments flags of victory and precious monasteriesStill divine son relatively this is how disturbing emotions are

themHis body is beautifully embellished with the eighty excellent signs He is the foremost among menKāśyapa consider a further analogyAlas On the contrary this is Māra or a man emanated by the evil Māraand who holds the DharmaTherefore the tathāgatas are established intimately dependent on this transcendent perfection of wisdomtherefore I shall teach you a parableThe real nature of the past future and present and the real nature of the Tathāgata are one and the same real nature They are not two but indivisibleThis completes The Sūtra on ImpermanenceHe ripened those who were now in his company as friends due to the power of their previous aspirations and their accumulated roots of virtueOn this topic it was said The heroic ones give away all their possessionsAll possessed of different formsand thus he understood that the two wanderers were like fruit ripe for the plucking The time to train them had comeThey are void hollow vacuous and like spaceThese words should be spoken three timesbut the element of consciousness is not tainted by the offensive way they liveWith all our lust surely his heart should have meltedHe is without reproachThe carts were made of the seven precious materialsDoes it abide in that which is apprehended by the eyeThrough contemplating a single word All of them will be meditated onThis earth with its mountains and forests may perish And so may the waters of the oceanAfter searching everywhere to no avail they gave up Dispirited and downcast they saidIt was decorated with flecks of divine gold of prime quality and studded with precious gems on all sidesbeing fearless in voluntary reincarnations That goddess said to me That whoever gives to the bhikṣu The flesh and blood of a human Will cure him of his evil illness When they meditate on these things over many eons dispensing generosity and similarly maintaining their ethical discipline cultivating tolerance undertaking perseverance achieving meditative concentration and cultivating wisdomVenerable Lord if great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom think I am practicing the transcendent perfection of wisdom I should cultivate itIn the same way the element of consciousness leaves the body behind Then after assuming virtue and nonvirtueThat blessed thusgone one taught the Dharma exclusively within the three vehiclesand with a great cry came down to the shoreThe monarch saw the two dharmabhāṇakas And with the greatest joy he approached them One should then bury the effigy face down in a cemeterySimilarly may you realize all the natural expressions of speech on the basis of two three and up to a hundred and a thousand syllablesall things are without support because they are empty of inherent existencedisplaying those extrasensory powers illuminates the world systemsSubhūti it is because those lord buddhas great bodhisattva beings pratyekabuddhasthe inconceivably numerous kinds of reasoning concerning the kleśas

mindfulness consummated by the six remembrancesgave him milk that had been churned sixteen times and mixed with honey to drinkMātṛ MotherThey are learned people who reject what should not be done They are wise people who are always doing what should be donenanda there are seven rākṣasīs who travel as far as one hundred miles when they smell the scent of bloodBhagavat where did these light rays come fromand were instructed thus were taught thusGreat persons teach the Dharma through their actions and not their wordsHe spent that night preparing a great amount of excellent delicious food and drinkThe others attained the result of becoming a nonreturnerThe benefit accomplished By the bhikṣu KṣemadattaWith veneration seek the Dharma Having heard it then become thatif you give a prize to everyone who wins a debate before long your lands of Aṅga and Magadha will themselves be victors prizesThen many thousands of divine princes congregating in the midst of the heavens cheered long and loudWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas excellent power of insight consist inThe fact that I live my life by love does not seem to make anyone happyin the same vein the refrain indicated in the preceding part of this chapter should also be applied hereThat which has no abode is thatnesshonesty due to a natural absence of duplicityThough they practice dhyāna They do not remain in existenceAlas my dear one renowned in heaven and on earth You who are a revered tree of wisdomAlthough he soon killed you and carried you off you remained patientShe should be without any pride or willfulness like a servantTheir fingers and toes are taperingIt is the absence of pollution in the mind It is rejecting incorrect viewsThey said Virtuous One without you this Heaven of Joy will lose its splendorIf you ask why it is because it is their very natureWho will become realizedSubhūti if for example an illusionist or the apprentice of an illusionist had conjured up a large gathering of people and established them on the path of the ten virtuous actions and so on until he had established them in the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasthe body vibratingHowever relatively the vinaya of the bodhisattva great beings overcomes all habitual patternsSister where do you think the fire comes fromand all of them had thoroughly cultivated the dharmas of emptiness no sign no wish no arising no birth and no existenceImagine Nārāyaṇa that every being in the fourcontinent world system were now to acquire as much merit as a wheelbearing monarchThey dispatched all the yakṣa generals To the four directions sayingThese beings have short lives and no faith and I do not have the power either to carry them to a different place or to subdue themand in the same vein they apprehend the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path and develop a view of them in an apprehending mannerThey have these qualities through knowing the nature of phenomena I am practicing the emptiness of internal phenomenaWhat is rejecting incorrect conduct It is preserving your good qualitiesGentlemen summon those officersand they thus proceed to the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahoodMonks seven days after the bodhisattvas of the past were born their mothers also diednanda this wisdom of the thusgone ones spontaneously accomplished and beyond formation which unimpededly perceives all phenomena of the past future and present is indeed uniqueVenerable Lord Those who seek to liberate sentient beings from cyclic existence and who would don the great armor are actually seeking to liberate spaceHe whose Intelligence is Like an Ocean of Arrayed Jewelsthere are also some sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who receive retain master and recite this transcendent perfection of wisdomRespect has been paid thus return to your own placesNeedless to mention that they also do so for the inhabitants of foreign cities and landsEach of the other bodhisattvas also brought forth magical emanationsis the noncultivation of the sensory element of the tongue the sensory element of tastes and the sensory element of gustatory consciousnessThe Blessed One mentally consented to this request yet remained completely silentName is the four aggregates starting with sensationIn the east he shines like a blue lotus to

than thisdescended to the levels of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas and failed to enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvasScattered excellent flowers and supreme incense xlivThat kind of Dharma was taught solely for the purpose of ripening beings and bringing them into the teachingSo how is the conditional relation in outer dependent arising to be seenWhenever bodhisattvas practice the

abide in these meditative stabilities have been foreordained by the tathāgatas of the past and are being foreordained by the tathāgatas who are alive at present residing in the world systems of the

unpleasant they do not want to hear them do not like them and do not enjoy themHow can they endeavor to engage mentally with the transience of the life of gods and humans and thus become free of expectationsHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of the aspects of emptiness and the aspect of voidnesshave attained and will attain arhatship through having trained in this same transcendent perfection of wisdomThis moreover is in terms of the ultimate and not in terms of the conventional nature of thingsAfter agreeing to that every day he partook of ambrosia in the land of the nāgas before returningSimilarly physical forms are all neither fettered nor liberated because physical forms are voidYou may wonder how bodhisattvas cannot be ignoredBased on ignorance formations

Mañjuśrī they exchanged some joyful and delightful conversation and thenfor it leads one to let go of all material thingsSeeming to engage in many meritorious deeds of givingSince this is the location where the breath is constrictedFrom the superimposition of a self comes the manifestation of viewsIf you ask what are the faculties that will enable knowledge of all that is unknownHaving incanted a piece of chalk one should repeatedly write this mantra on the ground andWhat is the extent of the stock of merit of those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritageand well trained in archery who had also handled sharp weaponsThus since these two are endowed with supreme qualities One will be the son and one is worthy to be the motherSugata enjoy these airborne palaces

established in the highest enlightenmentYoung man that is purity of actionBeings bound to their desires Are continuously swept away in the streamWhen the white cloth becomes black that is like an accumulation of bad karmaand for a long time lived chastely There is the meditative stability named Manifest Attainment of Modalities  There is the meditative stability named Unity of Aspects  There

doctrine is neither enhanced when it is explainedMay I be a protector an assistant A support and a refuge for all beingsand with that he approached a monk and said Noble one I seek to go forthVenerable Lord if the notion of the sensory element of the eyes as afflicted is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of the sensory element of the eyes as purified become a bodhisattvaIn this way he arranged for himself a very fine seat of grassHe became an excellent bhikṣu dharmabhāṇaka Who was very learned and had eloquent speech for those engulfed in darkness like the sunThey are not low nor middling nor highand dedicated himself to the practice of meditation on itand in which nonarising noncessation nonconditioning and nonentity are not realizedFurthermore those who give such alms reverend have neither great merit nor small meritand embrace wisdomOne should prepare an infusion of the three myrobalan fruitsplease reveal themselves to me and allow me to hear the DharmaSimilarly Subhūti this Great Vehicle too is neither empty nor is it not emptyYou create joy but not joy in desire You create love and not a mind of angerIn the presence of lords of the world In millions of buddha realms And why is that Because when even gods endowed with minor roots of virtue possess a voice that is both profound and pleasingthe friend sews a priceless jewel into the hem of his clothing saying This is a precious jewelIn that respect what is signlessness and what is the lack of reference pointSpeaking such words is the second root transgression for a beginner bodhisattvadoes not cause one to know the world system of desireVenerable āradvatīputra for as long as such beings take birth within the realms of existence that is what we call afflictionimmaterial unrevealed and unobstructedthey teach the perfection of generosityAlthough with their divine ear they hear the teachings of all the blessed buddhas ultimately they hear nothing whatsoeverTheir minds deluded they are frightened and dullIn the same way in the southeastO you who shout pheṭ Phe phe ha ha hā hā pheṭMonks due to the strength of the Bodhisattvas merit and the power of his insight his body instantaneously changed as soon as he took in solid foods In one moment his body regained its previous beautiful lotuslike lusterof devas humans beings in the hellshow then could this illusory person after training in the transcendent perfection of wisdom attain emancipation in omniscienceTheir limbs fingers and toes are very softThe blessed buddhas also eradicate any viewpoints that bodhisattva great beings who have engendered devotion to the Dharma might have and endow them with the genuine view insteadThey do not consider whether sights are calm or not calm and the same goes for the other sense objects up to and including mental phenomenaThe consciousness produces a body from the contact of the parents the presence of a gandharva and entities that are the support of actionsour entourages venture out everywhere throughout the ten directions in search of food and drinkFeeling is the causal condition of cravingWhen you look at her your eyes will not be satedAlso those who make stūpas out of stone Those who make them from sandalwood and agarwoodFrom the moment they smell that perfume the bodhisattvas attain the concentration called source of all bodhisattvavirtuesin such cases the activity of the formative factor is empty the agent of the formative factor is empty and the fruits of the formative factor are also emptyIf you ask why it is called the transcendent perfection of mundane generosityMañjuśrī how does a bodhisattva practice within the conduct of a bodhisattvaIt is far removed from the transcendent perfection of wisdomWhen the monks in the vicinity have gatheredThey are  they give away all their possessions without becoming proud that they are pureSo it goes without saying what it can do for a body endowed with consciousnessThereupon the Bhagavān spoke these versesUnderstanding that all things are without defining characteristicsThat appropriate time has somehow arrived today And that is why I shall teach

attained enlightenment will be estimableand they do not make assumptions about the other sensory elements up to and including the sensory element of mental phenomenaand indulged all their desires a

practice generosity But who have not heard this peace this stainless samādhiAnd they understand that the present body is similar in essence to grass trees walls rocks or visual aberrationsTherefore

then asked the Lord BuddhaSenior Subhūti why should one know that these great bodhisattva beings will never be separated from the transcendent perfection of wisdomI should try to persevere in this mannerso that they know accurately according to the karma of beingsBy these words of truth May my poison disappearThey start from Krakucchanda and end with the Tathāgata Roca who will be the last to be bornShould the body be smeared with it All kākhorda will be severedand the sughoṣak to where there stood two palaces strewn with beds and divans replete with goddessesThey will not pierce wisdoms

sorrowa counterfeit path that is indeed subsumed in the mundane conduct associated with cyclic existencethat there are no other philosophersBut my body was not harmed If you ask why physical forms are neither fettered nor liberated and similarly why feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are neither fettered nor liberated it is because physical forms are nonexistent and because feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are nonexistentthrough city walls and through mountainsOther mendicants or brahmins live with people and are engaged in plenty of social activityThe prince then washed a begging bowl and had a Dharma robe cut sewn and dyedAt the stūpa devas of the Trāyastriṃśa paradise scattered coral tree and great coral tree flowers on the

propose a mathematical problem and I will calculate itSimilarly they neither associate feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness with present events nor do they disassociate them therefromJust as when the long evenly balanced legs of a jar are placed on level groundNever will they shudder or lose heart Such is the bodhisattvas vajralike diligenceA rain of divine flowers felland likewise with regard to those commencing from the four applications of mindfulness and extending as far as the noble eightfold pathTheir minds never engage with the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhasWhy is that The Protector waits for an appropriate time And when he sees that time has come he teaches itThese are the attributes of bodhisattvasSimilarly they may attract by the meditative stability of aspirationlessness and so forth those who are attracted by the meditative stability of emptiness those who are attracted by the meditative stability of

superior wise man Who miraculously goes to billions of realms As he reflected on the conduct of past buddhas and the way to benefit all sentient beingsNor do they maintain the supremacy of their ethical discipline and ascetic disciplinesSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who possess such attributes indications and signs should know that they are irreversibleThey were Brother jñātakauṇḍinya

on the transcendent perfection of wisdomWise ones understand the mind in that way That is what is called the supreme restraint of the mind In this buddha realm even the names of hearers and solitary buddhas do not existWould you want to wake up the king of the animalsThis concludes Dwelling in Happiness the thirteenth chapter of the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good DharmaIn this way Subhūti do great bodhisattva beings Abiding in the transcendent perfection of ethical disciplineWhy is it a treasure of wisdom Because it is meditationThose who apply themselves to upholding the sacred Dharma are worshipping the buddhas of the past the future and the presentBecause the shapeshifter had greater exposure to Buddhist customs than the others he was respectful deferentialBrāhmans who have mastered the six branches of Vedic learning Are also born from itThen the lord will enter his bodyYoung man what do you thinkshould become skilled in the wisdoms of the three kinds of patienceanything else up to and including omniscienceare nonapprehensible the three vehicles are nonetheless establishedThey abused and scolded himAnd within the teaching of that Guide In that time he taught this sūtraBecause ultimately they are all utterly and entirely unarisenand similarly the feelings originating from sensory contact that is visually compounded and so on up to the feelings arising from sensory contact that is mentally compoundedHarboring wrong views they revile the noble onesThey have a sense of modesty They have stabilityIt is born of all the transcendencesFor many millions of eons you have aimed for thisPossessing the syllable ci is one yellow in color who shines brightlyGhoṣānana highest of humans Had a lifespan of a hundred million years They all left behind

consist inThey will use the saṅghas seats stools clothing bags cushions and beds which are prohibited to themWhat has become of the teacher Sañjayin His time cameāradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving the six transcendent perfections and in the same vein all the aforementioned fruitional attributes up to and including the eighty minor marks as entitiesMonks on that occasionCoral is used for enthrallmentTo those who recite the mantra continuously the events taking place in the three worlds will be revealedBecause these hellbeings do not disconnect from their consciousness they do not reach the point of deathTheir fangs look like elephant tusksThus he settled into the fourth meditative concentration perfectly pristine with impartiality and mindfulness unconnected with pleasure or painwhen Mahāmaudgalyāyana allowed the going forth of Upāli and a band of seventeen healthy new youths and ordained themFor endless quintillions of eons They would still not understand its meaning In distinction from childish ordinary beings this is the activity of nonactionSimilarly there are those who owing to their skill in means cultivate wisdom and so forth with a mind that does not resort to notions of I and mineThe definitive meaning is the ultimate meaningWent to forests cliffs and mountain summits And there reached the highest enlightenmentThe king is a nihilist Hence this is not a worthy place for the Bodhisattva to take birth eitherNoble son bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities are welcomed by akra Brahmā and the guardians of the worldUsing every mode of worship and respect honor him as much as you can with jeweled umbrellas victory banners flags flowers incense garlands ointments divine garments ornaments and vessels of many kindsLord these five hundred young Licchavis are truly on their way to unexcelled perfect enlightenmentHe had found the light and all darkness had disappeared for himThe numerous bodhisattvas were heartened by this Were filled with joy and praised and lauded himThe Bodhisattva perfectly understands with a single movement of his mind All the primary and subsidiary mental states conceptions and opinions That belong to all beings throughout the three times without exception Whether they be inferior or superior narrow or broadThe domain of living by the eightfold path without even perceiving any evil paths such is the domain of the bodhisattvaBhagavat when is Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara comingI was defining the expressions of that discourse by teaching the meaning of impermanence suffering selflessness and peacewho has a lotus faceEven when beginner bodhisattvas hear the extremely profound DharmaThe wise ones attain the inconceivable qualities of a buddha Subjugate all māras and reach the highest enlightenment iThat merit cannot be calculatedeven a fraction of it cannot be calculated there is no suitable analogy for it and there is no suitable simile for itThe expelled nāga who was now disguised as an elderly monk caretaker saw the six approaching from off in the distancerefrain from wine and beverages and even waterIt then occurred to him When there is no birth old age and death do not happen Old age and death are prevented by preventing birthThey will not quarrel and will not answer questions with an answer from the rāvakayānaThey will think Such is my Teacher the Blessed One I have found what is excellent to findTheir blood vessels and nerves are inconspicuousThey have eliminated even the minor kleśas And thus are trained in the restraint of the body became instantaneously free from suffering and filled with every happinessMaking common cause with all sentient beings they dedicate that gift of the sacred doctrine toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentI proclaim thatSimilarly it is owing to this transcendent perfection of wisdom that the ten powers of the tathāgatas are distinguishedJust as noble sir without going out into the great ocean it is impossible to find precious priceless pearlsIt would not be good for the powerful gods or for the bodhisattvas coming from the various buddhafields to hear such wordsThey do not come into being from karma kleśas parents and the primary elementswill attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment by means of wisdom that is instantaneously endowed with the adamantine meditative stabilityHe is called the one who has transcended the domain of Māra and the one who has conquered the retinue of MāraWithout rising from my couchThe royal palace Is equipped with four gates The first gate is made of gold The second is made of silver The third is a crystal gate The fourth is adorned with goldBoth she and the weaver should eat milkporridgeAnd they have no longing for a region and no longing for a town That is the uniqueness of this attainment of samādhi iiithey are skilled in resting in hundreds of thousands of samādhis they have developed the great higher knowledgesdo not wound those who are without woundsI said I will go to those gardens and the various flowerfilled pools in three days timeThe same conditions apply to suspensions meted out for refusing to amend ones behaviorAll the particles in the world And all that can be conceived of as dustWhen they exert themselves in diligence they extol themselves and think Those other monks are lazy and lack diligence yet they enjoy the offerings of the faithful They are not worthy of even enjoying water from a water containerBhagavān in this assembly there are many hundreds who are like meSimilarly Subhūti one who wishes to attain emancipation in things without defining characteristics merely wishes to attain emancipation in the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline in the transcendent perfection of tolerance in the transcendent perfection of perseverance in the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and in the transcendent perfection of wisdomHaving given in to desire one feels no shame or shyness at allThey pay homage to you Supreme BipedBut instead has love for everyone equally Māra is the supreme lord who holds sway over the desire realm the most powerful and evil demonthen teach the doctrine so that these applications of mindfulness might become voidThey string up flags And erect millions of bannersThe Dharma is peace and pacification because it is free of desireIs my dream a genuine predictionLikewise some although they hear of the buddhas manifestations And his strengths awakened intent does not arise in themMañjuśrī a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the result of a oncereturnerIn the same way Subhūti individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who are endowed with faith tolerance confidence higher aspiration willingness volition and renunciationThese defining characteristics through which the tathāgatas have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood are profoundYoung man at that time and in those days King Jñānabala ruled over Jambudvīpaand fruits the illness would not subside In despair as he was dying he made this prayerOne lived for many hundreds of thousands of yearsAnd they see those who are the illumination of the worlds Who are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges then young man those bodhisattva mahāsattvas liberate all beings from all the sufferings of existenceYearning for nectar with the virtuous thoughtYou may wonder how bodhisattvas resemble bonfiresThen the Bhagavān said to the youth Candraprabhaand the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood will be quickly reachedThen the great bodhisattva the great being Vajrapāṇi supplicated the Blessed One with these wordsVenerable Lord if the notion of the eyes as entities is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of the eyes as nonentities become a bodhisattvaone billion realms of the Gorgeous HeavenFor one thousand eons the Bodhisattva practiced discipline and his faculties are at peaceand were given names appropriate to their patrilineagemove and shift with the swiftness of mind remaining involved in activities as far as space extendsIn those manystoried palaces there are seated tathāgatas who teach the Dharma to the humans in JambudvīpaO White Acala accept this flower Hū phaṭThey will teach all that the Tathāgata has taughtFor one who renounces all mad carelessnessMañjuśrī what is the gateway to all dharmasMañjuśrī thus does the bodhisattva follow the wrong waysThe gods in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings told those in the Heaven of the ThirtyThree The gods in the Heaven of the ThirtyThree told those in the Heaven Free from Strife The gods in the Heaven Free from Strife told those in the Heaven of Joy and the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations The gods in the Heaven of Joy and the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations told those in the Heaven of Making Use of Others Emanations Finally they announced and proclaimed this to the gods of the Brahmā realmsIt is the seat of liberation because it does not intellectualizeSimilarly the acceptance of great bodhisattva beings includes the cognition and correct exertion of those who are tied to one more rebirth those who are no longer subject to rebirth and those who are arhatsWhoever has accomplished the practice and developed qualities Will be adored by devas asuras and yakṣas The ones who maintain the samādhi of peace difficult to attain Will have kings as their attendants There were countless bodhisattva mahāsattvas who held the supreme Dharmabut relative truth itselfHaving meditated well on the brahmavihāras He saw eight hundred million buddhasIt is speaking little It is speaking softly It is speaking slowlywere to extensively teach explain analyze elucidate and genuinely demonstrate these noble meanings and noble words of the transcendent perfection of wisdom to othersIn the same manner he will not teach the sacred doctrine according to the notions that physical forms are utterly pure or that they are not utterly pure they resolve struggle strive persevere with tenacity and rightly aspire that virtuous attributes which have not yet arisen might be developed andYou must not imagine thatIt is lifeless because it is free of birth and deathSenior Subhūti you should be established as supreme among those who teach the sacred doctrineThe Blessed One was in the Realm of the ThirtyThree GodsThereby with eyes that have been freed from blindness They become enlightened attaining the peace of buddhahood Should train in this goodness And become a buddha with the ten strengths The remaining great bodhisattva mahāsattvas definitive knowledge of all the afflicted and purified mental states and their emergence with respect to the faculties powers branches of enlightenment aspects of liberation meditative concentrations meditative stabilities and formless absorptionsFor the sake of just a single being I am ready to bear the suffering of the Hell of Incessant Pain until that being enters the field of the transcendence of suffering without any remainder of the aggregatesOthers said The Pradyota family in the city of Ujjayinī has a great army and many mountsthe four formless meditative absorptionsHaving again made her assume the bow postureThe vajra surface of the ground where the throne stood was delightful and smooth like the palm of a handI have discovered the supremely sublime and astonishing absoluteBy means of his absorption a light known as eradicating the reference points and ignorance of all beings shone forth above his head from his crown protuberanceāradvatīputra the nine serial steps of meditative equipoise are merely conceptualizedIn accordance with the aspirations taught by the buddhas through this offering of beds and pillows may I confer the loftiness of permanently abandoning all obscurations of all beings the divine abodes of Brahmā that are the sleeping chambers of the thusgone ones and the gift of elevationThe yogī moves the downward breathAlas you were to me the scent of flowers You brought delight to the retinue of consorts with song and musicThis noble teacher too has strayed onto a spurious path He pursues fully a ruinous pathone will become eloquent learned skilled in writing and able to remember all that one has learnedYoung man when bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have great compassion andBy the majesty of the Buddha Vipaśyin The power of ikhin The true words of Viśvabhū And the absorption of Krakucchanda By the wisdom of he who is known as Kanaka The supernatural power of Kāśyapa And the might of the Lion of the ākyas May the medicines transform into ambrosiaJust so āriputra living beings born in the same buddhafield see the splendor of the virtues of the buddhafields of the buddhas according to their own degrees of purityThis phenomenon has no body There is no body in it at allHe is known as the one who sees all phenomena with unobscured wisdomHe went inside Jetavana Monastery bowed his head to the Bhagavats feet and sat to one sideAnd they are those who have honored them And heard from them this kind of Dharmaand similarly when they establish cognize and become fixated on the notion that physical forms are nonentitiesEven Brahmā will be obedient to themYou should read themWhy son I must go out to defecateThey let those in need of arms take their arms those in need of legs take their legs those in need of eyes take their eyes those in need of meat take their flesh those in need of blood take their blood those in need of bones take their bones those in need of marrow take their marrow those in need of a head take their head or those in need of all their limbs and organs take them allThus they retain such teachings contemplate them practice them analyze them and become inspired by themThe temple in which the Bodhisattva had dwelt while in his mothers womb was carried off by Brahmā lord of the Sahā World and the other gods of the Brahma realm up into their realm where they enshrined the temple in a memorial and made it an object of worshipBhagavān in that time beings will be wicked have few roots of merit be arrogant be devoted to gain and honor engage in roots of demerit be difficult to guide have no interest and be filled with disinterestperceive with their own minds the minds of other sentient beings and the minds of other individuals exactly as they areinasmuch as they are attentive to mental images Subhūti to that extent there is attachmentYou radiate like a thousand suns You are as luminous as a full moon There has never been one like you In this world of gods and menanother bodhisattva might establish a single sentient being in the state of irreversibilityWhat is the root of materialityto be indolent to be lazy to disparage oneself to be undignifiedOthers words and ones own correct mental engagementand they should gather a single syllable within the fortytwo syllablesMeditating on my form And identifying perfectly with meDoes the light of the sun accompany the darknessA section indexand similarly when they establish cognize and become fixated on the notion that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are impermanentMonk as phenomena are nothing but void they are nothing whatsoeverThis same refrain should be extensively applied also to the

Which are unexaminable and unquantifiableAnd yet Mañjuśrī a semblance of him offering sight of himself appears among all the classes of gods by the power of his own previous roots of what is wholesome

fourth sense field of mastery refers to the miraculous perceptual transformation that ensues when one who perceives inner formlessness regards yellow external forms yellow colors yellow appearances and yellow reflections such as the yellow form yellow color yellow appearance and yellow reflection of the cassia flower or excellent yellow cloth from Vārāṇasī In the same way one who perceives inner formlessness regards yellow external forms yellow colors yellow appearances and yellow reflections and understands these forms having attained mastery over them and sees them having attained mastery over themMañjuśrī said Venerable āradvatīputra what do you think Is the nature of the realm of phenomena something that was bound in the past and later liberatedHis form is handsome Sublime and wellproportionedJust like dreams they cannot satisfy since one is grasping at a false appearanceMañjuśrī what are the types of disturbing emotionsthey perceive that all the other sensory elements up to and including the sensory element of mental consciousness are empty of the inherent existence of mental consciousness and the other sensory elementsThe state of Brahmā and the state of akra Are not difficult for them to attainJust as they teach kings and great ministers thoroughly so also do they genuinely teach outcasts and their offspringVenerable Lord Are there not some among the classes of

themselves Once I am liberated from this helllike wombExcept for some inferior living beings Without any intelligence at allOnly those guilty of the five deadly sins can conceive the spirit of enlightenment and can attain buddhahood which is the full accomplishment of the qualities of the BuddhaThe thusgone ones feel great compassion for sentient beings since all phenomena are free of desire and yet sentient beings give rise to desireThey quickly attain the eight and two bhūmis And swiftly subjugate the māras iIn just a moment we have obtained today A multitude of great excellent jewels We are all astonished to have heard That which we had not thought of nor wished for at allat that time bodhisattvas will memorize read recite and master the vast discourses the vast discourses of great meaning and power and the teachings that are like the mother of all the sacred DharmaThen there came a rain of divine food with supreme flavors and they were completely filledThrough all the secrets of enlightened body and mind And enlightened speech in their entirety One will quickly meet with awakeningSubhūti one should know that it is for that reason that great bodhisattva beings don the great armorIt is not stopped by anybodyHis world will be known as Painted with Many JewelsAlas these beings have been sick for a long timeAt this those bodhisattva mahāsattvas responded with these versesWithout perfecting the transcendent perfection of wisdom they will not attain emancipation in omniscienceThe road on which the Bodhisattva was to proceed had been sprinkled and swept sprayed with perfumed waterNor should they abide in the notion that the aggregates from physical forms up to and including consciousness are afflictedSome had swollen bellies and weak bodies with their bones sticking out They had broken noses bellies like barrels and feet round as ballsThey do not emerge based on the impurities of a father and mother and the various embryonic stagesWhen practicing

Including gods renunciants and priests Be healthy and free of feverHomage to all buddhas and bodhisattvasIs this a special result that has occurred through the blessing of the deity Maheśvara Nārāyaṇa or some other deity Have they descended to this levelso that twelve hundred beings from among the harem and the assembled people from the land towns and countryside developed the aspiration to highest complete enlightenmentFriends what can I do akra respondedWith a threatening gesture Holding an aśoka twigAnd we will fearlessly teach this sūtra In the middle of the assemblyOn the relative level concentration is a gateway to pliability of mindYou can take from what is not my core but not from my coreThey are killed and destroyed And their existences are terrible Different kinds of melodious sounds also emanated from those jewels as a rain of a multitude of jewels showered downWithout superimposing anything on phenomena he understands that they are all the same in their very sameness the very same just like spaceAnd a hundred thousand various parks With thousands of walkways seats and bedsWhat are those ten They are as follows Bodhisattvas worship and venerate the thusgone ones by means of worshiping the Dharma not through material worshipBy whatever wickednessO Bhagavān where does the eye come fromMonks on the stretch between the Nairañjanā River and the seat of awakening the gods of wind clouds swept the road for the Bodhisattva while the gods of rain clouds sprinkled his path with scented water and scattered flowers along the wayAnd also knowing their attitude I give them the teaching of the extensive sūtras Subhūti there are also foreordained great bodhisattva beings who practice this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomfor it eliminates overt fixation on the selfYou should firmly obey thisWe can however set up some spare seats and sayI have taught this maṇḍala of powders To accomplish the benefit of the worldTherefore all women should be viewed As goddesses on all occasionsHaving incanted clothesSenior Subhūti why do you say that the imperishability of physical forms is not physical formsby singing them songs in that same way I shall sing in order to make an offering to the god of gods the Tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened BuddhaAlas these beings have been taken by prideIt is like a torch for dispelling all darknesswe also

any dharmathis entire Sahā world realm would not be enough for the price of two karṣa of that kind of perfumeAlthough they have set their minds accordingly on enlightenment and practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom through skill in means they will not enter into the meditative stabilities of the buddhaswhich has been eloquently expressed and who then intend to defame this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom within the assemblyBy using different meanings I make their view correctWe will ensure that wealth and grains are well providedIf you ask why Subhūti it is because physical forms do not exist and are nonapprehensible Similarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness do not exist and are nonapprehensible This being the case how could they possibly come and goIn the same way Subhūti those individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who have a modicum of faithToday I have obtained my family fortune and I am happyI have neither seen it nor heard it May I come to realize This immortal and peaceful stateKnow that the teaching has implied meaning And may they be free of any doubtTherefore I will definitely practice generosity by offering flowers and flower garlandsSubhūti the real nature does not come from anywhere does not go anywhere and does not even abide anywhereTo reach the state of awakening Venerate the guide of humankindit is like the way that the ocean is supreme over all rivers lakes and pondsIn the same way one should practice with a golden yakṣa starting with Jambhala Maṇibhadra Pūrṇabhadra and CibikuṇḍalinThey do not truly see any knowing apart from what is knownand with hands together in homage they should honor those dharmabhāṇakas by making offerings to them of flowers incense perfume

anger and dullnessThe Blessed One criticised stealing in many ways and praised esteemed honored and extolled the forsaking of stealingHe has great power through miraculous powers He is a father to the worldMay I ask O lordshould retain hold and master this very transcendent perfection of wisdom and extensively reveal it to othersThrough the essential nature of all roots of virtue they reveal the essential nature of a bodhisattvaSenior Subhūti does arising arise or else does nonarising ariseNever gain wicked friends Have friends who are nobleenter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas and attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentāradvatīputra For these reasons you should understand that the views bodhisattvas might adopt and the deluded minds which they might have are both designated as fixationShould be placed on a copper plate and blended with the milk of a woman When applied to the eye it will cure diseases of the eyelord buddhas who are alive and present in the world systems of the ten directions numerous as the sands of the River GangesThey conceal and reveal Turn back and confront Frighten and seek out And show hostility They cause nightmares And cause harm to the slumberingAnd whoever hears this welltaught DharmaI turned the unsurpassable wheel of the Dharma And I ripened all to this supreme enlightenmentVenerable what was it you wanted to ask meThey will keep on cycling just there In the cyclic existence of the yakṣa worldFocused onepointedly on genuine pleasure Just as some beings who have great power Ever renowned throughout the ten directionsI do not hold that the status of a pratyekabuddha and the fruit of individual enlightenment are found in nonarisingApart from the skillful methods of supreme beings Who give the teaching of separate yānasIn those who persist in the belief in I and mine there arises the conception of self and otherIf someone is in the midst of fighting and battle In the great terror of humans at warIn this way the Tathāgata has realized through their very sameness that all these dharmas are equalThis is the Jewel of the SaṅghaIt is all true It is reality In this there is no deceptionOn the relative level a bad character is a gateway to all lower realmsHe will make offerings to the guides of humansIn that way the youth spoke those words with great joy Praising the one with ten strengths the speaker of truthThus noble son bodhisattvas remain in the application of mindfulness with respect to subsidiary afflictions thorough afflictions and complete afflictionsSince the Great Being was leaving the deity of the best of cities came feeling depressedthe guardians of the worldThe five aggregates of the process of reexistence Shall be consumed by the fire of emptinessthose who are intent on the emptiness of all things but have not accepted that phenomena are nonarising andEven though great bodhisattva beings may not have established their minds in equipoise they do focus their minds on meditative objectsHe guarded his facultiesdid not regress if their hands were cut off did not regress if their feet were cut offMañjuśrī consider that the production of merit of someone giving offerings were to continue for as many eons as there are atomic particles in a great trichiliocosmAt the very moment when the Bodhisattva was born all beings became filled with blissIn the same way divine son the Thusgone One teaches without teaching how to quickly awaken to unexcelled and completely perfect buddhahood when basing oneself on the acts with immediate consequenceVenerable Lord The purity of the transcendent perfection of generosity is due to the purity of the selfWhen there are other beings blinded by cataracts that doctor may think I shall cure all these beings of their blindnessthat is to say they establish sentient beings in the four applications of mindfulness and similarly in the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path and the three gateways to liberationand the fragrance of the food eaten by those bodhisattvas pervades immeasurable universesWhat discourses are appropriateThe preceptor also requests the presence of a monk who will inquire into confidential mattersthe abode of infinite space the abode of infinite consciousnessto teach the qualities of great wisdomThen the youth who had sat to one side rose from his seatFilled the buddha realm Nāgas brought down a rain of pearls As an offering to Kṣemadatta It came about through the power of previous aspirations made as the Bodhisattva had trained It was truly a suitable offering to the ThusGone OneEven if you do not have all these The time has now come for you give themThey should regard themselves as sick peopleone

hundred timesWithout thoughts and wholly devoted to blisshad his hair stand on endA fool who transgresses against thisPossessing knowledge of all these thingsLet him attend the learned one who is beautiful to beholdWhy should pratyekabuddhas cultivate the path of individual enlightenment according to which all formative predispositions are dependently originatedSimilarly when I attract them by my generosity they will not lie they will not slander they will not speak harsh words and they will not speak nonsensical wordsAs is someones mind So are their namesandformthey taught the Dharma that commences with the six perfections and the highest complete enlightenment and concludes with omniscient wisdomSister it is likewise when there are meritorious formative factorsDuring that time two learned and clever merchant brothers from the north Trapuṣa and Bhallika were traveling back from the south after having gained much profit with a caravan of five hundred fully loaded carts carrying many kinds of merchandiseWhen the Blessed One had spokenand I approached that rishi and said to himI bestow this enlightenment gained with difficulty Their mouths with protruding ugly fangs appeared

There is the meditative stability named Devoid of Vocalic Syllables  There is the meditative stability named Burning Lamp  There is the meditative stability named Purification of Defining CharacteristicsIn the same vein just as the notion of an illusory person engaging in all the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities is without foundationowing to their skill in means they themselves dispense generosity andSees no one but hears the echoes Of singing speaking and laughter Know that all phenomena are like that This will

was in the presence of that tathāgata I heard that description of the qualities of AvalokiteśvaraA lord of humans has even more Qualities of the aspects of his speech Vajrapāṇi Your radiation and absorption of enlightened mind is secretand I also set in place and protected my buddha realm Ah My father who is wise in the supreme Dharma Ah You who have no enmity toward any beingIt was like a

revealed in the manner of nonarising and noncessationThe monk joined his palms and said these wordsIn that way I know the characteristics Of phenomena of the five skandhasThen he thought I promised to share any such attainment with that sage so I must do so Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara said to the Bhagavatāradvatīputra do you think that the sensory element of the mental faculty the sensory element of mental phenomena and the sensory element of mental consciousness constitute a bodhisattvaTo them are made vast offerings Of perfume flowers and garlands Cloths and the sound of music And by the sound of drums over and overThey become great holy men With the superknowledges and pure continence And thus induce living beings to the morality Of tolerance gentleness and disciplineAt that time

transcendent perfections up to and including wisdom are dedicated toward omniscience in a nondual manner andI have the power of wisdom in this way It is a brilliance that is infiniteSenior Subhūti is there no attainment Is there no clear realizationThen hundreds of thousands of gods and humans let out hundreds of thousands of exclamations of shock and cries of joyThere truly is no self and no

those with skill in means have set their minds accordingly on enlightenment and practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom even if they perfectly acquire the ten powers of the tathāgatas and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas on account of their view with regard to sentient beings they will not actualize the finality of existence but after cultivating the meditative stabilities of

some have the six clairvoyancesThese sixty thousand tenderfleshed highcaste women lounge on sumptuous bedding in their houses fit for entertainmentThis exegesis of the transcendent perfection of wisdom has neither been explained nor revealed by anyone at allThey will not be emancipated into the doctrines of the śrāvakas or the pratyekabuddhascracking their skulls open and inflicting unbearable pain that caused them to cry out pitifullySenior Subhūti are physical forms neither fettered nor liberatedIn this regard nirvāṇa is empty of nirvāṇa because it does not endure and does not

MoonFaced One repliedI wish that after I die I will not have to take rebirth againHow you may wonder do they not acquire things by making hintshung with ankletsin order to aspire to the buddhaqualities he does not destroy compounded thingsHaving heard the king all the townspeople Brought the very best incenseThen that fool he departed He left and went to another townRemaining in this samādhi Wherever the bodhisattvas treadwhether they are fortunate or unfortunate whether it is a good rebirth or a bad rebirthIndeed the same applies to all the remaining phenomenological categories as far as the dependent link of aging and deathBy reciting the mantra  times for each syllable one will ensure great splendorDisapproving and disconcerted they then left the gatheringThe young brahmin Kolita was entrusted to eight nursemaids two to cuddle himThis concludes the first chapter on the settingI heard this Dharma of the Buddha That was taught with a hidden meaningThus they think How amazing that while phenomena are not real all sorts of actions appearCant you see this great and terrifying armyAll had eliminated defilements and were without kleśas All had attained the perfection of miraculous powersnor will they be killed with weapons or poisonThere does not exist even an atom of phenomena That which is called an atom does not existI attained the highest complete enlightenmentThey constantly seek supreme enlightenment And teach infinite millions of sūtras If you ask why it is because they are without the transcendent perfection of wisdom and they are without skill in meansone should recite the mantra for as long as one is not liberatedTheir gait is that of a swanand reveal to sentient beings the sacred doctrine of emancipation from cyclic existenceConsider noble son the way a lotus is always soft and never roughWe shall endeavor to protect them guard them and keep them from harmWith the power of patience have no conceptualization And practicing in that way rest in equanimity Not holding grudges is a gateway to the light of the Dharma for it allows one to be free from regretThe lady is endowed with supreme beauty Nourished by the

with cold waterPadmaśrīgarbha it is just as you say said the Blessed OneSenior āradvatīputra replied to akra mighty lord of the godsAll those who heard this teaching were freed from the lower realmsnanda in each of those lifetimes I also generated the roots of virtue so she could attain unsurpassable and perfectly complete enlightenmentHaving satisfied me with food she frolicked with meA hundred trillion and ten million And also those that are five millionWhat does it mean that it is conceived of as a central essenceSome nanda are pleased and delighted to see me but not to hear meEmptiness is not born and does not die All these phenomena are by nature empty Endeavoring in the six perfections bodhisattvas should never forget the mind of awakeningI will show millions of beings The perfect gate to the nectar of the higher realms Saying this you guarded your discipline wellāradvatīputra do you think that the designations of fundamental ignorance and in the same vein of all the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death as permanent or impermanent constitute a bodhisattvatheir merit would only be as said before equal to the merit of the tip of one hair on the body of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva AvalokiteśvaraThe Lord hearing these words of the assembly Pronounced the secret mantra which he himself masteredTheir acts that bring sentient beings to maturity will not be interruptedBeings as numerous as the sands of the Ganges Instantaneously became śrāvakasThus bodhisattvas are free from acquisition through covert urgingWill have in my presence Made many offerings to the saṅghaOf all that is pleasing to devas and humans And honor the buddhas with desirable offerings If I have such great carts I should treat them all equally and not unequallyYour Majesty I have slain the King of Aṅga and Campā is now in my handsO Jambhā Mohā You who make one heart turn toward another heart Hū phaṭ SvāhāSimilarly great bodhisattva beings do not become discouraged with regard to this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom owing to the fact that all things are void and calmThey then accomplish the fourth meditative absorption and maintain it with immaculate equipoise and mindfulnessThey were doing all sorts of thingscutting slicing crushing hacking to piecesIt fills my body with pleasure my mind with joy and brings supreme peaceHowever many beings wise ones Come to them for the sake of the Dharmait is because excellently abiding in the transcendent perfection of wisdom they never lack attentiveness associated with omniscienceto those who meditate make offerings during the three periods of the day and recite the mantrasFriends whose omen is this That has appeared on this day Today our airborne palaces are beautifiedOthers played gargara drumsthose who seek the fruit of being tied to only one more rebirth cultivate the path in order to abandon desire hatred and delusionor collecting wood for use in fire pūjasNor any guides who are solitary buddhasGentlemen will no one be put into these two And they replied NoNoble son you may wonder how bodhisattvas engage in endless activityWhat type is it Oh it is but a poor oneOr is it Māra lord of sense pleasures or perhaps the lord of the mahoragas Could it be akra the vajra holder Or is it perhaps Rudra or the lord of kumbhāṇḍasI myself have carried a pure being within me for a long time nowThus noble son without any doubts or reservations about these matters bodhisattvas have trust in the training that accords with the minds of sentient beingsThe brahmin Tiṣya repeated them andSome merely develop an instinct for the teaching some gain realizationThese excellent airborne palaces are shining Glorious bright and beautifulSimilarly the pratyekabuddhas and likewise the bodhisattvas and the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas do not apprehend the limit of past timeUpananda tied the handless monks lower robe on with a cord fastened his Dharma robe up with a pinit is because the three vehicles are extensively revealed in this transcendent perfection of wisdomWith their hands placed together in homage they bowed toward the Bhagavān and thought

Falling to the ground like sal trees that had been cut downHowever they would not praise a person whoThey obtain kalyāṇamitras Both buddhas and śrāvakas nor something unproducedIt is never too quiet nor too loud The Sages voice teaches everyone equally and easily and became the Tathāgata Jewel Moon in the West as many buddhafields beyond this buddhafield as there are sand grains in the River Ganges in a world system called Eternal LightThere are multitudes of herbs and multitudes of seeds all on the same earthlistened as the Blessed One had directedWhen I have passed into nirvāṇa Those who rely upon such four qualities as thesemaking common cause with all sentient beingsMonks once the luminous gods had praised the ThusGone One so they bowed to him with palms joined and stood to one sideBecause there is no abiding there is ultimately no scorchingand the inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of ignorance concerning purification Those are the fourand you will eat such food as you have never before tastedthat itself will guard protect and offer sanctuary to them those human and nonhuman adversaries who wish to harm them will find no opportunity to do soAllknower allseer Defeater of all proponents Dispeller of all doubts Leader of all worldsNanda and Upananda investigate this retired devotee and after seven days evict him along with his partisansall of those many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of buddha bhagavāns as numerous as the grains of sand in fifty Ganges Rivers who were in many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of world realms as numerous as the grains of sand in fifty Ganges Rivers were revealedThe bodys complexion is then improved through this great joythe fact that some living beings do not behold the splendid display of virtues of the buddhafield of the TathāgataThose brahmins and householders did this by following the example of King MahābalaThey exist to the extent that they do not exist and accordingly since they do not exist their posited existence is called fundamental ignoranceif you see it like that that view too will be abandoned discarded and cease to bein that case Venerable Lord how much merit would those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage accrue on that basisSimilarly it indicates to these worlds that internal emptiness is emptyThey crush pride as they think I must gain those buddha qualities that I have not yet gainedConquering views about causes is a gateway to the light of the Dharma for it leads to the attainment of awareness and complete liberationwho has eyes like blue lotusesit is because great bodhisattva beings do not speak of demonstrate or analyze their investigation of the irreversible levela god named Jñānaketudhvaja who was firmly established in the Great Vehicle and could not be turned away from awakening spoke to the great assembly of gods and bodhisattvasNoble ones even though it has thus been a long time since the Tathāgata attained the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahoodYour Majesty if one follows after desire It will never endVenerable Lord How do great bodhisattva beings transcend the level of the śrāvakas and the level of the pratyekabuddhas through the transcendent perfection of meditative stabilityThis is proper applicationāradvatīputra great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom accordingly will engage in the maturity of great bodhisattva beingsIf the elder could again change out of the female state then all women could also change out of their female statesrelease them from erroneous views by means of that which is neither fettered nor liberatedAlso if a follower of the rāvakayāna is frightened of this Dharma teaching is afraid and terrified of itSo many terrifying things have appeared That even inanimate trees fall overfor most people also view things thus and say such things and in that you are just like themDuly fulfilling their wishes he has never

same vein are the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas free from contaminants and not included within the three world systems owing to the emptiness of inherent existenceand in the same vein they will be unobscured with regard to the sacred doctrine and so forthSon of noble family through these seven instructions will one attain the

chief of humansBhagavān have no concern over this matterThe Bhagavat gave his approval saying That is excellentKauśika the humans or nonhumans who seek an opportunity to impinge upon those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage will find no such opportunitythey will perceive tathāgatas arhats and genuinely perfect buddhasas numerous as the sands of the River GangesAnd

came to live many of whom went on to actualize arhatship under his guidanceThe realized ones cut through their doubts And bring them happiness through the DharmaUltimately they are without any facultiesMy sons do I say I am the one and only philosopher on this earth The hairs of their heads point upwards finely and curling into locksYou have pacified conceit and flaws relinquishing the three stainsFor this is what happens to those who pay no heed to the words of the MasterAnd all five hundred princes no less Followed him into the homeless state Venerable Lord What is the physical purity of those great bodhisattva beingsSo I will now arouse that evil MāraOne should light a wickWith flowers and perfumed garlands And with sesame oil he was cremated The householder then takes off his garlands and jewelryWhen they close the door they develop the motivation I shall close the doors to the lower realmsall of them are then transformed into a single element which is exclusively the space elementWhat is the bodhisattvas perfect giving of material thingsbecoming free from the suffering of saṃsāra passing into fortunate forms of existence and never falling back from unsurpassable truly perfect awakeningThen the Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to the crown prince MañjuśrīThe eighteensyllable mantra Forcefully strikes down in the three times And suddenly his spirit is brokenThis transcendent perfection of wisdom is established by means of deeds that are equal to the unequaled and so forthThis is how bodhisattvas avoid denying the teachings of the thusgone onesWe will pronounce the punishment The incantation manifested by Brahmā Revered by akra And sealed by the guardians of the worldThe Blessed One replied to those gods as followsIs the benefactor endowed with the best marks with strength like NārāyaṇaI shall by all means ensure that their alms become fruitful deeply meaningful and of great powerIf it is hidden in the ground All harmful influences will become pacifiedIn the presence of the Lord of the World I will pronounce their punishmentIt is entering into samāpattiOne of the nature of wisdom and meansāradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by

all formshe is the One with the Power to Know All Contemplations Liberations Concentrations and Absorptions as well as the Way of Purifying and Stopping the Disturbing EmotionsHe made them recite the fourfold scripturesSubhūti that which is unthinkable is designated as unthinkableWhoever wishes to make offerings to the ThusGone One And listen to the Dharma from that lord of compassion And attain the qualities of the saṅghaEnjoin him to heed what he reveresGreat king it is excellent that you have developed your previous roots of merit and that your confidence has increased through the sovereign power of the TathāgataPāpīyān now leave on the same path that brought you hereConsequently they will not conceptualize the ethical discipline of the lord buddhas of the past future and present nor their meditative stability wisdom liberation and perception of liberating pristine cognitionThe kingdom was joyful and the harvests were bountiful There were no disturbances or animosity anywhereWith your unplaced awarenessThose who take attitudes like these as long as they think such contemptuous thoughts will cling tightly to saṃsāra for eonsor are about to be killedlike thieves in a dungeonWhen the wind in the avadhūtī has become Of the same essence with semenAnd all the immeasurable mundane techniques of craftsmanship This child already learned these things many tens of millions of eons agoPadmanetraAs the day progressed the Bodhisattva also excelled in all aspects of leaping swimming and runningIn the same vein do you think that the designations of all the remaining sensory elements up to and including the sensory element of mental consciousness as permanent or impermanent constitute a bodhisattvateach the Dharma according to sentient beings inclinations andOne will become invisible to tigers alligators mahoragas thieves etcBuddha can only mean someone who knows all causality It does not refer to the aggregates sense sources and elementsReflecting on vajra and lotus stopperedthe flag of pride was brought downConsidering this objective when I had attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentI am absorbed in meditative concentrationWhen the flowers fell on the bodies of the bodhisattvas they fell off on the floor but when they fell on the bodies of the great disciples they stuck to them and did not fallHe then spoke the following words to meSimilarly you should not have conviction in the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth to the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth and to the fruit of arhatshipIt also sees its past corpse lying in a cemetery and thinksPresent physical forms are empty of present physical formsIn space the applications of mindfulness are not discernedFriends Form sound smell flavor and touch are impermanentWill come into possession of it And promulgate it in the age of destruction And similarly the eight aspects of the supreme path That is what is called the supreme restraint of the mind Struck by my stare what power would this monk have Or struck by death what power would he have to live in this worldThey all wailed terribly in distress And they fainted and fell to the ground is classified as negativity of body and negativity of speechMoreover Venerable Lord great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom should not abide in the extrasensory powersaccomplishment is gainedthis is the supreme meditationAh Your body has all the eighty excellent secondary signs complete Ah Come here honest one who has crossed the ocean of existenceThus noble son these are their causes and conditions for the bodhisattvas display of death in the perfect palace of the Heaven of Joy all the way through to their display of passing into the great transcendence of sufferingYou awaken from their sleep The prime of life is very shortIs there no imputation of the emptiness of internal phenomena andWhat is delighting in dhyāna It is avoiding the thorns of desire not forsaking dhyāna and not abandoning joyas he grows and plays as a young childwhat does it mean when Mañjuśrī says that the tathāgatas remain in the world systems and bring beings to spiritual maturity through various skillful means even though ten billion eons have passed many times over since the tathāgatas attained nirvāṇaThe king asked his ministersMonks this impostor is one who will not flourish in the Dharma and the VinayaYou will call out with the delightful strains of Brahmās voiceWhy is that It is because there is only the one jewel that is affixed on his topknotThe wind element is considered flimsy and incorporeal answered MahauṣadhiAnother time the court scribe struck him and the lad went off crying to his motherWhile passing through UruvilvāThe sight makes him happy thrilled overjoyed and delightedThey will be freed from the unavoidable sufferings of saṃsārathey should certainly know that gods endowed with great occult power and great miraculous abilitiesThey discern that physical forms are nonarising and do not focus on themsuch as had never been seen or heard of before in order to honor the Blessed thusgone worthy perfect Buddha ākyamuniTherefore young man bodhisattva mahāsattvas who wish to attain quickly the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahoodShould illness and disease occur Perform the activity of supreme pacificationThe sovereign over men felt veneration for the Jina Who was endowed with the strengths and bowed down to his feetthey comprise the faculty of faith the faculty of perseverance the faculty of recollection the faculty of meditative stability and the faculty of wisdom of which tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas partakewho are the ones who stay just where they areThe birds that are snipes Mynas cranes and cuckoosIt is selfless because it is free of the dust of desireThe length of life of this perfectly and fully enlightened Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyarāja was twenty short eonsThe nonperception of sound is to have no abodeSimilarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness that resemble phantoms and the like are neither fettered nor liberatedThe trees burst into blossom and are laden with fruits It is clear that a sublime jewel will soon appear in the three realmsVenerable Lord The purity of omniscience is due to the purity of the selfIn the past you were the finest of horses as white as snowHe will in this way perfect his bodhisattva conduct andIt illuminated in those buddha realms the bodhisattvas and mahāsattvas who practiced bodhisattva conduct through being skilled in methodsI pray that the Bhagavān will place his right hand upon my headThey will pay homage to it bow before it and only then consider departing again for their own abodeswhen well fashioned by a skillful son of a goldsmith and thrown onto a white cloth becomes of vivid color resplendent perfectly pure and exceedingly brightThen noble ones at that time the boy Vimalagarbha and the boy Vimalanetra rose into the air to the height of seven palm treesMany trillions of female gandharvas live within itBodhisattvas should be insatiable in pursuit of the infinite qualities of buddhahoodThis transcendent perfection of wisdom is established by means of great deedsThe ThusGone One then proceeded to Rohitavastu and on toward UruvelaKalpa Anāla and the town of SārathiThus they may recollect one single life or two lives or three or four five ten twenty thirty forty or fifty and so on up to many hundreds of thousands of lifetimesHe then offered her a pair of fine cotton fabrics that were set with many different types of jewels a pearl necklace worth a hundred billion silver coins and a garland of gold set with red pearls The king then offered this sentimentand if he were to continue on further in that way until the entire element of earth in all those world realms was goneThey inspired themThe aroma of incense Spreads through this buddha realm A jina without dismay gives away the best forms Sounds tastes smells tangibles and phenomenaYou know the past and also the future You also know what is happening in the presentFor so long he has explained the benefits of desisting from killing so he is called the Protector of Many PeopleCarrying honey and the jewel bowlNow the purities of meditation are describedThe nose is outer formall other attributes up to and including enlightenment are empty of enlightenment and the restThat person will have great love and great compassionKnow that the death of humans and All these faults originate from birthAbove the nosetip of the relativeThey went to Kolita who too on seeing them off in the distance askedThey are not stained by the afflictions of saṃsāraVenerable Lord Will great bodhisattva beings also attain omniscienceit were easy for them to bring forth unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and it were easy to attain manifestly perfect enlightenmentMoreover the transcendent perfection of wisdom does not absorb physical forms nor does it diffuse themThe perfection of diligence is a gateway to the light of the DharmaThey are like a dewdrop on a blade of grass and deceptive like an empty fist They have no essence and no self and lack intrinsic existence in every wayBlessed One I have never seen anyone reborn in the lower realms after hearing this Dharma teachingEnlightenment is equality since it is equal to infinite spaceThey do not engage with the notion that physical forms are entities or that they are nonentitiesThese childish beings go up in smoke like this great earth at the end of the eonO Buddha Curu curu on the path SvāhāThen the Bodhisattva continued to thinkRight then akra opened the gate merely by the power of his mindWith the melodious voice of Brahmā he proclaimed The sublime physician dispeller of old age and death Has now arrivedWhoever does not form concepts or thoughts is applying himself correctlyand vanquish those of othersIt is for the sake of others that I give rise to the mind of unexcelled and complete awakeningAll the different phenomena he realizes To be like rainbows or a dancers maskSimilarly they neither associate the eyes with omniscience nor do they disassociate them therefromTo make pain go away one should administer water incanted with this mantrahe is the One Who Does Not Lose His DiligenceThese verses and songs so pleasant and sweetOwing to the utter purity of all things they do not apprehend those entering the streamThe Blessed One is endowed with completely perfect eyeballsThus should I swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and having attained manifestly perfect buddhahood I should also lead forth those sentient beings who have fallen into the three inferior realmsa knowledgeable and venerable one a sugata one who knew the worldTheir speech is profound soft and melodiousThe transcendent perfection of wisdom is an agent that has no actionsThese phenomena are to be abandonedAre the applications of mindfulness also nonconceptualMoreover Subhūti the condition of the robes belonging to great bodhisattva beings who are irreversible is never unkempt but always clean and free from bad odorsCan emptiness be conceptually constructedSimilarly sights sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomena being empty of inherent existenceTaking by force the saffron robes of those who have shaved their heads and beards for my sake and donned the saffron robeswhether they uphold the precepts or not whether they observe the discipline or notthus making them householdersThey find no essence either inside or outside Know that all phenomena are like that  He who gave up all attachment to his body Who had no regard for his own lifeJust as the yogins attain accomplishment In exactly the same way do the yoginīsbodhisattva beings who do not lack the six transcendent perfections taught by the tathāgatasIt is in this way Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings act as a support of the worldsIt entails absorption in the six aspects of perception by engaging with all things as if they were an illusionWhat is being indifferent to praise It is seeking good actions and abandoning worldly lifeOne should prepare the substances for an eye ointment a tika ointment an ointment for the feet a salve of enthrallment etc and empower themHow should he apply himself to apply himself appropriatelyI see the splendid expanse of the buddhafield of the Lord ākyamuni as equal to the splendor of for example the abodes of the highest deitiesWhen sensation ceases there is the cessation of cravingThis is what a son should doDesire arises due to the conditional cause of appropriationSuperior being accept from me this Dharma gifthey will wash their feet well and then go up onto it Having oiled their head and their faceBrahmā lord of the Sahā World together with  trillion gods lifted the jeweled structure that had delighted the Bodhisattva and placed it atop a great mansion in the Brahma realm that was three hundred leagues highWas the kings brotherThey were sprinkled and scattered over the

both seated on lion thronesThat in turn is the basis for peaceOnes lifeforce persists for the duration of this life but is annihilated after thatin accord with the sun we dry it in the suns heatpure clairvoyance that surpasses the vision of humans those sentient beings who are dying those who are being rebornMonks from the very beginning the Bodhisattva had already understood the many shortcomings of cyclic existenceThat has been taught by the Jina They will reject the discourse and go to hell and they accurately know a mind that has no kleśas to be a mind that has no kleśasIt was surrounded by a variety of trees and graced with pools and pondshave concentrated and subsumed the roots of virtue possessed by the lord buddhas of the past future and present commencing from when they first began to set their mind on enlightenment andHe is a protector liberating those who have not been liberatedNoble son you may wonder how bodhisattvas are deep and hard to fathomRecollection of giving is a gateway to the light of the Dharmacauses their complexion power abilities and happiness of mind to never decrease while it showers them with a rain of delightful incense flowers ornaments garments drums cymbals and so forthwhat O Lord are the defining characteristics of this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomTheir sound goes out to millions of realms everywherewhen the hour of their death arrives they will depart in an undeluded state After they have passed away the Tathāgata Amitābha will stand before them entirely surrounded by a śrāvaka assembly and accompanied by a congregation of bodhisattvas These sons and daughters of good family will be born in the Sukhāvatī world the buddha realm of the Bhagavān Tathāgata AmitābhaOnce they shine they first descend upon the bodies of bodhisattvas whose aspirations are like the great lord of mountainsThen for no fewer than eighty years He taught emptiness the treasure of the jinasMother please come into
